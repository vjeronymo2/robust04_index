			<p>Language: <F P=105>Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, head of the </F> Foreign Ministry's second bureau in charge of West Asian  affairs, by unidentified announcer; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Announcer] Mr. Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, about  two years have passed since the victory of the Afghan mojahedin.  During that period, we have witnessed relative, sporadic, and  intermittent clashes among the Afghan struggling groups in that  country, despite the general belief that after victory they  would reach a relative understanding and begin rebuilding the  country. But we have actually witnessed that they have failed to  reach a comprehensive agreement. What are the reasons for the  clashes?    [Taherian] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. As you pointed out, during the past two years, and  after the mojahedin entered Kabul, they have had various  agreements among themselves that have never been completely put  into practice. Perhaps one of the reasons is that none of those  agreements has ever taken into consideration the rights of all  the groups in a comprehensive and complete manner and has not  paid complete attention to all the realities existing in  Afghanistan. At times interference by those who did not know  about the Afghan issue and were outside the region has resulted  in a failure for any serious work to be done. It must be said,  unfortunately, that the monopolistic tendencies of some  individuals have become an added burden and resulted in our  witnessing repeated clashes in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and  intermittent fighting in various areas in Afghanistan in the  past two years, an Afghanistan that has been beset by war,  bloodshed, and destruction for 14 years. And that has continued  because of what I told you.    [Announcer] You made a passing reference to the role of  foreign factors in this. What do you believe its extent to be?    [Taherian] What is definite is that the forces outside the  region and those elements who are not present in the region have  had some connections with some of the groups. And those  connections have always resulted in -- without taking into  consideration the interests of the Muslim people of Afghanistan  and what the people of Afghanistan need -- them seeking their  own specific goals. That definitely is one of the factors that  has resulted in continued clashes or at times has started  clashes.    In the past two years we have seen clashes that one can  specifically connect to foreign elements, to the affiliation  that some groups have with foreign elements. The result of all  that has always been one loser -- the suffering Muslim people of  Afghanistan.    [Announcer] Mr. Taherian, achieving a relative understanding  is an important parameter in the Afghan events. Everyone,  particularly us in the Islamic Republic wish for the Afghan  groups to solve their problems in peace and to reach an  understanding. But what do you propose as a particular  political solution to the Afghan problem?    [Taherian] As you have pointed out, the Islamic Republic of  Iran stood by the holy war of the Afghan Muslim people against  the Soviet occupiers. After victory and mojahedin's entrance to  Kabul, the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to stand by them  and has always wished for the improvement of the Afghan  situation and has given practical help to the Muslim people. It  has done so during the jehad as well as the mojahedin victory  and will continue to do so. We are certain that for regional  stability, the Afghan problem should be solved through  negotiations between the jehad groups.    In answering your first question, I pointed out that the  problems existing between the conflicting groups have their  roots in the past two years and possibly even in the pre-victory  period. The important principle that must be taken into account  by all those interested in finding a solution is the reality of  the situation -- Afghanistan is a Muslim and a multinational  country. Any solution must take these two factors into account.  Furthermore, all the groups have a large amount of weapons.  The [Soviet] occupiers can not claim that they developed the  country. While Afghanistan was occupied, they provided weapons  for various groups more than anything else, and Afghanistan has  been turned into an ammunition dump.    These several factors must be taken into account for any  solution that might be put forward. And the Afghan groups must  also consider that any solution that is going to be planned and  programmed, if it is going to be turned into law, must recognize  the rights of all nationalities, groups, and parties. They must  be given their portion of rights. We would be wrong to think  that a group, on its own, could achieve supremacy.  Unfortunately all groups have experienced this one way or  another. If they go alone on a path, they would achieve  nothing. It seems that the most reasonable way is first for the  mojahedin and people of Afghanistan to find a solution based on  Islamic principles and according to the ethnic conditions of the  country. And second, Afghanistan's neighbors could prepare the  grounds for such discussions and the necessary dialogue that  must take place between the various groups, so as to allow  Afghan groups to sit together around a table and find a  reasonable solution based on Islamic principles acceptable by  nearly all the people.

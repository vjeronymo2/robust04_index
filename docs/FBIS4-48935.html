			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Wen: "Trade Fair Closes With 12 </F> Percent Surge in Exports"]    [Text] Guangzhou -- The 75th Chinese Commodities Trade  Fair came to a record close on Saturday as total export  contracts topped last autumn's exhibition by $1 billion, a 12  percent jump.    Spokesman Zhao Hua said trading was brisk during the 15-day  event.    "Daily trade volume topped $800 million during the peak  days," he said.    Hong Kong and Macao remained the fair's top partners,  signing  one-third of the contracts. The European Union, the United  States and Southeast Asia followed with 16.8, 9.9 and 7.9  percent of the respective trade share.    Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, in his fair tour on Friday, urged  trade companies to invigorate China's drive for exports,  according to a Xinhua report. He was accompanied by Foreign  Trade Minister Wu Yi and Zhu Senlin, governor of Guangdong  Province.    In his speech to provincial trade officials, Li said  competition is a main reason for the fair's record transactions.    He affirmed competitive bidding for export quotas is an  effective solution to vicious and unfair competition between  Chinese export companies. He said such a practice should be  applied to more than the present 13 commodities.    Li fully agrees with the plan to display similar commodities  at one place.    At the fair, contracted exports to the Middle East,  Southeast  Asia and Latin America all increased, Zhao said.    Seventeen Chinese trade delegations each signed contracts  valued at more than $200 million.    "The increase in trade deals at the fair is attributable to  the recovering world economy and China's new financial and  foreign trade reforms implemented this year," Zhao said.    Meanwhile, he stressed that bogus goods were not tolerated  at  the fair, as 20 companies were punished for using fake trade  marks on their products.    Organizers publicized those companies' names, confiscated  their fake trade marks and drove some of them out of the fair.    "Further investigation and punishment is pending and  organizers are discussing whether or not to allow them to attend  the coming fair," said Zhao.    The infringed trade marks were found in 20 firms, including  Shenzhen Kaichen, Guangxi Machinery Import and Export, Xingjiang  Zhongxin, Shenzhen Foreign Trade Group and Changfa Company,  China Aerospace Technological Import and Export Fujian Branch,  Anhui Chemical Products Import and Export, Shantou International  Trading Overseas and trade companies from Shanxi, Hubei and  Hunan provinces.    Vice-Premier Li urged local trade officials to take  advantage  of new trade policies, like the single exchange rate, to boost  their exports.    Li admitted the policies need improvement but urged trade  authorities to take any necessary steps to prevent future  problems from arising.    Li said foreign importers may unreasonably depress the  prices  of Chinese products, while Chinese exporters may also  unreasonably raise their prices, resulting in soaring prices for  foreign currencies.    Establishing a modern enterprise system and multinational  operations should be the direction for remolding foreign trade  enterprises, he added.    The semi-annual, trade event was expected to help fulfill  this year's planned export target of $100 billion.    Zhao said new mechanical and electrical products were in  high  demand. More than 60 per cent of the goods displayed by the  Guangzhou trade delegation were new.    The quota bidding system for 13 domestic products has helped  stabilize or raise export prices, he explained. The price of  garlic rose 20 per cent from last year.    More than 50,000 foreign businessmen visited the fair, 4,000  more than last fall.    The number of Southeast Asian guests increased. And the more  than 4,000 American visitors matched the Taiwanese total.    Japan's sluggish economy lead to fewer Japanese visitors  fair  organizers said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoi, and others]    [Text] The Russian delegation expressed its deep concern  over the situation in the sphere of human rights in Estonia at  the Third Conference of Foreign Ministers of Member-States of  the Baltic Sea States Council in Tallinn.    The memorandum circulated at the conference, underlined that  establishment of an independent Estonian state was going hand in  hand with pushing the non-Estonian population out of the  country. The document emphasized that Estonia had adopted and  was implementing several laws discriminating against the  Russian- speaking population in Estonia. In particular, this  meant the law on citizenship, depriving a third of the  population of citizenship, the law on language, hampering  employment of ethnic Russians, the law on local elections, which  does not admit the election of non- citizens and the law on  aliens which made many Estonian permanent residents foreigners  in their own country. There is also a law on schools limiting  studies in Russian to the first nine years of secondary  education.    The Russian delegation suggested that the recommendations by  international experts, including the CSCE and Council of Europe  High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities, had not been taken into  consideration when adopting these laws. The document also  stressed that implementation of the legislation was left to the  arbitrary whims of officials. The Estonian authorities fail to  display any appropriate response to this, the document said.    Russia proceeds from the fact that the legal rights of the  non- ethnic population in Estonia and settlement of their civil  status concerns not only Russian-Estonian relations but the  whole world community, the document underlined.    The Russian delegation circulated one more memorandum urging  the participants in the council to work on projects for  development of infrastructure and transport in the region, to  coordinate improvement of navigation on the Baltic Sea and  modernization of sea ports and to facilitate business and other  contacts.    Much attention was paid to social and economic development  of  the Kaliningrad Region.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is concerned over  the activities of the Baltic Sea States' Council which he has  estimated as not so effective.    Speaking at the third conference of foreign ministers of the  council, which unites ten states of the region, Kozyrev wished  that activities of the council would be more concrete;  particularly as concerned cooperation in the humanitarian sphere  and human rights.    Kozyrev submitted to Estonian Foreign Minister Yuriy Luik a  letter on the part of Russian retired servicemen revealing  concrete examples of violations of their human rights. The  letter said that elderly people older than 60 were demanded to  present medical documents confirming they were free from AIDS or  venereal diseases and that military pensioners were deprived of  free medical care.    Kozyrev suggested that the commissioner for democratic  institutions and human rights could be charged with such issues.  Kozyrev hoped that the commissioner would also control the  situation with the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic  states. Russia would assist the commissioner with his  activities on Russian territory, Kozyrev stated. He announced  that Russia approved of the candidacy of well known Danish  politician, former minister of justice Ole Espersen.    Kozyrev spoke in favor of cooperation between the members of  the council in the sphere of infrastructure and transport and  between different regions of the member-states. He spoke for  the future chairmen of the council to be more energetic and  efficient. Kozyrev supported the candidacy of Poland as the  head of the organization for the next year.</p>

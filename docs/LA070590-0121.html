			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE PARK  </P> <P> Serrania Park  </P> <P> 20865 Wells Drive, Woodland Hills  </P> <P> Size: 37 acres.  </P> <P> Facilities: Child's play area, picnic area, circular half-mile walkway  (unstaffed).  </P> <P> Hours: Open until 10 p.m. daily.  </P> <P> Information: District phone number, (818) 989-8190.  </P> <P> Maintenance workers who keep the grounds at Serrania Park in Woodland Hills  looking green and beautiful have a nickname for the area. They call it Parent  Park.  </P> <P> The reason is obvious to anyone who visits the park, which is secluded and has  only five landscaped acres. (The other 32 consist of hills and mountains.)  </P> <P> The park is shaped like an oblong rectangle, and steep hills and mountains make  up three of its sides. The single opening to the park is a narrow area near the  parking lot. Because of this design, Serrania is the perfect place for families  with young children and even expectant parents.  </P> <P> A paved walkway extends around the perimeter of the park and is used daily by  stroller-pushing parents or pregnant women seeking exercise. A children's play  area is in the center of the park about 50 yards from the parking area.  </P> <P> Serrania Park is the only Los Angeles city park that is surrounded by steep  hills and mountains instead of paved streets. For that reason, it is easy to  keep track of children. KAREN KINGSBURY  </P></p>

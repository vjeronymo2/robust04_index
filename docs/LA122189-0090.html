			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: HACIENDA HEIGHTS;  </P> <P> BOARD ELECTION CANCELED  </P> <P> Six seats on the Hacienda Heights Improvement Assn.'s board of directors will  be filled without an election next year because only six candidates are  running, Barbara Fish, association president said Monday.  </P> <P> Doing without a formal election will save the group hundreds of dollars, said  Fish. The association, governed by a 12-member board, acts as liaison between  the community and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. About 1,000 of  Hacienda Height's 17,000 households are dues-paying members of the association.  </P> <P> "It's a real battle to get people to say they'll run since we're all volunteers  and have to foot the bill for everything," Fish said.  </P> <P> The candidates for the six open seats will start two-year terms Jan. 15, 1990.  They are incumbents Sally Bianco, Bernadette King and Linda Renfroe, and  Lillian Avery, Raul Sahagun and Robert Tsang. After they take office, the board  will elect a new president to replace Fish, who said she will not seek  reelection.  </P></p>

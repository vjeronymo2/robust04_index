			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ansett helps TNT maintain its rally The turnround at TNT, the Australian transport and delivery services group, has continued in the third quarter, allowing the company to post an operating profit before abnormal items of ADollars 28.9m (Dollars 21.26m) on an equity consolidated basis, for the nine months to end-March. This compares with a loss of ADollars 41.5m in the same period of 1992-93. Revenues during the period reached ADollars 4.27bn, compared with ADollars 4.07bn a year ago. The equity-consolidated operating profit before tax was ADollars 104.3m, up from ADollars 4.2m in the first nine months of 1992-93. TNT said yesterday that the progress was largely due to improved earnings at Ansett, the Australian airline which it owns jointly with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and reduced losses from its GD Express Worldwide joint venture, the international express delivery business formed by TNT and a consortium of overseas post offices. On a consolidated basis - ignoring the impact of associate companies - the picture looked less rosy: TNT's operating profit before tax appeared to have increased only marginally, from ADollars 28.8m to ADollars 30m. But the company said that the 1992-93 figure included 'substantial' non-recurring profits and revenues resulting from TNT Leisure's involvement in Expo '92 and the 1992 Olympic Games. It said that there was an underlying profit improvement of ADollars 19.7m at the pre-tax level, once this factor was removed. TNT said that many of its operations, including those in Australia, North America, the UK and Germany, were seeing an improvement. The Italian business traded 'in line with expectations' and TNT Chronoservice in France, continued to reduce losses. But Spain remained 'disappointing', with increased losses.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / BA agrees to rescue Dan-Air: Rival carriers brand deal as uncompetitive - Up to 1,600 jobs to go BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday agreed to rescue Dan-Air, the UK's oldest independent airline, in a deal attacked as anti-competitive by rival carriers. BA agreed to take over Dan-Air, which was due to celebrate its 40th anniversary next year, for a nominal Pounds 1. It will assume the troubled airline's liabilities, which BA estimates at Pounds 35m. The rescue will mark the biggest consolidation in the UK airline industry since BA bought British Caledonian nearly five years ago. It will involve the loss of up to 1,600 full-time jobs and the closure of Dan-Air's charter operations. The deal was described by BA and Mr David James, chairman of Dan-Air's parent, Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, as the only alternative to receivership. Other independent UK carriers demanded a thorough investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. They said the takeover would entrench BA's domination of the UK market and undermine the British government's efforts to promote a multi-airline competition policy. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, described BA as 'no white knight', saying the takeover would be 'damaging to competition and choice'. He said he had contacted the UK and EC regulatory authorities. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said his airline would not complete the deal if it was forced to give up routes and landing slots. Without rapid regulatory approval, BA said it would abandon the deal. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said he would launch a short-haul carrier called Virgin European Airways to compete with BA. BA said the Dan-Air acquisition would be part of a cost-saving restructuring of its own operations at London's Gatwick airport. A new airline will be established under the BA livery, employing between 400 and 600 of Dan-Air's nearly 2,000 permanent staff. These employees will be offered lower salaries than they had at Dan-Air. Some 400 Dan-Air temporary staff are also likely to lose their jobs. BA's new Gatwick-based short-haul airline subsidiary will operate Dan-Air's scheduled routes with a fleet of 12 Boeing 737s and BA's existing Gatwick services with 10 Boeing 737s. Dan-Air will reduce its scheduled network from 28 to 12 routes and dispose of 26 of its fleet of 38 aircraft. Dan-Air made an operating loss of Pounds 24m in the first half of 1991 and is expected to continue losing money during the winter season. BA believes it can turn the operation around by next year. Davies &amp; Newman, whose shares will remain suspended, will be wound up once the transaction is completed. Shareholders will receive nothing, but Mr James said creditors would be fully reimbursed. Dan-Air was a successful independent carrier until 1989 when it started losing money. Mr James was called in two years ago to restructure the business. He failed in spite of an emergency rights issue which raised almost Pounds 50m last year. His critics say his decision to expand Dan-Air's scheduled services in the middle of the worst post-war recession in the aviation industry was doomed. BA has been busy acquiring stakes in airlines this year including its proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) holding in USAir and the acquisition of large minority stakes in TAT of France and Deutsche BA in Germany. Dan-Air's disappearance is the latest step in the shake-out of the UK airline industry which saw the collapse last year of Air Europe. The US Transportation Department yesterday announced that US and British negotiators are to reconvene in Washington on Tuesday for another round of talks on easing restrictions on air traffic between the two countries. The talks, will focus on British Airways' offer to buy a stake in USAir, the sixth-largest US airline. Storm of competitor protest, Page 8 Lex, Page 22</p>

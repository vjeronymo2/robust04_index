			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold mine back in operation The large Porgera gold mine in the Enga province of Papua New Guinea, began operating again at the weekend after an explosion last week which left 11 people missing, presumed dead. The blast occurred at the explosives facility, a short distance from the mine. The project is one of the largest gold mines outside South Africa and an important revenue source for the PNG government which has a 25 per cent interest in it. Similar stakes are held by Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold. BHP Coal Australia yesterday shut down coalmining operations at Moura in Queensland, as rescue teams tried to reach 11 people trapped underground in an accident on Sunday night. The mine has taken a heavy toll in the past: 12 people were killed there in 1986 and 13 in 1975.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> STORM 'HELPFUL,' BUT DROUGHT CONTINUES  </P> <P> Last weekend's storm did not end the drought, water officials warned state  legislators.  </P> <P> "We apparently face the fourth dry year in a row," said Water Resources  Director David Kennedy. "That storm was helpful, but we need eight or 10 of  them in a year. On the whole, we are well below average." Kennedy said  cumulative rainfall statewide is about 70% of normal, and the Sierra snowpack  is about 60% of normal. However, ground dried over the last three years is  absorbing much of the water that might normally flow into reservoirs, he said.  </P></p>

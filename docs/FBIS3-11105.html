			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paz Tejerina] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 9 March forecast  that if Argentina is on the list of countries chosen by the  United States to join NAFTA, "we would not be able to join it  until 1987."    Bilateral negotiations with Washington to join NAFTA will  not  harm Mercosur [Common Market of the South], he added.    The Argentine position, however, is still undefined. The  economic plan launched by Brazil in the past few days created  expectations among the negotiators and even a political position  in Brazil in the face of its new international situation.    The truth is that Argentina continues to strongly defend  Mercosur even though the other member countries turn their back  on the agreement. The importation of subsidized wheat from the  United States and Canada is an example of this.    Foreign Trade Under Secretary Carlos Kesman said he will  again ask the Brazilian Government to apply compensatory rights  for the measure.    Since 9 March, Argentine and Brazilian negotiators have put  on the table in the Argentine Foreign Ministry the policies they  must follow during the next 10 or 20 years.    Now that Brazil finds itself supported by an economic plan,  it will attempt to turn away from its previous policies.    In principle, there are two subjects that must be discussed:    On the one hand, whether Argentina should join NAFTA  together  with the rest of the Mercosur member countries.    On the other hand, whether to establish a more flexible  system by which each country could individually negotiate its  membership. How will this mechanism be applied? The Argentine  negotiators answered this with complete silence.    Now, what is the position chosen by Argentina? Kesman  answered: "For the time being we will join NAFTA together with  Mercosur."    Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo believes the last word has  not been spoken yet and the position expressed by Kesman could  be modified in hours.    In turn, the United States believes that if Brazil joins  NAFTA it would represent a trade exchange of $800 million, while  it would only amount to $46.6 million with Argentina, Kesman  said.    It is clear that the United States does not care whether  Mercosur can join NAFTA in bloc or partially because its  interest is centered mainly on Brazil.    The best move for Brazil now is to consolidate its position  in South America, and Argentina plays an essential role in this  strategy.    In order to attain this, the Brazilian economic plan should  work. Argentina, which still holds some doubts, has chosen to  play it safe in case of a failure. It has opted to side with  Mexico, which currently is at a disadvantage for not meeting  ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] norms.    Cavallo's aides earnestly defended Mexico's position in case  the Brazilian economic plan fails, in order to be able to join  NAFTA.    What if Mexico then does not act in favor of Argentina?  According to Kesman, it could be deprived of all the  preferential treatment it currently has with other countries.    During a news conference, Kesman acknowledged the Argentine  strategy of increasing trade with Brazil, Colombia, and Chile  and to making a strong move toward the United States.    He said the agenda established in Colonia, Uruguay, to  implement a common external tariff within Mercosur will be  respected.    Kesman said that in April he will meet with the Mercosur  evaluating group to analyze the accomplishments of the  agreement's terms as well as the tariffs for capital goods,  trade, customs, and macroeconomic subjects.    So far, Argentina has lost the first round, that is, to stop  its trade partners from importing subsidized products.</p>

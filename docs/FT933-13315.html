			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Howard's choice THOUSANDS OF British police officers are due to demonstrate at Wembley later today against radical proposals to reform their pay and conditions from the government-appointed Sheehy committee. They are resisting recommendations to introduce fixed-term contracts, to relate pay to performance and to lift their retirement age from 55 to 60. Mr Michael Howard, who was appointed home secretary after Sheehy was commissioned, has yet to reveal where he stands. Such a wait-and-see approach is sensible because, when his response comes, it will need to be wise. While it is essential that the police's restrictive practices are rooted out, change should ideally be accomplished without antagonising those within the force who can be won over for reform. The central objective should be to reform practices which virtually guarantee jobs for life. The aim must be to ensure that good officers are recruited and retained, while those who are not up to the job smarten up their act or leave. Achieving this will certainly require some form of performance-related pay. The current system of awarding uniform rises to all denies initiative to managers and gives individual officers little incentive to improve performance. But, to achieve better performance, there is no need for Sheehy's most controversial proposal - 10-year fixed-term contracts. The police are rightly worried that such a system could make it difficult to hire the best recruits and undermine careers. Given that most of the private sector operates on open-ended contracts which allow employees to be fired for poor performance after several months notice, it is not clear why fixed-term contracts are needed for the police. Moreover, if officers are underperforming, they should be removed long before 10 years are up. If Mr Kenneth Clarke were still home secretary his instinct might be to polarise the debate, paint the police as Luddites and ram through Sheehy's proposals. But the government's education reforms showed that determination in a fundamentally sound course needs to be tempered by subtlety. If Mr Howard can win consent by dropping the unnecessary recommendation of fixed-term contracts, he should grasp the opportunity.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STORES WARNED NOT TO SELL ALBUM BY 2 LIVE CREW  </P> <P> Police warned record stores Tuesday to stop selling the controversial album "As  Nasty As They Wanna Be" by rap group 2 Live Crew or face possible obscenity  charges.  </P> <P> "There's no prior restraint.  </P> <P> We're just asking for voluntary compliance," said Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander  of the vice squad.  </P> <P> In about five days, police will begin conducting undercover investigations and  arresting anyone still selling the album, Pittman said.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, when something like that occurs, the clerk that sells the  record is often the one that gets arrested," he said. "I don't think the  business owners want that."  </P> <P> Pittman said Bexar County Assistant Dist. Atty. Mike Schill reviewed  transcripts of the album lyrics and listened to them on tape before determining  that some words violate state obscenity law.  </P> <P> In Florida last week, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled material on the  album obscene under that state's law. On Sunday, two 2 Live Crew members were  arrested on obscenity charges after performing the banned lyrics.  </P></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): Still large and profitable - Banking / The precautions that Hong Kong's international banking community is making in advance of 1997 ONE of the more sensitive barometers of the Hong Kong climate is the state of its banks. On that score, the colony is holding up as well as can be expected. Hong Kong's banking community remains large and profitable, though it, too, is taking its precautions in advance of 1997. The most conspicuous example of this was the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's decision at the beginning of this year to create a new holding company, based in London. While such a move might have had a devastating effect on confidence a year or two ago, it passed with barely a ripple now - a sign of either Hong Kong's resilience or its fatalism. Otherwise the most notable departures from the Hong Kong bank scene have been for reasons unconnected with 1997 - such as the withdrawal by some US banks as part of their wider retrenchment from international banking, or the more selective strategies adopted by some European banks, such as Lloyds. But these have been offset by new arrivals, and the decision of some banks like Bank of America and Yasuda Trust to establish their regional headquarters there. According to Mr Tony Nicolle, the Banking Commissioner, the number of fully licensed banks in Hong Kong at the end of last year was a record 168, which 'showed clearly that it was an attractive place for international banks to establish'. In his 1990 report, he said profitability for most banks remained good, and their capital was well above levels set by international standards. Hong Kong's future as an international financial centre 'seems bright', he wrote. Although the Hongkong Bank now has a different home, its focus is still very much on Hong Kong where it dominates the overall market and, through subsidiaries like the Hang Seng Bank and Wardley, the merchant bank, various market segments as well. But the bank reported its first profits decline in recent history last year because of severe losses suffered in other markets like the US, Europe and Australia - all the result of efforts to diversify geographically. Mr William Purves, the chairman, rejects suggestions that the message is that the bank should stick to markets it knows. He says the Hongkong Bank had made a decision to become an international institution, and he still believed that to be correct. However, the bank suffered a setback with last December's decision not to proceed with its proposed alliance with the Midland Bank because of difficulties on both sides. Mr Purves does not rule some kind of alliance in future - 'we will revisit that scene at the end of this year,' he says. Hongkong Bank is still keen to strengthen its presence in Europe, the one major geographical region where it lacks a big operation. The other leading players on the local market are headed by the Bank of China and its 12 'sister banks,' now headquartered in Hong Kong's tallest skyscraper, and growing steadily as links with China become stronger. Standard Chartered, the other note issuing bank along with the Hongkong Bank, is fighting to recover ground lost during the turmoil of the 1980s. Staff and strategies have been overhauled, and American expertise has been brought in to sharpen its marketing edge. 'We are still only scratching the surface of the market,' says Mr Ian Wilson, chief manager of the Hong Kong branch. Among overseas banks, Citibank is an important player, as are certain European banks such as Banque National de Paris. But the largest growing foreign community is now the Japanese who have steadily expanded their share of commercial banking, though they have yet to move into retail banking. They have 31 full-licensed banks, compared to 20 from the US and 15 from China. Hong Kong officials say their presence reflects both their eagerness to expand their Asian and Chinese business, but also a desire to escape their toughly regulated home market. Although it is clear that Hong Kong banking is a profitable business, part of the difficulty of judging the health of the banking community is the fact that none of the leading players publishes full information. The local banks maintain secret inner reserves - though the Hongkong Bank is likely to start making full disclosure in a couple of years - and London-based Standard Chartered does not break out details of its Hong Kong branches. Their position is also protected to some extent by an cartel-like agreement among the main banks on interest rates. The future of this agreement is moot. Mr Purves argues that it helps to sustain a strong and flourishing banking industry, but government officials say it is being undermined by innovation in the market. Now that the government has developed ways of controlling the liquidity of the banking market, it is not needed for monetary policy reasons either. Apart from retail banking, the main avenues where bankers see growth are in trade finance and services related to the growing personal wealth of the region - such as private banking and custody services. The colony's growing links with China also hold out prospects for a wide variety of financial services. Citibank already uses Chinese labour to process its letters of credit in the Shenzen economic zone. The government can be expected to encourage the growth of the banking sector as the Hong Kong economy shifts towards becoming more services-based. Banks currently employ about 75,000 people, and the number has been rising each year. However the number of banks may shrink. Some observers expect to see more mergers among the small family-owned banks as competitive pressures increase.  ----------------------------------- HONG KONG BANKS  ----------------------------------- Numbers of licensed banks and their country of ownership:  ----------------------------------- Hong Kong                 15 Australia                  5 China                     15 Japan                     31 France                     8 Germany                    9 Italy                      7 UK                         7 Canada                     6 US                        20 Other                     45  ----------------------------------- Source: Annual report of the Commissioner for Banking, 1990.  -----------------------------------</p>

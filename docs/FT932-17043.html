			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies The Bundesbank's reluctance to cut its official interest rates at yesterday's council meeting is clear confirmation of its gradual approach to monetary relaxation. That is not only baffling in view of the 1 per cent fall in German industrial output during February. It also sits uneasily with the growing realisation on the other side of the Atlantic that the US recovery slowed during the first quarter. The combination pushed the dollar back below DM1.60 yesterday - and dollar weakness has a nasty habit of exacerbating tensions in the ERM. The obvious implication is that the relative calm which followed the French elections may not last. While the Bundesbank is being so coy, the new French government cannot engineer the sharp fall in interest rates needed to reduce unemployment. Double digit real interest rates are also troubling Danish voters in the run up to next month's Maastricht referendum. These factors must be plain for the Bundesbank to see, but they do not loom large in its thinking. Inflation remains higher than the bank would like but it is a lagging indicator. The money supply trend has improved, and there is no longer much sense in using interest rates to apply pressure on the wage and budget front. With such a weak intellectual case for high interest rates, it is curious that the Bundesbank should persist.</p>

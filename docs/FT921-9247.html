			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Branson poised for Virgin Music deal MR RICHARD BRANSON is in advanced talks to sell all or part of his record publishing arm Virgin Music Group, the world's largest independent record label. He said last night: 'We have had some considerable approaches at a level I wouldn't dismiss out of hand in the way I have done over the last 20 years.' Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank handling the valuation, have had discussions with several bidders this year including German publishing giant Bertelsmann, and Thorn EMI, the UK electronics and entertainment group. Mr Branson said he would be more interested in an alliance 'and it would be nice if it were a European company'. Mr Branson has been receiving suitors for the music group for nearly a year although he has denied a sale was imminent. He is understood to have commissioned a preliminary valuation of the music group's library of rights last autumn. Talks began soon afterwards with Thorn EMI and the initial asking price is understood to have been around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 558.5m). Mr Branson has had less contact with the music business in recent years, although he said last night he would not want to leave the business entirely. The change in his interests is understood to be one reason for the discussions. A second is believed to be his other businesses' long-term need for capital. Mr Branson took the Virgin Group off the stock market in 1988. His airlines, retail, communications and music businesses are run separately. Since then, the companies have needed an annual injection of some tens of millions of pounds, partly for investment in airlines and retailing. Mr Branson has sold minority stakes in the airlines, music and retail to a series of partners. The music group is now 25 per cent owned by Fujisankei Communications, the Japanese group, which paid Dollars 150m in 1989. In the last filed accounts, the music group's turnover in the year to July 1990 was Pounds 308.6m, of which Pounds 274m was recording, Pounds 30m music publishing and Pounds 5m the recording studios. It made an operating profit of Pounds 22.9m, Pounds 17.9m from the recording business. Bertelsmann AG, whose New York-based music group had turnover last year of DM3.5bn (Pounds 1.22bn), confirmed last night talks had taken place.</p>

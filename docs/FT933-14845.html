			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Franc in trouble THE main focus of attention in currency markets this week will be on the French franc after a week which has seen heavy selling pressure on the currency in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The last 5 trading days have seen an extraordinary fall in the franc's value against the D-Mark and, on Friday, the currency came below the FFr3.40 level against the German currency for the first time since March. More worryingly, the currency was at minus 71 percentage points level against its ERM divergence indicator, a point close to the one where European central banks are required to support an ailing currency. The franc's fortunes this week will be probably be decided by events in Frankfurt as much as in Paris. There was strong speculation late last week that the Bundesbank might lower the repo rate in its weekly money market intervention on Wednesday, currently at 7.30 per cent. A Bundesbank council meeting is also due on Thursday. At the start of last week, it was assumed that the German central bank would leave its interest rates unchanged at this session, and that the earliest that a cut in official rates could be expected was July 29. But, in the wake of recent developments, some dealers are leaning towards the view that the Bundesbank will have to lower its Lombard rate - and perhaps even its discount rate - this week if the French currency is to receive firm underpinning. Several German economic indicators will hint at whether the Bundesbank will be able to ease monetary policy. Wholesale prices figures for June are due out today, with the market expecting a slight rise in inflation. Producer prices for the same month are also due on Friday.</p>

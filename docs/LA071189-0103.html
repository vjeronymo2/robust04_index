			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARVIN DAVIS, J. H. SNYDER JOIN ON HUGE PROJECT  </P> <P> Billionaire Marvin Davis, through a real estate development company he  controls, has become a partner in the $450-million Water Garden office complex  now under development in Santa Monica, its developer said Monday.  </P> <P> Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co. has become an equal partner with J. H. Snyder  Co. in Water Garden. The Davis involvement has been crucial in the financing of  the 1.26-million-square-foot complex, which is located on a 17-acre site at  Olympic Boulevard and 26th Street.  </P> <P> "Through his efforts, we have been able to get a $230-million construction loan  with Citicorp (Real Estate Inc.) and Bank of America on phase one" of the  four-building project, Jerome H. Snyder, founding partner of J. H. Snyder Co.,  said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talk Over Breakfast  </P> <P> Snyder said he began talking to Davis, who he has known "many years," about the  Water Garden over breakfast one morning at the Tamarsk Country Club near Palm  Springs. "This is the largest development in West Los Angeles. It is too big  for any one person, as far as I'm concerned. We got to talking, (and) we'd  thought we do this one together."  </P> <P> Excavation for the first phase of the Water Garden, which was begun before  construction financing was in place, was completed recently. Snyder had elected  to secure the funds before leasing space in the building. Builders typically  pre-lease space in a building prior to construction to secure construction  financing.  </P> <P> "It is difficult to get this amount of financing in place prior to having  leased the place," he explained. "We wanted to build the project prior to  pre-leasing." Snyder said if potential tenants know they are needed to secure  financing, they push for better leasing terms. He said the $230-million loan  now "positions us nicely to go forward with the project."  </P> <P> Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co. will be responsible for marketing and leasing  of Water Garden, while J. H. Snyder Co. will oversee construction activities.  The first phase of the project includes two office buildings, or 700,000 square  feet of office space, plus 2,500 parking spaces. It is scheduled to open in  spring of 1991.  </P> <P> J. H. Snyder Co. developed the Wilshire Courtyard in the Miracle Mile area.  Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co. built the Fox Plaza in Century City. Davis is  one of two general partners of the firm; the other is longtime Davis business  associate Gerald S. Gray.  </P></p>

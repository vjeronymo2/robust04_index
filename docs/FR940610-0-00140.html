The amendments will eliminate the requirement for recipients to submit an application for NCCs. Instead, the due dates for performance reports will be adjusted so they may be used to determine whether a recipient has met the criteria for receiving a continuation award. EDGAR is also amended to clarify the Department's policy for the use of funds that remain unobligated by the recipient and carried over from one budget period of a project to the next budget period of a project. The action is being taken to improve the effectiveness, integrity, and efficiency of the grant award process, and to contribute to the effectiveness and integrity of the grants. Because these changes are procedural, the Secretary is not publishing these regulations as a proposed rule. However, the Secretary is interested in comments from the public on ways to further improve the non-competing continuation award process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Dates: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments.

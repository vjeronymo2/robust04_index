			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Lamont says it is up to companies to 'lead Britain down the road to recovery' MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last night said it is up to companies to 'lead Britain down the road to recovery' by capitalising on his 'Budget for British business'. He told London businessmen: 'You cannot get strong economic growth at the flick of a switch. However, the basic conditions for recovery are in place and economic indicators are improving.' Tax burdens on business had been cut for the year ahead, and small companies looked forward to a reduction in the burdens placed on them because of his VAT penalty reforms, he said. Businesses, especially in the south, could plan ahead knowing they will not see a real increase in their rate bills next year, he said.</p>

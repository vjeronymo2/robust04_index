			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Arjo obtains go-ahead to list in Paris ARJO Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, has received permission from the Commission des Operations de Bourse to have its shares listed on the Paris Bourse, writes Paul Abrahams. The shares will start trading on October 19. No new equity is being issued as a result of the listing, which is being sponsored by Demachy Worms, the banking subsidiary of Worms, the French holding company. Worms owns 36 per cent of St Louis which in turn holds nearly 40 per cent of Arjo. UBS France and BNP were co-sponsors for the listing. Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the listing would reflect the company's extensive continental operations which account for about half of group turnover. His initial target for the French shareholding is about 3 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A CLEARER PICTURE OF CIVILIZATION COURSE  </P> <P> On April 22, The Times ran an article on UC San Diego's experimental course,  Making of the Modern World ("A Big-Picture Review of World Civilization"). The  article gave a brief synopsis of this revolutionary course that has so enamored  itself with students that some have decided to immortalize it on, of all  things, a T-shirt.  </P> <P> A picture of the back of that T-shirt was printed with the article and served  as the source for most of the dates that were used. Unfortunately, due to human  imperfections on all sides, the first paragraph included a few inaccurate  statements.  </P> <P> First of all, Lucy is a 3.2-million-year-old fossil found in Hadar, Egypt.  According to the time line on the shirt, this find by Dr. Donald Johanson was  dated at 4 million years and was located in the Olduvai Gorge. As the designers  of the shirt, we are very sorry.  </P> <P> The second mistake, made by The Times, was that in 490 B.C. the Persian War was  being fought not in Troy, Ionia, but at Marathon, Greece.  </P> <P> Finally, the intent of the T-shirt being fun, the designers included some fun  places and dates. One of these entries is Nirvana, India. Nirvana is the  ultimate goal of Buddhists and is the spiritual state of enlightened salvation  that Gautama Siddhartha (or Buddha) reached in about 483 B.C.  </P> <P> We would like to thank the Los Angeles Times for an excellent article on a most  deserving curriculum. And as students who have participated in the course, your  article touched on the most memorable and important aspects of the class.  </P> <P> ALAN CHEN  </P> <P> URI FELDMAN  </P> <P> MICHAEL MIZE  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

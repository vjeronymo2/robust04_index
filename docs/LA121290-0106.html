			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING  </P> <P> Tiny powerhouse: On the banking side, another trade publication recently named  tiny Colonial Bank in Santa Ana as California's strongest bank.  </P> <P> The Holt Advisory in West Palm Beach, Fla., based its decision on a variety of  factors, including a formula it developed to determine a bank's soundness.  Colonial's safety factor was rated A-minus, according to the publication.  </P> <P> Colonial was created in 1987 to purchase the assets of the failed New City Bank  in Orange. With $68.7 million in assets at the end of June and net income of  $630,000 for the first nine months, Colonial hopes to expand its business  banking activities under new management, said Robert P. Zingg, the bank's new  president and chief executive.  </P></p>

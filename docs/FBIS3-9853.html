Olechowski said that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak would go  to Brussels to make the application as soon as the lower house  of Poland's parliament approves the measure, sometime after  April 7.    Warsaw wants detailed negotiations with the European Union  to  begin in 1996 or 1997, finishing before 2000, when Poland could  become an EU member with a special transitional status.    Poland has already signed a "Europe agreement" in  preparation  for eventual EU membership.</p>

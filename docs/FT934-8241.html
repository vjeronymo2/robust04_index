			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Bandits and gunmen retake Mogadishu: The UN decision to abandon its policing role leaves the streets to lawless clan fighters BANDITS and gunmen are retaking control of Mogadishu as a result of the United Nations' decision to abandon its policing role in the Somali capital, UN officials said yesterday. They said armed gunmen were walking the streets with impunity, while 'technicals' - jeeps with mounted guns - had made their first appearance since US Marines banished them from the capital last December. Mogadishu's Bakara market is reported to be doing a flourishing trade in weapons. An American civilian working for the UN Operation in Somalia (Unosom) was shot dead on Saturday by robbers who stole his car. Two other UN workers were wounded. The British charity Care International says its Somali security chief was killed by a stray bullet during a shoot-out outside its offices last week. 'Security in Mogadishu is deteriorating rapidly,' Mr George Somerwill of Care International said. 'There is a real risk that the capital might slide back into anarchy.' UN policy in Somalia has been in disarray since 18 US troops were killed in a battle with Gen Mohammed Farah Aideed's militias last month. Under pressure from Washington, the UN military command has given up attempts to disarm militias by force - abandoning, in effect, the first UN peace-enforcing mandate authorised by the Security Council in May. Unosom has also dropped its hunt for Gen Aideed, who is wanted for the slaying of 24 Pakistani peacekeepers in June. A UN policy analyst, who requested anonymity, said the 14,000 UN troops in Mogadishu were under orders to protect themselves and avoid further loss of life. 'As a result,' he said, 'Somalia's warlords believe the UN will not intervene in inter-clan fighting. If the UN maintains this passive military role, it might as well leave Somalia altogether.' Aid workers also report the UN's hands-off policy is emboldening bandits who have not had a chance to engage in serious looting since the US launched its humanitarian military intervention in December 1992. Food distribution and food-for-work programmes have been much curtailed. In addition to inter-clan warfare, UN military officials believe Islamic fundamentalist groups are aiding Gen Aideed with money and arms. Major David Stockwell, the UN military spokesman, said intelligence reports indicated 'the presence in Mogadishu of an unspecified number of individuals, possibly Hizbollah fundamentalists, with expertise in car bombings'. However, non-government organisations working in the capital believe these reports are exaggerated. Somalia's battle-hardened militias are not thought to need coaching in the handling of explosives. It is possible, nevertheless, that Gen Aideed and his rivals are re-arming their militias with the help of fundamentalist groups. In the wake of the rising lawlessness in Mogadishu, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday presented the Security Council with three different options for the future of the troubled UN operation in Somalia. The alternatives range from maintaining the present mandate and force of about 29,000 troops, to securing only ports and airports with a scaled-down military presence. A review of Unosom has become imperative because the US plans to withdraw its 7,500-strong contingent by the end of March, while France, Belgium and Sweden have also announced their intention to pull out of Somalia. Mr Boutros-Ghali says he has written to 42 UN member states in an attempt to fill the vacuum that will be left by the departing troops.</p>

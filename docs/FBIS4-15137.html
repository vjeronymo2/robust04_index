			<p>BFN     [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry has voiced serious  concern over the order issued by the Russian Federation  president on 5 April of this year, on setting up Russian  Federation military bases on the territory of CIS states and the  Republic of Latvia, with the aim of both ensuring security in  those states and testing military equipment.    Estonia shares the Latvian Government's concerns that the  above order constitutes an immediate danger to the independence  and security of a sovereign state. The Estonian Foreign  Ministry finds that setting up military bases on the territory  of one or another country is determined by the will of the  people in that country, and not by any orders from the Russian  leadership. This particular case is a dangerous example of the  Russian foreign policy's great-power ambitions [words  indistinct]. The Estonia Foreign Ministry holds the position  that the relations between Russia and the Baltic states can  develop only in the spirit of mutual respect, on the basis of  international standards.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Baggeridge Brick shows fourfold gain Shares of Baggeridge Brick, one of the last independent UK brick producers, jumped by almost 9 per cent yesterday, from 126p to 137p, after the company announced a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.56m for the six months to end-March, against Pounds 383,000. The company benefited from increased sales as the housing market recovery increased demand for bricks. Turnover rose from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 16.8m. The pre-tax result was helped by a decline in interest payable from Pounds 522,000 to Pounds 295,000. Mr Peter Ward, chairman, said: 'Sales of our housing bricks have been particularly strong in the six months as national housebuilders increased their building activity. 'Our production volume was markedly higher than last year as all our factories remained fully operational throughout the winter. Our stock levels were also reduced.' Earnings per share increased from 0.65p to 2.62p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.75p.</p>

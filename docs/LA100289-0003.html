			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> HEAVY RAIN, FATAL TORNADO BATTER SOUTH  </P> <P> Torrential rains battered the South, where a tornado also killed a woman and an  infant, injured a dozen more people and destroyed a church in a 10-mile rampage  near the southern Georgia town of Moultrie. Most of the damage and both deaths  occurred at a mobile home park. The tornado tore through a stand of timber  after wrecking the mobile homes and then demolished the Bethlehem Schley  Baptist Church, police said. The heavy rains -- more than 5 inches in  metropolitan Atlanta in 24 hours -- prompted the National Weather Service to  issue flood watches and warnings about earthen dams in most of the Southern  states. Some roads in south central Tennessee were closed under several inches  of water. Elsewhere, snow was predicted in Montana, and warnings were issued to  ranchers in northern Wyoming where livestock could become vulnerable to cold  gusty winds and rain changing to snow.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Significance of Abu-Mazin's Remarks"] </F>   [Excerpts] Many Palestinians have welcomed the remarks by  Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, a senior PLO official and a PLO  Executive Committee member. He said something to the effect  that this generation of revolutionaries, who have led the  revolution and the liberation movement since 1964, must hand  over the banner to the younger generation. Abu-Mazin expressed  doubt that the generation of the revolution would be able to  transform and govern a state. He emphasized that the  Palestinian leadership needs new blood to continue the road  forged by the generation of the revolution with their blood,  sweat, and sacrifice. They raised the banner of struggle in the  sixties; now the younger generation must continue the march  until the objectives are achieved. [passage omitted]    Abu-Mazin's remarks are sound, wise, and logical. He is  addressing his call to the current leadership. who began the  revolutionary march as young enthusiastic men who are wiser now  that they are over the age of 60. He is convinced that the  building of a state needs younger leaders to take over the  responsibility. He does not belittle the role that his  generation has played in leadership, a role that will always be  an object of admiration by our people and a model of sacrifice  to be emulated. However, he realizes that this is the code of  life and the logic of history. National interest dictates that  the leadership be handed over to a generation of Palestinians  who have relentlessly fought the occupation for over 27 years.  They are able to deal with their problems and issues with  pragmatism and equilibrium.    Over the past decades the leadership has faced many  challenges. It has taught the young generation the meaning of  steadfastness and defiance. It has refused to submit to  blackmail or to surrender under the most difficult  circumstances. It has believed in the homeland's sacred mission  and has carried it out with honesty. It has safeguarded rights  and has not abandoned principles. Abu- Mazin's call to the  leadership to give the younger generation a chance to shoulder  responsibility stems from his awareness that there is a need to  find a formula for transferring leadership, for he fears that a  clash might occur between the new and old leaderships in the  struggle to establish a democratic Palestinian state. Abu-Mazin  adds that a new Palestinian leadership has emerged, whether or  not the current leadership admits it or not.    Abu-Mazin's remarks reaffirm the leadership's awareness of  the new developments on the Palestinian land, developments that  require new and modern formulas to solve the problems not only  with the Israelis--the enemies of the past--but also among the  Palestinians themselves. There is a dire need to maintain the  unity of the national ranks, prevent any breakup of these ranks,  and to build new concepts based on solid ground so that the  masses will be one hand building the homeland for the sake of  which we have sacrificed so long.</p>

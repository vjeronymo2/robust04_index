Their activity brings up questions of the  possible effect on environment, personnel and population of  adjacent territories. Radioecological inspections of 19  specialized enterprises were conducted in 1989-1993. The article  presents a block diagram of operation of these enterprises,  which actually shows a model of possible transfer of radioactive  substances from an enterprise into environment. To obtain  information on the radioecological status of the environment one  studied _g_ radiation fields in various zones of each  enterprise  and the content of _a_ and _b_ emitting products and  individual  radionuclides in water, soil and vegetation. Results of the  analysis for all specialized enterprises demonstrated that there  was no noticeable effect on environmental objects. However, it  is possible that this conclusion was the result of insufficient  sensitivity of observation equipment, the small size of the  statistical sampling and non-representative character of the  samples. No correlation was found when a criterion based on the  principle of independence of data related to different  enterprises located far away from each other was used when the  effect of radiation background was discounted. Within the error  of measurement no environmental effect of the enterprises was  found when using available procedures. However, one cannot  consider this analysis as unbiased if one does not take into  account radiation background data. Figures 2.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Li Xudong (2621 2485 2639) and Jiang </F> Anjian (5592 1344 0256)]    [Text] Jinan, 3 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Zaozhuang Hengli  Optics Communications Company in Shandong successfully invented  our country's first deep-sea fibre optics cable and filled in  the production gaps in our country's optics communications  material.    Deep-sea fibre optics cable is a kind of fibre optics  communications cable laid on seabeds. Such cables must be  highly resistant to water and corrosion, and must be able to  withstand heavy pounding from the sea. So far such cables are  only produced by a handful of developed countries such as the  United States, Germany, and Britain. Our successful invention  was the result of joint research begun last May by the Zaozhuang  Hengli Optics Communications Company and the No.8 Research  Center affiliated to the Ministry of Electronics Industry.  Tests conducted by fibre optics communications research and  monitoring centers in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other  localities have proved that the cable's performance has reached  or surpassed similar products produced abroad. Batch production  of the cables has begun.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report SILVER fell sharply on the London bullion market, weighing on the GOLD market. Silver tracked losses on Comex where US funds, disappointed that the metal had failed to pull back above the key 390 cents chart level, liquidated long positions. December Comex gold futures were holding above the key chart level of Dollars 349.30 a troy ounce by midday in quiet trading because of Jewish New Year. However, one analyst said participants were liquidating their recent long positions in gold because the metal had failed to rise further on the back of Europe's currency crisis. Another said: 'With the dollar down against the yen, you'd think gold would be higher. But it isn't, and some are getting fed up with it.' London's robusta COFFEE ended around the day's lows. Dealers said ICO talks had slowed the market; news that delegates had agreed on basic principles for a control system met with scepticism. 'The market is in need of hard facts and we're getting no hard facts from this,' one said. London COCOA recovered from earlier lows as manufacturer buying emerged. The December contract fell to Pounds 624, possibly on long liquidation, before closing at Pounds 648 a tonne.</p>

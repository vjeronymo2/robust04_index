			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Malval condemns Haiti's military Mr Robert Malval, Haiti's acting prime minister, has denounced the country's military rulers after six months of silence, Canute James and agencies report from Kingston. He called on Gen Raoul Cedras and his fellow officers, who have refused to bow to international pressure, to resign and allow the return of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president who was overthrown and sent into exile almost three years ago. 'You have locked our country in the darkness of night,' an angry Mr Malval told Gen Cedras. 'The time has come for you to leave so that a new dawn may break for the Haitian people. Morally, you are not worthy of the title of commander in chief of the armed forces of Haiti.' His attack followed the usurpation of his powers by Mr Emile Jonassaint, an 81-year-old judge installed by a small group of lawmakers as provisional president last week. Mr Joussaint appointed a clique of extreme right-wingers and nationalists to his cabinet on Monday. In failing to name a premier, Mr Jonassaint assumed the duties of head of state and head of government. Separating those powers was the chief intent of Haiti's 1987 constitution, approved overwhelmingly by Haitians a year after they rose up to end the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SQUABBLE OVER AIRLINE MOVIE  </P> <P> Sun has the right to question the fairness of having to pay for headset rentals  to watch in-flight movies, although to me the situation is so self-evident that  the rule leaves no ambiguity.  </P> <P> The revolting part of the story, however, is Sun's message to the captain --  "I'm a lawyer and if anything happened on the ground, I would file a suit." If  the lawyer was really concerned about possible disciplinary proceedings in the  State Bar, as he sat handcuffed in the police station, it would be more aptly  for this abuse of his professional status.  </P> <P> ARTHUR CHEN, San Gabriel  </P></p>

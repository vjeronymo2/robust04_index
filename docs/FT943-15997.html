			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper rally runs into resistance Copper's price rally continued at the London Metal Exchange yesterday but ran into resistance short of the 21-month peaks reached late last month. Twice the three months position spiked above Dollars 2,490 a tonne, but both times the move was reversed by dealer selling and profit-taking. At the close the price stood at Dollars 2,486.50 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on the day and Dollars 110 above the low reached in the sell-off that ended a week ago. In after hours trading it was trimmed further Dollars 13. Dealers told Reuter that yesterday afternoon's retreat was all part of a consolidation process following a week of gains. The rise had been encouraged by news that Chile's Chuquicamata mine would lose 40,000 tonnes of output this year because of a furnace closure to comply with pollution controls.</p>

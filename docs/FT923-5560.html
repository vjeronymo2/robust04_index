			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Food and Wine: A top-class treat SHOULD you need to say thank you and want to give a present that will be really welcome, then why not choose a custom-made hamper? Panzers at 13-19 Circus Road, London NW8 (tel: 071-435-0165/071-722-8162) will put together hampers from a big selection of upmarket goodies: virgin olive oil with peppercorns, wild mushrooms, fresh truffles, caviar and pure Ceylon tea. Prices are from Pounds 40 per hamper. In a year when all things Japanese are fashionable you could order ingredients such as parched laver seaweed, bonito flakes, Japanese noodles, tofu, sake and Sapporo beer. Homesick Americans might be glad of a hamper containing candy canes, pecan nuts, Skippy peanut butter and root beer. There are more than 6,000 items to choose from and Panzers will deliver anywhere in the UK within 24 hours of ordering.</p>

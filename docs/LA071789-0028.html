			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BASTILLE DAY MUSIC AT GETTY MUSEUM  </P> <P> It wasn't the best of concerts. It wasn't the worst of concerts. Just like La  Revolution itself, Saturday's appropriately titled program in the Getty  Museum's peristyle garden, "Music Before and After Bastille Day," was not  without mishap.  </P> <P> No one was sent to the guillotine, but there was one casualty earlier in the  day: Soprano Mary Rawcliffe reportedly fell victim to an allergy. To the rescue  came Susan Judy, who, on scarcely more than two hours notice, performed  yeoman's duty in delivering Revolution-era songs by Dalayrac, Gaveaux, Philidor  and Becourt. Though one had to admire her pure, sweet tone and sensitive  phrasing, her voice lacked both projection and range and it appeared that she  had far too little time with which to acquaint herself with the text.  </P> <P> The purely instrumental installments were characterized by rhythmically  precise, well-balanced ensemble-work and intelligent, stylish phrasing.  Intonation, however, especially when the strings played double stops, proved a  recurrent problem. Violinists Elizabeth Blumenstock and Anthony Martin, viola  da gamba player Martha McGaughey and harpsichordist Arthur Haas brought  elegance and vigor to Francois Couperin's "Sonade: L'espagnol," but found it  necessary to retune the period instruments at every possible opportunity.  McGaughey had some difficulty in negotiating the technical hurdles in Marin  Marais' Suite, "D'un gout etranger" and some of her notes could barely be  heard.  </P> <P> Haas gave clean, articulate and highly charged readings of harpsichord works by  Claude-Benigne Balbastre, among them a spirited march based on the  "Marseillaise."

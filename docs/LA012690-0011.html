			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE  </P> <P> Staff writer David Shaw's indictment of the media coverage of the McMartin case  is a masterpiece of journalistic analysis and should be nominated for a prize  (Part A, Jan. 19-22).  </P> <P> If ever television and newspaper reporters have had a better reason to hang  their heads in shame, I haven't seen it.  </P> <P> The press' amplification of Deputy Dist. Atty. Eleanor Barrett's claim that  "millions" of kiddie porn photos had been taken, and its subsequent failure to  follow up the fact that, despite an exhaustive search, not a single picture was  ever found, is just one of many examples of unforgivable media negligence. This  example also reveals another fact of journalistic life. Claiming that such  photos exist is headline-grabbing; discovering that they don't is boring, even  disappointing. And it's headlines that sell newspapers.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the jury in a criminal trial must base its decision exclusively on  the validity of evidence presented in court, not on media sensationalism.  Unfortunately, the public forms its opinion exclusively from that media  coverage. The widespread outrage over the acquittal of Ray Buckey and his  mother is a vivid reminder of the enormous power of the press to shape public  opinion. It is also a sobering reminder of the media's responsibility to report  accurately and fairly.  </P> <P> FOREST G. WOOD  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

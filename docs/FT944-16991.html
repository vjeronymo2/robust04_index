			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / 24 in court over London violence Twenty-four people charged with offences arising out of Sunday's protest in London against the criminal justice and public order bill appeared yesterday at Highbury and Camberwell magistrates courts in London. They were variously charged with violent disorder, affray, assaulting police, possessing cannabis and threatening behaviour. They were remanded, mainly on bail, for a few weeks. Recriminations continued yesterday with police and protesters each blaming the other for the disorder in Hyde Park and Oxford Street that led to violent confrontations between an estimated 20,000 demonstrators and 2,000 police. Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, said yesterday that no party had voted against the bill in the Commons. 'The vast majority of those who demonstrated yesterday were demonstrating peacefully. It was a hard core of very unpleasant people who decided they wanted to have violence and to break shop windows. There is no place for them in our society.'</p>

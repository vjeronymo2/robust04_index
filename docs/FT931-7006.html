			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Hollick splits with view of MGN board LORD HOLLICK, the Labour peer, seemed isolated last night as a director of Mirror Group Newspapers as all the other directors reaffirmed support for the business policies of the group. After a meeting called to remove uncertainty about the political stance of the group, its future business direction, and the leadership of Mr David Montgomery, the chief executive, Lord Hollick said that he could not fully support the views of his fellow directors. Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, the television, advertising and financial services group, is a non-executive director of the popular newspaper group. The board yesterday confirmed its confidence in the MGN management and authorised Mr Montgomery and his colleagues to continue the agreed strategy. Yesterday's board meeting was also told that Mr John Talbot, the administrator who holds 54.8 per cent of the shares in the group, has expressed his confidence in the management and is pleased with the progress made so far. The latest row at the Daily Mirror blew up last week when Mr Montgomery, a former editor of the newspaper Today, brought in Mr David Seymour as group political editor. That was seen as an effective demotion of Mr Alastair Campbell, the Daily Mirror's political editor, who was close to both Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader and to Lord Hollick. Mr Campbell resigned. Ironically, he was yesterday appointed assistant editor of Today by Mr Richard Stott, the newly appointed Today editor who was himself fired as editor of the Daily Mirror by Mr Montgomery. The MGN board emphasised that there never would be any question of the group changing its left-of-centre political stance. Sir Robert Clark, MGN chairman, said: 'I am glad that all the other 10 directors, as well as our controlling shareholder, have today reinforced their support for the management and for the policies we have been pursuing. Untrue speculation can now be laid to rest.' Lord Hollick said: 'I have raised a number of concerns. The chairman has informed me that the board will be looking into these matters and hopefully steps can be taken to enable me to give my full support.'</p>

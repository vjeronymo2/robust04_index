			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Berlusconi hit by local polls: Centre-left alliances flourish as Forza Italia falters Results of week-end local elections have increased the fragility of Italy's right-wing government and turned the spotlight on the possibility of a centre-left coalition. Centre-left opposition alliances won the mayoral races in the run-off for four out of six regional capitals, two of the regional councils and a majority of the small local administrations being contested. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement showed signs of having lost momentum and in the south the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance surprised every commentator by the poor performance in its heartland. The most spectacular result was the defeat of the right by a centre-left coalition in the southern port of Brindisi and the province of Foggia. Members of the government dismissed the outcome as insignificant voter discontent. But Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, said the outcome demonstrated his movement could no longer live with its partners in the right-wing coalition. Although the elections involved fewer than 2m voters, all the political parties prepared for them as a big end-of-year test for the popularity of the Berlusconi government and the strength of the ruling alliance. The vote covered a cross-section of the country - from the rich industrialised north (Brescia, Treviso and Sondrio) to the centre (Pescara and Massa) and the South (Brindisi and Foggia). The most interesting result was at Brescia, where Mr Vito Gnutti, the industry minister and League candidate, fell to Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the leader of the Christian Democrats who presided over their transformation into the Popular party (PPI). He gathered 56 per cent of the vote, backed by the PPI and a broad alliance of the centre-left. This alliance included the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the Greens; but the high vote for Mr Martinazzoli indicated he had obtained the reluctant backing of Reconstructed Communism, formed from the rump of the old Italian Communist party. Brescia now mirrors the fast changing political landscape. This wealthy industrial centre was a traditional Christian Democrat stronghold, until it was taken over by the League in the March general elections. Then in the June European parliamentary elections, Forza Italia won 30 per cent of the vote and cut the League from 25 per cent to 17 per cent. The League vote held up in the first round of local elections two weeks ago; but Forza Italia fell back to 12 per cent, while the MSI was almost level with its government partner. With Forza Italia only giving half-hearted support to Mr Gnutti and the MSI boycotting him - both in protest over the League's 'disloyalty' in government - his defeat was likely. But the margin was bigger than expected. Mr Martinazzoli represented the left wing of the Christian Democrats and he has now become both the symbol of, and the laboratory experiment for, the PPI's new strategy of allying with the more powerful PDS.</p>

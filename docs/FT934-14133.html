			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Balladur seeks consensus on Gatt MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday saw the complete spectrum of French political, farm, industry and show business leaders in seeking a consensus for his negotiating position in the Gatt trade talks. After conceding on television on Sunday night that Gatt was 'a trap for his government', offering it only the alternative between an international or a domestic crisis, Mr Balladur called a succession of leaders and opinion-formers into his office, the Matignon. Over the weekend Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, made a rare public intervention in the Gatt debate, warning France of the risks of isolating itself over farm trade. In a French television interview he said France was 'inventing its own Maginot Line' - a reference to the elaborate but ultimately ineffective line of defences built against the Germans during the two world wars. Aides said yesterday Mr Delors was worried by the escalating rhetoric in France. One sign of the 'malaise' in the Gatt debate was the way in which a report in favour of free trade drawn up Mr Patrick Devedjian, the moderate RPR Gaullist deputy, was simply killed in committee. Mr Delors's criticism of the French government's position was balanced by sharp words for the US, which he said had failed to follow through on commitments on market access made last July in Tokyo. Most important, and for the moment predictably, he won a pledge of 'complete support' from the leader of his own RPR Gaullist party, Mr Jacques Chirac. A possible tussle between the two men for the presidency in 1995 could turn on the farm vote, which Mr Chirac has always courted assiduously. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the other government coalition party, the UDF, is due to see Mr Balladur later today. Mr Balladur got only an ambiguous promise from Mr Michel Rocard, leader of the Socialists, the main opposition party, that he would remain 'vigilant' in watching out for French interests. While the Communists said they could not support Mr Balladur 'for the moment', because he was not being tough enough, and the Greens pushed for a strong French stance in Gatt, the prime minister found some backing from Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the right-wing nationalist, who said he was ready to participate in 'the broad national consensus' that Mr Balladur is seeking in the run-up to the December 15 deadline for the Gatt talks.</p>

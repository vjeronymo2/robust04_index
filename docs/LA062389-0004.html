			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBUFFED SHIP  </P> <P> Your front-page story from Miami Beach talking to the survivors of the "Voyage  of the Damned" 50 years ago (June 5) was extremely powerful and moving in  relating a very important episode in the Nazi Holocaust.  </P> <P> To those of us who also survived this most tragic era in the history of  mankind, it brought back painful memories of life in Nazi-occupied Europe, in  constant fear of being caught and deported to the infamous death camps.  </P> <P> Your staff writer, Barry Bearak, deserves great credit not only for having  given such a detailed and faithful account of the sufferings of the Jewish  people under Nazi domination, but also of their futile efforts to find refuge  in the countries of the free world.  </P> <P> Historian and Holocaust scholar David Wyman was right in stating that "if the  world had opened its doors, hundreds of thousands of Jews would have been  saved."  </P> <P> Our sincere and deep appreciation to The Times for having devoted the space for  this vital historic account.  </P> <P> OTTO SCHIRN  </P> <P> YVONNE SCHIRN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

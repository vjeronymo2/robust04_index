			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TEEN DIES IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Rossmoor boy died early today shortly after the motorcycle he was  riding as a passenger went out of control and crashed, the California Highway  Patrol reported.  </P> <P> James Englehaupt died at 1:10 a.m. at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, about two  hours after the accident along St. Albans Drive in Rossmoor, an unincorporated  Orange County community west of Los Alamitos, CHP spokesman Lyle Whitten said.  </P> <P> Englehaupt was a passenger on the off-road motorcycle driven by Michael David  Winter, 18, also of Rossmoor. Whitten said the pair were headed east on St.  Albans Drive near Silver Fox Road at an unknown speed when Winter apparently  lost control of the motorcycle.  </P> <P> They crashed into a curb and struck a post, throwing both of them from the  motorcycle. Englehaupt suffered massive head and internal injuries while  Winter, who was taken to the same hospital, had a broken arm and other minor  injuries. Whitten said neither youth was wearing a helmet.  </P> <P> Whitten said officers will ask the Orange County district attorney's office to  file drunk driving and possibly manslaughter charges against Winter. Whitten  said the motorcyclist also lacked the proper driver's license.  </P></p>

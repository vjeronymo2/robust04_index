			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: The timbre of Indian timber IF YOU think Indian art is about refined miniature painting and the clean lines of the Taj Mahal, then the exhibition 'Living Wood' at the Whitechapel Gallery will change your mind. Celebrating the South Indian woodcarving tradition, this is a pioneering show of 120 animals, gods, spirits, chariots and architectural elements made in southern India since the 15th century. From a 2 1/2 m high, gold-painted strutting peacock used for temple processions to an equally large, sumptuously carved door of Burma teak which once led into a wealthy trader's mansion in Chattinad, all but a handful are on public view for the first time. India's craftsmen have produced some of the world's most remarkable woodcarvings. Their skills so astonished the sophisticated Mughals who invaded North India in the 16th century that they employed native Hindu woodcarvers to build and decorate their Islamic buildings. This exhibition concentrates on the pure Hindu traditions of the South, where the Dravadian culture was never knocked on its side by Islamic invaders. High-quality wooden sculpture has been a feature of life in southern India down the centuries, and continues to do so, but until now it has largely been ignored by academics. The vast wealth of material is mostly unpublished and thus unknown except to the more intrepid travellers to India. George Michell, who researched the exhibition and edited its substantial catalogue, has set out to change this. His aim of opening up another chapter in Indian art, to publicise the 'pure enjoyment and aesthetic stimulus' of South Indian woodcarving, has meant turning detective to ferret out the exhibits. Some, including a great painted screen flanked by grinning monkeys, have been shipped from Perth, Western Australia, where there is a foundation for Indian art, established by an American who made a fortune in Australia and spent much of it on Indian art. By contrast, a great goddess sitting astride a winged bull and several other votive images come from Mysore University's substantial Folklore Museum, which miraculously struggles along on an annual budget of Pounds 80, with no hope of exhibitions or publications. Closer to home, Mr Michell spent a day at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum unpacking 20 cases which had not been opened since the Indian Collection was moved there from the Imperial Institute in the 1950s. The Whitechapel Gallery held its first exhibition of Indian art in 1904, a general survey grandly entitled 'Indian Empire'. Mr Michell's show, ranging from high-class, intellectual temple carving to simple pieces of nature worship, is unified by each exhibit's freshness, directness and energy. Such a show demonstrates just how far the appreciation of Indian art in Britain has progressed. Sponsored by The Henry Moore Foundation, Visiting Arts, Grindlays Bank, and Cox&amp; Kings Travel. At Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1, (071) 377 5015, until May 31, then at Cliffe Castle, Bradford, June 13-August 9.</p>

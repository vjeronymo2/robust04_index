			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Rubber down 68% Sumitomo Rubber, Japan's third largest tyre manufacturer, yesterday reported consolidated pre-tax profits down 68.6 per cent at Y4.93bn (Dollars 45.64m) for the year ending December 31. Net profits fell 24.1 per cent to Y4.25bn. The result underlined the continuing dire state of the Japanese tyre industry which has been hit by falling demand, lower prices, and a deteriorating product mix as consumers trade down to cheaper products. The company also blamed the rise of the yen which had reduced the value of overseas profits. Earnings per share dropped from Y33.77 to Y24.6. The fall in profit was achieved on sales down 13 per cent at Y503bn. The Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers' Association recently reported that demand from automotive manufacturers and consumers wanting to replace tyres had fallen last year. Shipments to domestic vehicle constructors fell 12.1 per cent during 1993 to 50m units. Sales to the replacement market dropped from 67.6m units in 1992 to 60.9m last year. Sumitomo Rubber warned its net profit would fall further this year, reaching only Y4bn. It predicted pre-tax profits would be static at Y5bn on sales of Y530bn. Earnings per share would also fall at Y24.41. Mitsubishi is to take a 20 per cent interest in the new ADollars 70m (USDollars 50.3m) methanol research plant which Broken Hill Proprietary Petroleum, part of the Australian resources and steel group, is building in Melbourne, writes Nikki Tait. The plant is designed to research and develop forms of methanol-producing technology, first developed by ICI Katalco in the UK. 'The joint venturers believe that methanol, which can be transported and stored like other petroleum products, could be a cost-competitive fuel for power generation,' said BHP yesterday. BHP began building the plant last year, and it is about three-quarters complete.</p>

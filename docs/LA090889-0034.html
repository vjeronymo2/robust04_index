			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> BURBANK CASHES IN ON A TIP, 12-7  </P> <P> Alhambra 19, Glendale 10 -- Glendale entered its home opener fearing its  biggest weakness would be its running game. Stopping the run turned out to be  its biggest problem.  </P> <P> The Dynamiters allowed 262 yards and three touchdowns on the ground. The  longest touchdown run came on the combined efforts of Jess Castillo and Frank  Shiozaki. Castillo broke loose on a 31-yard sweep, but lost control of the ball  when he was tackled. Shiozaki picked up the fumble and went the final 12 yards  to give Alhambra its second touchdown.  </P> <P> Glendale lost a chance to take the lead in the second quarter when a 60-yard  touchdown pass from quarterback Erik Kiesau to Sang Lee was nullified by a  penalty. Lee was ruled to have stepped out of bounds before catching the pass.  </P> <P> "We're a young team and that was a very crucial play and it broke our spirit,"  Glendale Coach Don Shoemaker said. "The referee saw that he was out of bounds  and made the right call."  </P> <P> In his first start, Kiesau completed 18 of 34 passes for 194 yards for  Glendale. SEAN WATERS  </P></p>

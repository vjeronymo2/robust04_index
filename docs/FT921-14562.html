			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Brazil pension cash warning BRAZIL will allow the social security system to run out of cash rather than print money to finance higher pensions, Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank president, warned yesterday. Mr Gros said in London that if Congress did not vote money to finance a court-ordered 147 per cent increase in pensions, or if the court order was not reversed, 'the social security system is going to run out of money'. Legislation was due before Congress yesterday to increase social security contributions to raise the estimated Dollars 10bn cost of the pension increase. The administration of President Fernando Collor had proposed an increase of more than 50 per cent, but the Supreme Court ordered that pensioners were entitled to receive a significantly bigger rise. Mr Gros said the government remained hopeful that the court order would be reversed at a further hearing, probably next month. He sought to allay concerns that the rise in state pensions would jeopardise a Dollars 2bn standby loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which depends heavily on keeping the fiscal deficit in check. The IMF board is scheduled on January 22 to discuss the loan, upon which hangs agreement on important debt restructurings with the Paris Club of creditor governments and with commercial banks. The central bank president, accompanied by senior members of his team, painted a picture of an administration now committed to fiscal and monetary rectitude, but one which recognised that economic stability and low inflation would not be achieved quickly. The officials accompanying Mr Gros said they hoped that over a three-year period Brazil's foreign debt could be reduced by Dollars 15bn through debt-to-equity swaps in privatisations.

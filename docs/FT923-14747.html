			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Management (GEC At The Crossroads): Preparing for life after Lord Weinstock - Part one, The board is lining up to take one of the biggest decisions in the company's history A CORPORATE timebomb is quietly ticking away on the desk of Lord Prior, the chairman of General Electric Company. It will be his job to make sure it does not explode. The explosive issue is the succession to the man who has been the driving force behind the company for more than 30 years, its architect, creator and managing director, Lord Weinstock. Finding a successor to Lord Weinstock, who will be 68 next month, will be the one of the most significant decisions in GEC's history. He is the linchpin of the company's senior management. He has occupied the seat of power at GEC as the chairmen and managing directors of other companies have come and gone. His reign has lent GEC a stability unrivalled in British industry. Yet behind the scenes there are sharp divisions between GEC's management and some of its directors, and between the executives and institutional shareholders over how the company should develop and how the succession should be decided. It is Lord Prior's job to prevent the search for a successor turning into a power struggle that could destabilise the group. The conduct and outcome of that process will not just affect GEC. The company is a central pillar of the UK manufacturing establishment; what happens to it matters to the rest of British industry. Since the youthful Arnold Weinstock became GEC's managing director in 1961 he has transformed it from an ailing electrical group into one of Britain's largest manufacturing companies. It has a stock market capitalisation of about Pounds 6bn, annual sales of Pounds 9.4bn and pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 829m, generated by 277 subsidiaries which employ about 118,000 people. Only last week GEC unveiled a 1 per cent rise in profits and a 5 per cent rise in dividends at a time when rivals are seeing profits vanish. Its interests stretch from radars and torpedoes to petrol pumps and weighing machines. It sells power stations in China and frigates to Malaysia. It makes telephone exchanges in Liverpool and refrigerators in Peterborough. The group is the custodian of much of Britain's technological heritage: from Marconi's original work on radar and radio and Whittle's work on jet engines to most of the UK's expertise in telephone equipment and much of the post-war British computer industry. Lord Weinstock led GEC to its dominance of the UK's engineering, electronic and telecommunications industries through a string of daring takeovers. The foundation was laid in 1967 with the acquisition of Associated Electrical Industries, followed a year later by GEC's merger with English Electric. Since then the company has overshadowed UK heavy electrical engineering. The profits generated from rationalising the merged group allowed GEC to finance other acquisitions in the 1980s. These have brought it a similarly dominant position in British defence electronics and telecommunications equipment manufacturing. In the past five years, GEC-Marconi has acquired large parts of Plessey's and Ferranti's defence businesses. The group is also the leading UK maker of telecommunications equipment through GPT, in which Siemens of Germany has a 40 per cent stake. Much of the future of Britain's involvement in the electrical, electronics and telecommunications industries will hinge on the company's performance. The task of finding Lord Weinstock's successor would thus be highly sensitive at the best of times. But it is especially delicate now because GEC is facing as demanding a set of challenges as at any time since Lord Weinstock took the helm. The group's core, the Marconi defence electronics business, has been badly hit by cuts in defence spending. Even large programmes which it could once have relied upon, such as the European Fighter Aircraft, are becoming precarious. Marconi needs to grow by applying its technology to non-defence markets - but it lacks many of the skills to succeed in the competitive world of consumer electronics. UK public sector markets - in which GEC has traditionally prospered, particularly telecommunications - are being opened up to competition by privatisation and liberalisation. Also, the world's electrical equipment industry is still suffering from overcapacity, which has forced GEC to consolidate its activities into a joint venture with Alsthom of France. The way that GEC faces these pressures will turn on how it finds a successor to Lord Weinstock. The two figures who will be central to the saga of the succession are very different characters. Lord Prior, a bluff hearty figure, his cheeks rudely red with good health, has spent most of his life as a Tory politician, rising to become employment secretary in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first government before his last political job as Northern Ireland secretary. He became GEC's chairman in 1984 and is the company's public face. Lord Weinstock is the private power behind the facade. His influence extends throughout the group from his dimly lit office on the fifth floor of GEC's dowdy headquarters in London's Stanhope Gate opposite Hyde Park. All the big decisions at GEC revolve around him. With his tall frame bent over his desk in the corner of the office, he is intensely involved in the detail of all GEC's subsidiaries - from how much they pay their employees to how they set their prices. His chief weapons are a razor-sharp mind and his telephone, which is programmed to put him through to any of his 250 top managers at the press of a single button. The two Lords say there is nothing to worry about: the succession will be a smooth affair. Lord Prior insists Lord Weinstock will not dig his heels in. The need for change is fully recognised, he says: 'For the past six months, this is something we have done serious work on, we must talk about it at least once a month. We have time to get the right answer and we will do that through agreement.' Lord Weinstock agrees: 'There is no disagreement over how this issue should be handled. I will know when my brain is failing. My colleagues will come to me when they judge it's time for a change.' Behind the scenes, however, the succession is becoming a highly charged issue, one which could provoke a tug-of-war between the board and the company's top managers. Three groups are jockeying for position: Lord Weinstock and his closely knit team of Stanhope Gate senior managers want the succession to be resolved by evolution from within the company. They are opposed to an outsider being brought in as managing director. They favour the joint appointment of Mr David Newlands, the finance director, and Mr Simon Weinstock, Lord Weinstock's son, who is in charge of acquisitions. Lord Weinstock could become co-chairman, working in a supervisory capacity alongside Lord Prior, to provide advice and guidance when needed. A group of dissidents on the board flatly opposes this. The dissidents believe GEC needs to be shaken up by new management, to push the company into non-defence markets. These critics believe the board must wrest the decision from the management's grip. They want to break the Weinstock mould by bringing in an outsider as managing director. They would like other GEC executives to take the place of some of the old Stanhope Gate team such as Mr Malcolm Bates, the deputy managing director, and Mrs Sarah Morrison, the head of human resources. The balance of power will be held by a small but powerful group of centrists, mainly non-executive directors and institutional investors. The centrists agree with the Stanhope Gate managers that the company needs an evolution in operating management, through the appointment of an insider as managing director. But they would combine this with the appointment of a powerful chairman charged with forging a new strategy for GEC. The three groups have very different ideas about how the decision should be made. In spite of its size GEC is run like a family business. Its board plays only a limited role even in strategic decisions such as acquisitions. Those decisions are taken by Lord Weinstock working with a handful of managers who are intensely loyal to one another. Their main meeting place is in Lord Weinstock's open and informal office. The door to the adjoining office is always open. The occupant, Mr Bates, can often be heard bellowing criticism and encouragement to other executives. His voice echoes through Lord Weinstock's room as a succession of visitors pass through for conversation around the managing director's desk. Messengers will come and go from the outside world. Lord Prior will pop in to say he is off to see Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary; senior executives of foreign electronics groups may come through on the telephone loudspeaker; Mr Newlands and Mrs Morrison are often in attendance. The room is more like a parlour than an office. One member of the team describes how they work: 'An idea will come up over lunch or in discussion, it might come from an outsider, it may come from inside. Everyone will discuss it, not formally but we will all gather perhaps several times to go over it. Then one person will take the responsibility of writing a paper and we will have more informal discussions before making a final decision.' Outsiders, even other senior executives and directors of the company, have walk-on parts. Their advice might be requested. But they play no role in taking the decision. That is how the management would like to choose Lord Weinstock's successor. It would make sure that, through Lord Prior, institutional investors and non-executive directors were kept abreast of their thinking. Having drawn up a plan the management would put it to the board. So the final decision would be the board's but the initiative would have come from the management. This is how GEC normally works. But the succession is different. The board and the non-executive directors in particular believe they have the responsibility of making this decision. Having languished on the margins at GEC for decades, the directors could suddenly be thrust into a position of unprecedented power over an issue vital to the company's future. Traditionally, the chairman's role at GEC has been largely honorific. According to one board member, not one of those critical of Lord Weinstock: 'GEC has traditionally treated its chairmen very badly indeed. It has taken the management a long time to accept that the chairman has a real role.' Lord Prior says it has taken him some time to develop a good working relationship with the management. Even now he describes the job in equivocal terms. 'I am not a non-executive chairman but I am not executive either,' he says. 'I am more and more doing the job that most full-time chairmen do. It has taken a number of years for Arnold and myself to develop a relationship which works, but it now works very well and it has great significance for the company.' It is extremely rare for Lord Prior to delve into the company's inner workings, but management accepts that Lord Prior must play a pivotal role in deciding the succession, acting as liaison between the management, shareholders and the board. The GEC board gathers only four times a year. Meetings, which on average last only about 90 minutes, bring together the Stanhope Gate group and an eclectic mix of 12 non-executives which includes Lord Rees-Mogg, former editor of The Times, and Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz. The non-executives are neither a cohesive nor powerful group. They have only just started meeting together for dinner the night before board meetings. One disgruntled executive director describes the meetings: 'Everything is as clean as a whistle. Apart from the legal documents, there are no papers circulated in advance, other than a single line on the financial performance of each of the subsidiaries. 'After the formal legal business has been dealt with, Lord Weinstock goes through the quarterly results of each of the operating companies. Some people might challenge him on details, but they simply do not know enough about the companies to get very far. After that it is any other business.' A small group of directors - no more than four - believes the time has come to assert itself over the choice of Lord Weinstock's successor. This group will not publicly criticise Lord Weinstock's management style. But in private its members make no bones about their unhappiness. They allege the Stanhope Gate group will perpetuate its own power if the decision is left with it. They accuse the current management of holding GEC back through excessive caution and short-term thinking, restraining its potential to grow outside its traditional markets. A non-executive director, well informed about the way GEC works, comments: 'A subcommittee of the chairman and the non-executives should be set up in the next six months charged with the task of finding a successor, including an executive search of outsiders. We should look for someone who can inject new drive into the company, to push it into new markets.' The critics claim there would be a haemorrhage of management from the operating units if Mr Simon Weinstock got the top job. They say it would send a signal that family comes before merit at the top of the group. Those criticisms provoke an equally forceful response from Lord Weinstock and his team. They argue the non-executives know virtually nothing about the company and so could not be in a position to choose a successor on their own. Any attempt by the non-executives to set off on a trawl of talent from outside would spark outright conflict between management and board. Indeed the Weinstocks might even threaten to sell their shareholdings in GEC - more than 39m shares, about 1.4 per cent of the group and more than the entire holdings of the GEC employee savings share scheme - to display their displeasure. As one senior executive explains: 'We want to do this through consensus . . . there is no question of a putsch at GEC.' That last judgment is almost certainly correct. Although the critics claim a secret ballot of the board would deliver a slim majority in favour of change, in reality they are a powerless, underground minority. The dissidents, however, are not the only problem the executives may have to deal with. The centrists, backed by GEC's institutional shareholders, could well exert a powerful influence. This group recognises the strength of the case for continuity and acknowledges the current management team's considerable achievements. GEC has been steered clear of many of the financial and technological black holes which have claimed its peers and competitors. It is financially as sound as a bell. On top of this, the centrists recognise that if an outsider were given the power that Lord Weinstock has enjoyed, GEC might be ruined by ill-fated ventures into consumer businesses the company knows little about. However, they also believe continuity needs to be combined with change. As far as the company's strategy is concerned, that means investing the profits from GEC's joint venture with Alsthom to exploit the potential of Marconi's vast wealth of technology. From the point of view of the succession, it means combining a managing director from inside the company with a strong chairman from outside. The key figure in the centrist camp will be Mr Ron Artus, the former group chief investment manager at the Prudential, which remains GEC's biggest shareholder with 7 per cent of the equity. If the Weinstock team can afford to alienate the dissidents, it cannot afford to alienate Mr Artus, who has an analytical mind and an independent spirit  - and a seat on the Prudential board. His appointment as a non-executive was Lord Weinstock's idea. As a member of the Stanhope Gate group put it: 'Artus did not arrive from heaven. He was brought in as an independent figure, to make sure the City would see the succession was being handled properly.' Central to the succession will be whether Lord Prior, Lord Weinstock and Mr Artus can agree a plan. In this Mr Artus will not be a soft touch. He has just completed an international tour to assess the group's strengths and weaknesses. Separately the Prudential has recently completed an exhaustive six-month study of GEC's prospects. The centrists believe some quite far-reaching changes are needed in the way GEC operates. As a leading centrist on the board puts it: 'At the moment GEC looks as if it is becoming a defence electronics business with a few niche industrial businesses tacked on the end. That is fine but it is not a major electronics group, which is what GEC should be, playing in major markets. You do get the impression that there is potential which could be made more of without risking the financial safety which GEC is famous for.' The centrists hold two positions which could lead them into direct conflict with Lord Weinstock. First they insist there is no question of Mr Simon Weinstock succeeding his father. It is understood that GEC's main institutional shareholders have made it clear that although they view the younger Weinstock as a skilled and hardworking member of the management team, they would oppose his appointment because they feel that, in a public company, a father should not be succeeded by his son. They would prefer Mr Newlands as sole chief executive. Second, the centrists rule out the possibility of Lord Weinstock becoming chairman, for it is here the institutions see the opportunity for change. Lord Prior is 63. If he were to retire soon, that would create the space to bring in a chairman who would play a more assertive role in deciding the company's strategy. He would be charged with building an executive team to report to to a stronger board, with more executive directors from the GEC divisions, outside Stanhope Gate. The institutions' favourite candidate is Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Courtaulds and Reuters. A top executive with one of the largest institutional investors sums up their approach: 'There is no need for dramatic upheaval. We certainly do not want to bring in a big deal maker who would mis-spend GEC's money. 'We want a chairman who is good at strategy and building a management team at board level, combined with an operating officer from within the company. The question should be settled through consensus with Lord Prior consulting non-executives, shareholders and the management. If they could organise that kind of orderly succession GEC shares would rise quite sharply.' So it seems increasingly likely that Lord Weinstock will be faced with a painful choice. He is used to wielding almost absolute power - but on this he is likely to have to compromise with outsiders. To secure continuity and stability at the top of the company, he will have to satisfy the centrists. To do that he is likely to have to pay a price, forgoing his own ambitions to become joint chairman and accepting that an outsider should be brought in armed with a mandate for change.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Arms: How To </F> Survive"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The General Commissariat to the Plan proposes  various scenarios and solutions.    The industrial strategy group chaired by the ONERA [National  Office for Aerospace Studies and Research] president, government  general inspector Marcel Benichou, handed over its report, "The  Future of Industry-Related Industries," prepared at the request  of the General Commissariat to the Plan. For one year, some 60  professionals of all kinds (government officials, manufacturers,  union members, etc.) worked in groups on seven different themes.  They thus worked out various strategic choices designed to adapt  the French defense industry, which has already lost 25 percent  of its personnel, to the geostrategic new deal. These choices  should also enable it to go through the crisis without excessive  damage.    In the 244-page report, the group recalled the assets of the  industry: the human potential represented by 230,000 direct jobs  (plus 100,000 indirect jobs), a technological base, and first  rate material resources. Its survival, they wrote, will require  restructuring companies, making them powerful and able to  export, and "mastering access to European markets." The latter  will involve integrating the defense branch (which is not  covered by the Rome Treaty) into the European Market, and  adopting pragmatic rules for community exchanges together with a  policy of reciprocity toward U.S. protectionism, rather than  generalized "European preference." To ensure the survival of  French defense industries, Marcel Benichou's group recommended  adapting them along five lines:        -  Restructuring the industrial plant to make it fit the  demand; the balance thus achieved might be as much as one-third  lower than it was in the eighties, depending on the scenario  considered: that would mean losing from 59,000 to 131,000 jobs  (see table page 7 [not reproduced]). However, Marcel Benichou  believes that prime contractors must retain their full design  and engineering capacities in the subsectors preserved and still  provide adequate workloads to their subcontractors, while  subcontractors have to diversify into non-defense industries.  Finally, the report recommends the creation of an  interministerial fund to help small to mid-size companies and  industries survive.    -  Accelerating the search for a new cooperation framework while  eliminating the perverse effects of cooperation, such as  administrative red tape and the law of "just return."  Cooperation agreements should evolve toward capitalistic groups  (the economic interest group setup is no longer adequate) and  the integration of technological, industrial, and marketing  resources into competitive groups. In addition, the creation of  a European Arms Agency will make it possible to organize  research, exploratory developments, testing centers, and  programs on a European scale.    -  Rationalizing budget expenditures: for governments, this will  mean adopting longer-term military programming laws and adhering  to them more closely (even if they have to be revised halfway  through); respecting program implementation schedules by  avoiding costly delays and the simultaneous launching of many  programs; and revising the bylaws of nationalized companies (or  arsenals), which hinder management flexibility and marketing  dynamism.    -  Technological adaptation: it will have to include increased  consultation between civil and military departments and  manufacturers, through technological groups set up to prepare  sectorial plans and an advisory committee in charge of  summarizing these plans. The report also identifies 24  technological sectors of critical importance for the future.  Eight of these are top priorities and require full independence  at French level: the nuclear sector, structural materials  (including composites) and their implementation processes,  micro- and nano-electronic components, propulsion systems,  navigation equipment, signal detection and processing, mastery  of signature and stealth-related technologies, and mastery of  complex systems. Another ten are intermediate priorities and  could be shared with WEU [Western European Union] countries, and  the last six are lesser priorities and could be shared with  non-WEU countries.    -  Improved marketing: this will require faster government  decision-making and greater use of military resources for  promotional purposes. Manufacturers should improve after-sales  service by making greater use of government networks abroad.  Finally, the report recommends the creation (by the government  or by the industry) of a body responsible for training future  industry or government agents.

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Unions in Swans sale initiative UNION LEADERS at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, wrote yesterday to eight companies they believe may be interested in buying the yard, pledging the workforce's commitment to its survival and prosperity. The letter from the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions emphasises its desire to retain shipbuilding on the Tyne and stresses that Swans' workforce has been 'in the vanguard of industrial relations change', embracing flexibility in working practices. The initiative reflects union concern at mounting job losses and continuing uncertainty about the yard's future after two months in receivership. Mr Eddie Darke of the Life for Swans campaign said: 'We've been very patient for two months. We decided we had to be a bit more pro-active.' The unions, he said, also wanted to discourage anybody who did not want to continue shipbuilding at Swans. Receivers Price Waterhouse are unhappy about the timing of the letter amid delicate negotiations with four prospective buyers. PW confirmed yesterday that no bid had yet been received. The recipients of the letter are AMEC, which owns large offshore fabrication facilities on the Tyne; German-based shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan; British Aerospace; GEC, owner of the Clyde warship builder Yarrow; Norwegian-owned Kvaerner, owner of the Govan yard on the Clyde; Rolls Royce; Southampton-based shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft; and VSEL, the submarine builder based at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Unions believe the eight have been in touch with PW since Swans went into receivership. Yesterday Rolls Royce and British Aerospace strongly denied any interest in buying Swan Hunter, and Mr Martin Jay, managing director of Vosper Thornycroft, said his company had spare capacity at its Southampton and Portsmouth yards. Mr Diderik Schnitler, executive vice-president of Kvaerner, indicated that his company, one of the world's largest shipbuilders, would be unlikely to bid. Amec, GEC and VSEL all refused to comment. Mr Friedrich Hennemann, chief executive of Bremer Vulkan, said in a BBC television interview his company might be interested.</p>

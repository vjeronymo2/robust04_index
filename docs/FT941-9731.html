			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going out to dinner / Paris Gone are the days when a fashionable dinner in Paris meant making a three-star reservation six weeks in advance at a cathedral of haute cuisine and praying that your slinky Azzedine Alaia number could cope with the calorific challenge of six or seven courses. Times have changed. Parisians have not actually gone grungey, but life is much more casual than it used to be. These days the chicest places to eat are the guinguettes, the quaint old 1940s music halls along the banks of the River Seine, or at little village bistros on the fringes of the city, preferably one where you are on first name terms with the patron. The clothes are different too. Alaia is out. Anne Demeulemeester, with her elegant black velvet tunics, is in for younger Parisiennes as is Rei Kawakubo, of Comme des Garcons, for her exquisite brocade dresses, and Helmut Lang with his purist trouser suits. Even the older generation is eschewing the showy styles of the 1980s for a more subdued 1990s look. Prada's understated suits have supplanted Chanel as the uniform for less formal dinners and antique couture gowns are being dusted down for grander events. Dress codes for men are almost always less strict in Paris than in London. Black tie is reserved for the most formal occasions. Men of all ages can wear virtually what they want even to the most expensive restaurants, although they must always be immaculate. Younger men tend to favour soft, unstructured suits. Waistcoats are back this season, although the trademark for the truly fashionable Parisien is to wear his shirt flapping outside his trousers - and still to look smart.</p>

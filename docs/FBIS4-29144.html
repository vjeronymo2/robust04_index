			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- North Korea's Minister of  People's Armed Forces O Chin-u said North Korea will never again  permit inspections of its nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a speech carried  Wednesday by Radio Pyongyang.    In a broadcast monitored in Tokyo by the SHIN-A NEWS AGENCY,  O said North Korea took the "defensive measure of pulling out of  the IAEA and will never again permit inspections" because of the  agency's "arrogant and insolent" demands for nuclear checks.    The broadcast comes as IAEA officials are pointing out that  despite North Korea's announcement Monday that it was pulling  out of the agency, it is still subject to nuclear inspections by  the IAEA under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    O's speech was made at a welcome reception for a Vietnamese  military delegation visiting Pyongyang, led by Defense Minister  Gen. Doan Khue, SHIN-A reported.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR HOMELESS APPROVED  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council unanimously approved a five-year housing plan Tuesday  that officially recommends providing transitional housing for the homeless.  </P> <P> The housing plan is a mandatory five-year update to the housing provisions of  the city's General Plan. The update's deadline is Saturday.  </P> <P> Although three council members oppose spending city funds on projects aimed at  helping the homeless, they said they voted for the plan because a 1987 state  law requires cities to address homeless problems in their general plans.  </P> <P> "It's either vote for the plan or go to jail," Councilman Larry Zarian joked in  explaining his vote during the council meeting.  </P></p>

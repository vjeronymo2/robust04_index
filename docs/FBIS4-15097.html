The sides also discussed how to settle the conflict in  former  Yugoslavia and the participation of Russia and the United States  in peace efforts.    Congressmen expressed satisfaction with rates of economic  reforms in Russia. For instance, Republican minority leader  Robert Michael said that he plans to make a statement, after his  return to the U.S., on the need for more active participation of  U.S. businessmen in Russian investment projects.

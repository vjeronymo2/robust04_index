			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> PORTERHOUSE BLUE  </P> <P> by Tom Sharpe  </P> <P> (Atlantic Monthly Press: $8.95)  </P> <P>  Porterhouse, a venerable Cambridge college, is on the brink of disaster. On  this point all the quirky British characters that populate this novel agree,  though the reasons for impending doom are variously construed. A new Master has  been appointed -- Sir Godber Evans -- who intends to effect change in the  college; in his view, the ossified system that values the quality of the  kitchen and the cultivation of rowing skills over academic achievement is  outmoded. His plans, however, are strenuously opposed by the established  hierarchy of the school. "We have our faults I daresay but they are not ones I  would wish to see Sir Godber Evans remedy," says the most conciliatory among  the conservatives. The ensuing political battle is waged on such arcane  battlegrounds as High Table and College Council and elicits such sage counsel  as: "An appearance of open-mindedness has in my experience a tendency to disarm  the radical left. They seem to feel the need to reciprocate."  </P> <P> Tom Sharpe masters a staggering range of comedic effect, from the bawdy to the  sublime. In an exchange fit for vaudeville, a student seeking advice on a  sexual obsession finds himself compelled to describe his problems to the deaf  chaplain through a megaphone. "Porterhouse Blue" has been filmed as a PBS  miniseries.  </P> <P> LETTERS TO OLGA  </P> <P> by Vaclav Havel  </P> <P> translated by Paul Wilson  </P> <P> (Henry Holt: $16.95)  </P> <P>  Vaclav Havel, Czech playwright and leading member of the human rights group  Charter 77, was arrested in Prague during demonstrations in January and  sentenced to six months in prison -- his third prison term since the 1968  invasion of his country by the Soviet Union. This volume is a collection of the  letters he wrote to his wife from prison between June, 1979, and September,  1982. "Not only were (these letters) my only means of communication with the  outside world," he writes, "they were my only opportunity for some kind of  creative expression. I was not allowed to write anything else." As the prison  authorities forbade letters discussing anything but family matters, Havel  developed an encoded style, which allowed him to "smuggle more and more general  comments into the letters." Often, however, his meditative observations of  simple activities -- passages that could easily pass the censors -- are the  most revealing, poetic and affecting. He revels, for instance, in the pleasure  of drinking tea: "I have become a fanatical devotee of Earl Grey, which the  English tea lover scorns as a perfumed, old-maidish drink. . . . Tea, it seems  to me, becomes a kind of material symbol of freedom here. When and how I make  it is entirely up to me. Tea as a sign of private relaxation . . . is a  substitute for the world of wine rooms, parties, binges . . . something you  choose yourself and in which you realize your freedom in social terms."  </P> <P> BANANA DIPLOMACY  </P> <P> The Making of American  </P> <P> Policy in Nicaragua 1981-1987  </P> <P> by Roy Gutman  </P> <P> (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster: $9.95)  </P> <P>  The author, national security correspondent for Newsday, explains that when  Ronald Reagan became President in 1981, there were in place no American  policies hostile to Nicaragua. Although the United States had supported the  Somoza regime, the economic and social ties between the two countries remained  intact even after the 1979 Sandinista revolution. The Reagan Administration's  campaign against the Sandinistas therefore had to be made up from scratch.  Formed without any specific strategy, the blanket anti-Communist mandate  resulted in what might be called a Keystone Kops style of foreign affairs  management. Reviewer Peter Davis characterized "Banana Diplomacy" as  "fascinating and complex, resembling more closely the court intrigues around  Louis XIV than the conventional policy development of an American presidency."  </P> <P> FALL OUT OF HEAVEN  </P> <P> An Autobiographical Journey  </P> <P> Across Russia  </P> <P> by Alan Cheuse  </P> <P> (Atlantic Monthly Press: $7.95)  </P> <P>  In 1986, novelist and NPR commentator Alan Cheuse traveled across the Soviet  Union with his son on a sort of pilgrimage, seeking out the places his father,  Philip Kaplan, had known. The story of this voyage is braided with tales of  Kaplan's romantic and adventuresome youth (he was in the Red Army Air Force),  told in the first person. The third interwoven strand is the author's  recollections of a difficult father-son relationship in Kaplan's  far-from-heroic later life as an immigrant auto worker. Jonathan Kirsch's  review called "Fall Out of Heaven" "a celebration of the belated intimacy of  father and son which is achieved, tragically but also triumphantly, only after  death."  </P> <P> SPIRIT SEIZURES  </P> <P> by Melissa Pritchard  </P> <P> (Collier/Macmillan: $8.95)  </P> <P>  Winner of the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction and the Carl Sandburg  Literary Arts Award, "Spirit Seizures" contains short stories with a cast of  broken, thwarted, despairing characters. Melissa Pritchard writes an unbalanced  style, often lurching from first person to third within a story, and takes a  merciless distance on her subjects, who observe each other closely but without  connection or concern for each other. In "A Man Around the House," a woman  confined to a wheelchair recalls the man who lodged for a few days at their  house: "His handwriting made me queasy. No man worth his salt writes with such  fat female letters." Later, when the suspicious character murders her sister  and robs them, she muses detachedly: "I hope she had some happiness before he  killed her anyway."  </P></p>

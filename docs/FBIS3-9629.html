			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonia Vymazalova: "Revision in a Week; The </F> Government Discussed Filling Posts of State Secretaries"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--Yesterday the Slovak Government  held its third meeting with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik in the  chair. [passage omitted]    The government discussed and approved a draft amendment to  the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] law on the  organization of ministries and other central bodies of state  administration of the Slovak Republic. As Deputy Prime Minister  Ivan Simko told a news conference after the government meeting,  the law addresses the issue of ending the provisional  arrangement and legal vacuum that arose after the establishment  of the independent Slovak Republic. The government will submit  the draft amendment to the current meeting of parliament. Under  the amendment, the government can determine in justified cases  that two state secretaries will operate at a ministry. The  minister will determine in which order they will stand in for  him. The Government Office of the Slovak Republic is being  deleted from the system of other central bodies of state  administration [under the amendment] because it will only  fulfill tasks for the government's needs. The Labor Safety  Office of the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, is being added  to the central bodies of state administration. The government  yesterday appointed Jan Filko, LL.D., to head the Government  Office. Until now, Filko has been deputy chairman of the Slovak  Government's Legislative Council. [passage omitted]    The government took note of a report on basic trends in the  development of the national economy of the Slovak Republic in  1993 and their forecast for the first half of 1994. The report  notes that state budget expenditures went up as a result of the  establishment of the new state and in connection with  safeguarding its operation. The higher expenditures have been  reflected in an increase of the budget deficit to 23 billion  Slovak korunas [Sk] [in 1993]. It is expected that, in the  first half of 1994, a trend of recovery will start making itself  felt in the material-production branches. The volume of gross  domestic product in steady prices is therefore expected to drop  by only 0.6 percent. The rate of unemployment will increase to  16.5 percent, which means 420,000 registered unemployed. The  rate of inflation will reach 17.4 percent, and average monthly  wages will go up to Sk5,700, which would be a 15.2-percent  increase over the first half of 1993 but a 1.9-percent decline  in real terms. [passage omitted]    Yesterday the government appointed Pavol Nunuk, LL.D., to  the  post of chief border commissioner of the Slovak Republic and  Colonel Miroslav Hyres, LL.D., and Colonel Mikulas Salak, LL.D.,  to the posts of deputy chief border commissioners of the Slovak  Republic. Furthermore, it approved the following proposals for  the appointment as state secretaries: Ministry of  Justice--Sergej Kohut, LL.D.; Ministry of Culture--Marina  Jurickova, M.A.; Ministry of Environment--Lubomira Zimanova,  LL.D.; Ministry for the Administration and Privatization of  National Property--Gabriel Palacka, doctor of natural sciences;  and Ministry of Agriculture--Engineer Stefan Palacka. It also  approved proposals for the appointment of heads of ministerial  offices: Ministry of Defense--Colonel of the General Staff  Engineer Rudolf Zidek; Ministry of Transportation,  Communications, and Public Works--Engineer Peter Klucka;  Ministry of Economy--Engineer Jaroslav Kubecka; Ministry of  Environment--Engineer Magdalena Vodzinska; and Ministry of  Agriculture--Engineer Jan Straka. The government approved the  proposal to appoint Marian Jusko vice governor of the Slovak  National Bank. It will submit this proposal to the NRSR  chairman for further constitutional discussion.    Yesterday's news conference was moderated by Lubomir  Lintner,  who has been newly appointed as director of the Slovak  Government Office's Press and Information Department.</p>

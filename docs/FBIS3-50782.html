			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (AFP) -- A government program  that includes land distribution, equality toward women, urban  [urbana] reforms, and workers improvements was made public today  by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) in the first  edition of this group's publication "EL DESPERTADOR MEXICANO"  which was forwarded to AFP offices in Mexico City.    In a 20-page item entitled "Living for the Country or Dying  for Freedom," the guerrillas, who have been clashing with the  Army in the southern State of Chiapas for the past six days,  announced that "we have started the armed struggle" in order to  accomplish "jobs, land, housing, food, health, education,  independence, liberty, democracy, justice, and peace."    The bulletin also repeats the demands they announced on 1  January when they launched their military activities, and  guidelines are relayed "to EZLN leaders and officers." These  guidelines include a "war tax bill" which will be levied "on all  business establishments and property owners" in the regions  where they operate.    The publication describes the regulations that will be  implemented in the communities they "liberate" and includes the  democratic election of authorities, prices and salary control,  release of all prisoners -- excluding those charged with murder,  rape, and drug trafficking -- the protection of abandoned  children and senior citizens, and foreign companies will now  have to pay their workers the same salary paid in their  respective countries of origin.    The two-colored publication displays excellent type quality  and carries at its top a photograph of Emiliano Zapata, the  revolutionary leader who was one of the leaders who unleashed  the 1910 Mexican Revolution. The publication also exhibits the  photographs of some Zapatist members during training sessions in  jungle regions.    "The people struggling against the oppressor government and  the great national and foreign exploiters" will be entitled to  bear arms for their defense and by obligation "respond to the  call for help made by those authorities democratically elected,"  the EZLN announces in its publication. The Zapatists also  propose that all public officials will be subject to audits  aimed at detecting embezzlements, peasants' debts will not be  recognized, and private property hoarding and production means  [as received] will not be allowed.    The publication establishes the EZLN general headquarters in  the Lacandona jungle region where clashes are currently taking  place. Lacandona is located in the southern State of Chiapas  bordering Guatemala.</p>

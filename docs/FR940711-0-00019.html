			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 15, 1989, [54 FR 6866], the program was again revised to allow handlers credit against their creditable assessment obligations for payments for in-store supermarket generic or brand advertising using fixed position (i.e. stationary) display advertisements, or video media. In addition, the provisions were further expanded to allow handlers to receive a 150% credit for payments to the Board for the Board's generic advertising and promotion program. These changes gave handlers additional flexibility in meeting their assessment obligations and particularly benefited small handlers which did not have brand names and/or did not market their almonds in retail outlets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 16, 1990, [55 FR 41826], the program was further revised to provide handlers with additional opportunities to receive credit against their creditable assessment obligations for their own branded or generic advertising and promotional activities by (1) allowing credit for in-store supermarket advertisements using light emitting diode (LED) signs (a new form of in-store supermarket advertising which was being offered by advertising firms at that time); (2) expanding the provisions under which handlers could receive credit for in-store supermarket advertisements using fixed position media; (3) allowing handlers credit for brand advertisements in all foreign countries where California almonds were sold; and (4) increasing credit for certain mail order promotion costs. These revisions were intended to better reflect current industry practices as they related to advertising and promotion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the years, other revisions to the program have been adopted in order to expand activities eligible for credit, improve program administration and generally bring the program into line with industry practices. These numerous revisions to the program demonstrate the Board's, as well as the industry's, recognition of changing conditions within the market and their willingness and ability to adapt the almond advertising and promotional program to address these changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> The Ninth Circuit's Review of the Former Creditable Advertising Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reviewed the Almond Marketing Order's former creditable advertising and promotion program in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cal-Almond  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  U.S. Department of Agriculture. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The case was brought by three independent almond handlers, each of which challenged the constitutionality of the Almond Marketing Order's former creditable advertising program on the grounds that the mandatory nature of the program violated their First Amendment rights. The Department's Judicial Officer upheld the validity of the Order. The handlers sought review in the United States District Court, which affirmed the Secretary's decision. The handlers then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the District Court's decision, the Court of Appeals held that the former advertising and promotion program imposed a burden on almond handlers' First Amendment rights, and, therefore, it was necessary to evaluate the nature and scope of the burden imposed on those rights to determine whether the program was constitutional. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ninth Circuit evaluated the constitutionality of the former almond advertising and promotion program under a three-pronged test: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is the governmental interest in establishing and carrying out an advertising and promotion program substantial? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Does the program directly advance that interest? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is the program no more extensive than necessary to achieve the government's purpose? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In evaluating the almond program under this test, the Court held that there was in fact a substantial governmental interest in establishing a program that would stimulate the demand for almonds and help maintain and expand markets so as to enhance returns to almond growers. The Court went on to find, however, that there was insufficient record evidence to establish that the former almond advertising and promotion program was effective enough to directly advance the government's interest in increasing almond sales, and that the rules providing for credit against a handler's assessment obligation for its own advertising were more extensive and cumbersome than necessary. Thus, it held that the advertising regulations were an unconstitutional restriction on the handlers' First Amendment rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Equity Issues: Danish Dollars 500m issue offers another test for unsettled fixed-rate dollar sector THE latest test of the unsettled fixed-rate USDollars sector of the international bond market is expected as early as today, as Denmark steps in to borrow Dollars 500m. After the difficulty with which the market has digested large dollar issues from Spain and Ontario in the past fortnight, the reception accorded Denmark's issue of five-year bonds could provide an important pointer for what other borrowers can expect in the weeks ahead. Late yesterday, bankers in London said that the Denmark issue had been aggressively bid for, with the mandate likely to be awarded to a bank which quoted a spread of close to 30 basis points over US Treasuries, compared with the 55 basis points paid by Spain for its seven-year issue. The Danish deal has exposed widely different opinions among bankers about the current state of the market, with bids reported to have ranged from under 30 basis points to over 45. The pessimists claim that Italy's decision to apply a 12 1/2 per cent withholding tax to repurchase agreements (or repos) involving bonds issued by supranational agencies such as the World Bank will have a big long-term impact on bond prices. According to one banker in London, some Dollars 20bn to Dollars 30bn of bonds is currently tied up in such repos. As these repos mature over the coming 12 months, Italian banks may try to dispose of many of the bonds, pushing yields up which will have an effect on the spreads on other issues. Optimists, on the other hand, point to Spain's problems as merely the result of bad timing, rather than any substantial increase in yield spreads in recent days. 'It is difficult to see a consistent move of more than about 5 basis points for the quality issuers,' one banker said yesterday. 'There's a readjustment going on, but it's not a bloodbath.' Meanwhile, the flow of collared floating rate notes continued yesterday with some signs of more generous pricing in the wake of the aggressive batch of deals from top-rated borrowers last week.</p>

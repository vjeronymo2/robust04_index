			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: French maritime affairs minister to hold meeting with fishing association Mr Charles Josselin, the French maritime affairs minister, will today hold a meeting with the French fishing association in Rennes to discuss the European Commission's proposals for a minimum fish pricing system, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The news of the meeting followed renewed demonstrations from fishermen in the Brittany and Vendee. The fishermen who have, for the past fortnight, been protesting against the recent rise in cheap fish imports into France culminating in the ransacking on Tuesday of the Rungis fish market near Paris. A group of 400 Breton fishermen yesterday staged a demonstration in Brussels outside the building where European Community fishing officials were discussing the minimum pricing plan. The fishermen sheltered from a light snowfall in nearby cafes during the meeting. There were rowdy demonstrations throughout the day at Sables d'Olonne, the Vendee port. Local fishermen sealed off the commercial docks with a boat blockade during the morning and protested outside local authority buildings in the afternoon. Another group of Vendee fishermen sealed off the Loire estuary by Saint-Nazaire bridge and built blockades of burning tyres to block off road access to the bridge. Meanwhile the trawlermen, who had on Wednesday blockaded a military testing area in Les Landes, ended their protest yesterday afternoon.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Heated arguments over effects of drought - There is controversy about how imminent irrigation restrictions should be applied / Farmer's Viewpoint THERE is no dispute that there is a drought in the south and east of England. But the row between the National Rivers Authority (NRA) and farmers who irrigate crops about the best way to use and conserve limited supplies is becoming increasingly acrimonious. The south-east has always been the breadbasket of England, growing cereals for that most basic human food and, of course, for feeding livestock. It has also, because of its proximity to the main centres of population, been the main producer of vegetables. During the last 10 to 15 years, however, with the development of sophisticated irrigation techniques, the importance of crops like early potatoes, carrots and fresh salad vegetables in general for sale in supermarkets has increased dramatically and with it the profitability of the light-land farms concerned. Without adequate irrigation such enterprises would quickly collapse. Experience suggests that yields would probably be halved and quality would deteriorate to the point of unsaleability. Today's consumers have come to expect evenly grown, smooth-skinned, clean vegetables free of scabs and spots, which can only be grown with optimum moisture. Neither the supermarkets nor their customers would willingly accept anything less, and farmers are fearful that buyers would seek alternatives from overseas suppliers. The NRA, however, has stated that because of the shortage of water caused by 33 months of drought - one of the longest dry periods this century - it might be forced to restrict crop irrigation to six hours a day in some areas and perhaps ban it altogether in others. Back in January it was warning of problems ahead. Even then the cumulative deficit since August 1988 was equivalent to about 12 inches of rain. The NRA said at the beginning of the year that to avoid restrictions we needed that kind of quantity of rain by the end of April. But average rainfall over most of the area has been only about five inches. It is now almost inevitable, therefore, that some sort of restriction on irrigation will soon be imposed by the NRA on all farmers licensed to abstract from ground water-supplies via bores, or from surface water, such as rivers. Farmers with their own reservoirs in which they have stored water collected during the winter are unlikely to be affected. For the majority who do not have storage facilities, however, it is the type of restriction proposed which is disputed. The NRA claims it has consulted farmers' representatives, the Ministry of Agriculture and others and that the consensus was to limit irrigation to the hours between six am to noon each day. Most of the irrigating farmers, on the other hand, point out that this would be inefficient because much of the water would evaporate during the heat of summer days. They would rather, they say, be permitted to use an agreed percentage of their entitlement when they believed it would do their crops most good, or as a second choice to irrigate at night, when crops would derive maximum benefit from the water applied. The NRA replies that nighttime irrigation cannot be policed, and that it could be dangerous. By this, they mean that, if unattended, mobile irrigation guns might collide with electricity wires and the like. The farmers say they feel insulted by the NRA's implication that they are dishonest or irresponsible or both. Then things get even nastier. The farmers say the NRA is unjustified in claiming that aquifers, that is, the deep limestone rocks which hold the water, are much lower than they really are. Their own records, they claim, show little difference in bore water levels from previous years, in spite of the drought. They also accuse the NRA of wasting water, and of transferring supplies from this driest area of the country to wash cars in other areas and to top up rivers and wet-lands for conservation reasons while seeking to penalise the production of food. The farmers say the NRA's priorities are domestic consumers first, industry second, conservation third, and food and farming at the bottom of the list. The NRA denies that it has any list of priorities, although it does concede that water wastage because of leaky pipes could be between 10 per cent and 40 per cent of supplies. It points out, however, that it has no power to control the water used by domestic consumers because this is now the responsibility of the water supply companies. Last week two of the region's highest-powered MPs got involved in the row. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the House of Commons and MP for South Norfolk, and Mrs Gillian Shepherd, Minister of State at the Treasury and MP for South West Norfolk apparently persuaded the NRA to review its policy towards irrigation. They are scheduled to meet Mr John Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture, for further discussions on the matter this week. Clearly they recognise the threat to the livelihoods of many of their voters  -not just the farmers, but also the thousands who work in processing plants, pre-packing vegetables for the supermarkets. Meanwhile, the drought continues. Soil moisture deficits - that is, the amount of moisture in that part of the soil to which crop roots can penetrate compared to what they require for optimum growth - are already high and increasing. According to the Agromet Unit run by the Ministry of Agriculture at Wolverhampton deficits for crops of grass, for instance, exceeded 25 mm last week across most of the southern two-thirds of England for the second year running. Last week the irrigation advice service run by Norsk Hydro, the fertiliser company, was warning that autumn-sown crops of cereals on some of East Anglia's lightest land would need irrigating within a few days if there was not substantial rain. It should be noted that the irrigation of cereals even in June is normally a rather dubious economic exercise, but in late April or early May it is almost unheard of. It is, of course, still possible that adequate rainfall during the next few crucial weeks will provide farm crops on heavier, more moisture-retentive soils with what they need. But although weather forecasters expect significant rainfall in the west this week, they see little prospect in much reaching the parched east. Irrigating and non-irrigating farmers are becoming increasingly concerned. That concern was exacerbated last week by Prof Keith Clayton of the University of East Anglia's Department of Environmental Sciences. He predicted that, even given rainfall up to average, increasing usage of water by households, industry and agriculture would mean East Anglia would be forced to import supplies from Wales by the year 2000. It appears that this water-shortage story will run and run.</p>

Commenting on recent remarks by Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who has showed a flexible stance  toward major revisions of the political reform bills, Ichikawa  said: "Different approaches could be possible if the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] is ready to accept our concessions  without boycotting Diet deliberations. Under the present  circumstance, it is difficult for coalition parties to allow  further concessions on the main points of the bills."    It is believed that Ichikawa's remarks were made in view of  opinions among Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] members.  The quota for single-seat constituencies was already increased  from 250 to 274 when the bills passed the lower house, and the  SDPJ would certainly oppose a further increase.    As an example of concessions, Hata proposed dividing a  nationwide constituency for the proportional representative  election into several regional blocs; however, Ichikawa noted:  "Not only the LDP, but also each party in the coalition would  have various opinions on the design of the regional constituency  blocs. If we set our hands on this issue, it would take at  least 40 days to reach an accord. I do not think it is a  realistic idea."</p>

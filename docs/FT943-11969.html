			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (4): Milestones on the road to free trade  -James Harding on the pace of progress in negotiations with the European Union Tunisia is negotiating a partnership agreement with the European Union aimed at establishing a free trade area. Although Tunisians relish the prestige of being acknowledged as an equal competitor and look forward to an increase in foreign investment, they qualify their enthusiasm with concern that reciprocal free access will present a stiff challenge to domestic producers while boosting European importers. Closer ties are the natural expression of EU-Tunisia trade - 79.8 per cent of Tunisian exports in 1993 went to Europe, up from 77.4 per cent in 1992, while European goods represented 71.6 per cent of Tunisian imports in 1993, slightly up from 71.1 per cent in 1992. However, both sides recognise the need to tread gently. One EU diplomat estimated that 'if we were to open the Tunisian market tomorrow, between 60 and 70 per cent of industry would close.' The 1976 co-operation agreement gave Tunisia free access to the European market, but allowed it to maintain high tariffs and quantitative restrictions protecting domestic industry. Despite protective measures, which have been scaled down in recent years, a European Commission report estimates that the Tunisian trade deficit with the EU grew from TD727.5m in 1989 to TD1,414.8m in 1993. European imports have grown in value from TD2,776.7m in 1989 to TD4,462.3m in 1993, outstripping Tunisian exports to Europe which were up from TD2,049.2m to TD3,047.5m in the same period. The Tunisian government makes two requests of its European partners to help it achieve the structural adjustment necessary to meet the conditions of full liberalisation. The first is time. Earlier this month, the two parties entered the third round of negotiations since March, but EU officials say they have yet to reach 'a level of detailed discussion'. Nevertheless, they intend to agree a text by the end of 1994 with a view to seeing its implementation in 1996. The establishment of a full free trade area with total dismantling of customs tariffs is not expected for 15 years. Yet observers expect even this timetable may slip. The second requirement is an increase in aid for a further structural adjustment programme. Since 1989, Tunisia has received Ecu743m, of which Ecu324m was in grants from the European Commission and Ecu419m in loans from the European Investment Bank. Because of fund constraints, EU officials recommend that spending shift from agriculture to investment in job creation and programmes to help industry meet European quality, environmental and technological requirements. More sensitive than the question of further EU grants is the future of the olive oil quota. Although the EU has renewed the quota for 1995-96, Tunisia is understood to be seeking an increase in the quantity guaranteed for purchase from 46,000 to 60,000 tonnes. As yet, EU officials say that no solution acceptable to both parties has been found. Despite these disagreements, Tunisia stands to make considerable gains from the partnership. The World Bank predicts significant medium-term benefits in the form of greater foreign direct investment and financial flows. In the long term, the elimination of outstanding customs barriers will lift the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy. The EU partnership agreement should encourage the removal of restrictions and liberalisation of tariffs. By the end of 1993, only 42 per cent of agricultural and manufacturing production was protected by quantitative restrictions compared with 72 per cent in 1991. Tunisian officials predict these will be eradicated by 1995, although the World Bank makes the more moderate estimate of a reduction to 25 per cent. Tariffs, too, are set to be dismantled, albeit using a mechanism which subsidises liberalisation by implementing an additional tariff at a 43 per cent rate for a limited period of three years. The Gatt council, in a report last month, congratulated Tunisia on its policy of unilateral liberalisation since the mid-1980s. However, it points out: 'Tunisia's trade policies still seem far from neutral.' Moreover, the country's comparative advantage in labour costs and proximity to Europe is being challenged by east European and Asian producers. The report notes: 'The lack of diversity in trade patterns adds to the vulnerability of the Tunisian economy to external factors, such as the current slowdown in European markets.' If Tunisian commerce is to succeed, it must go beyond Europe; 'the future of an outward-looking Tunisia extends beyond the frontiers of the Mediterranean into a wider multilateral world'. Ironically, nothing is more likely to enable Tunisia to compete in the global marketplace and release it from its dependence on Europe than the trade liberalisation that comes with an EU partnership agreement.</p>

The transformation is to be completed by the end of 1995, he  said.    Last year, the main thing was to stabilize the units which  remained on Czech territory after the split of Czechoslovakia,  and to work out a concept for the Army's transformation. Career  soldiers serving in the army underwent special tests and this  was followed by personnel changes, Nekvasil said. In 1993, the  twelve-month basic service was introduced and a different  concept of training, he added. All this caused the career  soldiers to feel socially insecure, Nekvasil noted.    The Defense Ministry and the General Staff were reorganized  last year, some military headquarters were abolished and some  newly established. Nekvasil said that 777 units have been  abolished since 1990. 126 units redeployed and 187 newly  established. Twenty-eight garrisons and 261 buildings were  transferred to civilian administration in 1990-93, another seven  garrisons are to follow this year, Nekvasil said. Moreover, the  Army now guards 378 buildings. Though it does not use them any  longer, they are watched by some 1,815 soldiers.    Important changes occurred in 1993 in the Army's staff.  6,594 people left the Army, 4,607 of whom were officers and 18  generals. In the same period, 1,821 people joined the Army, of  which 244 are officers, and 438 noncommissioned officers to  serve temporarily in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  peacekeeping forces.    In 1993, the Army was reduced by 12,923 soldiers to 90,405,  of which 32,113 are career soldiers, Nekvasil said.    The transformation is to continue in 1994. Among other  things, the Air Force is to be reduced, and a rapid deployment  team is to be created, Nekvasil said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Kolodin: "In a Civilized and Humane </F> Manner. This Is How Turkmenistan and Russia Are Resolving  Questions of Dual Citizenship and Migration"]    [Text] Turkmenistan -- When, during a one-day visit to  Ashgabat on the eve of the December meeting of Commonwealth  heads of state, Boris Yeltsin and Saparmurad Niyazov signed an  agreement on dual citizenship and regulation of the process of  migration, the majority of their CIS counterparts perceived this  event as unexpected and partly sensational. After all, the  attitude of the leaders of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, for  instance, toward the institution of dual citizenship is well  known. They consider it unsuitable for the countries and  peoples they head, one citing a possible decline of patriotism,  and the other classifying the... indigenous population as  Russian-speakers. Let me say straight away that a couple of  years ago even President S. Niyazov, to put it mildly, was not a  particularly ardent supporter of concluding a treaty on dual  citizenship with anybody. However, in making a decisive  contribution to the preparation and conclusion of the  agreements, creating for the first time in nearby foreign  countries a civilized legal basis for the status of Russians  permanently resident on Turkmenistan's territory, and having  advocated the states' responsibility as regards the fate of  migrants, the Turkmen leader has proved yet again that uppermost  in his mind is not personal ambition, but the interests of  actual people.    After all, the life and status of Slavs in Turkmenistan were  and remain perhaps by far the most propitious among the millions  of their compatriots who overnight became foreigners in their  own homes after the great power's collapse. One of the very  first laws adopted by the parliament of the now independent  state proclaimed that the incitement of interethnic strife and  the infringement of citizens' rights on the grounds of their  belonging to a different nation or religion is a crime of the  utmost severity. But, of course, this is not just a matter of  lawmaking: The main point is that, through the tangible actions  of the leadership in this difficult transition period, public  accord and calm were successfully preserved here, and the  honoring of social guarantees for all categories of citizens  without exception was ensured. The exceptionally good  relations, which have developed on the new basis of sovereignty  with greater Russia have played a far from insignificant role.    "Good relations are a remarkable thing," V. Cherepov, the  Russian Federation's ambassador in Turkmenistan, told me. "But  in proclaiming the aspiration to occupy a worthy place in the  ranks of civilized states, we must switch all problems to a  lawful channel. I agree that Russians here are somewhat better  off than even our compatriots in the majority of Russia's  regions. But nevertheless, just look at how many problems  emerge when a family breaks up. Here, a vast unified country has  collapsed, customs posts have been erected, national currencies  have been introduced, and today, at times, people do not even  get the chance to bury close relatives who have died in another,  now also independent, republic. Look at the burden of migrants.  Let me point out that the process of the migration of Russians  from Turkmenistan is not a new phenomenon -- it has been going  on since the 1970's. But whereas at that time migration could  be compared with a couple of small fires, nowadays it is more  like a universal catastrophe, the reasons for which do not need  to be spelled out to anybody, I think."    Every day, from early morning, a small crowd of people  gather  by the gates of the Russian Embassy. Similar things, no doubt,  can be seen at the Russian Federation missions in many other  former fraternal republics. The difference is that, although  Russians in the Baltic Region are asking for assistance to  regain civil rights and those in Dushanbe and Tbilisi are  begging for help to escape "to anywhere," here in Ashgabat  people are coming to find out when they will be able to apply  for dual citizenship, and which rights and opportunities it  offers them.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Bandaranaike sworn in as PM Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, Sri Lanka's new president, yesterday appointed her mother to a third term as prime minister, but made few other changes in the cabinet for the sake of continuity. Mrs Kumaratunga, who won a sweeping victory in last week's presidential polls, swore in the elderly Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike along with other cabinet ministers, keeping alive a family tradition of ruling the island nation. Mrs Bandaranaike, 78, was the world's first woman to head a national government when she became Sri Lanka's prime minister after her husband Solomon Bandaranaike was assassinated in 1959. She served two terms as prime minister in the 1960s and 1970s and was leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom party formed by her assassinated husband. Mrs Kumaratunga kept the finance portfolio and took over the defence ministry, a portfolio which under the constitution resides with the executive president along with the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Political analysts said Mrs Kumaratunga's decision to nominate her mother as prime minister would enable them to swap roles easily after the new government met its election pledge to make the presidency a ceremonial position.</p>

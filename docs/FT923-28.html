			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (8): Declining prices create havoc for industry - Survival now depends on big sales volumes and new software and services that powerful computers are technical marvels which demand high prices - was finally laid to rest. A year ago, the cheapest notebook computer based on the best-selling Intel 80/386 microprocessor chip and manufactured by Compaq, the market leader in high performance personal computers, cost Pounds 2,775 in the UK. Today, Compaq's cheapest 80/386 based notebook, the Contura 3/20, costs only Pounds 995, one of the most dramatic examples of the way prices have collapsed over the past few years. PC prices have been falling by an average of between 25 and 40 per cent a year and there is no reason to suppose they have reached the bottom. In few industries have high priced, high technology products become commodity items in such a short time. It is causing serious problems for established manufacturers and creating havoc in the supplier channels, where margins have been shaved unbearably thin. Computer dealers can survive now only if they sell hardware in large volumes or if they can add extra value in the form of software and services. The recession apart, prices have fallen because of declining component prices which have lowered entry barriers to the industry and helped to stimulate intense competition. A year ago, for example, a 20-megahertz Intel 386SX microprocessor, the workhorse of the industry, cost Dollars 88 in 1,000-part lots; now the same chip costs only Dollars 57.50 in the same quantity. Pressure on microprocessor pricing is helped by competition from a number of semiconductor manufacturers, notably AMD and Cyrix, which are developing chips functionally identical to Intel's industry standard devices. Some suppliers are also prepared to accept much smaller profit margins than is customary in the computer industry. Manufacturers traditionally expect a 60 per cent gross profit margin on mainframes, 40 per cent on mid-range systems and 20 per cent on PCs. Automated manufacturing techniques and more economic channels of distribution are allowing some manufacturers to work on much tighter margins. Many are based in Asia and constitute the biggest chunk of a new market segment - the so called 'no name' segment, which according to the consultancy InfoCorp Europe may now be greater than 30 per cent of the total. Growth in this segment of the market is greater than elsewhere in the PC business which is why no manufacturer can afford to ignore it. Across Europe it is expanding at 45 per cent a year as opposed to 21 per cent for the whole PC market. Dell Computer, a clone maker based in the US broke the mould by pioneering direct sales in the West through mail order. Compaq was one of the first victims. A year ago it reported its first ever loss after taking a Dollars 135m restructuring charge to pay for 1700 redundancies. Under new chief executive Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, the company changed tack decisively. It cut prices, sought manufacturing economies and announced a new range of low cost products. Compaq's challenge was to maintain its quality image with products cheap enough to compete in the lower regions of the market. It seems to be succeeding. In July it reported a 43 per cent jump in second quarter income, the first year to year improvement in Compaq's earnings since the beginning of 1991. It also warned that it was suffering from a parts shortage because of the popularity of its new machines. In some cases it has lost orders as a result. Warned there would be a two month wait for Compaq Prolinea computers, a customer bought extensive numbers of a 'no-name' brand. Dell, meanwhile, is prospering. Its quarterly results, published last month, show a year on year growth of 129 per cent and net profits up 77 per cent. It has Dollars 122m in cash and operating costs of only 16 per cent of sales. International Business Machines (IBM), the world leader in PCs, is taking a diversity of approaches. In Europe, for example, it has established a wholly owned, subsidiary, Individual Computer Products International (ICPI) to take on the no-name manufacturers directly. The company will source products on the open market, selling them through a variety of channels - dealers, retailers and direct sales. The name of the products - Ambra - gives no clue to their parentage. IBM is clearly trying to carve out a share of the low-end market for itself without compromising its credibility as a quality manufacturer. Earlier this month, the company announced it was splitting off its PC operations as a separate business within the corporation. The new unit, the IBM Personal Computer Company, will have responsibility for developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing the company's entire range of PCs. The idea is to give the unit more freedom in setting budgets, sourcing components and recruiting staff. The first products from the new division, three models in IBM's entry level PS/1 range, were launched earlier this month. The rush for the lower ground has even enveloped Apple, which has ploughed its own furrow through the computer industry since its early days. The company, which traditionally charged premium prices for its easy-to-use Macintosh technology, introduced cheaper versions last year and earlier this month introduced a new line of low-cost machines that it will sell through mass-market retailers. Models in the new range, known as Performa, will sell for between Dollars 1,250 and Dollars 2,900 in the US. It seems likely, however, that selling the new range through retailers will cause conflict with Apple's traditional dealers who will have to compete against the new machines with more expensive Macintosh products. Price reductions and new low cost models continue to come thick and fast. Digital Equipment, hitherto an also ran in the PC stakes, has launched a 386SX computer with colour screen for Pounds 850. How much further can prices decline? Few would give hostages to fortune by hazarding a guess in such a volatile industry, but at least 20 per cent seems likely next year. The principal effect of the past year, according to InfoCorp, however, is to narrow the average system, price differential between a first tier vendor - Compaq or IBM, say, and the no-name third tier suppliers from Pounds 600 to Pounds 100.</p>

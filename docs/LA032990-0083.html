			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN QUENTIN DIARY;  </P> <P> NEWS AGENCIES JOCKEY FOR SPACE AT THE PRISON GATE  </P> <P> As Tuesday's scheduled execution of Robert Alton Harris draws near, news  organizations have begun quietly renting rooms, balconies and even lawns from  residents living near San Quentin prison.  </P> <P> The grim business -- and it indeed has become an enterprise, with one  well-located balcony renting for $2,000 -- developed because of the difficult  access to the prison's main entrance, where a large anti-death penalty  demonstration is planned for the night of the 3 a.m. execution.  </P> <P> Getting in and out of this tiny San Pablo Bay village near San Rafael is  expected to be extremely difficult when the only road into town, a two-lane  street, is jammed with what authorities expect will be a crowd of 3,000  demonstrators and several hundred sheriff's deputies, police and California  Highway Patrol officers.  </P> <P> To make sure they have the room needed to do their jobs -- and, in the case of  one Bay Area television station, to broadcast a live one-hour special -- news  agencies turned to people living in former prison staff housing just outside  the gate.  </P> <P> Residents and journalists, fearing such deals may seem to be in bad taste, are  reluctant to discuss specifics. But many concede that significant money is  being discussed: One man is asking $2,500 for his front lawn, while a woman at  the low end of the scale has rented spaces in her home for $400 apiece.  </P> <P> "It's been a bidding war out there," said Al Corral, assistant news director at  KTVU, an independent Oakland television station.  </P> <P> John Motroni, managing editor at KGO, the local ABC television affiliate, said  the renting of space is unavoidable because location will largely decide how  well a significant aspect of the story -- the protest demonstrations -- can be  covered.  </P> <P> "It's sort of like a game of Monopoly," Motroni said. "Everyone wants to land  on Boardwalk and Park Place instead of Baltic Avenue."  </P> <P> (The Los Angeles Times also is negotiating with local residents for the  installation of telephone lines for use by its reporters.)  </P> <P> In a departure from what it had originally said was standard procedure, the  state Department of Corrections said Wednesday that Harris will continue to be  allowed direct contact with visitors through Sunday.  </P> <P> The decision will let the condemned man meet for one last time with members of  his family on that day, about a day and a half before he is scheduled to die in  the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Earlier, prison spokesman Cal White said that "security concerns" in the death  penalty protocol required that Harris be separated from visitors by a pane of  glass. Conversations would have been conducted over telephones.  </P> <P> The Prison Law Office, a legal aid group for prisoners and their families, had  threatened to sue over the loss of contact visits, said spokeswoman Laura  Prado.  </P> <P> Rejecting the complaints of a small band of residents who live next to the  prison, the Marin County Board of Supervisors said there is little the county  can do to ban anti-death penalty protests outside San Quentin prison's gate.  </P> <P> The residents, who live along the two-lane road to the prison's main gate, had  asked the county to try to block the execution by suing the state because it  cannot guarantee that residents will be safe from demonstrators.  </P> <P> Opponents and supporters of the death penalty have said they will assemble  outside the prison gate the night before Harris is scheduled to be executed.  Residents fear that their lawns will be littered and their homes damaged.  </P> <P> Supervisor Gary Giacomini, who represents the village of San Quentin, suggested  the residents lobby Sacramento to find a new location for the gas chamber if it  is used again. He said it is too late to relocate Harris' execution, which  according to the death warrant must be carried out at San Quentin.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's office Wednesday released the list of 16 news agencies  that will be allowed to send representatives to witness Harris's execution.  </P> <P> Among the organizations selected to attend are The Times and the two major wire  services, the Associated Press and United Press International.  </P> <P> In addition, the list includes four media representatives -- two from daily  newspapers, one each from radio and television -- from San Diego, where Harris  committed the two 1978 murders that put him on Death Row.  </P> <P> The list also includes one television and one radio station each from Los  Angeles and San Francisco, as well as a Sacramento television station. Also on  the list are two newspapers from San Francisco, the largest city close to the  prison; a newspaper from Sacramento and the local newspaper in Marin County.  </P> <P> Absent from the list is the Sacramento Bee, the largest, most influential  newspaper in the state capital. Deukmejian spokesman Tom Beermann said the  exclusion of the Bee was not related to its editorial opposition to the death  penalty or other Deukmejian Administration programs.  </P> <P> He said the number of news agencies seeking to witness the execution was far  more than could be accommodated. The witness list was drawn up by the  governor's staff with help from the Department of Corrections, Beermann said.  </P> <P> As many as 36 other execution witnesses will be drawn from among state  officials, prison staff, people designated by Harris and the family of his  victims. The names of those witnesses will not be made public by the prison.  </P></p>

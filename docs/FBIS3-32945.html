			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "If the Salt Loses Its Flavor...."] </F>   [Text] Corruption and crime have existed from time  immemorial. Ever since man set foot on this earth, homo  sapiens has had to be watched over and punished. Not only  are the Ten Commandments a guide, but also a form of prevention  and a warning to those who do not follow them. National laws,  those set forth by man, are in a sense a modern replica, ever  harsher but, unfortunately, apparently increasingly ineffective.  All of them, starting with those handed down during the time of  Moses, have pursued a single purpose: to protect morals.    In this struggle, violators fall almost daily, while others  escape. And yet--nor is this a purely Colombian  phenomenon--immorality continues to spread and it is very  frequently the high-ranking officials who are involved in cases  of corruption. In our country, the list is long. However, the  most disturbing fact is that these cases occur in the very  institutions responsible for ensuring that justice is served  and, furthermore, that justice is done. We have recently been  surprised by cases such as the one involving the prosecutor  responsible for overseeing the Judicial Police, Guillermo Villa  Alzate. Now, the deputy prosecutor general's private secretary,  Orlando Caceres Henao, is accused of extortion, apparently on  the basis of conclusive evidence. All of which makes the average  citizen think of the old saying to the effect that "when even  salt loses its taste," we face the danger that bad examples are  spreading. That is why we believe that cases of high-level  corruption must be investigated most rigorously and, when the  crime is proven, harshly punished.    We said yesterday that the sex education so essential in our  schools should be accompanied by healthy information provided to  children by their parents at home. The same is true of morals  and ethics. It is likewise the responsibility of fathers and  mothers to teach the necessary notions so that, as adults, those  children will base their conduct on the strictest standards of  morality.</p>

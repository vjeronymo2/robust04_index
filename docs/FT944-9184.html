			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (5): Systems get a new look - Technology Shut an ex-derivatives trader into a room with two electronics designers and a financial products engineer. Wait for 11 months. What emerges is a blueprint for the future of derivatives trading systems, according to the manufacturer's claims for one new product. Fun is not the word most people associate with trading systems. But the new system for modelling financial instruments, FiCAD, promises to be fun to use, and illuminating about the various risks and relationships in, for example, trading exotics. FiCAD is modelled on graphics - computer-aided design (Cad), to be more precise. Cad is used by architects and designers for creating three-dimensional models of everything from buildings to computer chips. Because of its graphical nature, and the ability to deal with 'related' values, derived from elsewhere, it is the ideal tool for dealing with exotics, and other complex products that require imaginative handling. The person proposing this scheme is Rod Beckstrom, a former derivatives trader at Morgan Stanley International. Despite his MBA from Stanford, it is likely that no-one would take him seriously if he were not also the founder and chief executive of the company that claims the lead in software systems for derivative trading, C ATS - Computer Aided Trading Systems of Palo Alto. Four years ago the C ATS brainstorming team came up with the idea of 'sketching' the complex relationships that underpin derivatives. They worked on development for a year - but chose inappropriate technology as the vehicle, threw it all away, and began again. 'We started coding before we got the design right,' admits Mr Beckstrom. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Computer and, more recently, of Next Computer, became associated with the project, and development went ahead using Next's computer environment and software development tools. No-one was laughing by the time the FiCAD - Financial Computer Aided Design  -system was launched in March this year. The idea of dealing with derivative products through a computerised drawing pad sounds less crazy when it becomes clear that banks and other users are not being asked to abandon their existing investments. FiCAD effectively 'bolts on' to previous, more rigid systems that use older technology and mind sets. Mr Beckstrom has a track record of backing outsiders that win. In the past he has made technical decisions that seemed risky, only to watch the rest of the field follow the trend. When he first envisaged the design of the original C ATS package in 1986, the underlying principle of cashflow analysis seemed unconventional in software design, and the hardware choice of Unix open systems almost outrageous. Unix, subsequently adopted by many hardware suppliers as a standard operating environment for shared multi-user systems, was then still emerging as a standard. It gives end-users a choice of hardware suppliers and the ability to transfer or upgrade hardware without changing software: hence 'openness'. Users can share data and applications on a Unix network, while still retaining immense local power through a desktop work station. Unix operating functions and many Unix applications are written in the powerful language called C. C ATS built the first cash-flow-based system in 1986, adopting the best practice at the time, by representing any part of the value of a payment as cash flow. 'In 1986 we used the C programming language, and Unix operating systems on Sun Microsystems work stations,' says Mr Beckstrom. 'It was heretical at the time, but everyone else followed the architecture. We feel we have broader cash-flow functionality than anyone, but we've also taken it to the extreme and tested its limitations. 'The breaking down of instruments into cash flows over time was a useful way of describing all sorts of contracts, but they didn't describe complex options and the plethora of new products financial engineers have been creating - the exotics,' he adds. 'So we had to answer the question: 'if the lowest level elements of instruments are not cash flows, then what are they?'' Mr Beckstrom believes they would never have found the answer without 'fresh blood in the room to penetrate the financial jargon',and it was provided by James Kleckner, technical director of C ATS, whose experience in simulation techniques and Cad system Systems) is evident in the techniques used by FiCAD. The product uses techniques the IT world has been parading as state of the art for some time, such as object-oriented programming, and parallel processing. Parallel processing shares tasks across several computers to provide higher speed. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a quick but very flexible way of developing software programs. The technique produces complex applications that are nevertheless 'intuitive', very easy for end-users to navigate, and just as important in the changing world of finance, easy to maintain and update. Such OOP programs gather disparate information into consolidated 'objects', depicted on the computer screen in a graphical 'icon' which can be opened up (via lists or menus) into its various components and relationships with a point-and-click mouse. The company is signing up third-party developers who plan to build FiCAD product offerings. 'We've taken the most dynamic object-technology in the world and applied it to the most dynamic industry,' says Mr Beckstrom. 'It's totally visual computing. We're convinced that NeXT is the reference architecture for the future. You can model any instrument, process it in real time. Our users are speed freaks, because there's such a value to getting the answer faster than your competitor. The others are all hoping we're mad but we've been proved right in the past. It's a risk, but a calculated risk.' Mr Beckstrom's stance is that banks are throwing away money on developing old technology, and are in danger of continuing to do so. 'We're not going to replace those back-office monoliths managing the loan portfolio overnight. But banks are simply going to be throwing away millions of pounds on developments that simply will not have the flexibility to accommodate changes and developments in the market.' Sun Microsystems (which accounts for 70 per cent of the installed workstation base in the financial market) has made a commitment to OpenStep from NeXT and Microsoft is rumoured to be interested. C ATS claims applications developed in FiCAD will run on Sun Unix today and on Microsoft Windows 95 when available. Most people in the industry agree with Mr Beckstrom's assertion that the primary challenge to systems is that of data integration, even if they would disagree with much else. Steve Husk, of ACT Business Systems, a supplier to the derivatives' industry, notes that there is a need to draw systems together and consolidate. Organisations seem compelled to spend whatever it costs to achieve this, and speed - of systems development and of information delivery  -is vital to a company's competitive status. The problem driving users towards simple 'graphical user interfaces' (GUIs) is that dealers have to negotiate complex systems. 'What really matters is the skill of the dealer,' says Mr Husk. ' Taking a position means taking a risk, and a good computer system means you can identify the risks. This makes it doubly important that a system is simple to use, however complex it is in its functions.' ACT is one of two UK-originated software offerings that have done well in the derivatives market. The other is SunGard Capital Markets which took over Devon Systems. Some organisations are exploring 'neural networks' for the simulation of risks and the identification of areas of exposure, or even of under-valuation. The systems simulate human intelligence in gathering data and analysing it to make connections and propose likely scenarios.</p>

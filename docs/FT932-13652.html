			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day achieves Pounds 4.45m AMBER DAY, the discount retailer, has taken an important step on the road to regaining credibility following last year's departure of Mr Philip Green, its controversial chairman and chief executive. The group yesterday reported operating profit of Pounds 5.9m in the six months to January 30. That was down from Pounds 7.46m, but it said the figures were not directly comparable because of a large one-off video deal which contributed about Pounds 2m last time. Sales by the 52 branches of What Everyone Wants grew 17 per cent to Pounds 55.7m, split almost equally between like-for-like growth and new stores. Group turnover, including an import business, improved 10 per cent to Pounds 61.3m (Pounds 55.5m). The pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 4.45m compared with a restated loss of Pounds 6.29m. The profits figure was depressed by the exceptional payment of Pounds 1.13m made to Mr Green, who stepped down in September after the group reported a sharp fall in profits. The company also spent Pounds 1.7m in August to buy and cancel 6.1m shares in the company held by Prudential, which bailed out at just 27 1/2 p per share. Amber Day's shares, which have recovered steadily since their low point of 24p in August, yesterday closed 5p higher at 79p. Mr Stacey Ellis, the former Inchcape director who became group chairman, said: 'I have been greatly impressed, in the three months since I joined, with the group's strengths and prospects and look forward with confidence to the second half of this year and beyond.' Mr Ellis said more competitive pricing, coupled with a policy of widening the product range and upgrading quality had been well received. Strong cashflow from operations helped limit the increase in gearing to 38 per cent, up from 22 per cent. Earnings per share of 2.51p compared with losses of 6.43p. Mr Ellis said that the strong financial position and growth prospects meant the board felt justified in maintaining the interim dividend at 1.1p. COMMENT Amber Day's main task yesterday was to reassure doubters that there would be no more nasty surprises from a company which caused a lot of grief last year. Mr Ellis achieved his aim, assuring analysts that there were no skeletons in the cupboard, and that these profits represented a clean basis on which to judge future performance. More remains to be done - not least the crucial appointment of a chief executive, which should be announced by the middle of the year. However, forecast earnings of Pounds 9m for the full year put the shares on a prospective multiple of under 15. At this level they are likely to attract further support from investors who believe that discount shopping has a place in the UK.</p>

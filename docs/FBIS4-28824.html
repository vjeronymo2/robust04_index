			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will  cut the base rate on lending to government affiliates by 0.20  percentage point to an annual 4.10 percent, effective Friday [17  Jun], ministry said Monday.    The move reflected recent declines in the coupon on  long-term  government bonds, the officials said.    Given the rate reduction, the ministry will consult with the  Construction Ministry to decide on new rates on public loans  extended by Housing Loan Corp.    The new base rate, for example, on loans for purchasing  newly  built housing with floor space of up to 125 square meters, is  expected to go down by 0.15 percentage point to an annual 3.90  percent, effective the same day.    The base rates on public housing loans link with those on  lending by Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau by using funds  of the fiscal investment and loan program.    The current housing loan rates of 4.05 percent were set on  April 22 after a round of rate hikes from an all-time low of  3.60 percent marked on Jan. 26.</p>

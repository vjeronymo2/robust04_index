			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  addressed the Ingush and Chechen peoples on the anniversary  today of the deportation of these peoples in 1944. The press  service of the President of the Russian Federation has  distributed the text of this address:    Address to the Ingush and Chechen peoples: Esteemed  compatriots! Today, on the tragic anniversary of the deportation  50 years ago of the Ingush and Chechen peoples, I offer you my  sincere condolences and sympathy. The Ingush and the Chechens  became the victims of the criminal arbitrary measures taken by  Stalin and Beriya. It is particularly incredible that it took  place when the best sons of the Vaynakh people were displaying  their heroism and loyalty to their patriotic duty alongside  other peoples of Russia at the front in the Great Patriotic War.    It is also a terrible truth that totalitarianism implanted  "delayed-action mines" in interethnic relations. Unfortunately,  they have started to explode in our times of nascent democratic  change. This is especially felt in the case of the  Ossetian-Ingush tragedy. I mourn with you over the victims of  the armed conflict, and share the grief of those who have lost  family and close ones, who are looking for a roof over their  heads.    I want to assure you that it has been and remains my goal  and  concern to eradicate the grave consequences of the tragic  events. With this in mind, I signed a decree on 13 December  1993, the main aim of which was to return refugees and deportees  to their original place of abode.    We are firmly on the road to thorough democratic  transformation, to creating a genuinely lawful, humane Russian  state. We are coming up against quite a few obstacles and  problems, one of which is the unresolved nationalities issue,  whose seriousness, even existence, were practically ignored  before.    The Northern Caucasus, where dozens of peoples live in a  small area, remains the most difficult region today in this  respect. But problems can only be solved by political means,  with armed force ruled out.    I am convinced that democratic Russia is capable of  resolving  any issue for the sake of a better future for its peoples and  for each citizen. One confirmation of this is the Law "On the  Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples", which lays down the legal  bases for the restoration of historic justice.    The federal bodies of state power have directed much effort  at improving the situation in the Northern Caucasus. The right  of the Ingush and Chechen peoples to an independent national  state system in the Russian Federation has been restored. They  have been given the same opportunities for development as other  peoples of the Russian Federation on the basis of the rights and  freedoms guaranteed in the Russian Federation Constitution.    The situation now is that you yourselves must move forward  towards national revival in all spheres of public life by  patiently settling disputed issues with your neighbors on the  basis of mutual accord. You can count on the help and  wholehearted support of the Russian president, the federal  bodies of state power and of all peoples of the Russian  Federation.    I am convinced that it is only through democracy and firm  constitutional law and order, without legal excesses or  lawlessness, but using the wise traditions of Caucasian peoples  tested over centuries, that peace and interethnic accord can be  achieved in the North Caucasian region along with calm and  wellbeing in every Ingush and Chechen family.</p>

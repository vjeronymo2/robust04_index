			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN BREAKS INTO BURNING HOUSE TO SAVE FOUNTAIN VALLEY WOMAN  </P> <P> A 28-year-old woman from Fountain Valley, Calif., apparently near death as her  mother's home here burned around her, was saved by a man who broke through a  door after seeing smoke at about 3 a.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> David Jones, 30, and his wife went to the burning house, pounding on doors and  windows trying to wake anyone inside.  </P> <P> Jones said he had seen two cars in the driveway and believed that there were  people inside the burning house, so he broke through a sliding-glass door to  the master bedroom.  </P> <P> Jones, who was barefoot, plunged into the burning room.  </P> <P> "It was pitch black," Jones said, and the smoke stung at his eyes, but he felt  his way to the bed.  </P> <P> There he found Julie Layton, who was watching the home for her vacationing  mother. "I shook her and I said 'We got to get out of here, there's a fire.' "  </P> <P> Jones said he put the woman's arm around his shoulder and helped her out of the  house. As he brought Layton to the front yard, she recovered enough to tell him  that she had been alone in the house.  </P> <P> Layton suffered from smoke inhalation but no other injuries. She was treated  and released at Chandler Regional Hospital.  </P> <P> "I'm glad that we were there because another 10 minutes and it would have been  all over for her, " Jones said.  </P> <P> Chandler Fire Department investigator Lou Carlucci said the fire started in a  couch and may have been ignited by a smoldering cigarette. The house was  destroyed, and damage was estimated at $70,000.  </P></p>

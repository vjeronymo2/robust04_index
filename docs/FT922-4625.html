			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / US calls meeting of Latin American finance ministers THE US Treasury has called a surprise meeting of finance ministers from Latin America to discuss trade, debt and investment developments in the region. The meeting, expected on June 24-25, will be chaired by Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, and is aimed at furthering the Enterprise for Americas Initiative announced by President George Bush two years ago. Mr David Mulford, under secretary for international affairs at the US treasury, said yesterday he did not expect the meeting to yield any new initiatives. But it would provide a useful forum to discuss the global economy ahead of the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Munich early next month. Finance ministers have been invited to Washington from 11 governments which have reached a Brady debt reduction accord with creditors or benefited from the Enterprise for Americas Initiative. They include Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela but also smaller economies such as Jamaica, Costa Rica and El Salvador. Mr Mulford said that since the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was announced there had been important progress in resolving debt problems and stimulating capital flows in Latin America. Good progress was being made in trade talks with Mexico and Canada on a North American Free Trade agreement and once an agreement had been reached the US would start negotiations on a similar accord with Chile. The Enterprise for Americas Initiative was dealt a setback in April by the failure of Congress to vote relevant authorisations and appropriations for debt reduction and the US contribution to a proposed Dollars 1.5bn multilateral investment fund. Mr Mulford said the administration would continue to press this issue in the current year.</p>

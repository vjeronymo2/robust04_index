			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In using animal models to predict neurotoxic risk in humans, it is important to understand that the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that underlie human biological processes, particularly those involving neurological and psychological functions, are very complex and are sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to model exactly in a lower species. While this caveat does not preclude extrapolating the results of animal studies to humans, it does highlight the importance of using valid animal models in well-designed experimental studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.2. Validity of Animal Models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whether animal tests or methods actually measure what they are intended to measure, whether the data from such tests can be obtained reliably, and whether such data can be logically extrapolated to humans are problems for most disciplines in toxicology. Various proposals have been made for the standardization and validation of methods used in neurotoxicological research. It is generally agreed that validation is an ongoing process that establishes the credibility of a test, building an increasing level of confidence in the effective utility of any model of evaluation. The credibility of a method, as it applies to testing, is usually discussed within several different contexts, including construct validity, criterion validity, predictive validity, and detection accuracy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construct validity concerns the ability of a method to measure selectively a particular biological function and not other dimensions. Construct validity is frequently established empirically. For example, sensory dysfunction such as hearing loss is reported by humans exposed to some chemicals, and tests are designed to detect and quantify those changes. Such tests are designed to measure changes in auditory function, while other sensations are unaffected (Tilson, 1987; Moser, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion validity refers to the ability of a method to measure a characteristic relative to some standard. For example, Horvath and Frantik (1973) noted that the significance of a test measurement as an index of an actual treatment effect should be validated relative to the effects of a defined reference substance or positive control. Furthermore, each specific test or type of effect may require an appropriate reference substance for which the given type of effect is a determining factor of the toxicity. Use of reference agents has obvious advantages in the assessment of unknown chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Predictive validity refers to the ability of a method to predict effects from an incomplete or partial data set. An animal model of neurotoxicity with good predictive validity would reliably predict neurotoxicity in humans, i.e., the animal to human extrapolation would be good. There are several examples in neurotoxicology where animal models have been developed based on neurotoxicological reports from humans. Presumably, the predictive validity of such models would enable detecting similar kinds of effects produced by uncharacterized chemicals having a similar mechanism of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been proposed (Tilson and Cabe, 1978) that the most logical approach to validate animal methods in neurotoxicology is to evaluate chemicals with and without known neurotoxicity in humans in tests designed for animals (predictive validity). By using such an approach, it is possible to generate a profile of effects characteristic of each type of neurotoxicant (criterion validity). This profile could then be used to assess the construct validity of various tests. That is, procedures assumed to measure the same neurobiological dimension should show similar effects; measures designed to detect changes in other functions should not be affected. This approach to test validation has been described as the multitrait-multimethod process of validation (Campbell and Fiske, 1959).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of particular importance in establishing the credibility of a method is the accuracy of detecting a treatment-related effect (Gad, 1989). Accuracy is a function of two interacting elements, specificity and sensitivity. Specificity is the ability of a test to respond positively only when the toxic endpoint of interest is present. Sensitivity is the ability to detect a change when present. This aspect depends on the inherent design of the procedure and experiment. Increasing the specificity of a test may reduce the possibility of classifying a chemical as neurotoxic when, in fact, it is not (false positive), but it may increase the probability of missing a true neurotoxicant (false negative). Increasing sensitivity of a test may reduce the possibility of false negatives, but may increase the probability of false positives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3. Special Considerations in Animal Models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.1.3.1. Susceptible populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like most other measures of toxicological effect, neurotoxic endpoints are subject to a number of experimental variables that may affect susceptibility to the biological effects of toxicants. In this regard, genetic variation (Festing, 1991) is a particularly important issue in neurotoxicology. For example, most neurotoxicological assessments are carried out with only one or two species. This may pose problems, however, since species may differ in sensitivity to neurotoxicants. For example, nonhuman primates are more sensitive than rats (Boyce et al., 1984) or mice (Heikkila et al., 1984) to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP, a byproduct in the illicit synthesis of a meperidine analog (Langston et al., 1983). In the assessment of delayed neuropathology produced by some cholinesterase inhibitors, it is well known that hens are much more sensitive than rodents (Cavanagh, 1954; Abou-Donia, 1981, 1983). In addition, rat strains also may be differentially sensitive to some neurotoxicants (Moser et al., 1991). Although it is preferred that more than one species be tested, the cost required for routine multispecies testing must be considered. Whenever possible, the choice of animal models should take into account differences in species with regard to pharmacodynamic, genetic composition and sensitivity to neurotoxic agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to species, other factors such as gender of the test animal must be taken into consideration. Some toxic substances may have a greater neurotoxicological effect in one gender (Squibb et al., 1981; Matthews et al., 1990). Thus, screening evaluations frequently require both male and female animals. Another important variable is the age of the animal (Veronesi et al., 1990). Whether a chemical produces neurotoxicity may depend on the maturational stage of the organism (Rodier, 1986). Most preliminary assessments are designed to provide information on adults, which have the greatest probability of being exposed. However, populations undergoing rapid maturation or aged individuals may be especially vulnerable to neurotoxic agents. Longitudinal studies that assess both genders at any stage of development address many of the problems associated with differentially sensitive populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making the most of perks - The pros and cons of holding a gold card HAVING a gold card was a mark of wealth in the yuppie days of the 1980s. Producing one to pay for goods or services made its owner feel good: it signified that his income was above average, and offered high spending limits plus other perks. But with the recession causing many people to reassess their priorities, gold cards came under increasing scrutiny. And with the recession still biting, the question arises: are they now more of a liability than an asset? To qualify for a gold card, you must have income of at least Pounds 20,000 (although the minimum at Robert Fleming is Pounds 40,000 and usually Pounds 75,000 at Coutts) so that issuers know you have the means to settle any large bills. But that has not stopped some issuers running into substantial bad debt problems. Last December, American Express halved - to Pounds 5,000 - the overdraft facility for its gold card customers and it has suspended the facility altogether for new customers, at least for the time being. Unsecured lending above Pounds 2,500 also has been suspended for its green card customers in the UK. Girobank has gone even further and last year withdrew its gold card for new customers altogether, although it says the reason was low demand. Robert Fleming ties its gold card to its Premier account. Unusually, it does not charge an annual fee but there are no perks on the card other than an overdraft facility at preferential rates. 'Our research showed us that there is a significant market which does not want all the travel-related services,' the bank said. Some banks offer two types of gold card because of an agreement with American Express. Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland are among those which offer their own gold Mastercard or a gold American Express card. Charge cards Most gold cards are charge cards where the balance has to be paid off in full within a certain period of receiving the statement. But some - including those of the Co-Operative bank, Lloyds and National Westminster - are credit cards. The advantage of charge cards is that there is no pre-set spending limit; thus, you do not have to worry about running out of credit on an expensive holiday. There is also the discipline of knowing you have to settle the amount in full once the statement has arrived. Some issuers, such as Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland, insist on direct debits for settlements. Most levy penalties for late payment, but there is also the risk that the card will be withdrawn if this happens too often. The main disadvantage of charge cards is that they have a higher annual fee than the credit variety, mainly around Pounds 70-Pounds 85; Barclays has just raised its levy from Pounds 70 to Pounds 80. Coutts charges Pounds 120, but reduces that to Pounds 90 if it is paid by direct debit. But the annual fee is meant to be a charge for a whole range of perks. For many people, the most important of these will be the chance to borrow money at preferential rates and without the usual arrangement fee and other charges. The box shows the rates offered on gold cards compared with standard authorised rates of interest by the banks concerned. Some are better than others. Barclays Premier quotes a preferential rate of 13.6 per cent (equivalent annual rate) compared with its standard rate of 19.2 EAR, but this is less favourable than, say, the 2.5 per cent over base rates offered by Bank of Scotland. With base rates at 6 per cent, this means paying 8.5 per cent instead of Bank of Scotland's standard overdraft rate of 18 per cent. The preferential rates offered directly by Amex are particularly unappealing, although the company says it will be offering a new tiered structure by the end of the year to benefit those gold card customers who have a good credit history. Preferential interest rates on Amex gold cards issued by other banks are cheaper: the rate on a Royal Bank of Scotland Amex gold card is 8.7 APR. While the perks on gold cards are many and varied, issuers have long assumed that holders - because of their incomes - tend to be frequent air travellers; thus, many of the perks are travel-related. But some of these are more useful than others. The fine print on Amex's travel accident insurance shows that it applies only to those 'who are involved in an accident while travelling on a public conveyance.' But compensation for luggage delays or losses, and a refund of money spent on a holiday when the travel company fails, are attractive benefits. Another good perk - which is offered by most gold cards - is purchase protection for goods bought with the card, usually for 90 days. There is the convenience, too of being able to make cash withdrawals abroad and obtaining cash advances from member banks at home, although most banks charge a 1.5 per cent handling fee on such advances. And gold cards often act as cheque guarantee cards for amounts (mostly) up to Pounds 250. Some issuers have an emergency replacement service for lost or stolen cards. But charge cards are not usually covered by the Consumer Credit Act, which limits the cardholder's liability to Pounds 50. Most issuers of charge cards promise their cardholder protection if their card is lost or stolen but cardholders are not covered by law should they fall into dispute with the issuer. Credit cards These cards have lower annual fees but do not offer the same range of benefits as charge-card gold cards. The Co-Operative has now issued 175,000 gold credit cards, much of the business stemming from its pledge never to introduce an annual fee. Customers at Lloyds and National Westminster banks have the option of a 'gold' bank account service which will offer a full range of perks for a higher annual fee. This type of account is offered also by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Neither NatWest nor Lloyds offers a preferential overdraft rate on the gold card alone. Lloyds bank withdrew the facility last October; it says it wanted to avoid duplication with its gold service bank account. The preferential overdraft rate at the Co-Operative is only just over two percentage points lower than its standard rate. The main advantage of these gold cards is that the minimum monthly credit limit is high even if it is not unlimited, and the cards do carry some travel-related perks. But if you possess a gold card out of habit, now could be the time to review how often you use its perks. This way, you can judge if it is worth paying the annual charges.

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PROTEST BY ISRAELI WOMEN  </P> <P> Security forces dragged a dozen praying women away from Judaism's holiest  shrine, the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after disturbances erupted during a  service. An Israeli group called Women at the Wall aroused anger among  ultra-Orthodox Jews by holding collective prayers at the women's section of the  wall. The ultra-Orthodox believe that women's voices should not be heard during  prayer. About 50 of the women sat with linked arms to try to avoid being carted  off. One of them, psychologist Marsha Pik, said, "At such a public, holy place  it deeply offended me and made me think about women's place in Judaism."  </P></p>

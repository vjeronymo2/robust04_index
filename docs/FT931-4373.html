			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Observer: Welcome on the inside A nice little earner could be in the offing for ex-Granada chief executive Derek Lewis, now gone from the leisure and entertainments industry to inject entrepreneurship into the UK prison service. With its rebirth as a free-standing agency only three weeks away, the service is afflicted with a problem more often found in show business - how to drag them in. With no fewer than 7,000 vacancies in its cells, according to an internal briefing document, the service is operating well below capacity. True, the prison population has risen by 2,000 since the count of just over 40,000 in December. But that is merely a normal seasonal increase, the document says; the potential captive audience that once awaited in police station cells has run out. So what to do? While wanting the service to be more entrepreneurial, the government might draw the line at a campaign to promote a capacity-filling crime-wave. And although prisons' running expenses are only a quarter of the police-cell figure, their daily cost of about Pounds 60 a customer would price them out of the standard hotel market. Considering Lewis's background, however, a solution should certainly not be beyond him. One obvious possibility is to follow the theme park trend. After all, the Dartmoor Experience could well prove as big a draw as the London Dungeon.</p>

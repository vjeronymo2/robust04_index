Blanco said that although the document acknowledges that the  Shining Path is the greatest human rights violator in Peru, but  also notes the progress attained by the government in this  field, the report persists in accusing the Peruvian Government  of systematically implementing a policy of murders and  disappearances.    Besides pointing out that the government's antisubversive  strategy is based on the concepts of prosperity, democracy, and  respect for human rights, Blanco maintains that the U.S. State  Department's view is incomplete and ignores other more objective  reports such as the ones prepared by the United Nations.    Gen. Cisneros, who agrees with Blanco, denied that the  Peruvian Government systematically implements a policy of abuses  to human rights.    He said that the U.S. report is quite unfair to the Armed  Forces which last year were very careful to act within the legal  norms and with respect for the individual.    He added that the U.S. Government has a distorted notion of  the problem as a consequence of "information obtained from  people interested in creating a false image of Peru."    However, Cisneros agreed on the need to modify the trial  mechanism -- by military courts -- of terrorists to make trials  "more transparent and according to the law."    "We can already observe a change of attitude in the  government, especially since the installation of new Supreme  Court members who were chosen by a Disciplinary Board for  Magistrates," Cisneros said.</p>

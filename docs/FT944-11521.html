			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lonrho busy Lonrho burst into life with 28m shares - 4 per cent of the company - changing hands as the stock market got its teeth into the potential implications of Tiny Rowland's departure. The management move, and the sense of high drama it created, also generated a huge traded options business. Amid talk of a wholesale clear-out of non-core operations and a rapid reduction in debt, the shares jumped 12 to 144 1/2 p in heavy two-way business, although dealers said no large lines came on offer. Even on a busy day Lonrho seldom trades more than 3m shares. The consensus in London was that given a free rein the board will now move quickly to rationalise Lonrho's group structure, which consists of some 600 companies. Analysts expect a string of new year disposals with best bets pointing to the UK motor distributors, Dovercourt and Dutton-Forshaw, and the African non-mining business. These generate around 30 per cent of group profits. Media conglomerate Pearson lost some of its recent gains after NatWest Markets downgraded its recommendation on the stock. The securities house decided that the valuations for BSkyB, the satellite television group, were too high. Pearson shares fell 20 to 624p. Conflicting wire agency stories late in the session unsettled Vickers, which shed 3 to 180p. Speculation of a link-up with a big German company had helped lift the shares by almost 10 per cent in the previous four days. A Daimler-Benz spokesman was quoted by Extel as saying his company had no plans to take a stake in Vickers' Rolls-Royce motor car subsidiary. In contrast, Reuters weighed in with industry sources suggesting that Daimler's chances of linking up with Roll-Royce Motors were far greater than those of rival German motor group, BMW. At a City presentation on Thursday, Vickers told analysts it would announce a partner for Rolls-Royce Motors before the end of the year. Shrugging off a 3 per cent decline in new car sales for October, motor distributors stayed a clear feature with Cowie, basking in tentative takeover talk and adding a further 2 at 239p, and Lex Service, which jumped 13 to 361p. Cowie has put on almost 12 per cent in four days while Lex has staged an advance of 27p in three days. Dealers pointed to the low volumes in the shares - Lex traded just 223,000 - plus recent heavy under-performance. Cowie has lagged the market by 5 per cent over the past three months while Lex has underperformed by around 15 per cent. Sun Alliance was one of the top performers in the insurance sector following talk of a UBS buy recommendation; the shares rose 4 to 341p after good turnover of 4.3m. Royals eased 1 1/2 to 308p but remained 19 higher over the week following a spate of broker buy recommendations, notably from BZW, and ahead of expected good third quarter results next Thursday. Prudential gained 5 at 323p Irish Permanent, floated on the market a week ago at 180p, added 3 to 220p, still buoyed by news that Abbey National, the UK building society-turned-bank, had bought a 9.9 per cent stake in the group as a 'long-term investment'. In financials, Gerrard &amp; National jumped 18 to 483p following support from income funds while Cater Allen, due to report interims at the end of the month, continued to move ahead strongly, closing a further 8 higher at 512p, up 43 on the week. Sage Group, the computer services company, gave another exceptional performance, the shares racing up a further 22 to a record 678p, after the scintillating figures and the French acquisition announced on Thursday. Radioactivity healthcare specialist Amersham International eased a penny to 985p as it was announced that SG Warburg had reduced its stake to 13.97 per cent. However there was some support ahead of interim figures on Wednesday which are mooted to be around Pounds 19.5m. Consideration of the decision by discount retailer Kwik Save to buy the retail supermarket business of Shoprite for Pounds 45.4m saw the latter tumble 5 to 16. Kwik Save, which had published figures above most analysts' forecasts, was steady at 550p. Boots, the high street chemist and retailer, lost 7 to 512p on further reaction to Thursday's cautious statement on potential trading in the second half of the year. Courtaulds Textiles gained 6 to 476p in response to a buy recommendation from BZW. The investment bank says Courtaulds offers strong cyclical recovery in depressed but structurally satisfactory businesses. The house also advised clients to buy Marks and Spencer suppliers Dewhirst and Claremont and the two stocks held firm at 125p and 316p. M&amp;S fell 5 to 414p. Pulp and paper supplier Arjo Wiggins Appleton fell 8 1/2 to 267 1/2 p after announcing that turnover in the third quarter of the current financial year rose to Pounds 686m making Pounds 2.13bn of sales for the nine months.</p>

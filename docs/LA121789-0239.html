			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TREE FARMS TAKE FRESH APPROACH TO TRADITION  </P> <P> Wandering amid the two acres of live Monterey pine at the Orange Christmas Farm  on a recent sunny day, Keith Kenney was looking for the perfect tree.  </P> <P> Kenney and his two daughters Dana, 6, and Erin, 8, had set out to surprise Mom  -- Grace Kenney, a registered nurse who was cooped up studying for refresher  courses -- by bringing home a special Christmas tree.  </P> <P> "She's always wanted this type," said Kenney amid the forest of living pines.  </P> <P> He knew that choosing a tree from a farm was a little more expensive than  taking home a pre-cut one from a lot -- in fact, twice the amount he says he  usually pays for a tree. But the 33-year-old engineer said this had been a  special year.  </P> <P> "With school and working -- it's been a real strain, so this will be a real  special Christmas for us."  </P> <P> Sentimental holiday enthusiasts, longing for the look and scent of a fresh  evergreen to fill their homes this Christmas season, have been abundant during  recent weekends, searching the county's live tree farms for the pine of choice.  </P> <P> "Last year we had to take our tree down the day after Christmas; it was so dry,  it was a fire hazard," said Cynthia Kareem of Yorba Linda, as her husband, two  children, a friend and a next-door neighbor roamed among 5,000 pines at the  Bailey-Findley lot in Yorba Linda. "Hopefully it will be fresh."  </P> <P> Most customers visiting one of the more than a dozen farms throughout the  county defer to staff workers to do the chopping. But a few brave souls,  including 8-year-old Omar Kareem and his neighbor, Scott Woodward, 9, prefer to  take saw in hand.  </P> <P> "Now if you cut it, you have to carry it too," Jim Bailey, part-owner of the  lot, told the boys after they had felled a six-foot Monterey pine, which is the  type offered at most lots because they grow so well in the county's climate.  </P> <P> Not only did the twosome carry the pine from deep inside the farm to the  parking lot, they heaved it over the side of the Kareem family's Jeep.  </P> <P> "It's not that heavy," Omar said. "It was fun."  </P> <P> Scott said his parents aren't buying a tree this year because of the fire  hazard, but he was sure that he would spend time enjoying the tree at his  neighbor's house.  </P> <P> "I've always been wishing I could have a great, big Christmas tree high as the  clouds," he said as he nestled in the back of the Jeep with Omar and the tree.  </P> <P> At Santa's Forest, also in Yorba Linda, where wooden bridges take shoppers from  the jam-packed parking lot off Yorba Linda Boulevard into a serene and shady  five acres of evergreens, some buyers found the freshness of just-cut trees a  worthy investment.  </P> <P> "You don't see any dead stuff in here," said Stan Jablecki of Brea as he moved  aside the branches of a pine, revealing a nearly perfect green tree. "The last  thing you want is a fire. No matter what the cost, what's the cost of your  home? It's a lot more than a Christmas tree."  </P> <P> He and his wife Sue said they have been buying fresh-cut trees for about 13  years.  </P> <P> "We've got pictures of little Elizabeth standing on the trunk" of the chopped  tree, said Sue Jablecki, referring to the couple's now 16-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> Dick Holmes, who has worked at the Santa's Forest lot for 16 years, says that  even fresh-cut trees need special care.  </P> <P> He suggests that buyers chop off the bottom of the trunk just before they put  the tree in water, and add fresh water every few days.  </P> <P> Bailey, who has sold Christmas trees for 20 years, said the trend is for 7- and  7 1/2-foot trees, and especially ones that are full, fat and perfectly shaped.  But he said everyone has a particular preference.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN SIGNED JUDGES BILL IN JULY  </P> <P> The Times incorrectly reported Wednesday that legislation increasing the  insurance and retirement benefits for San Diego County judges was signed by  Gov. George Deukmejian last week. In fact, the bill, sponsored by Sen. Larry  Stirling (R-San Diego), was signed into law July 13 and became effective  immediately. Deukmejian on Tuesday announced that he had appointed Stirling as  a San Diego Municipal Court judge, a move that will become effective with  Stirling's resignation from the state Senate. #YES#  </P></p>

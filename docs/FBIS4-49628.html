			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan companies will be  allowed to manufacture 633 more products in Mainland China,  Director-General Yin Chi-ming of the Industrial Development  Bureau reported Friday [6 May].    The green light brings the total number of industrial items  allowed to be manufactured in the mainland to 4,444, or 70  percent of the 6,771 industrial goods Taiwan companies currently  manufacture, Yin noted.    The government made the decision following 29 rounds of  talks  with representatives of 12 key industries, including the  information, consumer electronics, machinery, steelmaking,  petrochemical, [word indistinct] and telecommunication  industries, he said.    Of the new products allowed to be manufactured in Mainland  China, 196 and 188 are textile and machinery products,  respectively.    Even the automobile and information industries, both of  which  are considered vital to Taiwan's economy, have been approved to  manufacture 18 and 16 items, respectively, in Mainland China, he  pointed out.    Information products getting the go-ahead for mainland  production include the 486 personal computer, he added.    Yin said the further relaxation of restrictions on  investment  in Mainland China will help create win-win opportunities on both  sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>

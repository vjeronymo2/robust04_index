			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Massive selling of sterling HEAVY pressure on sterling yesterday culminated in the suspension of the currency from the exchange rate mechanism after the end of European trading, writes Tracy Corrigan. During the day, two consecutive rate rises by the Bank of England and an estimated Pounds 9bn of concerted central bank intervention failed to halt massive selling of sterling in the foreign exchange market. In spite of an increase in the minimum lending rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, the pound remained under intense pressure throughout the day, repeatedly falling below its ERM floor of DM2.778. The second rate rise was cancelled when sterling was suspended from the ERM. Sterling slid further after 4pm, the cut-off point for obligatory intervention by European central banks to support weak currencies in the ERM. By the close of London trading, the pound had fallen to DM2.75, nearly 3 pfennings below the official floor. A trader said: 'The market has really got the bit between its teeth now, but the assault on the currency would never have been so effective if it were purely speculative.' The shift of capital from UK markets by fund managers and corporate treasurers proved irresistible. By the end of the day, the task of keeping sterling within its ERM band seemed insurmountable, as rumours of a realignment - or even an abandonment of the ERM - swept the market. The scale of the sterling crisis overshadowed worries about the French referendum on Sunday, which is now being viewed almost as a secondary issue. The first UK rate rise, from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, followed repeated intervention by the Bank of England, which was joined by the Bundesbank and the Banque de France. The swift draining of foreign exchange reserves failed to boost the pound, which hovered around its floor against the D-Mark as foreign exchange dealers and fund managers sold sterling. Continued pressure on the pound then prompted a further rate increase to 15 per cent at 2.15pm. But this second rate rise served to increase selling pressure further, as speculation mounted that some sort of devaluation of sterling was becoming inevitable. Meanwhile, the lira, peseta and Swedish krona also came under pressure. The Bank of Italy bought lire for D-Marks, but failed to prevent the currency from falling below its new ERM floor of L820.68 per D-Mark. The Bank of Spain, which bought pesetas aggressively at a higher level, was somewhat more successful in stemming the Spanish currency's decline, which ended at Pta67.64 to the D-Mark. The Swedish authorities again hoisted their marginal lending rate, this time to 500 per cent, in an effort to stem a further outflow of capital from the Swedish financial markets.</p>

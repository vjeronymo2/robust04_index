			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Loans linked to business advice - In a nutshell The government is expected shortly to announce plans for a pilot programme linking the loan guarantee scheme to business advice and counselling provided by local Training and Enterprise Councils. Managers and business owners seeking a loan will be invited to take some form of business training. The loan guarantee scheme guarantees 85 per cent of bank loans to businesses which lack a track record or the security normally required. The pilot programme will allow the government to discover whether companies which elect to take advice perform better than those which do not. If they do, linking loans to training could be a means of reducing losses from the scheme.</p>

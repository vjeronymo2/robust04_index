			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHRIS REA: PUB-ROCKING AT ROXY  </P> <P> "Michael who?" quipped English pop-rocker Chris Rea, a silly grin on his face  as he attempted a clumsy moonwalk on Tuesday at the Roxy. While the joke may  have gone past most of the people in the crowd, in his native land it would  have hit home: The album that song originally came from was kept from No. 1  honors a couple of years ago in England by none other than the Moonwalker  himself.  </P> <P> Over there Rea's a certified Beeg Deal; on this side of the Atlantic he's  little more than a footnote, remembered (if at all) for a few well-received  albums nearly a decade ago. But the brief Roxy set made a strong case that Rea  deserves at least a page of his own.  </P> <P> Backed by a six-piece band, Rea couldn't have been more the antithesis of  Michael Jackson. Warmly low-key with a few days' worth of beard and a plain  black T-shirt, he looked as if he just popped over from his local pub.  </P> <P> And indeed there were a few echoes of the English pub-rock style in his music:  an attractive package of substantive emotions and playing, anchored by his  weathered voice and impressive guitar playing.

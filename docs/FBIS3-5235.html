The agreement came at a meeting Friday  between floor leaders Rep. Yi Han-tong of the Democratic Liberal  Party and Rep. Kim Tae-sik of the Democratic Party.    The meeting was called to discuss issues the two sides left  out when they adopted revised political bills in a special  National Assembly session which ended Friday night.    The floor leaders agreed to have the Legislation and  Judiciary Committee undertake preliminary work on possible  revision or abolition of the security law.    The National Security Law entered the spotlight in recent  days when Secretary of State Warren Christopher and another  senior U.S. official urged South Korea to repeal the law as part  of efforts to improve human rights. The law, enacted to deter  North Korean espionage and other seditious activities against  the South, was often perceived as an instrument of human rights  abuses by past administrations headed by retired generals.    "The floor leaders of the two parties have agreed to let the  Legislation and Judiciary Committee form a subcommittee to  discuss the National Security Law as they agreed to do so in  principle last year," said Kim Tae-sik.    As a result, the committee is scheduled to hold a plenary  session Saturday to form the proposed subcommittee.    The two parties agreed to discuss possible revision or  abolition of the law last year when the National Assembly  revised the law on the Agency for National Security Planning.</p>

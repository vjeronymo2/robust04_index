			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Big business seems to be into society's new religion. Religion itself has taken  to mimicking entertainment. The situation gets a barbed drubbing in Michael  Hickman's newest paintings. In these quick, thin works, power lunches have the  reverent illumination of the Last Supper, and the Crucifixion is strangely  updated theater complete with colored Malibu lighting and a dying Christ in a  business suit.  </P> <P> Hickman's chiaroscuro technique of strong, contrasting darks and lights is  bluntly direct. Scenes have the gritty reality of newspaper reproduction mixed  with a quirky what's-wrong-with-this-picture kind of disjunction. Whether it's  the apparent torture victim with a trash can hood in "Performance" or the  placid gospel reader surrounded by guards carrying semiautomatic weapons in  "The Word," every drama goes strange.  </P> <P> Hickman's figures are rudimentary and the often garish color gives them a  heightened urgency. They need that emotional push to withstand the  volume-killing glazes he uses to pull the compositions together. Yet the raw  color alone can be too blatant, as in hellish scenes of body builders and punk  rockers. Hickman seems more effectively controlled in the mysterious grayed  images that tangle the symbolic vocabularies of the sacred and the profane.  (Orlando Gallery, 14553 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, to April 28.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

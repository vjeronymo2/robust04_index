			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports from Chhuk District [Kampot Province], say  that on 29 January leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets  and the two-headed government gathered a regiment of troops from  Chhuk District, Kampot Province, to attack the people and the  National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] along Route 3 in  Chhuk District. However, as soon as as they showed up, they  were ambushed and routed by the people and the NADK. The NADK  and the people killed 11 enemy soldiers, including a platoon  officer who died on the spot, and wounded 13 others. We seized  six AK rifles and a quantity of war materiel.    The reports also say that the NADK and the people in Chhuk  District, Kampot Province, remain constantly vigilant to smash  and rout the offensive campaign of the Vietnamese communist  puppets and the two-headed government. Furthermore, they say  that offensive campaign of the Vietnamese communist puppets and  the two-headed government against the people and the NADK is an  act killing the nation and people. It is also an act pushing  the Cambodian nation, people, and territory into the communist  Vietnamese's Indochinese federation strategy.    The people cannot accept this. Our people want Cambodia to  have independence, peace, and sovereignty with territorial  integrity. They want national reconciliation in accordance with  the five-point policy of Samdech Euv [Sihanouk] the king.    The reports further say that the NADK and the people have  warned that by continuing to fuel Vietnam's war of aggression,  leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed  government are war criminals. As a retribution, these war  criminals will certainly be dissolved and disappear like  previous traitors because of the people's curse.</p>

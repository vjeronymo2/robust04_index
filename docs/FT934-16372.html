			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Germany set to oppose Spanish rescue scheme THE German government is likely to oppose a European Commission-backed restructuring plan for the Spanish steel industry unless significant changes are made to it, Bonn officials said yesterday. The plan, which EC industry ministers will be asked to approve next month, was 'completely unacceptable in its present form', they said. A go-ahead for the Spanish scheme is crucial for the Commission which is negotiating with other state-subsidised steelmakers in order to rescue Europe's recession-hit industry. But opposition to the Spanish deal has been mounting and is now threatening to derail Brussels' attempts to have a EC-wide plan in place by next year. Under the Spanish proposal, which aims to reduce capacity and state-subsidies, the authorities must close a Basque plant at Anzio by mid-1995. But they can rescue another at Sestao if private investors are found for it. The plan foresees state aid amounting to Ecu2.77bn (Dollars 3.2bn). German officials say these state subsidies remain 'much too high'. They also want the Anzio plant closed earlier. 'We need capacity cuts now and not in two years,' a senior official said. They further object to the Sestao plant being allowed to survive in the hands of private investors. 'We cannot accept an ailing steelmaker being rescued by an investor which will only take a 51 per cent stake, and which may be partially owned by the state itself,' an official added. Nor would the German government accept a restructuring package it disapproved of in return for subsidies for its Ekostahl plant in east Germany. Bonn argues that Ekostahl is a separate case because its privatisation belongs to the restructuring of eastern Germany as a whole.</p>

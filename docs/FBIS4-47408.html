The researchers here performed a computer  study of monthly reports from AIDS-prevention centers, daily  reports of HIV infection, and reports of epidemiological  investigations filed in the Russian Center for Controlling AIDS  to identify a correlation between HIV infection and drug use.  They found that, as of 1 November 1992, a total of 588  individuals had been diagnosed as having HIV, and eight of those  individuals had had casual sex with drug users. A poll of 86  intravenous drug users indicated that most of them (upwards of  90 percent) shared unsterilized needles. None of those polled  had shared needles with foreigners, although 13-18 percent had  shared needles with prostitutes. Users of so-called pervitin  accounted for the highest percentage of drug users who had sex  immediately after intravenous injection of the drug. Most of  those polled did not have a steady sex partner, did not use  condoms, and had sex with prostitutes. Only 6 percent had had  sex with foreigners. The pervitin users appear to be at greatest  risk among the drug users for spread of HIV. References 6  (Western).</p>

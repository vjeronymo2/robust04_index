			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Ford plans biggest shake-up in its history Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, unveiled plans yesterday for a sweeping restructuring of its global organisation. It is planning to merge its European and North American automotive operations and its automotive components group into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations (FAO). In a radical attempt to break down traditional national and regional barriers, it is setting up five vehicle programme centres (VPCs), one in Europe and four in the US, in an attempt to regain a competitive edge over its rivals. Each will have worldwide responsibility for the design, development and engineering of particular vehicle ranges - in the case of Europe for small and medium-sized front-wheel-drive cars. Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive, said Ford would move to a single set of worldwide processes and systems in its product development, manufacturing, purchasing and sales and marketing activities. According to Mr Robert Transou, who is to become group vice-president for manufacturing, part of the reason for the restructuring, the most radical in Ford's 91-year history, was that 'GM was outperforming Ford in Europe; Chrysler was outperforming us in North America - that's simply unacceptable'. Mr Trotman said the simplification of engineering, purchasing, and technical and other processes would 'substantially reduce the cost of operating the automotive business', and could lead to cost savings of at least Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn-Pounds 2bn) a year by the end of the decade. Ford is seeking to eliminate the costly duplication of effort and the waste of resources that have allowed it in the past to develop similar cars, engines and transmissions in parallel in North America and in Europe. It is seeking to capture the economies of scale enjoyed by powerful rivals such as Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, which essentially design and engineer a car such as the Toyota Corolla once for the world market. Mr Trotman said that for the time being Ford's Asia Pacific and Latin American operations would remain separate. In both regions, it has complex relations with other carmakers, with Mazda in Asia and with Volkswagen in Latin America. 'Integrating North America, Europe and the components group is a big enough task,' Ford said. 'We thought we should complete this first phase before moving to Latin America and Asia. The single Ford Automotive Operations unit is to become operational on January 1, but there would be 'a continuing integration over the next few years'. Ford's Europe-based engineering operation has been assigned responsibility for small and medium-sized front-wheel-drive cars in the size of the Fiesta, Escort and Mondeo models together with any future derivatives, such as a smaller minicar. Based in the US, the other four vehicle programme centres will be responsible worldwide for large front wheel drive cars, for rear-wheel-drive cars including Jaguar, for personal use trucks and for commercial trucks. Jaguar now would be better able to draw on US expertise in large cars, said Ford, but Jaguar's Coventry development centre would be unaffected in the 'short to medium term'. Jaguar and Aston Martin would remain corporate entities. Mr Trotman refused to be drawn on where job losses might occur, except to acknowledge that there would almost certainly be cuts in Ford's central support staffs. Mr Ed Hagenlocker, who has been heading North American automotive operations, becomes president of Ford Automotive Operations, reporting directly to Mr Trotman.

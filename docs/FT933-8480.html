			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Change for Ukrainian currency NEW regulations are to go into effect today fixing the exchange rate of the Ukrainian currency to the dollar for some trade-related dealings, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Ukrainian enterprises, which are obliged to sell 50 per cent of their hard-currency earnings to the government, will be reimbursed at the fixed rate of 5,970 coupons to the dollar. The change is part of the government's attempt to obtain enough hard currency to offset the country's growing balance-of- payments crisis, triggered by Russia's shift to charging world prices for its oil exports to other former Soviet states. However, top government reformers criticised the move as a throwback to the days of central planning and said it would encourage capital flight from Ukraine. Under the old rules, enterprises were compensated for the hard currency they were obliged to sell to the government at a floating exchange rate determined by twice-weekly hard currency auctions held at the central bank. The new regulations allow enterprises to trade dollars above the 50 per cent surrender requirement at floating rates. They also allow Ukrainian citizens to buy or sell foreign currency in unrestricted quantities at the floating rate.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Asda disposes of Allied to Carpetland in equity deal Asda has sold its Allied business to Carpetland in a deal that will create the biggest carpet retailer in the UK. Under the deal, Asda has subscribed for Pounds 8m of ordinary shares in Carpetland, which was acquired from the Lowndes Queensway receivers in a Pounds 12m management buy-out in 1991. This will give Asda an initial 40 per cent equity interest in the enlarged group, which will have 200 stores and be renamed Allied. Asda's interest in the group can be increased to not more than 50 per cent, depending on the realisation value of Carpetland on a flotation or trade sale. Asda, the UK's fourth largest grocery chain, has emerged from severe financial difficulties at the end of the 1980s determined to concentrate on its core business. Mr Archie Norman, chief executive, described the disposal as 'a problem solved. Allied has been in decline for a number of years and threatened further losses.' In the last two financial years the Allied business, which has soaked up more than Pounds 100m of investment since the late 1980s, incurred operating losses totalling Pounds 17.7m. Carpetland made operating profits of Pounds 771,000 on turnover of Pounds 54.5m in the 12 months to the end of January. Mr Ray Nethercott, managing director, said that this year, before the acquisition, the company had been expecting profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 80m. 'Business has been flying in the last 12 months,' he said. Mr Nethercott stated that there was 'real commercial logic' in the deal. The combined group would have turnover of about Pounds 200m a year. He expected to have the group showing healthy profits in 18 months through cost saving measures, particularly on marketing and advertising. He hoped to bring the company to market 'within three years.' As part of the deal, CINVen, the venture capital group and existing majority shareholder in Carpetland, is subscribing for Pounds 5m of 12 1/2 per cent preference shares and Asda is subscribing Pounds 10m of 12 1/2 per cent redeemable loan stock. In the profit and loss account Asda will take a write-off of about Pounds 70m, mainly reflecting the total book value of its historic investment in Allied and Maples. It will also make a charge of Pounds 53.3m goodwill. Mr Norman, who joined Asda 20 months ago, said he was pleased with the deal, which took another distraction away from management. Asda's debt had fallen from Pounds 700m to well below Pounds 100m since he joined. He expected to sell the 20 remaining Maples stores, 'within the next two months.' See Lex</p>

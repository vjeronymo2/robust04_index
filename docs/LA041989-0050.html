			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI FEST HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Macho Dancer'  </P> <P> The Philippines, 1988, 100 minutes  </P> <P> 7 p.m.  </P> <P>  Filipino film-maker Lino Brocka is a minor master of violent, sentimental  melodramas, usually with left-wing political undercurrents. That description  fits this movie, but what makes it unusual is its milieu: the twilit Manila  world of gay bars, male hustlers and "macho dancers" -- whose soapy,  hip-rolling, nude and quasi-nude routines make up a lot of its footage. Brocka  spins a typical young-man-from-the-provinces gangster plot, but he doesn't  stint on depicting the underworld nor the political and police corruption that  fuels it; if he falls at last into gun-toting melodramatics, its probably the  price of knowing one's metier. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Observer: Royal parking slot Sir Donald Gosling's generous offer to contribute Pounds 5m and orchestrate a fund to replace the Royal Yacht Britannia has caught the popular imagination. If anyone can pull it off, it is the National Car Parks' swashbuckling boss, dubbed the merchant adventurer of the parking lot. Gosling already owns the 245ft Leander, proudly trumpeted as the largest non-royal British yacht afloat, so he should know where to get the best buy  -even if it means shopping abroad. Leander, unlike Britannia, was built using largely Russian naval expertise at a military dockyard in former East Germany which used to build ships for the Soviet navy. Gosling was not the original client. The mysterious Tim Landon, a Hampshire landowner and ex-Army officer, commissioned the ship, which was a by-product of a 'swords into ploughshares' programme. Leander was sold to Gosling before it was launched. Landon is more than just a farmer. At one stage he was the link between the Oman government and Whitehall during the secret war largely fought by SAS troops against Omani rebels. Sources in the super-yacht industry say that Landon, still close to Sultan Qaboos, is planning to build an even bigger gin-palace inside the former Soviet Union. Could he have the biggest client of all in mind for this one?</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: US markets Before yesterday's intervention to support the dollar so spectacularly failed, the US bond and equity markets were trying to digest Mr Bush's keynote speech. The idea that taxpayers might be invited to 'tick the box to reduce the deficit' was waved aside, and proposals to link tax cuts to spending cuts were taken with an appropriately large pinch of salt. But there was a sense that Mr Bush might be able to win voter support by pinning Mr Clinton to a high tax, high spending platform. Despite a slight fall in bond yields in response to the speech, the political risks of the election have yet to filter through to the US Treasury market. Equities are still less affected. As this year's election in Britain showed, political factors can take a long time to feed through to prices, and it may be well into September before opinion polls dominate market movements. When the focus shifts, however, investors may begin to suspect that the policies of either candidate could in practice mean higher budget deficits.</p>

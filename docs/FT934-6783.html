			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O links with Swire to invest Pounds 54m in Chinese container port Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, the UK transport and construction group, and Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong property and aviation conglomerate, yesterday joined forces to invest HKDollars 615m (Pounds 54m) in a southern Chinese container port. P&amp;O and Swire Pacific said they would each acquire 25 per cent of the Shekou Container Port from China Merchants, a Hong Kong-based shipping and trading group, and China Ocean Shipping. From the beginning of next year, P&amp;O will operate the port. Shekou port is situated on the west coast of the Shenzhen special economic zone, just north of Hong Kong, on the Pearl River. It acts as a feeder port to Hong Kong's deep water container port. The port is capable of processing 550,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) annually; expansion currently under way will more than double capacity by the end of 1996. P&amp;O said yesterday that it and China Merchants would acquire the increased capacity. Lord Sterling, P&amp;O chairman, said yesterday that the investment represented P&amp;O's first sizeable step into the management and ownership of materials handling facilities on the Chinese mainland. It is the first in a series of planned acquisitions in accordance with strategic expansion in Asia, he said. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Swire Pacific, said the Shekou facility would complement Hong Kong's container handling facilities. 'There is no question that the Pearl River delta is the fastest growing manufacturing area in the world and that Shekou container terminals is ideally situated to service this demand,' he said. China Merchants, which began developing Shekou in 1978, will retain a 32.5 per cent interest in the port, China Ocean Shipping will have a 17.5 per cent interest, while P&amp;O and Swire will each own 25 per cent. In April last year, P&amp;O sold China Merchants an 8.1 per cent stake in Modern Terminals, an operator of Hong Kong's container port, for Pounds 55m. Swire owns 13 per cent of MTL.</p>

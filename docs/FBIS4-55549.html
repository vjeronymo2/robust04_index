			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, and Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert of the Hungarian  Socialist Party, by Ivan Gador; place and date not given:  "Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday in Politics? -- Laszlo Bekesi  and Ivan Peto Talk About the Coalition Possibilities"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Not yet knowing the election  results, political scientist Attila Agh said that the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] are like Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday to each other.  They might not really want each other but they cannot live  without each other. Can you accept this view?    [Peto] [passage omitted] The MSZP has a chance to get an  absolute majority. Therefore, technically, the Socialists do  not need us. However, politically they do. A coalition  government is more useful for the country in all respects than a  one-party government. However, it is no use denying that a good  number of MSZP members treat the dilemma of a coalition or a  one-party arrangement as a simple technical matter and tend, for  this reason, toward the former. [passage omitted]    [Gador] In recent days, many guesses have surfaced about the  MSZP's actual direction. Whether it will support the  Bekesi-type social-liberal line -- this is actually the party's  accepted program -- or follow a separate road in the hope of a  large-scale victory.    [Bekesi] Certain subjective intentions and ideas --  especially in the current situation -- obviously do emerge.  However, what Attila Agh said is an objective necessity,  however we look at it. To use the slogan of a well-known film:  "You cannot do it on your own...." Especially because -- this  might sound like a commonplace -- the country is in a difficult  situation. This situation can be described in terms of three  typical attributes: The economic crisis has become deeper, the  etatist governing of the past four years has created nausea and  much damage, and, according to 2.8 million voters -- the two  parties together received this number of votes -- the way out of  this can only be found by implementing a modernization program.  A social-liberal economic policy is clearly required to  restrain the economic crisis and establish the conditions for  growth. This can only be implemented by a coalition government  of this structure. In other words, it cannot indeed be done  alone. The progressive political forces have to work together,  otherwise the trust will be lost. A close cooperation is  primarily in the interest of the party that receives the most  votes. I do not think this need be further explained. In  addition to this, we need not make very great efforts for our  parties to cooperate. As Peto also mentioned, the major  features of our programs can be harmonized even if experts have  disagreements on minor issues. However, these can be bridged.  We have complete agreement on the essential issues, for example  that etatism has to be eliminated: The "withdrawal of the  state," or deregulation is one of the most important tasks.    [Gador] In other words, among other things, you agree that  the citizens should be left in peace and they need not be told  every day what to do.    [Bekesi] Certainly. The state must not oppress people,  their lives, or the economy. It might be naivete on my part but  I believe that since 53 percent of the electors have voted for  this program then they have only authorized us to implement this  program. The electors believe that this program can  successfully be implemented together. Therefore, their  confidence does not only apply separately but it also obliges us  to cooperate. If this is so, then it is our duty to overcome  the mistrust that undoubtedly exists between our parties. This  is in the interest of both parties.  <H5>  Bekesi: Realistically, Logically </H5>   [Gador] However, the MSZP received almost twice as many  votes as the SZDSZ. I very well remember that, from the first  moment to the last, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] alluded  to the fact that the majority of Hungarian society had voted for  them: These votes meant that they were right. Are you sure  that this false euphoria will not capture the MSZP?    [Bekesi] If we are realistic and logical, we do not think in  terms of parliamentary arithmetic and the party will not be  overcome by the arrogance of power just because it got more  votes than its partner. Overvaluing the numerical success of  the elections can also be a very visible lesson for my party. I  know that 1.8 million people voted for us in the first round,  but even if I had never learned mathematics, I would know how  little this is compared with the 10.5 million Hungarian  citizens. We also have to recognize that, even together with  the SZDSZ's 1 million votes, the two parties only have less than  28 percent of society's and 33 percent of the electors'  confidence; therefore, we have no right to any kind of  authoritarian behavior. We must cooperate with society and, to  be able to do this, mainly with each other.    [Gador] This recognition is respectable. However, does this  mean that you will not use any "power" superiority when the  probable coalition talks are started after the second round and  the offices and ministerial positions are allocated?    [Bekesi] Let me recall the agreement between Helmut Schmidt  and Hans-Dietrich Genscher when the Social Democrats ended up  with more than 40 percent at the elections while the Free  Democrats did not get more than 7 or 8 percent. The allocation  of ministerial positions was decided by sober consideration  rather than by the proportion of the parliamentary  representation. They governed successfully at the time. This  is what is before our eyes! [passage omitted]    [Gador] Politicians of two parties, who have very  different backgrounds, are sitting here and are agreeing on all  the important issues, and they might at most be politely and  quietly debating each other's arguments and conclusions. I do  not wish to be cynical: Hungarians have been dreaming about  this. However, is this not only a case of what the conservative  politicians and journalists accuse you of, namely that you want  to achieve a two- third majority in parliament, and can then  even legally rewrite the Constitution. Many people believe --  and the predecessors of the Socialists are an example of this --  that uncontrolled and uncontrollable power is bound to become  distorted.    [Peto] Every kind of power can be abused at any time;  however, it might not be worth it. This kind of policy does not  work in the long run, and not even in the short term nowadays....    [Bekesi] And we do not wish to fail.    [Peto] A possible two-thirds majority can be used, rather  than abused, because, for example, the parliamentary order of  procedure can be changed in such a way that parliament will  indeed be able to function. In the meantime, the rules that we  are planning would significantly expand the rights of the  opposition. This is what we have been saying for years,  actually....    [Bekesi] A new law on local authorities and the media should  be made....    [Peto] If I wanted to speak with pathos, I would say that  the SZDSZ has not been fighting for basic democratic rights for  years so as to become anti-democratic now that it may come to  power. [passage omitted]    [Bekesi] Uncontrolled and uncontrollable power is indeed  frightening. It must not exist. The MSZP, just like any other  party, only has a chance for successful governing in a  coalition, otherwise it will fail. This will not change whether  we get 48 or 52 percent after the second round. I repeat: The  dominance and the ministerial seats have to be decided on the  basis of rational consideration rather than in accordance with  the parliamentary power relations after 29 May. The country --  and among others, to maintain its prestige, the MSZP -- needs a  rational government that is able to operate and which is  professionally impeccable. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCCLURE'S INTERCEPTION PAYS OFF FOR CORONA DEL MAR  </P> <P> Bud McClure pays his son, John, $100 for every interception or sack he makes  for the Corona del Mar High School football team.  </P> <P> But John McClure's interception Thursday night against University will be worth  more than the $100 bill his father will hand him this morning.  </P> <P> The defensive back intercepted Brad Vail's pass at the Corona del Mar 12-yard  line with 43 seconds remaining to preserve a 17-13 victory over University in a  Sea View League game at Irvine High School.  </P> <P> The victory guaranteed third place in the league and a spot in the Southern  Section Division VI playoffs for the Sea Kings (5-4-1, 2-2-1 in league).  University dropped to 4-6, 2-3.  </P> <P> "That was McClure's biggest play of the year," Corona del Mar Coach Dave  Holland said. "It put us in the playoffs."  </P> <P> University nearly stole the game, and the playoff berth, away in the final  minute.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar's Tom Hess kicked a 36-yard field goal with 1 minute 12 seconds  remaining to give the Sea Kings a 17-13 lead.  </P> <P> University then marched from its five-yard line to Corona del Mar's 17 in only  37 seconds. Vail completed four consecutive passes for 61 yards on the drive.  </P> <P> But it was Vail's last pass that mattered.  </P> <P> Vail rolled to his left and lobbed the ball to the left side. With no  University player close to the ball, McClure shot under it and pulled it in.  </P> <P> "I was rolling out with the quarterback," McClure said. "It (the ball) was  tipped and I was the lucky guy to get to it."  </P> <P> McClure's interception capped a strong second half for Corona del Mar, which  rallied from a 13-0 halftime deficit with two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Kevin Murphy scored on a one-yard run with 2:12 left in the third quarter to  cut the deficit to 13-7. George Dickson caught a nine-yard pass from Chad  Woolsey to put Corona del Mar ahead, 14-13, with 6:07 left in the game.  </P> <P> "The difference was that we were able to move the ball in the second half,"  Holland said. "In the first half, University was running the ball at will on  us."  </P> <P> University scored on its first two possessions and outrushed Corona del Mar,  162 yards to 27, in the first half.  </P> <P> Marc Walker put University in front, 7-0, on a one-yard run with 5:05 left in  the first quarter. University pushed the lead to 13-0 with 10:14 remaining in  the half when Jerry Apana caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from Vail.  </P></p>

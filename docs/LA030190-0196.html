			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA'S QINTEX TO SELL 232 ACRES IN DANA POINT PLANNED FOR A RESORT;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: DEVELOPERS ARE SAID TO BE INTERESTED IN THE MONARCH BEACH  PROPERTY, BOUGHT FOR $131 MILLION, AND IN THE HEADLANDS, ANOTHER OCEANFRONT  PARCEL.  </P> <P> After insisting for months that it intended to build a plush resort in the  Orange County beach town of Dana Point, an Australian company said Wednesday it  will instead sell its 232 prime acres overlooking the ocean.  </P> <P> Qintex's lenders have been trying to unload its Australian television stations  and resorts to recover more than $1 billion in loans.  </P> <P> Stock analysts suggest the Dana Point land is so loaded with debt that the  company won't realize much -- if any -- profit from the sale. So selling it has  been a low priority.  </P> <P> In fact, the land still isn't officially on the market, said Kevin Wallace, a  Qintex executive in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Other developers, including some Japanese interests, are said by brokers to be  very interested in the Quintex property and a second oceanfront parcel in Dana  Point that Qintex once had an option to buy.  </P> <P> But some experts say the market is weaker than it was last year, when Qintex  bought the property.  </P> <P> Here's why:  </P> <P> * Competition gets tougher as hotels proliferate along the Orange County coast,  a trend fueled by the proximity of millions of customers in the Los Angeles  metro area and a glut of resorts in Hawaii.  </P> <P> * Dana Point, which incorporated only last year, will likely be tougher on  development than county government.  </P> <P> * It's harder to borrow money given the turmoil in the lending industry and the  junk bond market, so there aren't as many buyers bidding up land prices.  </P> <P> * A developer might have to own both parcels to make the most money from them,  since only one has access to a golf course, a necessity for a resort.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the parcels are among only a handful of prime oceanfront  sites left so close to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Qintex raised eyebrows when it bought the 232 acres at Monarch Beach for $131  million.  </P> <P> Stock analysts suggest Qintex borrowed at least that much. With accrued  interest the company may need to get as much as $150 million to break even on  land that sold for only $32 million two years earlier. Monarch Beach has a golf  course.  </P> <P> The sellers, local developers Stein-Brief Group and Hawaiian mega-developer  Christopher B. Hemmeter, had government approval to build a huge hotel  patterned after Hearst Castle at San Simeon. Qintex contemplated a smaller,  plusher hotel along the lines of the nearby Ritz-Carlton, an exclusive, luxury  hotel.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Qintex took an option to buy the other, 115-acre parcel in Dana  Point called the Headlands for a stiff $120 million. It planned to build homes  and perhaps another hotel there, which would have had access to the  Qintex-owned golf course just up the coast at Monarch Beach. (There's no room  to build a course on the Headlands.)  </P> <P> But Qintex couldn't make the payments and the option lapsed after Qintex spent  $12 million. In fact, Qintex was beginning to unravel late last year when its  bankers wouldn't lend it the money for its biggest deal, the purchase of the  MGM/UA film studios. Qintex went into receivership shortly afterward.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Headlands' owner, the Chandler family, said earlier that  the family took the property off the market while it completes a market study.  </P> <P> Among the suitors for the Headlands are Stein-Brief, now flush with cash from  selling the Monarch Beach property to Qintex for a spectacular profit.  Stein-Brief is "interested," said principal David Stein, though "not pursuing  it aggressively."  </P> <P> And Dana Point City Manager William O. Talley said executives of a Japanese  company recently visited City Hall to ask about the zoning on the property.  </P> <P> The city of 28,000 is watching both parcels anxiously, since it has few  industries other than tourism and hotels mean tax revenue.  </P> <P> But the Headlands is also the city's most prominent geographical feature and  developing it is likely to stir a fairly strong slow-growth sentiment.  </P> <P> Unlike Monarch Beach, the Headlands has no government approvals to build.  Getting them could mean a yearslong, costly fight -- possibly against stiff  opposition -- at City Hall and the Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Qintex is one of several high-flying Australian companies shot down by heavy  debt, ambitious expansions and high interest rates in Australia that are being  broken up and sold.  </P> <P> "It's a buyer's market now," said Edward Falkiner of the Australian stock  brokerage Ord Minnett.  </P> <P> "There are cheap television stations, cheap breweries, cheap shopping centers."  </P> <P> QINTEX IN DANA POINT  </P> <P> Qintex is planning to sell 232 acres in the Monarch Beach area of Dana Point,  where the company had planned to build a resort hotel. Qintex also held an  option to purchase the nearby Headlands, but the option lapsed late last year.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Yeltsin upset over Berlin farewell plan President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the west not to humiliate Russia after a row blew up in Germany over plans to exclude Russian troops from a farewell parade of Allied forces from Berlin. American, British and French troops are due to mark the departure from Berlin with celebrations organised by the city authorities on June 18, nearly 50 years after Berlin surrendered to the Red Army. But the Russians have been told they cannot take part. And Chancellor Helmut Kohl has excluded them from the federal government's send-off, to be held in Berlin on September 8. The German government and western allies have agreed on separate ceremonies on the grounds that the role of the Russian troops as an occupying force was very different from that of the west. The planned farewell celebrations will be discussed by Mr Kohl and Mr Yeltsin, who arrives in Germany tomorrow for an official visit, and final details are due to be settled this week. Russia has been offered two civilian ceremonies in Berlin and in the southern city of Weimar on August 31, which Mr Yeltsin will attend. Moscow has made clear however that it sees plans for a separate send-off as shabby treatment. Mr Yeltsin, reflecting hurt national pride, said yesterday during Victory Day celebrations in Moscow: 'It is important to remember just one thing. 'Russia must always be addressed in a tone of respect because our people will never accept anything else from any country, such is the will and testament of those who died defending the honour and independence of our Motherland.'</p>

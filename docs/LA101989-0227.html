			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BILL INTRODUCED TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAXES, EXPAND IRAS  </P> <P> Two Republican senators, claiming support from the Bush Administration and more  than half the Senate, introduced a bill today to cut capital gains taxes and  expand tax-deferred Individual Retirement Accounts.  </P> <P> "This plan provides opportunities and incentives for all Americans," Sen.  William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) told a news conference. "It's good for both savers  and investors. And it's good for America."  </P> <P> President Bush campaigned last year on a pledge to cut capital gains taxes.  Over objections of Democratic leaders, the House in September approved a  reduction endorsed by the Administration. That legislation did not address  IRAs.  </P> <P> Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), co-sponsor of the bill, claimed to have between 55  and 58 votes for it in the 100-member Senate.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in FAR Part 150, &sect;150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal, state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project grants must be submitted to the FAA Detroit Airports District Office in Belleville, Michigan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The County of Kalamazoo submitted to the FAA noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from June 20, 1989, through November 18, 1993. The Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on March 1, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 15, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of the study completion to the year 1995. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 18, 1993, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period would have been deemed to be approval of such program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitted program contained sixteen (16) proposed actions for noise mitigation. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outright approval was granted for 15 of the 16 specific program elements. One proposed element to extend Runway 35 1,000 feet was disapproved pending submission of additional information regarding air traffic safety and efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports on May 17, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and documents which comprised the submittal to the FAA, are available for review at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., room 617, Washington, DC 20591;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville, Michigan 48111; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, 5235 Portage Road, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49002. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Issued in Belleville, Michigan, August 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Dean C.

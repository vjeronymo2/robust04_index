			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Unions accuse BBC of risking 10,000 jobs BROADCASTING unions yesterday accused the BBC of imposing a 'double whammy' on its staff, which could cost up to 10,000 jobs by 1996. Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union, predicted that this would be the scale of losses arising from internal recommendations about the future of the corporation and the move towards buying services in the open market. Bectu yesterday distributed the confidential summary conclusions of the 15 BBC task forces examining the corporation's role. Proposals include increasing use of independent producers, closing Radio 5 in its present form, floating BBC Education as a private limited company and closing BBC World Service TV unless it becomes self-financing by March 1994. None of the recommendations are BBC policy. The board of management and the governors will begin discussing the proposals next month. As Bectu distributed copies of the documents, the union began ballotting its 14,000 BBC members for a day of industrial action on May 15 to express lack of confidence in the BBC management. One task force document  - The BBC: The Standard Setter  - is severely critical of the corporation's decision making. It looked at a range of BBC decisions, such as those on starting Daytime TV and creating Radio 5. Defence and expansion of territory had been the most potent motivation in Daytime TV, it said. With Radio 5, structural changes had been made to solve editorial problems. 'The decision-making process would fall short of high public-service standards on the grounds that not enough neutral, well-researched information on crucial questions was fed into the decisions,' the report says. Another  - The Mission  - admitted that Channel 4 had ended the BBC's monopoly of culturally adventurous programme making, that ITV was outperforming the BBC in popular drama, and that between 1987 and 1991 there had been no BBC dramatisations of classic literary works. At a press conference yesterday Mr Lennon said the move to the outside market was costing the corporation money. Earlier this year the BBC had sold 60 years of stock scenery items for Pounds 75,000. The purchaser charged the BBC Pounds 1,100 for the hire of just three of the items for two days. Bectu fears that the structure and programme capacity of the BBC could be seriously weakened before the new national heritage department under Mr David Mellor has a chance to look at the future role and financing of the BBC. Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the corporation, has already made it clear he will reject some of the task force recommendations such as the privatisation of BBC orchestras and levels of contracting out.</p>

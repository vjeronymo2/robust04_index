The  alliance opposed to President Borhanoddin Rabbani used Scud and  Organ [as received] missiles to shell government positions.  [passage omitted]    Afghan diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia have told AL-HAYAH  that Rabbani's condition for agreeing to a truce is for  Hekmatyar to completely sever his links with the militias and  the communists and hand over all the heavy weapons in his  possession to the Defense Ministry. He also demanded strong  guarantees from high-level circles that the Hezb-e Eslami  [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] will not try to violate the  cease-fire again or participate in any "future conspiracy to  seize power" in the country.    The sources also emphasized that the Afghan presidency is  not  prepared at all to hold talks with Dostam and his allies. They  quoted Rabbani's sources as saying that Rabbani is willing to  hold general elections under international supervision, as  stated in the Mecca declaration, provided that the elections be  held six months after the end of the head of state's term.

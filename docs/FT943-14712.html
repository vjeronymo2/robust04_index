			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Lyonnais losses Yesterday's French parliamentary report into losses at state-owned Credit Lyonnais makes sobering reading. The document describes 'incompetence, imprudence and lack of seriousness' at the helm of one of Europe's largest banks, which made a net loss of FFr6.9bn last year. Additionally, it identifies contradictions in the French state's role as shareholder. In view of grave past errors by the bank and the regulatory authorities, there is clearly a need for the greatest vigilance on the terms of the rescue package proposed for the bank by the Paris government. France traditionally has regarded nationalised banks as a way of expanding economic policy muscle. Yet the state generally seems not to have encouraged actively the management decisions leading to Credit Lyonnais' troubles. On the other hand, the finance ministry failed to carry out its duty to check the build-up of problematic assets from the late 1980s onwards. In its involvement with Credit Lyonnais, the public sector appears to have reaped the worst of bargains: minimum control and maximum losses. The difficulties stem from ill-judged corporate loans, property losses, and an unprofitable drive to expand internationally. It would be wrong to blame these problems purely on public sector parentage. As the US savings and loans saga illustrates, there is no shortage of examples of private sector institutions that have had to be bailed out at the cost of the taxpayer, after suffering large losses from imprudent activities. Yet the cloying relationships in the French governmental establishment may have contributed to the excessive amount of leeway given to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, a former director of the French treasury, who headed Credit Lyonnais up to last year. Top French civil servants can over-estimate their ability to circulate faultlessly among public sector jobs. In a more transparent system, Credit Lyonnais' mistakes might have been corrected in a more timely fashion. The question now is how the bank can rebuild its balance sheet and profitability. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new chairman, has launched a radical programme of cost-cutting and asset sales. He has orchestrated a large package of public sector aid, including FFr3.5bn in direct government capital injections. The European Commission has indicated it will closely scrutinise the measures for possible breaches of competition rules. Brussels must make clear that it will approve help for the bank only if it is accompanied by measures likely to secure eventual privatisation. Restoring Credit Lyonnais' fortunes will require hard decisions. The pity is that they were not made earlier.</p>

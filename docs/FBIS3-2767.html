During the meeting Jiang expressed appreciation of fruitful  cooperation between Orbis and China, hoping that Orbis will make  greater contributions to the work of the prevention and control  of blinding diseases in the world.    Foot said the flying eye hospital has conducted the most  successful cooperation with the Chinese Ministry of Public  Health and run training courses on ophthalmology in Taiyuan,  Shanxi Province, since its founding in 1982.    He told Jiang that Orbis has decided to present the Chinese  government with the DC-8 special plane that the hospital once  used, as an exhibit and a symbol of peace, cooperation and  friendship.    "We welcome your decision," Jiang said.    Up to now, the hospital has helped restore the sight of more  than 8,000 blind people. More than 7,000 eye doctors have been  trained by the hospital.    Chen Minzhang, Chinese minister of public health,  participated in the meeting.</p>

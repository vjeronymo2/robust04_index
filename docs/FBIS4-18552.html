			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgium and Holland are going to cooperate more  closely in matters concerning asylum-seeekers. The two  countries will exchange information about asylum-seekers to  prevent them from travelling to one country when their  application for political asylum has already been refused in the  other. Efforts will also be made to include Germany in the  scheme.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (12): Caution prevails - Japan / The growth in new Japanese investments is being hampered by the stagnation of the economy THE recent stabilising of the Tokyo stock exchange and a spate of public offerings by smaller companies are encouraging Japan's venture capital sector. However, the bursting of the country's asset bubble and the squeeze in capital flow, prompting rapid restructuring of investment portfolios at venture capital companies, has scarred relationships with businesses in which they invested in the late eighties. Venture capital in Japan has taken a different form from that in the US and Europe, where capital is invested in high-risk companies starting up. Japanese venture capital companies search for mature companies with potential to be listed publicly and look for future profits through flotations and underwriting. During the sharp appreciation of share prices in the late eighties, venture capital companies made vast investments into businesses preparing to go public, accumulating shares ahead of listing. But the sharp fall in listings and the slump in the stock market has hurt most venture capital companies, and some groups have been forced to liquidate due to the increase in bankruptcies and bad loans. Yamatane Investment, a venture capital subsidiary of Yamatane Securities, was dissolved earlier this year, with the investments shifted to the parent. Many venture capital companies are now looking to sell off their investments. Businesses are increasingly frustrated as the venture capital groups are forcing businesses to buy back shares, or selling the shares to larger companies, forcing the businesses to become a part of a keiretsu, or industrial grouping. According to a survey by Nikkei Venture, a business magazine, venture capital investment in fiscal year 1992, posted a decline for the first time since the survey started 10 years ago. The outstanding investment balance at the end of last March fell 1.7 per cent to Y876.1bn, while the loan balance fell 9.6 per cent to Y1,362bn. As for new investments, growth is being hampered by the stagnation of the economy. 'We have the capital and are intent on investing, but there is a lack of worthwhile businesses,' says an official at a second tier venture capital company. Venture capital companies are more cautious of the rising risks from investments due to the rise in bankruptcies. Last fiscal year, venture capital companies faced 71 bankruptcies in businesses in which they had invested up 69 per cent from the previous year. Some venture capital companies, in the meantime, have started to focus on start-up companies which are not necessarily looking for a public listing, but need financing. Mr David Wilson, at 3iBJ, a joint venture capital company between Industrial Bank of Japan and 3i, the UK development venture group, says, 'Investment activity relating to young companies is moving up, and there are many new companies wanting to do new things.' The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is also trying to encourage the start up of new companies and last year set up a commission to study new ways to promote venture capital investment in new high-risk but small businesses. The commission, composed of university professors and bankers, is studying tax breaks for venture capital companies and the deregulation of over-the-counter listings of the stocks of venture capital companies. Mr Takatoshi Takahashi, deputy director of Miti's machinery and information industries bureau, says that the current economic situation is a chance for the smaller venture companies. 'The Japanese economy is going through a structural change, and smaller companies have an advantage,' he says. Larger companies are finding difficulty in coping with the end of life time employment, the gradual unravelling of the keiretsu, and traditional relationships, and the shift from mass production to limited versions of products. However, he also acknowledges the financing problems facing start-up companies, and adds that Miti is aiming to support entrepreneurs and new businesses through new loan programmes. The recent emergency economic package announced in September, included an increase in loan facilities to small and medium companies by over Y1,000bn over the next year, and tax incentives for machinery and equipment purchased during the year to September next year. The easing of various bureaucratic restrictions by the new government under Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, is also expected to eliminate regulatory barriers barring new businesses, and may stimulate a number of start-up companies. The cabinet wants the 11,000 regulations of the bureaucracies decreased by 10 per cent in the near term. Meanwhile, areas in which venture capital companies currently see growth are those in businesses related to environment conservation, health, and medical and bio-technology. Venture capital companies are also focusing on the sharp growth in south-east Asia. Overseas investments by venture capital rose 6.2 per cent last year to Y130.5bn, as the recent rallies in the Asian markets and the number of new listings encouraged capital to flow into countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.  ---------------------------------------- OUTSTANDING INVESTMENT BALANCE BY VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANIES  ---------------------------------------- Fiscal year                    Ybn  ---------------------------------------- 1983                          70.6 1984                         114.8 1985                         221.1 1986                         241.8 1987                         283.6 1988                         359.8 1989                         502.4 1990                         742.5 1991                         890.9 1992                         876.1  ---------------------------------------- Source: Nikkei Venture  ----------------------------------------</p>

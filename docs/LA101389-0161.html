			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> FIGURES POINT TO DROP IN CONSTRUCTION OF HOMES AND APARTMENTS IN 1989  </P> <P> It looks as if construction of new homes and apartments will be down in Orange  County this year. That is the tale new figures from the Construction Industry  Research Board tell.  </P> <P> As of August, with a third of 1989 left, builders had obtained building permits  for just 11,534 units. Last year -- for the entire year -- builders obtained  23,455; the year before they got 24,698.  </P> <P> Permits are an approximate indicator of construction activity because most  units are built within a few months of obtaining a permit. Here is how this  year's permits break down through August: Houses accounted for 5,903 permits,  while such attached housing as condominiums and apartments totaled 5,631.  </P></p>

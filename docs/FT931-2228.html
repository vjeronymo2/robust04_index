			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kawakami ousted from board of Yamaha THREE generations of family rule ended at Yamaha, the world's largest maker of musical instruments, with the decision yesterday to oust Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, grandson of the company's founder, from the board. Mr Kawakami, who was suddenly forced to resign as president of Yamaha in February last year, is also relinquishing his position as a board member in June. He will become a director of a little-known affiliate company, Yamaha Resort. Mr Kawakami's resignation last year as president had been triggered by a demand from Yamaha's labour union for him to take responsibility for the company's poor performance. The latest coup was triggered by the displeasure of company management at his comments to the media after his resignation from the presidency. Earlier this month, an article based on an interview with Mr Kawakami and describing his anger at being ousted in a boardroom coup appeared in a popular weekly magazine. 'Those comments . . . have damaged the company's reputation,' a company representative explained. Mr Hideto Eguchi, president of Yamaha Motor, the motorcycle manufacturer and member of the Yamaha group, is also resigning as chairman of the musical instrument maker, just one year after he assumed the post. Yamaha said it had no plans to fill the chairmanship after Mr Eguchi vacates the post after a board meeting in June. Mr Eguchi will concentrate on the motor business, which faces an increasingly difficult trading environment. Mr Kawakami's departure formally ends the rule of the Kawakami family, which began in 1897 with the establishment of the company by Mr Kawakami's grandfather. Yamaha has been hit by a plunge in demand for musical instruments. In the six months to September it reported a 43.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y3.87bn (Dollars 33.1m) and cut its interim dividend. Brother Industries, a maker of small machinery, plans to transfer production of portable electronic typewriters to a US plant for export to Japan and Asia, AP-DJ reports. The company manufactures models in the US and Europe for sale in those areas, but to date has been making units for Asian markets in Japan.</p>

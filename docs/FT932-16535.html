			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Two former Italian PMs investigated TWO FORMER Italian prime ministers, Mr Giulio Andreotti and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, were served notice yesterday that they were under investigation for alleged illicit financing of their Christian Democrat party. The moves amount to a further widening of Italy's political corruption scandal, which has led to the resignation of five ministers and investigations into a large number of businessmen and politicians, including former Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi. Mr Andreotti, who was advised by Palermo magistrates a week ago that he was under investigation for alleged collusion with the Mafia, was warned of a new inquiry into party funding by Milan magistrates. Mr Forlani's inquiry is being carried out by Rome magistrates investigating the awarding of contracts for road building by the state group Anas. Until recently, Mr Forlani was secretary of the Christian Democrat party. Last night Mr Andreotti told the Financial Times he could not recall the transaction to which his inquiry relates, dating from the campaign for the general election in April last year. 'I don't remember. . . But this was election time and you have to make a lot of telephone calls,' he said. He was also dismissive of the moves to incriminate him. Parliament could meet today to consider whether to waive immunity on Mr Andreotti, a life senator. Mr Andreotti's lawyers said yesterday: 'We are completely and unconditionally at the disposition of the Milan magistrates in whom we have absolute faith.' This declaration contrasted with the vigorous reaction by Mr Andreotti and the Christian Democrat party after Palermo magistrates sent a 256-page dossier on the former premier to parliament last week. Milan magistrates are understood to want to question Mr Andreotti about payment of L250m (Pounds 114,000) allegedly arranged by him via his friend Mr Giuseppe Ciarapico, owner of Roma football team and a prominent financier, who was arrested on charges of fraud relating to a subsidiary of state holding company Efim, now in liquidation. The payment was allegedly made to help the Social Democrat party, one of the Christian Democrats' coalition partners, in the 1992 elections. Mr Andreotti is alleged to have orchestrated it.</p>

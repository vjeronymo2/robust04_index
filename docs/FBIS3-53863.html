			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Salih al-Qallab in Aden] </F>   [Excerpts] Now that an agreement has been initialed among  the political forces in Yemen, the Yemeni crisis, which has been  going on since August and which has recently reached the point  of armed confrontation, has taken a wide step toward  reconciliation. However, it cannot be said that everything is  definitively over and that the clouds have rolled by, never to  return unless this agreement is implemented in accordance with a  definite timeframe.    A good reading of this agreement will show that the Yemeni  unity, which began in May 1990, is heading toward a  confederation This is clear from the agreement's emphasis on  decentralizing the Yemeni republic's administration. In fact,  this would in any case prove to be a thousand times better than  a shaky merger liable to explode at any moment. In addition to  the decentralized administration, the agreement stipulates  redeployment of forces and removing military posts situated in  and outside towns.    AL-DUSTUR has learned that efforts are now being made to  prepare for a large ceremony so that Salih al-Bid can sign the  agreement under King Husayn's patronage and in the presence of  Omani Sultan Qabus and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.  Other Arab officials may be invited to this signing ceremony in  addition to the diplomatic corps. Obviously, the site of this  celebration in which the president and his deputy will meet for  the first time in five months, is still a controversial issue.  [passage omitted]    A senior Yemeni source which participated in drafting the  agreement, regarded now by the Yemenis as a new proclamation of  unity, said that al-Bid, who has been residing in Aden since  August, informed the dialogue committee that he was prepared to  meet with the president in any place and at any time that the  committee sees fit and that he has no reservations on anything  that is based on the contents of the agreement.    While it is true that the agreement has ended the tension  and  imparted an atmosphere of relief represented by the drop in the  dollar price from 75 to 50 Yemeni rials on the black market  within hours of the announcement of the agreement, optimists put  the rate of possible success in implementing the agreement at  only 40 percent. [passage omitted]    It is well known that there are currently four armies of  different sizes and diverging loyalties in Yemen. These are the  Sanaa-based army which takes orders from President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, the Aden-based army which takes orders from  'Ali Salim al- Bid, an army owing allegiance to 'Ali Nasir  Muhammad, the former president of the former People's Democratic  Republic of Yemen, and paramilitary militias which belong to the  reform movement led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar.    Reliable information sources say that all the Yemeni groups  which reached the agreement the day before yesterday have agreed  to seek the assistance of Jordanian military expertise to  reunite and rehabilitate the Yemeni Armed Forces. If all goes  well, a Jordanian Army force will travel to Yemen within three  weeks. [passage omitted]</p>

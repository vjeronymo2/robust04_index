			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Discomfort in Europe's south In the hearts of Europe's policymakers, hope springs eternal. Faster-than-expected recovery from recession has revived the idea that a group of countries centred on Germany could attain economic and monetary union as early as 1997. Yet there is an unfortunate corollary to the improved prospects for the European 'core'. Economic divergences in the continent's periphery, particularly the EU's southern members, are increasing at a disconcerting pace. Action to cope with the south's economic challenges has been half-hearted or curbed by political difficulties, or both. This is underlined by developments as diverse as the problems dogging Italy's 1995 budget plans, Spain's rejection of advice on structural reform from the International Monetary Fund, and the delay to Greece's privatisation programme. These are matters of concern for the whole EU. A growing gap in economic performance between north and south would greatly strain the EU's cohesion. It would further impair the EU's ability to help resolve the troubles on its Mediterranean fringes, increasing the chances that north African instability could spill over to Europe. In addition, by undermining necessary efforts to restructure budgetary and farm support arrangements, a widening north-south gap would upset the EU's planned enlargement to eastern and central Europe. Economic shortcomings The shift in Europe's centre of gravity after the fall of the Berlin Wall has helped to expose the south's economic shortcomings. Corporations seeking sites for investment regard southern Europe with more scepticism than a few years ago. In the five years before 1989, annual average growth in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece was 3.5 per cent, 0.3 percentage points above the EU average. Between 1990 and 1994, growth in these countries has fallen to 1.2 per cent, 0.4 points below the European average. Greece has been a chronic under-performer for the last decade, but below-average growth in Spain, Portugal and Italy is much more recent. Efforts to reduce inflation differentials have been only partly successful, and prices in all four countries (particularly in Greece) are still rising at beyond the EU's 3 per cent average. While monetary policy has remained anti-inflationary, fiscal performances have become increasingly wayward. According to the Commission's latest forecasts, the four southern states are the sole EU members where government borrowing will exceed 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1995. Rising indebtedness Budgetary imbalances have accentuated government debt build-up, especially in Greece and Italy, where indebtedness is more than 120 per cent of gross domestic product. Excessive public sector indebtedness is not limited to the south, as shown by the examples of Belgium or Sweden. During the next two years, however, according to the Commission's forecasts, debt as a proportion of GDP in the four southern states will continue to grow, whereas it will be falling slightly for most other EU members. Even for Spain and Portugal, the likelihood that debt can approach the Maastricht target of 60 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade is increasingly remote. Deteriorating fiscal positions in the south have disturbed capital markets. Yields on southern Europe's bond markets have risen by about 3 percentage points since January, roughly twice the rise for D-Mark bonds, weighing heavily on the south's recovery potential. The risk is that large budget deficits and high interest rates will be self-feeding impediments to growth and employment. In these circumstances, governments seeking a return to sustained growth are walking a tightrope. The south's structural weaknesses cannot be overcome without painful measures, particularly in reforming labour markets and welfare systems. The implemention of such corrective action leads to political difficulties, further lowering investor confidence. Yet without such restructuring, the task of adjustment will become still more difficult. If growth migrates permanently from the south, the EU is unlikely to be robust enough to enlarge itself to the east.</p>

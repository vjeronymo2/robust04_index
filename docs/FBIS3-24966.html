			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mali has been without a prime minister since  yesterday following the resignation of Abdoulaye Sekou Sow. His  resignation seems to be the result of a series of disagreements  with elements of the radical wing of the ruling Alliance for  Democracy in Mali [ADEMA]. Djibril Mboj has the details:    [Begin Mboj recording] At the beginning of the week, a local  newspaper was already wondering whether Abdoulaye Sekou Sow had  run out breath. On 12 April 1993, 62-year-old Sekou Sow, who  has a raucous voice and a nonchalant gait, was entrusted with  the weighty task of getting the country out of the crisis -- the  persistent economic crisis -- and more especially the school  crisis, which has been almost a permanent fixture in Mali for  more than three years and which led to the resignation of the  first government of the Third Republic. He very quickly  distinguished himself as a man of dialogue who favors consensus.  He was able to contain certain excesses and even found  compromise solutions. Unfortunately, the demands by  schoolchildren and workers continued to be more pressing,  especially after the devaluation of the CFA franc.    Furthermore, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow is reported to have felt  abandoned by his own supporters because the support he expected  to get from the majority ADEMA party was not forthcoming. Added  to this was the 48-hour strike notice by schoolchildren, who set  up roadblocks and burned car tires. All these issues  exasperated the affable sexagenarian, who showed courage,  abnegation, and the desire to do a good job during the 10 months  he spent as head of the government. If his resignation is  accepted by the head of state, there will be a cabinet  reshuffle, the fourth since Alpha Oumar Konare became president  of Mali. [end recording]</p>

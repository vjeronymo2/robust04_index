			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Observer: Pick a job The UK government is planning to privatise - 'contract out' is the official euphemism - the Careers Service, from April 1995. You may like that or not, but what does seem more than a trifle absurd is the choice of some of the department of employment's 43 'franchise areas' for which bids are invited. Number three on the list is the county of Cleveland, and number ten is the County of Humberside. But those thinking of bidding for the contracts to provide Careers Services to those places should think again; the government has plans to abolish them, starting with Cleveland on April 1 1995.</p>

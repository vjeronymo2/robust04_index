			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Un-floating The shift from fixed to floating rate lending in the British financial system was one of the more profound institutional changes to emerge from the inflationary experience of the 1970s and 1980s. There are now signs of a move in the opposite direction, notably in the mortgage market, where fixed interest lending is gradually lengthening in maturity. What are the implications for financial stability and the workings of monetary policy? The widespread use of floating rate debt contracts was a natural response by creditors to unanticipated inflation. In effect, it protected the banking system from the risk inherent in borrowing short and lending long because worries about uncertainty over the future price level were passed to the borrower. The instinctive assumption about the implications for the UK, where the ratio of household debt stands at nearly 60 per cent of GNP, might be that demand would respond more rapidly to changes in interest rates in a floating rate environment. That, indeed, is the argument advanced in a paper on changes in the UK debt structure in the forthcoming Bank of England Bulletin. And it puts the case for an equal and opposite effect if there is a significant increase in the private sector's use of fixed rate debt, arguing that interest rates could be increased quickly, but at lower cost to the private sector. Yet past experience suggests that the monetary transmission mechanism can be more complex. Certainly in the US in the first half of the 1980s, the shift to floating rates appeared, if anything, to make the monetary system less responsive to central bank discipline than under fixed rates. A combination of deregulation and the growth of the swaps market inevitably meant that a bigger change in interest rates was required to bring about a given shift in demand. In the UK, where floating rate mortgage borrowing plays a more important part in the monetary transmission mechanism, swaps are unavailable to the personal sector. But the impact of deregulation on the housing market meant that it took an exceptionally big rise in base rates from 7.5 per cent in May 1988 to 15 per cent in October 1989 to knock house prices on the head in the early 1990s. While the Bank's paper claims to be impressed by the speed of the market response, it felt remarkably slow both then and now, because the inflationary psychology took so long to adjust. How far the maturity of fixed rate lending will continue to extend is a moot point. The Bank's paper hints, very plausibly, that the personal sector may not yet have developed an appetite for long-term fixed rate assets, after the inflationary losses of the past. Nor are the banks and building societies likely to be anxious to abandon the competitive advantage they derive from floating rate retail deposits - although their ability to hedge against mismatched maturities is enhanced by the growth of hedging instruments. But if the process does continue, there is a clear message for the tradeable goods sector: it will bear more of the brunt of any future effort to control inflation because monetary policy will work increasingly through the exchange rate.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Embattled Hafnia merges two banking subsidiaries HAFNIA, the troubled insur-ance group which is fighting for survival, announced that two of its banking subsidiaries will merge. The group also announced yesterday the retirement of 10 senior managers, including Mrs Jette Arnskjold, the chief executive at Hafnia Insurance, and Mr H. E. Johansen, a member of the group board of management. None of those to retire are associated with the irregularities which have been revealed at the group over the past two weeks, Hafnia said. The two banks to merge are Hafnia Merchant Bank, the investment banking arm of the group, and Hafnia Trust &amp; Investment Bank, a portfolio management subsidiary. Last Friday, the Hafnia board decided to cancel a DKr8m (Dollars 1.4m) 'golden handshake' for Mr Per Villum Hansen, who was dismissed from his position as group chief executive in April. Mr Hansen was responsible for the strategic share investments in Danish group Baltica and the Swedish insurance company, Skandia, which are at the root of the group's present financial problems. Chr. Hansen's Laboratorium, the biotechnology group which specialises in enzymes for food production and anti-allergy preparations, is to acquire the allergies subsidiary of Italy's Montedison for DKr305m, the group said. The acquisition of Alergia e Inmmunologia Abello, which has headquarters in Madrid and a turnover of about DKr200m a year, will make Chr. Hansen's allergies subsidiary, Allergisk Laboratorium (ALK), the world's biggest producer of allergen products in the world, the Danish company said.</p>

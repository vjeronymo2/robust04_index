			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FROM BLUES TO 'BROADWAY,' A LIVELY SEASON IN THE ARTS;  </P> <P> MUSIC: CLUBS SHOWCASE LOCAL TALENT WITH LOYAL FOLLOWINGS. STYLES RANGE FROM  METAL ROCK TO ROCKABILLY TO COUNTRY.  </P> <P> The Country Club, the area's longtime showcase of popular music, plans to try  again this year to regain the liquor privileges it lost in November, 1988.  Since losing its right to serve alcohol -- a group of residents had complained  that rowdy club patrons created disturbances in the neighborhood -- the Reseda  club has generally catered to young crowds who will forgo drinking to follow  their favorite speed metal or punk band.  </P> <P> "That's what has kept us alive," said Scott Hurowitz, the club's general  manager. "These kids don't need to drink. They love their bands." The club will  continue to feature metal and punk bands.  </P> <P> On Jan. 20, the Circle Jerks, a Los Angeles-based punk band, will perform at 8  p.m. The show costs $15. And on Jan. 27, two commercial metal bands, Terriff  and Burn, will play. According to promoter Jason Lord, Terriff is close to  being signed by a major record label. The show costs $12.  </P> <P> Hurowitz added that the club, which featured familiar performers like Deborah  Harry, and the Replacements in 1989, will again try to book popular acts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, rock 'n' roll at other venues in the Valley will continue to  highlight local bands with loyal followings and well-known acts. At other clubs  around the Valley:  </P> <P> FM Station: Local metal rock is also this club's forte, and owner Filthy  McNasty said that's not likely to change this year, although he said the North  Hollywood club will try to bring back well-known performers like Dr. Hook, Leon  Russell and Eric Burdon.  </P> <P> "But this club is not going to do too many revival acts," McNasty said. "There  are too many oldies coming back. If we did that, the new groups would stay  away, thinking we don't have any new and hip groups."  </P> <P> McNasty added the club should hold its long-postponed television pilot this  year. The show, FM Station Live, was supposed to be taped last year, but  scheduling conflicts caused several cancellations. The show would tape the  area's best unsigned local bands performing live each week. McNasty said he  hopes to persuade a local or national television station to carry the show.  </P> <P> In coming weeks, the club has booked with an array of local talent: Jan. 17,  Big Guns; Feb. 1, Fire in the Sky; and Feb. 14, Wyld Hearts. Shows cost either  $4 or $5. Doors open at 8:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Palomino: Bill Thomas, owner of the North Hollywood club, said tentative plans  are under way to initiate a weekly "BAM JAM" -- an all-out jam by various local  bands. Discussions are still preliminary, but Thomas hopes to have  representatives from BAM magazine critique the contesting groups.  </P> <P> Otherwise, no major changes are anticipated. Ronnie Mack's Barn Dance, which  was carried on KCSN-FM until the station switched to classical music in  November, will continue each Tuesday night at 9.  </P> <P> On Jan. 16, Mack and a host of other performers will celebrate the Barn Dance's  two-year anniversary. Among the scheduled guests: Big Jay McNeely, whose 1959  pop hit, "There Is Something on Your Mind," made the R&amp;B charts; Gene  Clark, an original member of the Byrds; Carla Olson, lead singer of the  Textones, and singer Lucinda Williams, who performs a variety of folk, country  and blues. Mack said he will keep trying to find radio stations to carry the  concerts, but "we'll continue regardless."  </P> <P> On Jan. 30, Barn Dance will host a special album release party for Chris  Gaffney, recently voted by Music Connection magazine as the second most popular  country act. Gaffney will do a variety of hillbilly, rockabilly, rhythm and  blues, and Cajun music.  </P> <P> Bebop Records and Fine Art: Owner Richard Bruland has fought a nonstop battle  to stay one step ahead of financial disaster, frequently holding benefits to  keep the club alive. For now, Bruland said there is no threat of imminent  closure, and the Reseda club will continue to present its distinctive blend of  rock, pop and alternative music.  </P> <P> Upcoming shows include: Hollis, a female vocalist who combines pop and country,  on Jan. 26; Eugene Chadborne, former member of Shockabilly, on Feb. 6, and This  Great Religion on Feb. 10.  </P> <P> Concerts will remain free, with donations voluntary. Shows begin at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Longhorn Saloon: On Feb. 6, at 8 p.m., the Canoga Park club will celebrate Dave  Durham's 36th birthday with a special tribute, including harmonica player David  McKelvy and singer Dean Dobbins. In the last two years, Dobbins has had three  singles reach the top five in the national independent country charts.  </P> <P> In addition, Silk 'N Spurs, the winners of the California Country Music Assn.'s  Dance Team of the Year, will perform.  </P> <P> Durham of Van Nuys, who was voted songwriter of 1989 by CCMA for his hit  single, "In My Car," also will be treated to Billboard's top 10 country songs  from Feb. 5, 1954, the date of his birth. Among the hits: "I Really Don't Want  to Know," by Eddy Arnold; "Secret Love," by Slim Whitman; and "I Don't Hurt Any  More," by Hank Snow. The songs will be performed by several guest disc jockeys  from Los Angeles-based radio stations.  </P> <P> Durham captured a host of country music awards in the past year. He and his  band, the Bull Durham Band, were voted by CCMA as 1989's best group.  </P></p>

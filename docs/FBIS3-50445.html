[Franco] The constitutional reforms longed for by the  people.  The tranquility and normality of the elections. The curbing of  inflation. The consolidation of our economic growth. The  permanent and effective struggle against starvation and misery.  The eradication of all forms of violence. The recovery of  self-esteem. Health as everyone's legitimate right and school  for all. And finally, for our happiness, winning the World Cup.    [Dal Bosco] What should Brazilians expect from President  Itamar Franco in 1994?    [Franco] Work, being aware of his duties and obligations,  maintaining democratic order, and a strict and direct communion  and unity of purpose with Brazilian society.    [Dal Bosco] Is there any risk of a military coup or a  rupture  in the democratic order in Brazil?    [Franco] No, absolutely not because I firmly believe the  political conditions in our country have matured, and the  democratic institutions have definitely found their direction.  They are becoming more solid as shown by the recent historic  events.    [Dal Bosco] Having governed for one year, do you believe  that  your own expectations have been fulfilled?    [Franco] I believe so. There is no doubt that Brazil has  grown. It has grown to such an extent that this year shows a  GDP growth of nearly 5 percent and a 14 percent growth in  industrial production. Although, it is obvious that the country  still has a very high inflation rate. Therefore, we hope that  with Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan it will  be possible to substantially reduce inflation when fiscal  readjustment goes into effect. In addition the government  desires the patriotic cooperation of Congress and of all  segments of society. Next week I will have been at the head of  the government for one year. I am certain that 1994 will be  very good for the country. If there is nothing else that I can  do, then I will democratically pass the government on to my  successor, hoping that he will find a country that is socially  more just and economically more solid.    [Dal Bosco] Which country would inspire you if you could  somehow magically mold Brazil's future?    [Franco] I am from the working class, by excellence and by  roots, and I have been molded in the class of Alberto Pasqualini  (the Rio Grande do Sul State lawyer is considered to be the  father of the Brazilian working class. He was a town councillor  and a senator, he supported the movement that put Gertulio  Vargas in power in 1930, and he was a minister of state under  Vargas in 1944. Leader and theoretician of the PTB [Brazilian  Labor Party], Pasqualini helped to draw up the party's charter.  In 1948 he published the Fundamental Directives of the Brazilian  Working Class, which was adopted as the bible of the PTB. In  the publication, he defends the thesis of extirpating "social  usury" from the country, something that is contained within the  economic relations that do not take social justice into account.  Pasqualini died in 1960 at the age of 58).    [Dal Bosco] Are you sure that Fernando Henrique Cardoso's  plan will be successful?    [Franco] It is not Cardoso's plan. It is a government plan.  But I can tell you something: I will not allow the country to  fall into a recession, but that is not the case. Never in  modern history has someone supported an economy minister as I  have supported Minister Cardoso. I have just lost two excellent  advisers because they disagreed with the economic plan. One of  them is an excellent ambassador (referring to former Culture  Minister Geronimo Moscardo) and the other is a loyal party  leader and a very good fighter (referring to Deputy Roberto  Freire).    [Dal Bosco] What do you intend to do if you become convinced  that the plan will lead to a recession?    [Franco] If that should happen, something which I do not  believe, I will tell the minister to stop and we will have to  find another alternative.    [Dal Bosco] There are those who contend that you, Mr.  President, support [Finance] Minister Fernando Henrique  [Cardoso] from a technical standpoint, but that in your heart,  you agree with former [government] leader Roberto Freire, who  criticizes high interest rates and recession.    [Franco] The heart has reasons that the mind itself cannot  fathom.    [Dal Bosco] How so, Mr. President?    [Franco] Simply that -- the heart has reasons that the mind  itself cannot fathom.    [Dal Bosco] Are you, Mr. President, in favor of the  reinstatement of the 100,000 civil servants that were dismissed  during the Collor administration?    [Franco] I am in favor of injustices being redressed,  period.  Our first proposal originally contemplated only the  re-examination of those cases that involved a flagrant breach of  the law or an injustice. Furthermore, even according to the  most pessimistic estimates, those cases do not add up to  100,000. If the project were to be passed by the Senate, to  maintain its original spirit and become law, we would then  re-examine the cases of those who believe they have suffered  some damage and plead their reinstatement on a case-by-case  basis. The reinstatement will never be automatically done.    [Dal Bosco] Are you personally in favor of ending the  state's  monopoly in the oil industry and telecommunications in the  constitutional reform?    [Franco] Personally, I am not. However, one has to bear in  mind what decisions and alternatives are the most appropriate  ones for the historical moment we are living in Brazil and for  the current economic and social order.    [Dal Bosco] The CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee]  ...    [Franco] (interrupting) The CPI is an affair that pertains  to  Congress.    [Dal Bosco] Would it be possible to strike an alliance  between the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the  PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] for the forthcoming  presidential elections?    [Franco] What I can tell you with regard to the elections,  is  that the three coming months -- January, February, and March --  will be decisive for the country, since during that period party  affiliations will be decided, government officials who campaign  for election will have to resign, the economic plan will be  under way, and the CPI will issue its final report.    [Dal Bosco] Do you believe, Mr. President, that PC [Farias]  and former president [Fernando] Collor are scheming against you?    [Franco] I do not think that PC is involved in such a thing.  My relationship with him was limited to the election campaign.  I spoke with him on very few occasions.    [Dal Bosco] And how about former President Collor?    [Franco] I think that he is. I read about the accusations he  leveled at me in VEJA, but did not want to answer them.  However, after thinking about it, I decided to write some  lines. (The president excuses himself, leaves the room, and  comes back with a typescript in his hand. He slowly unfolds the  paper and reads the following:) "From the Olympus, located in  the celebrated Casa da Dinda [Collor's official residence in  Brasilia], that deposed little god fires his machine gun of  half-truths and insidious innuendoes seeking to smear other  persons' honor. It seems a most coherent attitude with the  personality and feelings of those who disdain other persons'  uprightness because they do not have it." This is the first time  that I have responded to that individual. Up to now, I had  tried to show my respect for and keep my distance from the  former president of the Republic.    [Dal Bosco] Mr. President, does PC Farias' ghost check  deposited in the account of your secretary Geraldo Faria exist  after all?    [Franco] If there was a ghost check, we did not know about  it  at that time. Furthermore, who would have imagined the  possibility of the existence of ghosts back in 1989? There is a  check for the campaign, but it has not been issued for the  absurd amount that is being said. (Franco refers to the rumor  that it was a check for $700,000, when in fact the only one  found was for $145,000). Besides, Faria is a very tidy person.  He kept all the documents, notes that prove where the money was  spent. The checks for the campaign were even deposited in other  accounts. My account has absolutely nothing. PC Farias or  anybody else may say whatever they want. But, why should only  the election campaign in Minas Gerais be under scrutiny?  Especially in the case of Geraldo Faria, who was not the  treasurer general of the campaign. Are the 1989 election  campaigns of all candidates being delved into? Former President  Collor is facing charges for what he did during his presidency.  One should make it clear that the Superior Electoral Court  approved the PRN's [National Reconstruction Party] accounts at  that time. Why study them now? I, Itamar Franco, was neither  coordinator nor treasurer at either regional or national level.  That was no concern of mine.    [Dal Bosco] The Federal Police seized one of P.C. Farias'  personal appointment books, where he had marked a meeting with  you for April 1990, during Fernando Collor's government. Do you  remember that meeting?    [Franco] I did not see Paulo Cesar Farias after the campaign  ever again. I never called him P.C. because our relations were  always formal. I do not remember having talked to him after  Collor took over power. This is why there is no way I could  have negotiated the nomination of Eliseu Resende to head Vale do  Rio Doce with him. President Collor recommended Resende to head  Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc], not Vale. Resende  was told of his appointment before the swearing-in ceremony,  when he was still at his former public office.    [Dal Bosco] In 1990 you purchased a D-20 pickup truck, and  then exchanged it for two cars. What is the story behind that?    [Franco] I reported everything to the tax department. I kept  the pickup truck for only a few days. I answered some questions  about the matter then. I am almost sure that I also sent a copy  with explanations to Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. I  do not have copies of the documents here, but I can show them to  you later.    [Dal Bosco] A D-20 pickup truck is worth nearly $35,000. Did  you have the money to buy the truck?    [Franco] Of course I had the money to buy it. Otherwise I  would not have made the deal. I did not steal the pickup truck.  My tax record shows that everything was in order.    [Dal Bosco] Does a Republic of Juiz de Fora really exist? Do  you ask its people before making a decision?    [Franco] Such a republic has never existed, nor will it ever  exist. But there is a town called Juiz de Fora that is very  dear to me. It is not only a picture hanging on a wall. Before  making a decision I usually hear the opinions of a large variety  of people, as well as my own heart.    [Dal Bosco] Why did you decide to work in Rio de Janeiro  this  week?    [Franco] There is a very simple reason. I had more than 20  requests for audiences from people or groups established in Rio  de Janeiro. I simply decided to receive those people in the  city.    [Dal Bosco] Didn't you want to send a message to the country  indicating that everything was calm?    [Franco] It might be understood that way. There is calm and  tranquility in the country. There is no need for the president  of the Republic to stay in Brasilia. The country has its  democratic order ensured, and there are no risks. I can tell  you before you ask that I never thought of resigning as  president of the Republic.    [Dal Bosco] Are you tired? Do you wish you could take some  days off to rest?    [Franco] The other presidents did not have vacations,  either.  As far as I can remember the only exception was President  Getulio Vargas. He used to spend a few days at the Palacio Rio  Negro, in Petropolis, in Rio de Janeiro. The president should  have some 20 days or so to rest, in a place of his choice, in  Brazil. Obviously he could not be traveling back and forth. He  would stay at a single place. I only have one more year as  president, and I do not think of that possibility. But I will  ponder about the idea, for the future. After all, everyone has  the right to some rest: journalists, physicians, lawyers, the  president of the Republic. I need the Brazilian press to  understand that, too. Society, I am sure, understands it.    [Dal Bosco] Why did you lose patience with the press in Juiz  de Fora?    [Franco] I recall very well an O GLOBO photographer asking  me  when I left my apartment whether I wanted to talk. I answered  no, and left for a friend's place, but journalists followed me.  I think they should not do that, but I understand that it is  their job. When I arrived at my friend's house, the  housekeeper, who is a humble person, asked the journalists to  withdraw. No one listened. They invaded private property and  followed the car. They entered nearly 70 meters inside the  property. This is no way to earn respect. If they wanted to  take my picture they had a chance when I left my apartment. I  think the incident showed a lack of respect. Where I come from  you do not enter someone else's house without knocking at the  door first. You only trespass through an open door if it is a  church. I would not walk into a friend's house without  knocking, even if the door was open. It is a matter of good  manners. One of these days we will have a more serious  incident. Journalists will find a more courageous housekeeper or  security guard.    [Dal Bosco] But wouldn't a security team avoid the problem?    [Franco] No. I think the incident could have been worse. I  politely asked the reporters to leave. Security guards could  have beaten them. I believe that with security guards it could  have been worse. To tell you the truth I would rather drive my  own car. I don't drive one because I don't like driving.    [Dal Bosco] With no security guards, don't you fear an  attack?    [Franco] Security is necessary, but it depends on where I am  going. I want to have political and democratic visibility.  When I am in my hometown with my daughters I do not think the  bodyguards are necessary. Concerning a possible attack, I have  no fear. U.S. presidents move in armored helicopters and  limousines and they still die. Bodyguards would not prevent  someone from killing me.    [Dal Bosco] Is it true that pompous ceremonies at Planalto  Palace bother you?    [Franco] Ceremonies with much ostentation I do not like. I  think they are too artificial. But I do obey the rules. I do  everything the protocol chief orders. But I try to do it in the  simplest manner. For instance, the granting of credentials to  ambassadors was a pompous ceremony. I even had to wear black  tie. Why wear black tie to receive ambassadors? The simpler  ceremony is more human. I think most people also think that  way. They tell me they would rather have simpler ceremonies.    [Dal Bosco] Are you dating someone?    [Franco] Who knows? I do not want to talk about it. I do  not talk about my intimate life. I do not ask a reporter  whether she is dating someone, or whether she is in love  (laughs).    [Dal Bosco] What do you like doing on weekends?    [Franco] Exactly what I am doing now: meeting with friends  and listening to a good piano player. (At this moment President  Franco is meeting with friends at the Brasao Restaurant, in Juiz  de Fora, where he goes every time he is in town. Before, as  special guest of the group, he attended the graduation of his  daughter Georgiana, who studied law at the Vianna Junion Law  School. At the Brasao, he drank beer and ate meat and cheese  pie. At the piano, Professor Maria Teresa Lerdersnaier, from  the Music Conservatory, played: Love is a Many Splendored Thing,  Bolero by Ravel, and the theme of the movie Casablanca, As Time  Goes By. The piano player has been playing for Itamar Franco  for more than 15 years, and whenever the president is in town,  she goes to the Brasao in his honor).    [Dal Bosco] Is it good being the president of Brazil?    [Franco] It is not a question of its being good or bad. It  is, above all, a task, and has its gratifying aspects, while  other decisions and solutions are difficult.    [Dal Bosco] What have been your best and worst days in the  presidency?    [Franco] The happiest day I could not say. But one of the  saddest days was when my mother died on 9 December 1992.    [Dal Bosco] How would you like to be remembered by  Brazilians?    [Franco] It will be up to history, with its impartiality, to  record that.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: A handsome 'Iguana' casts its symbolic spell - The new production at the National AN IGUANA is a large tropical American lizard which, when captured, is tethered by a long rope so that it has the illusion of freedom, but can never quite escape unless someone releases it. I think I caught a glimpse of a real live iguana somewhere below the boards at the Lyttelton on Thursday - from the stalls it is hard to be certain - but no matter: the symbolism is quite enough. The Night of the Iguana was Tennessee Williams's last successful play. First performed in New York in 1961, when it opened in London in 1965 it also struck me as perhaps his best. It looks even better in Richard Eyre's marvellous new production at the National. Here one must be careful. When it pulls out all the stops, the NT can make almost anything look good, and many are the people who have allowed the technical brilliance of the production to inflate their view of the play. That does not apply to Iguana, which is a piece entirely worthy of the NT's resources. Although the play has its imperfections - notably characters who wander in, then disappear - it is superbly theatrical throughout. Iguana deploys the twin virtues of wit and pathos to the full. Some of it is very funny: a scene, for example, where a drinks trolley is shoved backwards and forwards across the stage at accelerating pace, and a limerick which ends: 'Women are fine, and sheep are divine, But iguanas are - Numero Uno'. There is, too, a wonderful series of vignettes of a group of very blond, very fat, totally unrepentant German Nazis staying as tourists at the none-too-good hotel on the Mexican coast. Inessential to the plot perhaps, but splendid comic relief. Ultimately, of course, it is the pathos that counts. The Reverend Shannon, played by Alfred Molina, is a disbarred priest who is reduced to conducting parties of women on bus tours through the more exotic parts of the world. In Mexico he revisits an old flame, Maxine, just widowed, who runs the hotel. Also arriving in the hotel are a 97-year-old American minor poet, accompanied by his grand-daughter and portraitist, Hannah. The dialogue between Shannon and Hannah is at the heart of the play: he sexually promiscuous and trying to stay off the drink while thinking about returning to the church; she sexually almost untouched, but wonderfully east coast educated and preferring an oriental form of tea. The iguana is the symbol in the background, emphasising the fine line between captivity and freedom. The performance by Eileen Atkins is the finest that I ever ever seen from this actress, which is saying something. Whenever she speaks, and she tends to speak quietly, she commands the stage totally. In tribute to Williams, she also has very good lines. Take, for instance, her long account of an experience with an Australian property developer in Raffles Hotel, Singapore and afterwards in the Straits of Malacca. Iguana is worth seeing for that performance alone. It will be a long time before it is matched. Being the National Theatre at its best, however, there is much more besides. If she were not playing in a smaller part alongside Ms Atkins, one would be tempted to give the same praise to Frances Barber as Maxine. As it is, she excels in what becomes a secondary role. The set, designed by Bob Crowley, is magnificent. If you want to see tropical rain convincingly falling on stage, here you are. Even the sound of the rain is perfect. The production is sponsored by Data General, the company that supplies the NT with its office automation systems. On all accounts, see it.</p>

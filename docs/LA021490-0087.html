			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Irving Fryar of the New England Patriots, a former Nebraska football player,  denied a published report that he shared cocaine with Doug DuBose, a troubled  former Cornhusker star running back.  </P> <P> "I used marijuana through college," Fryar told the Omaha World-Herald, "but I  didn't use cocaine until after my senior year in college, right before I got  into the pros."  </P> <P> The Hartford Courant, which published a four-part series about DuBose last  week, has said it stands by its stories, which alleged that DuBose was  introduced to drugs by Fryar and running back Mike Rozier.  </P> <P> Fryar, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, told the World-Herald:  "Let's get this straight, OK? You can print this. I go around and speak to  schools now. As everyone knows, I've been involved with drugs before, not to  the extent that I was addicted."  </P></p>

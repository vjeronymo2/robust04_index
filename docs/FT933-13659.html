			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Peps are separate A HUSBAND and wife each invests Pounds 6,000 in a personal equity plan using money from a bank account held in their joint names. One partner dies - say, the husband. Is his Pep investment allowed to be part of his estate, or do the accumulated funds transfer to the survivor? Is the answer affected by the two investments being with the same plan manager? Pep investments made by a husband and wife would form part of their separate estates. It makes no difference who the plan managers are. Any remaining funds within a bank account in joint names would pass automatically to the other holder of the joint account. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic  Affairs Friday [3 Jun] unveiled a white paper outlining the  country's industrial policy for the next 10 years.    It was the first time the ministry published a white paper  detailing the country's industrial growth targets.    According to the paper, Taiwan's industrial production is  expected to reach US$320 billion by 2002, with the annual growth  rate set at 6 percent. This is nearly double the current  production of about US$188 billion.    The paper said the "brain industry" will be the mainstay of  future world industry, with "knowledge-intensive" products  dominating the merchandise market.    The ministry will thus give priority to encouraging  development of high-technology, high value-added and  high-quality products, the paper said.    It noted that the textile industry will continue to boast  the  top production value at the turn of the century, but the  information industry will be the fastest growing sector.    By 2002, Taiwan's annual textile output will reach US$34.6  billion, while its information industry production will hit  US$25 billion.    The annual growth target for technology-intensive industries  is set at 9.5 percent for the next 10 years. They will be the  driving force behind Taiwan's future economic development, the  paper said.    In addition to the information industry, the paper said, the  machinery, vehicle, consumer electronics, pharmaceutical and  petrochemical industries also have great development potential.    Traditional labor-intensive industries like textiles and  footwear are expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent  over the next decade.    Machinery output will grow by 1.5-fold to hit US$25.6  billion  by the turn of the century, while petrochemical production is  expected to reach US$23 billion. The paper said Taiwan's  petrochemical output will be able to satisfy 74 percent of its  annual market demand by 2002, compared with the current less  than 60 percent.</p>

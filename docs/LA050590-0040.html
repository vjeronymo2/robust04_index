			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE MEET;  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE DOMINATES TEAM RACES  </P> <P> The Woodbridge High School boys' and girls' teams won titles at the Pacific  Coast League track and field finals Friday at Irvine High School.  </P> <P> In the girls' meet, Woodbridge placed first with 254 points and Laguna Hills  was second with 80. Costa Mesa was third with 57 points.  </P> <P> Seniors Michelle Muniz and Kaci Keffer each won two individual events. Muniz  won the 100-meter dash in 12.6 seconds, beating a hard-charging Tenaya Johnson  of Laguna Hills, who finished in 12.7. Woodbridge's Kristina Lockwood was third  in 12.7.  </P> <P> Her victory was remarkable because Lockwood flew out of the starting blocks and  had a three- meter lead with 50 meters left. That didn't faze Muniz, however.  She made up the difference in the last 30 meters.  </P> <P> But Muniz came back to win the 200 in 25.9 with Johnson second in 26.3.  Earlier, Muniz participated in Woodbridge's 400 relay, which won in a meet  record 49.0, breaking the team's record of 49.3 set in 1988.  </P> <P> Finally, an obviously tired Muniz ran the second leg of the 1,600 relay. The  Woodbridge team of Muniz, Mindy Hawley, Amy Robles won in 4:06.2, followed by  Orange in 4:14.5.  </P> <P> Keffer, who has run one of the top 400 times in the nation, easily won the 400  (56.5) and the 300 hurdles (45.4) in addition to running on both relays.  </P> <P> In the boys' team results, Woodbridge won with 157 points to Orange's 95.  Laguna Hills was third with 84.  </P> <P> Frank Smith of Woodbridge broke the long jump meet record with a leap of 23  feet, exceeding his record of 22-7 set in 1988. Smith also dueled with Laguna  Hills' Dave Childs in the sprints. Smith won the 100 in 11.1 in a photo finish  over Childs, who ran the same time. However, Childs won the 200 in 22.3, with  Smith second (22.4).  </P> <P> Craig Riggs of Laguna Hills was also impressive in the hurdles, winning the 110  (14.9) and 300 hurdles (40.0). Laguna Beach's Phil Bently won the 1,600 in  4:27.9, holding off Chris Lynch of Laguna Hills (4:30.8), who won the 3,200 in  9:55.2.  </P></p>

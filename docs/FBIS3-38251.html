			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn/Washington (DPA) -- In a talk with U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has advocated  preserving the disputed aviation agreement between the two  countries from the "mills of inner-American company  competition." At a working lunch on Monday [31 January], he  told Clinton that "not only the text but also the spirit of the  agreement must be fulfilled," the chancellor told the press in  Washington.    The new agreement, which was negotiated in autumn, is in  danger because the U.S. Administration so far has only partially  approved it. Exports from both sides want to make a new state  this week to abolish the differences of opinion.    The outcome of the controversy is important for the German  Lufthansa airline, which has concluded an agreement with the  U.S. airline United Airlines on joint services (code sharing) on  the basis of this agreement. This, too, has not yet been  accepted by Washington as a whole. Lufthansa chief Juergen  Weber said a partial approval, according to which Lufthansa can  offer flights in the United States in cooperation with United  Airlines is "almost worthless." The partner company has not yet  been granted the same rights by the U.S. side for Germany and  other countries. The Bonn Transportation Ministry said it would  be a violation of good faith if the United States were to try to  call the bases of cooperation between Lufthansa and United  Airlines into question.    The U.S. competitors American and Delta Airlines are raging  at the U.S. Administration against the agreements between the  two companies. In this connection, it was said in Bonn that  these airlines should know that they are hurting themselves by  torpedoing the agreement. Informed circles did not rule out  that the Federal Government might cancel the old contract, on  which the new agreement is based. This would mean that every  single U.S. flight to the FRG would have to be approved  individually.</p>

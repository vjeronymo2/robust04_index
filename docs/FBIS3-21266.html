Energy Beams as Means of Processing Materials </H5>   There are a number of materials with peculiar properties  that  reflect their microscopic atomic and electronic structures. By  processing these materials properly, their properties can be  made to play a role as functional materials. However, the adding  new functions or compounding functions by means of artificial  control requires the alteration of material structures with a  method that far exceeds the compound energy of materials. This  method of processing materials must be able to control space,  time, energy volume, etc., very precisely. From this standpoint,  directional energy beams such as ions, electrons, and lasers  become important means of developing new functional materials by  controlling material conditions artificially.    For such research and development efforts, an understanding  of the interaction between energy beams and target materials is  significant. The basic interaction process involves the  introduction of heterogeneous elements, electronic excitation,  elastic collision, and nuclear reaction, and their ratios change  according to the combinations of various kinds of energy beams  and target materials. Ion beams, for example, play different  interaction roles in different energy domains. Such a situation  is surveyed in Table V-1. In general, the higher the level of  energy is, the greater is the ratio of imparted energy for the  electronic excitation process. The following is a discussion of  the alteration of material structures, taking as a typical  example organic materials, which are affected largely by  electronic excitation processes, and inorganic materials, which  are affected largely by the introduction of heterogeneous  elements and elastic collision processes.     <H5>  2. Organic Materials </H5>   Organic polymers are used not only in all phases of our  life,  but are also very familiar as materials that constitute living  organisms. Living organisms are quite well constructed, and are  capable of responding properly to changes in the external  environment. This is because the polymers that constitute  organisms, such as membranes, have specific functions.  Therefore, the artificial synthesis of such functional polymers  has been studied, for instance, for such materials as selective  separation membranes that allow specific materials to permeate,  photochromic materials that change colors by radiation of light,  and materials with high-temperature superconductivity. These  materials are types of functional materials that not only  implement the functions of living organisms, but also possess  new functions that living organisms do not have.    In synthesizing such organic functional materials, the use  of  energy beams, especially the use of electronic beams, has been  studied. Recently, there has been considerable research on the  use of ion beams and laser beams as well.  <H5>  (1) Use of Electronic Beams </H5>   The reactions of materials that are radiated by electronic  beams can be grouped into two categories: the primary process,  where the energy of radiated electrons is applied to the  material through collision and ionization, as well as  excitation, and occurs adiabatically in a very short time; and  the secondary process, which is caused by ions, radicals, and  excitation molecules generated in the primary process.  Electronic beams used for material synthesis normally have  energy levels of from several hundred keV to several MeV, and  the energy of the secondary electrons, generated in the primary  process, at about 40-50 eV, also affects the secondary process.  From the standpoint of molecules that collide, the effects of  the secondary electrons are overwhelmingly larger than the  direct effects of the radiated electrons. The secondary  electrons with low energy levels generate ionization as well as  excitation continuously in the neighborhood of their occurrence,  and produce several ions and excitation molecules. As these ions  and excitation molecules possess excessive energy, they  themselves develop into other ions and radicals, and also  generate various products due to addition, charge transfer, and  reaction with neutral molecules.    Synthesis of particles and thin films can be done by  polymerization using electronic beam radiation. For instance,  stable particles with a diameter of 20-30 m were obtained by  emulsion polymerization of styrene. Positive and negative resist  materials also were obtained by applying 20 layers of polymer  thin film on a silicon or gallium arsenide wafer, and then  radiating it with electronic beams 250 nm in diameter.    The graft polymerization method is often used as a  polymerization method. In this method, polymer radicals  generated by radiation are used as a starter for polymerization  response of monomers. As graft polymerization using monomers  that are different from the constituent unit of the base  polymers results in chemical synthesis of polymers of different  properties, the properties of the original polymers can be  changed permanently. Since the yield of graft polymerization is  dependent on the radiation dose, and not on dose rate, the  amount of starter needed for a reaction can be obtained in a  short time by irradiating it at a high dose rate using an  accelerator.    Practical application of graft polymerization by electronic  beam radiation was examined, and a film that was permeable only  to positive ions selectively was developed. This was  accomplished by introducing carboxyl into the film, which was  radiated with the accelerator, to produce graft polymerization  of acrylic acid. In this case, it is necessary to distribute the  polymerized acrylic acid in the film uniformly so it will serve  as a separating membrane. This was achieved in the practical  process by setting the radiation dose at 100-200 kGy, and the  reaction time at two to three hours. This product has been used  for separating membranes of button-type silver oxide cells.  There also is the possibility of using it for separating  membranes of nickel cadmium secondary cells in the future. The  same method is used for graft polymerization of radiated fiber  polymers, such as polypropylene, with styrene, and it is  expected to be put into practical use as an absorbent deodorizer  for ammonia gas, tobacco smoke, and pet odor. Furthermore,  heat-resistant and chemical-resistant ion exchange films,  selective permeable films for gas and liquids, metal collectors,  and organism-affinity films and tube are in the stage of  research and development.    In this way, there are many research examples of the  synthesis of organic functional materials using electronic  beams, and such research and development is expected to further  expand in the future. One reason is that electronic accelerators  can be utilized relatively easily. At present there are about  800 accelerators in Japan, and about 20 percent of them are  estimated to be for industrial use. It is also noted that the  advantage of using electronic beams for synthesis methods has  become obvious. Catalyzers are usually used for the synthesis of  organic materials. Using electronic beams, however, has a number  of advantages. For example, there is no need for high  temperatures, no chance of introducing impurities such as  catalyzer pieces into products, and easy control of the reaction  by turning the beams on and off.  <H5>  (2) Use of Ion Beam </H5>   Figure V-1 illustrates a typical phenomenon that occurs when  ion beams are radiated on a material. The figure shows the  results of radiation on a silicon wafer by changing the energy  of Pd ions from several 10 eV to several MeV. At 1 keV or below,  radiated ions lose energy on the material surface, and  accumulate as a film after being neutralized. At 1 MeV or above,  a layer is formed deep inside the material. The depth changes  approximately in proportion to the injected energy of the ions.  In the energy range between 1 keV and 1 MeV, the sputter  phenomenon, where atoms on the surface of the material are cut  out by colliding ions, is observed. The curve in the center of  the figure indicates the numbers of ions sputtered by an ion.  Similar trends can be observed in any combination of materials  and ions, even though there are some differences in the range of  energy and sputter rate.       Based on such radiation effects, research on the possibility  of adding functions to organic materials has been conducted  (Table V-2). The most commonly reported research involves  improvements in the electric conductivity of plastics, such as  polyethylene. There is a report on polyacethylene, where p-n  junction occurred between the layer created by ion injection and  the original material. Concerning surface improvement, there are  examples of improved adhesion between metal and plastic, as well  as improved antithrombotic properties in silicon rubber. There  have been experiments with ion beam resists in the submicron  range, permeability improvement for gas, and optical reflectance  and refractivity improvements. These improvements to organic  materials by ion beam radiation can be accounted for as the  result of the cutting of molecular chains, carbonization, and  switching to the amorphous state.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table V-2.

For instance, this technique is used to control  perforation by nuclear track and molecular orientation. When  ions with a large atomic number and an energy level higher than  several 10 MeV are radiated on an organic film, the ions,  without stopping, penetrate the film if it is thin. When this  film is processed with acid or alkali, the film is perforated  through the sections where the ions penetrated. An organic film  suitable for this purpose is a polymer named CR-39. CR-39 has  been used for neutron ray detectors, and as a material for dose  measurement in space.    CR-39 film was radiated with gold ion beams with an energy  level of 11.4 MeV per nucleon, and processed in a sodium hydrate  solution at 6N at 60C for four to five hours to obtain a  perforated film. The film has about 5 x 10[.sup]5[/] holes,  which are basically vertical cylinders, with a diameter of 2  m, per 1 cm[.sup]2[/]. Only the holes of the film were  then chemically modified by graft polymerization. For example,  when the holes were combined with a kind of hydrogen that varies  its volume by temperature by 5 percent in weight, the holes at  1.2 m at 40C were completely shut at 0C (Figure  V-2) as observed with an electronic microscope. Using this  phenomenon, it is possible to produce a new film that controls  the flow through its holes by changes of temperature.       When molecules with both hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic  groups in the same molecular structure are dropped on the  surface of water, and repeat arranging orientation by adding  pressure and catching with a glass wafer, a film consisting of  layers of single-molecule films can be obtained. However, its  mechanical strength is not sufficient as it is, and it is  necessary to reinforce the film by combining individual  molecules by such methods as polymerization. Then, after  accumulating diacetylene monomers for 30 to 50 layers, it was  polymerized by irradiating it with ion beams and ultraviolet  rays. An examination of the structure of the layered film by  X-ray diffraction spectrum showed that a film with superb  orientation could be obtained with ion beam radiation compared  to ultraviolet ray radiation. As illustrated in Figure V-3, when  flex monomers are radiated with ion beams, the carbon-carbon  linkage is shaken and polymerized after all the molecules are  loosened. The oriented organic thin film obtained this way has a  long conjugate system, and features nonlinear optical properties  such as p electrons can move about the layers freely. For  instance, when this film was injected by an optic laser with a  wavelength of 1.907 m, higher harmonics waves with a  frequency three times higher were observed. When such a material  with three-dimensional nonlinear optics is used, diffraction  factors and absorption coefficients can be changed. Therefore,  such materials are expected to be applied to elements for  optical communications and optical memory in future.       Recently, materials (hybrid materials) that are accumulated  for materials to interact with each other on the atomic and  molecular levels are being considered. When realized, such  materials should have superb properties that far exceed those of  the original materials. The creation of hybrid materials  requires extraordinary distance between atoms and between  molecules, the creation of anisotropy, and approximation between  materials. For this purpose, such methods as vacuum evaporation,  plasma CVD, molecular beam epitaxy, ion sputtering, and ion  injection are effective. In the future, the synthesis of hybrid  film materials with various combinations of materials produced  by different layering methods will be explored experimentally  using ion beams. As a result of such efforts, materials with new  functions, such as organic superconductivity based on the tunnel  effects, will be developed.  <H5>  (3) Use of Laser Beams </H5>   The development of organic materials using lasers is in  progress along with the spread of excimer laser. Excimer laser  beams possess such properties as high durability,  monochromatism, directionality, short pulse, etc., and are  suitable for microprocessing. As an example of using a polymer  material as the base, a polymer film was radiated with lasers to  cause aberrations (a dispersing phenomenon of decomposed  materials with impulsive sound and emission of light), and  microprocessing at the level of microns on the surface of film  was tried experimentally. One experiment involved inducing  decomposed materials to accumulate on a wafer to produce a thin  film. It is expected that such efforts will be applied to  produce optoelectronic elements in the future. Furthermore, when  ultraviolet-ray lasers are radiated on the surface of acrylic  resin, moving the laser spot while radiating causes a hardened  layer to form on the surface in the trace of the laser spot. By  accumulating the layers, a more complex solid can be formed (the  optical carving method). Its solution is about 0.1 m at  present, and its application to the processing of micromachines  is being examined by improving its precision. In addition, it is  also noted that the carbon cluster molecule C60, which has  attracted attention as a future functional material, is produced  by laser beam evaporation.  <H5>  3. Inorganic Materials </H5>   Use of ion beams, along with other energy beams, brings  about  radical changes in material structures. Electronic excitation  and elastic diffusion processes cause crystalline materials to  break their chemical linkage, and turn amorphous by atomic  displacement. Such a state is one of disequilibrium, and  presents solid state properties that are different from ordinary  solid state properties. Table V-3 indicates typical property  changes of inorganic materials turned amorphous by ion beam  radiation. It shows that there are large effects, not only on  optical properties, but also on electric and chemical  properties. In this way, the use of energy beams facilitates  basic property and space control, and its spin-off effects in  materials development cannot be overestimated.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table V-3.

TIARA also has promoted research on the advanced use of  radiation, such as the development of new materials. Figure V-4  illustrates a typical system for ion beam processing mainly for  inorganic materials. The system is capable of ion radiation and  injection with temperature as a parameter and on-site ion beam  analysis, which are important in material processing. As a means  of additional processing after ion injection, ultrafast thermal  processing on the order of several 10 ns by YAG lasers is  possible. A goniometer also is installed for low-temperature ion  channeling experiments, so that such data as location change on  the atomic level of the injected elements, and the elements  constituting the target materials can be obtained. Cooling can  be controlled continuously within a range from 15 K to 300 K,  and data on the interactions between the injected elements and  radiation defects are needed for analysis of the state of  material disequilibrium, which is an important feature of ion  beam processing. This system will be established and made  available for operation by December in 1993 as part of a  compound beam use experiment consisting of middle-energy  heavy-ion radiation equipment, low-energy ion radiation  equipment, and middle-energy light-ion radiation equipment in  the facilities of TIARA.       This section addresses metallic bond materials, ionic bond  materials, and covalent materials as typical inorganic  materials. Typical examples and the mechanism of basic  functional addition are presented in terms of interactions  between energy beams and materials.  <H3>  (1) Improvement of Critical Current by Introduction of  Electronic Excitation Defect </H3>   As most of the energy added in the electronic excitation  process becomes heat that is transformed to the lattice system  in metallic materials, this process becomes important in  compounds. Although lattice defects called color center are  generated easily by ionizing radiation in alkali halides,  lattice defects are generated by high-density electronic  excitation by high-energy heavy-ion radiation in oxides. When  incident ion energy reaches a level of about GeV, linear lattice  defects (ion tracks) with a diameter of about 100 A expanded  beyond the atomic unit can be introduced. These lattice defects  effectively serve to pin magnetic flux in oxide high-temperature  superconductors, and contribute to the rise of critical current.    Figure V-5 illustrates the results of changes in the  critical  current measured by the external magnetic field function and T  after radiating Xe ions of 173 MeV at 77 K on a Y-group oxide  high-temperature superconductor for 4 x  10[.sup]11[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] parallel to the C axis. As the  figure indicates, when lattice defects (in the amorphous range)  introduced by radiating Xe ions are parallel to the direction of  the magnetic field, they increase critical current thereby  serving as an effective pinning center. The strength of pinning  is thought to be the largest when the size of the pinning center  is about the same size as the coherent length of the material.  This indicates that the high-energy heavy-ion radiation method  is capable of controlling the direction, dose, and ionic  species, and is an indispensable material processing method to  upgrade research in critical current improvement for oxide  superconductors.     <H3>  (2) Improved Sensitivity of Image Memory Elements Using Spew  Defects/Heterogeneous Element Introduction </H3>   Here, enhancement of sensitivity in the memory process of  optical images by introducing ion radiation lattice defects to  PLZT (lead-lanthanum-zirconate-titanate) oxide superconductors  is discussed. Defects are created in PLZT mainly by the  displacement of constituent atoms in the elastic scattering  process. Electrons captured by lattice defects induce optical  current by the radiation of light needed to memorize optical  images and to reduce the applied current needed for orientation  change in the dielectric domain. In this way, by controlling  ionic species and ionic energy, it becomes possible to introduce  radiation defects adjusted at the energy level of the captured  electrons at the location corresponding to the depth to which  light for memory reaches. Therefore, image memory elements  sensitive to light across a broad range of frequencies can be  formed.    In Figure V-6, the inverse number of the light volume needed  for image memory is defined as exposure sensitivity, and the  results of measurements as a function of wavelength of light are  illustrated. When Al and Ne are radiated at 500 keV for  approximately 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/], exposure  sensitivity is improved by two orders of magnitude, and  wavelength dependency is removed. Therefore, image memory  capability is enhanced.     <H3>  (3) Addition of Electric Conductivity by Introduction of  Heterogeneous Elements </H3>   One-dimensional conductors can be created if it is possible  to introduce metallic elements between subcrystal lattices  consisting of metallic elements to constitute a compound. Ion  injection, which is a means of processing amorphous materials,  is effective in realizing this. The state of the materials thus  obtained depends largely on injection temperature. For instance,  when LiF crystals are injected with Na or K ions at 78 K, a  broad absorption belt from visible to infrared light is formed,  and this is totally different from the case of injection at 300  K. It can be concluded from this light absorption phenomenon  that a metal state linking the Li of the injected ions and the  mother lattice in a chain is formed parallel to the surface.  This continuous metal layer changes its structure by annealing  and becomes discontinuous metal particles.    Figure V-7 illustrates change of conductance depending on  the  amount of K ion injection at 100 keV, and injection at  approximately 2.9 x 10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] (approx.  5%) increases it by six orders of magnitude. When the  frequency  dependency of alternating conductance is examined as a function  of the amount of ionic injection, frequency dependency  disappears at approximately 2.9 x  10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. This is considered to be a  nonmetal-metal transfer caused by one-dimensional contact of Li  and K.     <H3>  (4) Control of Chemical Response by Introduction of  Heterogeneous Elements </H3>   A considerable amount of research into the control of  chemical response using the ion injection method has been  conducted from the standpoint of catalytic materials, because  ion injection causes alterations of the surface layer. Since the  elements used as catalyzers are generally inactive, for  instance, in the case of sapphire, it is necessary to inject  ions into the sapphire and to stabilize the catalyzer element in  the state of a high-speed response material into the crystal  structure of sapphire in the heating process later on. The ion  beam analysis method is used to analyze structural changes  concentrated on the surface layer.    Figure V-8 illustrates the relationship between response  speed and response time when hydrogen is added to toluene using  hydrogen and sapphire processed in an oxygen atmosphere in  advance. In the reaction, methylcyclohexane is generated. The  radical rise of response speed in the heat processing test piece  in the first 20 minutes is attributed to the formation of water  by the remaining oxygen atoms, which affect the hydrogen adding  process, and the real process is indicated with the dotted line.  On the other hand, in the case of processing in a hydrogen  atmosphere, indicated with the solid line, the response speed is  reduced by almost one order of magnitude. When advance  processing for individual catalyzers is compared, heat  processing in an oxygen atmosphere produces certain results  regardless of the manner of handling.     <H3>  (5) Phase Separation and Crystallization Control by  Introduction of Heterogeneous Elements </H3>   The simultaneous introduction of heterogeneous elements and  radiation defects to materials by both the ion injection method,  and the consecutive phase separation process by heat processing,  is an important part of crystallization control research for  glass materials. Figure V-9 illustrates the distribution in  depth of Li atoms obtained during heat processing after  injecting Li ions at 50 keV for 1 x  10[.sup]17[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] into SiO[.sup]2[/] glass.  The distribution of Li atoms is a result obtained by an energy  analysis of the recoil of Li atoms from elastic collisions with  heavy ions ([.sup]28[/]Si) as a probe. Although the depth  distribution of Li atoms is not changed by annealing at  temperatures up to 873 K, they accumulate on the surface above  that temperature as indicated in the figure. Along with the  redistribution of Li, H atoms in the glass disperse internally  and induce crystallization in the range of the injected Li ions.  Since crystallization does not occur by injecting Si or O ions  that constitute the glass network, the role of Li atoms  themselves in crystallization has been concluded. As the amount  of Li ion injection is large in this case, phase-separated  Li[.sup]2[/]O prevents restoration of the glass network by  SiO[.sup]4[/] tetrahedron formation, and functions instead as  the core of single crystallization. Using such a method,  SiO[.sup]2[/] glass could be crystallized at a far lower  temperature than the 2,073 K needed for melting by controlling  the depth and area.     <H3>  (6) Application for Laser Radiation-Induced Phase Transfer  and Data Memory </H3>   Laser radiation of a semiconductor material with a small  band  gap generates fusion of the material by adding the excitation  energy of the electronic system to the lattice system. When  lasers with a pulse of several 10 ns are used, the material  after fusing is cooled down at a ultrahigh speed, and it turns  into an amorphous state. The amorphous state can be reversed to  the original crystal state by longer laser radiation. The  difference of reflectance between the crystal state and the  amorphous state is expected to be large. Based on such results,  detailed research on interaction between pulse lasers and  materials is expected to be applied to the data memory process  where repeated read and write are possible.    Figure V-10 is a diagram illustrating the radiation effects  of pulse lasers on Te at 750 A evaporated on a glass base, and  indicates the range where radiation-induced transformation of Te  can occur as a function of incident power and pulse width. The  solid line indicates the minimum laser radiation condition to  reach the fusing point of Te (450C). From this research,  the conditions for crystallization and the consequent  transformation to the amorphous state that are important for  recording of data can be discovered.</p>

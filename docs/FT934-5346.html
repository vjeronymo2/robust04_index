			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Merrydown tops Pounds 0.9m Merrydown, the Sussex-based cider and soft drinks maker, increased first half pre-tax profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 932,000, helped by contributions from Shloer and PLJ, the adult soft drinks acquired in January. 'Their combined impact on revenue and profit is expected to be significantly greater in the second half,' said Mr Richard Purdey, chairman. 'The Christmas period, which normally accounts for 45 per cent of Shloer's annual sales, will be crucial.' Earnings per share for the six months to September 30 fell 8 per cent to 5.72p (6.22p) after a 3m share issue to fund the acquisitions. The interim dividend is maintained at 1p. Trading profit rose 17 per cent to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.07m) on turnover 31 per cent higher at Pounds 11.29m. Soft drinks, which also include Piermont and Sorelle, accounted for 27 per cent of turnover compared with 8 per cent in the same period last year. Shloer sales in Ireland were largely responsible for an 85 per cent rise in export revenue to Pounds 830,000. Cider sales were affected by a slower than expected relaunch of Merrydown Original, the company's leading brand. By September, however, sales were running ahead of last year, and Original retained leadership of the Scottish take-home market. Sales of Premium Draught cider progressed and sales of own-label ciders accounted for 10 per cent of group revenue.</p>

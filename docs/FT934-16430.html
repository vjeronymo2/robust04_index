			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: German exchanges to merge THE Frankfurt stock exchange, the largest of Germany's eight stock exchanges, is to merge with the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's screen-based futures and options exchange, at the beginning of next year, the Deutsche Borse announced yesterday. This is the first change in the structure of Germany's security markets since the creation of the Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, at the beginning of the year. This organisation is a holding company which brings the Frankfurt exchange, the DTB and the Deutscher Kassenverein settlements organisation under one administrative roof. The Deutsche Borse said the aim of the merger of the DTB and the Frankfurt exchange was to integrate the markets for equities and fixed interest securities with that for options and futures. It would lead to further meshing of trading and settlement between the two markets, the Deutsche Borse said. These changes are administrative in nature and are unlikely to bring immediate benefits for investors in German securities. However, they are part of a campaign on the part of the German securities industry to improve its competitiveness and are likely to presage significant changes. 'These steps are required in order to achieve a considerable improvement in the competitiveness (of the German securities markets) against other European markets,' it said. They would lead in time to faster settlement and lower costs for investors, the Deutsche Borse said.</p>

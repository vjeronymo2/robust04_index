			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Toyoda Loom up Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, one of the Toyota Motor group of companies, saw profits rise for the fiscal year ended March. Pre-tax profits grew by 1 per cent to Y24.3bn, due to streamlining efforts, compared to a 20.3 per cent decline a year ago, writes Wayne Aponte. Net profits rose 2.2 per cent to Y15.3bn. But overall sales dropped 2 per cent to Y571.5bn in the softening domestic motor market. The company assembles cars for Toyota, and makes textile machinery, industrial vehicles and engines. Toyoda Automatic Loom forecasts a below-average performance this fiscal year due to foreign exchange losses and increased depreciation costs. Sales are expected to drop about 3.8 per cent to Y550bn, with pre-tax profits down 13.6 per cent to Y21bn and net profits down 12.9 per cent. Sales of Toyoda Machine Works declined 7.3 per cent last year to Y161.8bn</p>

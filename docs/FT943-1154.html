			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / This Week: Television Ian Botham is being profiled by the BBC to mark the beginning of another sponsored walk for leukaemia research, for which he has already raised Pounds 5m. There is also an autobiography in the offing - no celebrity agrees to major programmes these days without something to plug. In this case however the self-promotion is forgivable - apart from the charity work 'Beefy' Botham can claim credit for leading England at 24 and notching up over 5000 runs, 400 wickets and 100 test matches. Botham (Wednesday, 10.55-11.45pm, BBC1) examines the man's career from boyhood in Yeovil to his retirement last year, and includes an appraisal of the 1981 series against Australia and his relationship with 'blood brother' Viv Richards. The programme doesn't shirk the sex and drug allegations that nearly ruined Botham's career in 1986. Kathy Botham talks about living with a legend and Bob Willis pays tribute to her. 'If Ian hadn't got married quite so early, he would have ended up in prison,' he says. They were going to call it Dead Belgians Don't Count as an indication of our chauvinistic news values but it's just as well they changed the name to Drop The Dead Donkey (Thursday, 10.00-10.30pm, C4) because Belgium now buys the situation comedy from Channel Four and may not have found the joke so funny. The writers have deliberately left long gaps between series so, although it seems to have been around since of Reginald Bosanquet was still behind the microphone, this is only the fourth series. Set in the newsroom of Globelink Television, the programmes are recorded the day before transmission to keep the jokes fresh and the final gags are often added half an hour before transmission, giving this a topicality that adds to the generally high laughter quotient. The series that aims an icepick at icons takes a swing at Aristotle Onassis and reveals a life that ranged from comedy, in the way he outwitted his opponents, to Greek tragedy, in the way the House of Onassis has been dogged by disaster. Reputations (Sunday, 9.30-10.30pm, BBC2) examines the tycoon's life from his escape from the massacres in Turkey - during which the Onassis family sufferred losses both of life and lucre - to the final days when he was bowed by the sudden death of his only son. The love affairs with Eva Peron, Maria Callas, Gloria Swanson and, most famously, Jackie Kennedy are mentioned. The real scoop, however, is not the revelation that Onassis was a wife-beater but that the White House was after him. Robert Maheu, the FBI man hired to orchestrate the industrial espionage, claims that Richard Nixon said: 'If you kill this son of a bitch don't do it on American shores.'</p>

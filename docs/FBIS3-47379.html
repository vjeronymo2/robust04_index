			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an editorial headlined "Let us Dynamically Advance in  the Spirit of Chollima Spurred on by the `Speed of the '90s.'"    What is important in effecting a new revolutionary upsurge  in  all sectors of socialist construction in hearty response to the  New Year address of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is that  all the officials, party members and working people make  continued innovations and uninterrupted progress in the spirit  of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s," the editorial  says, and continues:    To make continued innovations and uninterrupted progress in  the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" --  this is an important militant slogan set by the Workers' Party  of Korea.    The party set the next three years as a period of adjustment  and put forward militant tasks to secure a new base for reaching  higher levels of socialism by implementing its revolutionary  economic strategy.    Each time they were faced with difficult and vast tasks in  socialist construction, our people recorded the history of  socialist construction with heroic feats, closely united around  the party. In the postwar period when everything was destroyed  and no bricks were left unbroken, our people brought about a  great upswing of Chollima, producing what was lacking and  finding out what was insufficient in the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and hard struggle in reliance on themselves. In  this way, they successfully built a socialist power independent,  self-sufficient and self- reliant in national defence.    The spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s"  is a new speed of progress in socialist construction with the  spirit of Chollima in the postwar period plus the revolutionary  zeal and indomitable fighting spirit in the '90s. This reflects  the noble intention and unshakable will of our party to make the  first year of the period of adjustment an occasion of a great  advance in socialist construction by successfully inheriting the  tradition of the great upswing of our revolution.</p>

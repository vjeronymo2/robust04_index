			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> 2 BUILDINGS ON ARCADE TO GET 2ND STORIES  </P> <P> The Ojai Historical Preservation Commission, after approving a proposed second  story for two Arcade buildings, said it wants future building applicants to  consult with architects who specialize in historic structures.  </P> <P> Commission members voted 2 to 1 Monday to back the proposed additions at 250  and 254 E. Ojai Ave.  </P> <P> The project, proposed by Larry Wilde, Dennis Guernsey and Andrew Pollet, all of  Ojai, will be reviewed Monday by the Ojai Redevelopment Commission.  </P> <P> Architect Marc Whitman of Ojai said he had consulted with a historic  preservation architect and had designed the retail-office complex in a Spanish  Mission style to complement the Arcade.  </P> <P> The arched walkway was built in 1917 and is on the commission's list to be  considered for landmark designation.  </P> <P> "It's bold, beautiful and big like the Ojai Valley Inn, but it's not charming  and it's not Ojai," Commissioner Rose Boggs said.  </P> <P> She was the lone vote against the project.  </P> <P> "I'm against all two-story buildings. I see no reason why we need them."  </P> <P> Commissioner Zelma Wilson voted for it although she said it is unfortunate to  have two-story buildings among the Arcade's dozen one-story shops.  </P> <P> "It's going to loom very large. It will hit you hard. But a lot of things loom  large until they begin to meld into their environment," Wilson said. THIA BELL  </P></p>

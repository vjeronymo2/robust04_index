			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Tractebel rises 4% in first half Tractebel, the Belgian energy and civil engineering group, saw consolidated net profits for the first half of this year rise by 4 per cent, from BFr16.5bn (Dollars 519m) in the first six months of 1993 to BFr17.2bn, writes David Gardner in Brussels. Turnover in the same period rose from BFr123.3bn to BFr130.5bn, largely due to expanding sales in the group's international electricity and gas business. Tractebel said that it expected results for the full year to be 'at least equal to 1993's'. It also expected to maintain 'at least' the level of last year's dividend.</p>

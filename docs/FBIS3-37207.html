The 30-minute conversation of the two ministers centered  around the Partnership for Peace programme. Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev said on Monday, the Russian Defence  Ministry fully supports the programme, but views differ on how  the programme should be implemented, with each country insisting  on its own viewpoint.    Pavel Grachev told the British secretary of state that an  instrument should be worked out for joining the programme of  Partnership for Peace. An intermediate plan is needed for this,  under which European countries would join political alliances by  region or bilaterally with the Conference for Security and  Cooperation in Europe playing the dominant role.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BATHHOUSE RESTORATION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks is considering two proposals  to restore the historic Cabrillo Beach bathhouse in San Pedro and convert it to  a restaurant and shopping complex. The plans will be the topic of a public  meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> The 60-year-old bathhouse, once the home of the Cabrillo Marine Museum, has  been vacant since 1981 except for the shower rooms, the office of a club and a  concession that has since closed. Last year, recreation officials announced  that they would offer a long-term lease to someone who would renovate and  maintain the bathhouse.  </P> <P> Keith Fitzgerald, management analyst for the Recreation and Parks Department,  said one proposal is from the Pilcher Group of Pomona and calls for $1.6  million in improvements. The other, from the Los Angeles-based Janss Corp. and  the San Pedro Bay Co., calls for spending $2 million. Department officials hope  to select one of the proposals within 90 days after the meeting Wednesday,  which will be at 7 p.m. at the Cabrillo Marine Museum auditorium.  </P></p>

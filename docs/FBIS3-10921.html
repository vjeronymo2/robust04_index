			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Undercurrent Section"] </F>   [Text] The much heralded Second National Congress of the  Communist Party-Shining Path, which was announced for March with  government cooperation, is being frustrated by discrepancies  between imprisoned Shining Path militants over Abimael Guzman's  peace negotiations. This change of mind was visible 15 days ago  at the Canto Grande Prison when a group of inmates started to  shout "Viva the armed struggle and the Gonzalo [Abimael Guzman]  Thought," instead of singing the national anthem, which was  apparently something they had agreed to do. This disagreement  in the negotiating line seems to have been started by Victor  Catano, an important military commander imprisoned in Yanamayo,  and none other than Maritza Garrido Lecca, another inmate. It  was then that the imprisoned Shining Path leaders began to  demand a Second Congress to discuss the bases for negotiating  with the government. Faced with these revelations and  discouraged by Guzman's confession that the peace process would  only be a "strategic and momentary withdrawal" (LA REPUBLICA 25  Jan 94), President Alberto Fujimori changed his mind and now  says the event obviously cannot be carried out without his  consent.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Market subdued despite Halifax Pounds 100m addition NEW issue activity remained subdued in the international bond market yesterday, with volatility in domestic bond markets keeping most issuers and investors on the side-lines. Halifax Building Society became the second UK financial institution to raise capital this week, following a Pounds 100m subordinated debt issue by Abbey National on Monday. its outstanding Pounds 150m subordinated debt issue maturing 2014. The new 11 per cent bonds were priced to yield 152 basis points over long-dated UK government bonds, a pick up of around 10 basis points over the outstanding issue. This was generous enough to tempt a range of UK institutional investors into the deal, which was wholly underwritten by Warburg Securities. The deal becomes the largest unsecured issue at the long end of the sterling market. There have been few new long-dated bond issues in the sterling market this year. Most companies have preferred either to defer new issues until UK interest rates have fallen again or to lock into current rates at shorter maturities. As a result, yield spread of outstanding issues have narrowed in the secondary market. For example, the outstanding Halifax bonds were trading at a yield spread of 175 basis points over gilts in early December, against 142 basis points before the new paper was issued yesterday. The proceeds of the issue count as non-core capital for Halifax, strengthening its balance sheet and increasing its capacity to lend. However, it does not have an urgent need for capital. Its total capital ratio is well in excess of 8 per cent of risk weighted assets, the minimum ratio required under international banking supervision rules, which building societies will have to meet next year. By the close of trading, yesterday's issue was trading at 100.875 bid, having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 100.592, where the yield spread was 147 basis points over gilts. Elsewhere, new equity-linked bond offerings by Japanese companies continued to flow. Syndicate officials expect a stream of new deals in the run up to the Japanese financial year end on March 31. Six deals were launched in dollars, D-Marks, Ecu and Swiss francs with the companies raising Dollars 650m equivalent. Demand is well below the levels seen at the peak of the financial boom in Japan, although most of the deals launched yesterday received a reasonable reception. For example, Nisshinbo Industries' Ecu100m five-year issue, lead managed by Nikko Europe, traded up from an issue price of par to stand at 100.40 bid by the close of trading. Autobacs Seven Company's Dollars 100m five-year issue, lead managed by Nomura International, traded up to 101 bid, also from an issue price of par. Nomura Bank International, the arm of the Japanese securities house recognised under UK banking legislation as a deposit-taking institution, has been awarded a top A-1+ credit rating for short-term debt by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency.</p>

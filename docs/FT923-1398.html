			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / China to regulate securities markets CHINA plans to create a national regulatory body independent of the central bank to oversee its burgeoning securities markets which have frequently been hit by turmoil. Nie Qingping, chief of the stock market regulation division of the People's Bank, China's central bank, told Reuters in Hong Kong that a Securities Management Committee would soon be established. It would be fully independent of the People's Bank and have independent authority to regulate China's stock markets. There are two stock markets in China, one located in Shanghai and the other in Shenzhen special economic zone to the north of Hong Kong. Chinese cities from Dalian in the north to Guangzhou in the south are competing for the central government's approval to open a third exchange. Nie said the committee would be modelled on western regulatory bodies, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Its central task would be to bring measured development to China's financial markets. 'The most important thing is to build on what we have in Shanghai and Shenzhen and to continue improving the way the stock markets perform,' he said. In August the city of Shenzhen was overrun by 1m would-be investors who rioted when they were frustrated in buying application forms to participate in new share offerings. Allegations of official corruption were widespread, leading senior municipal officials to make public self-criticisms. China's accounting guidelines are elementary, although Chinese companies' desire to raise foreign capital has meant adoption by some of international accountancy standards. In July, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission, the corporate watchdog, issued a warning to potential investors in Chinese quoted companies. It reminded them that little investor protection existed in China and that Chinese companies were not required to register a prospectus with regulators in Hong Kong.</p>

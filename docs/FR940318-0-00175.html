			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prospective users should also note that companies now investigating PFC use contend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that within 2&hyph;3 years, it will be possible to replace the PFCs in cleaning equipment with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFCs or other options that have zero ozone depletion potential and significantly lower global  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warming potential. As a result, they view use of the PFCs as an important but transitional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solution to their cleaning needs. If PFCs are chosen, it is important for users to begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working with chemical manufacturers to start testing and qualifying these new materials to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> help speed conversion when alternative chemicals become commercially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users of PFCs should note that if other alternatives such as HFCs or other cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes are later found to meet performance or safety standards, the Agency could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to a petition requesting it to list PFCs as unacceptable substitutes due to availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other alternatives. If such claims are determined to be accurate and EPA limits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptability listing even further, EPA may grandfather existing uses but only to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted by cost and timing considerations associated with testing and retrofitting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Precision cleaning. (a) Perfluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precision cleaning sector only for high-performance, precision-engineering cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications where reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain that other alternatives are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements. PFCs covered by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination are C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, C7F15NO,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and C8F16O. The electronics cleaning section discusses the justification for this narrowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use acceptability listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite concerns about the global warming potential of PFCs, the Agency has listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this narrowed application as an acceptable use of perfluorocarbons in precision cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because, for certain high-performance, precision-engineered components and equipment, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PFC-based system may be the only viable alternative available to replace use of class I or II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Types of precision components that may require PFC-based cleaning include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;High-performance guidance, navigation and tracking systems such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gyroscopes and accelerometers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;High-performance aerospace and avionics components and equipment such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid oxygen systems or rotational hand controllers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Critical analytical devices and their components used for gas chromatography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where low residue levels are essential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Optical components made from plastics damaged irreparably by water or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents or coated or mounted with specialized materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested users should review the section on PFCs under electronics cleaning for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full discussion of the considerations, limitations, and requirements associated with selecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unacceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Metals cleaning. (a) HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends are unacceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metals cleaning, with acceptability subject to narrowed use limitations to be granted by EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if necessary, as CFC&hyph;113 replacements after the effective date of this listing. The effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date for this listing is 30 days after the date of the final rule for uses of HCFC&hyph;141b and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blends in new equipment (including retrofits made after the effective date) and as of January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1996, for uses of HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends in existing equipment. For purposes of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP determination, ``existing equipment'' is defined to include equipment that companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have shown a clear intention to use and have purchased before the effective date of the SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, even if that equipment has not yet been installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier in this action in Section VI.B., the Agency is authorized to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grandfather existing uses from a prohibition where appropriate under the four-part test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sierra Club  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> supra. The Agency has conducted the four analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under this test, and has concluded that the balance of equities favors a grandfathering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of two years for uses of HCFC&hyph;141b in existing equipment in this application. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition set forth in this action clearly represents a departure from previously established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice, as use of the substitute was allowed previously. Existing users of HCFC&hyph;141b who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switched from class I substances into this solvent invested in this substitute on the assumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it would be a sufficient improvement over the class I use. Prohibiting their use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute immediately would impose a severe economic burden on these users. These factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken together outweigh any statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing users. This is especially true since the restriction applies immediately to new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment using HCFC&hyph;141b, which creates no incentive for continued investment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment using HCFC&hyph;141b in this application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Taiwan has  deported 25,299 Chinese immigrants since 1987, but it is holding  another 2,346. Future repatriations have not yet been arranged  with Mainland China, said the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC],  which handles the government's contacts with Peking [Beijing].  The Mainland Chinese come to seek better-paying jobs in Taiwan.  Council Vice Chairman [Shu Chi] told reporters who visited the  Hsinchu detention center that some of them have stayed in Taiwan  over a year all because of the mainland's lack of sincerity in  cooperating with the repatriation operations.    In 1990, the Red Cross Society of Taiwan and Mainland China  agreed to repatriate the mainland illegal immigrants within 20  days of their arrest. Under the agreement, Taiwan sent the  illegal immigrants to the island of Matsu near the Fuchien  [Fujian] coast of south China for the pickup by Mainland Chinese  boats.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jamal Khashuqji report: "After News of Differences Between </F> Its Political and Military Leaderships, the Salvation Front  Prepares To Escalate; No `Gratis' Initiative for Zeroual"]    [Text] Jeddah -- Sources close to the dissolved Algerian  Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] have confirmed that FIS supporters  will escalate "armed action" against the Algerian authorities, a  signal that the FIS is not prepared to offer the new President  Major General Liamine Zeroual a "gratis initiative" under which  it would suspend military operations. This new FIS position  comes after news of differences between its political leadership  and those responsible for armed action over contacts with the  government.    The same sources expect the FIS' "serious" military  escalation to be carried out soon by the FIS supporters who have  joined the so-called "Islamic Salvation Army." They stressed  that "information they received from inside [Algeria] indicates  that the fighters are now in a strong position, having managed  to close their ranks and secure large quantities of arms and  continuous sources of supply." The sources believe that any  "suspension of armed action would lead to a loss of the current  zeal and drive and could lead to sharp differences in the ranks  of the gunmen whom FIS' leading ulema had managed to unite."    An FIS member who left Algeria recently and wishes to remain  anonymous for security reasons has stated that "the most  important recent achievement was the containment of the dispute  which occurred between Sa'id Makhloufi (one of the Armed Islamic  Movement's leaders) and the FIS political leadership because  Makhloufi had thought that the leadership was willing to make  concessions unacceptable to him." He also said that "another  achievement" was that "most members of the Armed Islamic Group  [as published] have joined the Islamic Army, and those who have  not officially done so are coordinating with the command of that  army." He noted in this connection that the group no longer  issues statements in its name, and he cast doubt on statements  issued in its name abroad such as the statement claiming  responsibility for the assassination of Cheik Mohamed  Busulaymani, who was close to the Hamas Movement. FIS leaders  abroad (Rabeh Kebir and Anwar Haddam) strongly condemned the  assassination.    The appearance of a taped statement with the voice of Sa'id  Makhloufi, a former officer in the Algerian Army and one of the  FIS founders who leads an important part of the operations  against the Algerian regime, criticizing the "Provisional  National Council" headed currently by Cheik Abdelrazzaq Rejam,  had raised fears of a possible serious split within the FIS.    It is now certain that by moving to escalate, the FIS is  saying that it has no intention of offering President Zeroual a  "gratis" initiative calling for the suspension of armed action,  particularly as "the mujahidin have become a difficult factor  that cannot be ignored in any future negotiations."    It is estimated that the armed Islamic movements have as  members about 8,000 youths who have joined the military  operations and are distributed over the countryside where they  control areas not within the regime's grasp. They form large  groups each in some cases exceeding 100 people controlled  sometimes by military people who have deserted from military  service. They have medium weapons such as antiaircraft guns and  shoulder missiles. They mount operations against army camps,  the police, and military convoys. A large number of them could  take part in a single operation.    A second group consists of those who are involved in  underground operations inside the cities. They go in small  groups not exceeding 10 members each and they operate in  absolute secrecy with some of them leading normal lives as a  cover. Some of them only operate at night. Joining these  groups is more difficult than joining the groups in the  mountains. Desert detention camps are an important source of  those who join this category.    Anwar Haddam, head of the FIS parliamentary mission, who  lives in the United States and is a member of the FIS Executive  Committee abroad, was the first to speak of the need for "the  mujahidin to be taken into consideration in any serious  negotiations between the regime and the FIS." He told AL-HAYAH  the day before yesterday that "the leaders of the mujahidin are  now an important part that cannot be ignored in the  decisionmaking process within the FIS." One of the most  prominent of these leaders is Abdelqadir Shabouti, known as  "Major General Shabouti," a veteran who worked with the late  Mustafi Bouway'li, the first man to declare armed mutiny in  Algeria.    FIS sources have stated that the military operations have  not  at all been affected by the national dialogue conference or the  appointment of Zeroual as head of state. They added that the  Islamic Salvation Army had claimed responsibility for a number  of operations last week, the most important of which was the  ambushing of an army patrol in Boumerdas east of the capital, in  which 12 soldiers were killed and the attackers seized the  patrol's weapons. The Islamic Army also claimed responsibility  for a number of operations carried out on 26 January, the day of  the opening of the national dialogue conference. Among the most  important of these operations were "the assassination of three  policemen in Baraki, the assassination of an officer near the  Constantine bridge," the assassination of four inspectors and an  officer in el-Aghouat [as transliterated], an ambush for Major  General Bakhouti in Warqala [as transliterated] (which he  survived), the assassination of Farhat Sheybout, member of the  Algerian Communist Party's Political Bureau in Jijel, and the  "execution" of six people in the Taher area accused of  collaboration with the police. FIS sources said that "these were  killed to put an end to the informer phenomenon."    The sources said that the Armed Islamic Movement also  claimed  responsibility for the al-Sawma'ah operation in which 15 members  of the "special forces" were killed in the area of Blida last  Sunday and also for the assassination of Rashid Nefrirt,  secretary general of "the Group for Culture and Democracy," last  Monday.</p>

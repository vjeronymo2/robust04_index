			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: Not a rod with which to beat BR, nor a recipe for results (1) Sir, In your article on the Citizen's Charter ('Mixed blessings for the three Ps', July 21) Mr John Beishon of the Consumers' Association criticises British Rail's passenger charter and says 'vouchers and petty discounts . . . given grudgingly . . . go nowhere near far enough'. On a recent journey from Wales to Russia my train was 45 minutes late arriving at Reading, so I missed my coach connection and took a taxi to Heathrow airport. I wrote immediately to InterCity and in reply received a charming letter enclosing a cheque for Pounds 33 to cover the taxi fare, a Pounds 10 voucher and the information that my fishing rod, which I had left on the train, was awaiting collection at Paddington lost property office. I think that British Rail went as far as could be expected on this occasion and look forward to using my free voucher. Edward A Taylor, Leninskii Prospekt 99/251, Moscow 117421, Russia</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Transatlantic group wins contract to run Doncaster prison A fourth company entered Britain's expanding prison services market yesterday when Premier Prison Services (PPS) was awarded the contract to manage the new Doncaster jail. PPS is a joint venture between Serco, a British facilities management company, and Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, a US private prison operator and part of the Wackenhut security group. Doncaster, the first new town-centre prison built this century, will open by July and PPS's five-year management contract is worth Pounds 66m. It will be the most complex prison yet run by the private sector, with convicted and remand prisoners, young offenders and category A high-security cases among its 771 inmates. PPS intends to bring a range of US-style, high-technology security techniques to its management. Electronic systems will be used to monitor prisoners, seal off sections of the building in the event of disturbances, and check on visitors. The systems will help the company maintain tight staffing levels, particularly in support services, and its successful bid is based on a weekly cost per prisoner place of Pounds 295 - low by all standards. The cost at the new privately managed Blakenhurst prison in Hereford and Worcester is Pounds 310, one of the lowest. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, said the PPS bid combined security with positive prisoner programmes. The company intends to provide 12 hours of purposeful activity for prisoners daily and introduce anti-bullying initiatives. Doncaster's governor will be Mr Kevin Rogers, who joined the prison service as an officer in 1964. He was until recently head of custody at Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight. PPS joins Group 4, Securicor and UK Detention Services - a consortium of John Mowlem, Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons and Corrections Corporation of America - in the prison management and escort services market. Serco provides management of support services to industry and government agencies including the Royal Aerospace Establishment, Fylingdales ballistic missile early warning station in North Yorkshire and the National Health Service. Wackenhut operates as a security company in about 40 countries and its wholly owned subsidiary Wackenhut Corrections Corporation manages prisons in the US and Australia. The new Doncaster prison will have about 350 staff and PPS plans a recruitment job fair in the town. Dr George Gray, chairman of Serco and of PPS, said industrial relations at Doncaster were likely to be modelled on the Serco pattern. The company managed a number of sensitive activities and had lost no time through industrial disputes. He expected a staff council to be established to represent employees.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["wis" report: "Western Companies Primarily Count on </F> Exports"]    [Text] Munich, 26 Apr -- In March, the companies of the  west German producing industry continued to assess their current  situation largely as negative, but in comparison with February  the Munich Ifo Institute for Economic Research noted a clear  improvement in the assessment of the situation. Regarding their  assessment of the next six months, the companies were more  optimistic. They are counting primarily on export business.    According to Ifo, the reports within the framework of the  economic development test permit the conclusion that orders  received increased in March and that orders on hand were kept at  the level of the previous month despite accelerated production.  On average, orders on hand were sufficient for production of  2.5 months, which was as long as in December 1993.    During this period capacity utilization increased slightly  from 79 to 80.3 percent. According to Ifo, the production plans  for the next few months show an upward trend. Sales prices have  again declined in various fields; over the next few months the  price climate is expected to be calm.    A differentiation in line with economic branches shows "far  less unfavorable business" for the producers of preproducts than  the last months, particularly in the chemical industry.    Investment goods producers largely assess the situation as  negative, but it has still improved, the Ifo report continues.  In particular machine-building registered an increase in  orders. There, and in electrical engineering production, plans  have "reached the threshold of the positive area."  <H5>  Expectations of East German Industry Only Cautiously </H5> Optimistic    In the durable consumer goods industry the number of  companies with a bad business situation has again declined  "tangibly." Regarding further development, the participants in  the test are, however, skeptical. The producers of nondurable  consumer goods, particularly in the clothing industry, are still  largely negative in their statements, but far less pessimistic  than before.    In east German industry the current business situation  continues to be unsatisfactory, expectations are "only  cautiously optimistic." At least, orders received in March were  considerably higher; still, orders on hand declined slightly  from 3.2 months in December 1993 to 3.1 months.    According to Ifo, capacity utilization remained virtually  unchanged at almost 76 percent, but it was considerably higher  than in March 1993 (71 percent). Export prospects are still  seen negatively; one-quarter of the companies complain about  sales problems, 16 percent about problems with financing.  <H5>  Construction Sector in Old Laender Remains Skeptical </H5>   In March, the construction sector in the west said that its  current situation is still unfavorable; expectations are still  largely characterized by skepticism. If weather is disregarded,  building output and capacity utilization remained constant over  the past months and is above last year's value. While the  assessment of those polled in the branch of public works and  foundation works was very unfavorable, in building construction  one can see a slight improvement, just as in prefab building.    In the east particularly that branch of building  construction  that is involved in housing construction expresses satisfaction.  In the rest of the sector negative assessments continue to  dominate. Prices have again declined in individual spots; most  companies, however, expect a stabilization of the price level.    According to the Ifo test, in March the business atmosphere  in west German wholesale trade again improved "considerably";  company reports allow another recovery to be expected. Turnover  probably exceeded last year's level; prices remained largely  stable, which, in the companies' view, will probably also be the  case over the next three months.    In east German wholesale trade, negative assessments are  still dominant, but the business situation has improved.  Pressure by stocks has decreased; nevertheless, one-quarter of  the companies consider their stocks too high.    Retail trade in the west and in the east reported declines  in  turnover compared with the same period last year and, according  to the poll, ordering is to be further limited over the next few  months. While in the west individual price increases are  reported, the trend in the east is going rather downward. In  the west, only the consumer markets expressed satisfaction with  the development; mail order companies, on the other hand,  complain of a further deterioration of their business.</p>

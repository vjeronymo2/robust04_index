			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials and articles published in Seoul vernacular dailies on  21 April on the reportedly pacifying gesture by North Korean  President Kim Il-song during his recent interview with William  Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic and  International Studies, CSIS, and other Western media, such as  CNN, THE WASHINGTON TIMES, and Japanese NHK Television.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled ``From the Sea of Fire to Fishing.'' The  editorial begins: ``Until recently, U.S. media was uproarious  in reporting that a war would break out on the Korean peninsula  at any time. Now, a person called vice president of the U.S.  CSIS, who interviewed Kim Il-song, states that he can confirm  Kim's pacifying attitude. Noting this rapidly fluctuating  scene, we are led to believe that Kim Il-song's game with the  South, the United States, and the media is working. Uproarious  commotions occurred in Western media concerning 'war clouds on  the Korean peninsula' in reaction to `the sea of fire' remark.  Several days later, when Kim Il-song said: `I wish to visit  the United States to fish and hunt,' a U.S. figure said there is  no war danger. Kim is certainly toying with our side. As  revealed in Kim Il-song's meeting with Western figures, he is  informed on the nuclear issue, he is resolved not to ultimately  abandon the nuclear program while continuing to deny possessing  nuclear weapons, and he will keep trying to win a package  solution using the nuclear card.'' The editorial concludes:  ``We should solidify our security posture and maintain a firm  ROK-U.S. cooperative alliance, rather than readily reacting to  the North's game, which does not display any honesty. We should  not hastily be tempted to meetings or talks with the North.''    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,300-word  article by reporter An Hui-chang entitled: ``Kim Il-song's  Pacifying Scheme -- Well-Planned Propaganda Offensive Aimed at  Deranging the South.'' The article notes that ``The `smile  operation' shows that North Korean President Kim Il-song himself  is undertaking must have been well-planned.'' The article then  notes: ``For the show, North Korea displayed a `dovish gesture'  to the world through an actor called Kim Il-song. The show is  also aimed at deranging the South. North Korea had to stage a  show like this because it is thoroughly isolated from the world  opinion owing to its incomplete compliance with the ad hoc  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.  Furthermore, the recently reported issue of North Korean  loggers and escapees from the North brought to light the North  Korean human rights issue, a disgrace to North Korea.'' The  article concludes: ``The true North Korean intent behind the  pacifying show by Kim Il-song will be revealed in the near  future.''    CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by Kim  Chol entitled: ``The ROK and the United States Taken by  Surprise.'' The article notes that ``Using a Western broadcast  covering the news connected with the tension on the Korean  peninsula and his 82d birthday, North Korean President Kim  Il-song took the United States and the ROK by surprise. Kim  tried to replace his image of a hooligan with an image of a  neighborly grandfather, a good citizen one can meet anywhere,  and a friendly figure for the American people.'' The article  notes that Kim Il-song's pacifying gesture is likely to confuse  ROK's North Korean policy and inspire the reunification  advocates who are not aware of the true nature of the North  Korean rulers. The article then notes North Korea has succeeded  in enhancing its position, as was expected, in using the nuclear  card in view of the present stage of development. The article  notes: ``Kim Il-song's nuclear strategy consists of two stages.  One is to improve relations with the United States by using the  nuclear issue as a weapon for the North Korean system, which is  left as a solitary island in the post-cold war era.'' The  article continues: ``The second stage of Kim Il-song's strategy  is to force the U.S. Forces out of the ROK, ultimately through  the improvement of relations with the United States.''    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an article by Pak  Che-kyun entitled: ``Kim Il-song's Remarks on His Readiness To  Abolish the Radiochemical Laboratory.'' The article notes Kim  Il-song's remarks in a written interview with Western media that  he is prepared to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, provided  that the United States assists North Korea to install  light-water reactors. The article notes the complexity involved  in assisting North Korea to install light-water reactors because  it would mean the United States has to spend $1 to 2 billion per  reactor, not to mention the 10 years required for the  construction of the reactor. The article notes: ``U.S.  assistance to North Korea for the light-water reactor means the  improvement of relations between the United States and North  Korea, which will probably lead to the establishment of  diplomatic relations between the two countries.'' The editorial  concludes: ``It is not likely that the ROK and the United  States will accede to President Kim's proposal at this stage,  which President Kim will no doubt be aware of. Therefore, while  unwilling at heart to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, he  is urging the United States to improve its relations with North  Korea, using the light-water reactor card, stressing that North  Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, according  to an analysis of relevant government officials.''    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word  article by Kim Pong-son entitled: ``The Government's View on Kim  Il-song's Remark Hinting of Abolishing the Radiochemical  Laboratory.''    Reporting that the ROK Government reaction was mixed on his  remark, the article notes those who have an upbeat view hold  that ``such a remark is an indirect expression of change in its  previous stance that `North Korean-U.S. talks are an  prerequisite for additional inspections,''' whereas those with a  negative view maintain ``his remark clearly shows that North  Korea intends to earn more time by adding conditions regarding  light-water reactors.''    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 700-word  article by Kim Yong-ha. Noting the huge differences in their  capacity to extract plutonium from light-water reactors and  graphite reactors, the article notes ``if North Korea's  intention to install light-water reactors is true, it can be  interpreted as an intention to suspend its nuclear development.''    The article concludes: ``The clearest sign that can be seen  from President Kim Il-song's remark is that `North Korea's  nuclear card' is becoming ineffective. Hence North Korea's  gesture implies that North Korea, being driven into a corner,  seeks an exit that serves its interests.''    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 5 an 800-word  article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok entitled:  ``Kim Il-song's Pacifying Remarks.''    Enumerating on North Korea leadership's moderate tone, the  article writes: ``With this pacifying attitude, North Korea  aims to earn the time necessary for nuclear development, to  disintegrate the ROK-U.S. cooperative system, and to deepen the  confrontation between ROK hardliners and moderates.'' The  article continues that Kim Il-song ``in effect asked the world  to take him at his world that he had no nuclear ambitions,  giving no hint of welcoming IAEA inspections.''    Noting that the North Korean nuclear issue is back to the  point it had started, the article analyzes ``in view of this,  there is a dominant feeling around U.S. political circles that  the United States should not be entangled in President Kim  Il-song's pacifying attitude and that it should firmly push  ahead with its previous scenario of imposing pressure if North  Korea fails to meet the early-May deadline.''    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word  editorial entitled: ``We Should Not Get Dazzled by a Peace  Offensive.''    Referring to U.S. and Japanese media welcoming Kim Il-song's  remarks for its moderate tone, the editorial questions: ``How  can we believe that he is telling the truth? What we need now  is his remark that North Korea will unconditionally accept  overall inspections and carrying it into practice. To one's  great regret, he has not uttered a word on this even though he  has made countless flowery remarks.''    Denouncing North Korea's invariable communist-type disguised  tactics, the editorial holds that ``regardless of such a peace  offensive, the deployment of Patriot missiles and the Team  Spirit exercise should not be suspended. The UN Security  Council should adopt sanctions against North Korea unless it  accepts IAEA inspections. What is more, we should show more  positive interest in the human rights condition in North Korea  to make North Korea acknowledge the necessity of accepting  nuclear inspections and holding inter-Korean talks.''    Recalling the recent student demonstrations opposing the  deployment of Patriots, the editorial warns that ``the people  and public sentiment should not be deceived by North Korea's  peace offensive.'' The article concludes that ``in this  perspective, the members of the National Federation of General  Student Councils should remember that they are playing into  North Korea's hands.''</p>

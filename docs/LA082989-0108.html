			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pan Am Reaches Preliminary Settlement: Pan American World Airways and 115 women  flight attendants fired for being overweight have agreed to a preliminary  $2.35-million settlement. The flight attendants claimed that Pan Am's pre-1988  weight standards were tougher on women than on men. While not eliminating  weight restrictions, the new rules permit women to be measured by the same  "large frame" standard as men, and allow women to add an additional three  pounds when they reach ages 35, 45 and 55.  </P></p>

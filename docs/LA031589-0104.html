			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO HOUSING COSTS STILL RISING, BUT THERE ARE SIGNS OF A COOLING-OFF  </P> <P> The average price of an existing house sold in the San Diego metropolitan area  continued to increase at a brisk pace in February amid indications that last  year's feverish escalation may be slowing because of the dampening effects of  higher price tags and mortgage rates.  </P> <P> According to the San Diego Board of Realtors, the average price of resold  houses in the San Diego area was $187,636 in February, a 14% increase over the  same month last year, but down 7% from the record $202,240 average price in  January.  </P> <P> A sign that the housing market may be cooling somewhat was that the median sale  price, the point at which half of all houses sold for less and half for more,  has remained flat since November. February's median price was $159,500, down  from the $161,000 median price in January and only slightly above the $159,000  median price reported by the board in November.  </P> <P> The San Diego Board of Realtors, whose members broker home sales in San Diego,  El Cajon, La Mesa and Chula Vista, has been keeping median price statistics  only since August, 1988.  </P> <P> Brokers say market activity continues strong, however, mainly because demand is  far outstripping the inventory of houses available for sale in the county. "We  have one-third the inventory we would like to have in a normal marketplace,"  said Ann Throckmorton, a broker at Century 21-Regents Properties, a residential  brokerage active in the University City area.  </P> <P> An indication of the market's strength, Throckmorton said, is that only 1% of  residential listings in the Mira Mesa area are expiring without having been  sold, contrasted with typical expiration rates of 12% to 25% of listings.  Listings usually last 90 days, she said.  </P> <P> Demand for houses remains high, brokers and lenders say, despite the  half-percentage point increase in fixed mortgage rates over the past 90 days to  11%. Fixed mortgage rates, as well as starting rates on variable mortgage  rates, are up a full point from a year ago, said Rick McGill, residential  lending manager at Great American First Savings Bank.  </P> <P> "I have not seen the higher rates translate into lower buyer activity," McGill  said. "Our loan volume is about level and may be a bit stronger than a year  ago."  </P> <P> Blaming higher mortgage rates, Dennis Casey, group vice president at Home  Federal Savings, said his S&amp;L's total year-to-date loan applications are  about even or possibly a little below last year's volume.  </P> <P> San Diego board members sold 910 houses and condominiums in February. That  total is down from 1,095 units sold in January, but up significantly from the  518 units sold in February, 1988. San Diego board members handle about half of  all resales in the county.  </P> <P> "The market may not be quite as hot as six months ago, before the  growth-control initiatives were defeated, but it is still very active," said  Chuck Hoffman, president of the San Diego board and head of ACI Investments, a  Mission Valley brokerage. "Brokers are still getting multiple offers on houses  as soon as they hit the market."  </P> <P> In November, San Diego voters turned down a ballot initiative that would have  placed strict limits on new housing construction within city limits. Fears  among prospective home buyers that the measure would pass caused what some  observers described as a buying frenzy last summer and fall. Those fears helped  drive the price of an existing house up 18% in the San Diego area last year.  </P> <P> Builders of new housing struck a more cautious view of the market Tuesday. Bill  Fontana, a partner in Westana Builders Developers of San Diego, said there has  been a slowing of buyer activity at new subdivisions because of higher prices  and interest rates.  </P> <P> Fontana, whose company will open a 142-unit subdivision in Rancho Penasquitos  next month with homes priced in the $240,000 to $275,000 range, said the  skyrocketing cost of developable lots has pushed the price of new units beyond  the reach of many buyers.  </P> <P> That high cost of land is the main reason new houses in the county cost  significantly more than existing houses, Fontana said. According to Market  Profiles, the average price tag on all new units available for sale in the  county at the end of 1988 was $211,800, or $30,000 more than the average sale  price of existing units sold by San Diego board members that month.  </P> <P> "I think we'll see a leveling off of price increases of new housing in the  first quarter (to end March 30)," said Market Profiles President Russell  Valone. His firm, a housing market research and consulting firm that tracks new  subdivision sales, will report new housing prices for first quarter 1989  sometime next month.  </P> <P> "This is the quarter that I have really been waiting to see," Valone said.  "Last year we had the growth-control initiatives hanging over the market,  putting pressure on prices. Now that they have gone down to defeat, this  quarter's data will really tell us something."  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Liberty Media shares surge SHARES in Liberty Media, a cable television programming company, rose strongly yesterday amid Wall Street speculation that its former parent, Tele-Communications Inc, was in discussions to buy back the business. Such a move could have important repercussions on the takeover battle for Paramount Communications, since QVC Network, the television home shopping company making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, is 22.5 per cent owned by Liberty. The re-acquisition would thus thrust TCI, a large and well financed company, much more directly into the battle for Paramount, and could give additional muscle to the bid by QVC, which is substantially smaller than Paramount. The QVC bid is contending against a smaller, Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid for Paramount from Viacom, the cable television company best known for its MTV pop music channel. No comment was immediately available from TCI on the rumours surrounding Liberty, though the speculation could be useful to the two companies in testing Wall Street attitudes to such a deal. The role of TCI in the Paramount bid is already a matter of some controversy. Viacom has launched a legal suit seeking to block the QVC bid, alleging it is the latest in a series of efforts to monopolise the cable industry by Mr John Malone, who is president of TCI and also heads Liberty. TCI says the suit is frivolous but Viacom has also been suggesting the QVC offer could face problems in Washington with anti-trust regulators. TCI spun off Liberty in 1991, in part to deflect political criticism that TCI was too powerful. Shares in Liberty closed in New York yesterday 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 28 1/2, on top of a rise of almost 6 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / EC lifts bar on Mars in ice-cream market MARS, the US-owned confection-ery group, will no longer find itself frozen out of the German ice-cream market this summer following a European Commission ruling yesterday against its two main competitors. The Commission cut the exclusive ties between ice-cream retailers and individual manufacturers, allowing the US company to supply all German stores with Mars, Milky Way, Snickers and Bounty ice-cream bars in time for summer. Mars complained to Brussels last September that its German operation would suffer because of restrictive contracts linking German retailers and the producers Langnese-Iglo, a subsidiary of Unilever, and Scholler Lebensmittel. The ruling said contracts obliging retailers to stock only products by those companies were a prima facie infringement of European Community competition rules and contracts would 'seriously and irreparably damage' Mars' business. The Commission's temporary decree means Langnese and Scholler may no longer insist that their tied retailers in Germany sell their ice-cream alone. Mars entered the ice-cream business only three years ago with frozen versions of its chocolate bars. Its success in pioneering this new area of the market has prompted several other manufacturers, including Scholler, to introduce rival products recently. It is unusual for Brussels to act so quickly on a complaint, but officials said Mars had convinced them that its seasonal challenge to the German producers would be severely undermined unless immediate action were taken. The Commission also plans to look into another complaint from Mars, which alleges that German retailers with Langnese and Scholler freezers are allowed to stock them only with those companies' products only. The Commission will not publish details of market shares, but Langnese is believed to control some 75 per cent of the market in west Germany and 50 per cent in eastern Germany. Scholler has 25 per cent and less than 20 per cent in the respective regions. According to the Commission, the German stores worst affected by the restrictive contracts are those catering to impulse buyers.</p>

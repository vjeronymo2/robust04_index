			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Meeker quits post as MGM president METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, the Hollywood film studio owned by the French bank Credit Lyonnais, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Charles Meeker, president. Mr Meeker's departure is the latest in a string of executive changes as the French bank tries to resuscitate the studio before selling it. In July, the bank ousted Mr Alan Ladd Jr, who had run MGM for more than two years, and brought in Mr Frank Mancuso, former chairman of Paramount Pictures, to take his place. Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM and United Artists, its companion studio, in 1992 after foreclosing on loans it made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian entrepreneur who bought the company in 1990 for Dollars 1.3bn. The bank is trying to make MGM more attractive to buyers before 1997, when it must sell the studio. In August, Mr John Calley, a Warner Brothers executive in the 1970s, was named head of United Artists Pictures, a studio which had been inactive for years.</p>

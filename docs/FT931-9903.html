			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / For CDs even the bad times are good: With computer games competing, companies are sticking to old artists BOB DYLAN was back in London this week, singing his old reliable hits such as Maggie's Farm, Mr Tambourine Man and Don't Think Twice, It's All Right. The critics complained that he seemed bored - if so, he was again capturing the spirit of an age. Last year the British music industry saw deliveries to record dealers drop 2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m - the first fall since 1980. In the most difficult trading conditions that many in the music industry have seen, companies have fallen back on old and trusted names. Mr Simon Burke, managing director of the retail arm of the Virgin group, says: 'There's been an undue emphasis on safe bets, like Cher, Madonna, Michael Jackson. They're eminently bankable, but they're not new.' Music manufacturers and retailers report that other successes have been compilations of greatest hits by familiar names such as Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard, Queen, Genesis and Simple Minds. Industry executives say that although new names pop into the charts frequently, few have a lasting impact. Mr Paul Conroy, managing director of Virgin Records, which Mr Richard Branson sold to Thorn EMI last year, says: 'There have been a lot of one-off hit singles. But the artists don't go off and develop acts. You look at the acts that there are and a lot of them are old people.' Mr Burke adds: 'The strength of creative output is not as great as in the old eras of music, but these things go in cycles. During the 1980s music had a pretty good time, but you can't do that forever.' The drop in sales has been particularly marked among the under 25s, usually a mainstay of the music business. The recession and the absence of new hits account only partly for the dearth of young buyers. Industry executives point to the large number of alternative leisure pursuits available, particularly computer games. Mr Burke says that although music sales in Virgin stores will be higher this year than last, it is the teenagers buying computer games who will really lift the company's profits. 'There's a buzz around new computer game releases that there used to be 10 years ago around new music releases,' he says. Mr Brian McLaughlin, UK managing director of HMV, the music retailing arm of Thorn EMI, says sales have been better in the 25-40 age group. 'They're becoming a more important part of our business. They're more interested in music than they've ever been.' The compilations of old hits have sold particularly well to this group. Many were previously vinyl record buyers who are now building up compact disc collections. A particular disappointment to the industry has been the failure of classical music and opera to retain the sales momentum they built up in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The success of Nigel Kennedy, the British violinist, and the immense sales generated by the opera star Luciano Pavarotti raised the hope that classical music had extended its appeal. Mr Burke says: 'That burst of enthusiasm for classical music was a bit of a flash in the pan. It was a trend based on a few artists and a few particular works that people wanted.' The industry hopes that the success of the Classic FM radio station will regenerate interest in classical music. Some classical compositions are still attracting buyers. A surprise success has been the Polish composer Henryk Gorecki's third symphony. Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI, says a music industry revival may be some way off. If past experience is any guide, he says, the music industry will recover a year after the rest of the economy. He and many of his colleagues reject the recent accusation by Sir Malcolm Field, managing director of WH Smith, that manufacturers have kept CD prices too high and that they should cut them to stimulate sales. 'WH Smith's results weren't good, so he's trying to point a finger,' says Mr Perry. Mr McLaughlin says: 'It's always questionable that if you drop prices volume will go up. We're not seeing any resistance to CD prices. CD sales are still growing, even during a recession.'</p>

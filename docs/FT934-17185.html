			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Casualties heavy in Sri Lanka battle AT LEAST 300 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in what the Sri Lankan army calls the biggest battle for more than two years in its war against Tamil guerrillas fighting for independence in the north of the island. The heavy casualties come soon after President D. B. Wijetunga had promised a new offensive against the guerrillas, after the assassination in May by a Tamil suicide bomber of President Premadasa. The Sri Lankan defence ministry said last night that 114 soldiers had been killed and nearly 250 injured in the battle for Elephant Pass, which joins the Tamil Tiger stronghold on the Jaffna peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland. It said the army, backed by jet fighters, had killed over 200 guerrillas and wounded more than 250 at the end of the third day of the new offensive.</p>

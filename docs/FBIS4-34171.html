			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia Trevisan] </F>   [Text] Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers  Party] are the two presidential candidates who have taken the  most concrete steps toward attracting evangelical voters.    Quercia chose an Evangelical -- Iris de Araujo Machado -- as  his running mate for the presidency. The PT campaign has a  national evangelical committee charged with organizing pro-Lula  evangelical committees in every capital city of the nation.    The PT candidate is determined not to repeat the error he  committed in 1989, when he lost most of the evangelical votes to  Collor. All the presidential candidates regard the evangelical  group -- consisting of 25 million people, 13 million of whom are  voters -- as one of their priorities.    The campaign that is least focused on the Evangelicals is  that of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] presidential candidate.    Deputy Lezio Sathler, a Presbyterian and the only PSDB  evangelical member serving in Congress, said: "I have noticed a  lack of action in that area. Cardoso must urgently shift his  attention to the Evangelicals."    Cardoso has the support of Deputy Salatiel Carvalho (PP-PE)  [Popular Party-Pernambuco State], a member of the Assembly of  God, who coordinated Fernando Collor's campaign among  Evangelicals in 1989.    Carvalho has not shown, however, great enthusiasm about this  job. He said: "I am going to ask for votes for Cardoso to  comply with my party's decision."    PDT [Democratic Labor Party] candidate Leonel Brizola is  well  accepted in some segments of the evangelical community,  especially in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul.    PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] candidate Esperidiao Amin,  who has already started to meet with Evangelicals, plans to  intensify these meetings.    Lula's attempt to strengthen his ties with the Evangelicals  dates back to before the start of this electoral campaign.  Presbyterian Pastor Caio Fabio, president of AEVB (Brazilian  Evangelical Association), said: "For two years, I have met  almost every month with Lula to pray and to read the Bible."    In 1989 there were widespread rumors that, if elected, Lula  would shut down all evangelical churches. The Universal Church  of the Kingdom of God went so far as to compare Lula with the  devil.    Evangelical leaders note that Lula has managed to reduce  resistance to his name, but not to the point of earning the  majority of evangelical voters.    Silva Malafaia, pastor of the Assembly of God church, said:  "The PT ideology upholds materialistic views that are contrary  to ours."    Salatiel Carvalho also opposes Lula. He said: "I will ask  for votes for any candidate running against Lula in a runoff."    Most evangelical leaders believe that Quercia's decision to  pick Iris de Araujo as his candidate for vice president will  influence evangelical voters.    Iris Araujo said: "The fact that a sister of the faith will  be on the ticket will have a greater effect on evangelical  voters." She said that an evangelical candidate will attract  evangelical voters. She added: "We have to expand our field of  action to change somewhat the materialistic mentality that  prevails in today's world."</p>

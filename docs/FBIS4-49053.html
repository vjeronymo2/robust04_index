			<p>BFN     [Text] William Hayden, governor-general of the  Commonwealth of Australia, and his wife and party successfully  ended their visit to our province yesterday [27 April], leaving  Xiamen for Hong Kong by special plane.    On 26 April, accompanied by Governor Chen Mingyi, Xiamen  Mayor Hong Yongshi, and others, Hayden and his party braved the  rain to visit the Xiahua Electronic Enterprise Company Ltd., the  Xiamen Torch High-Technology Development Zone, and the Dongdu  Pier in order to get information on enterprise production and  operation, and on infrastructure construction. Elatedly, he  said: I have visited China on many occasions, but this is the  first time I have inspected a special zone. He praised the  Xiamen Special Economic Zone for its marked successes. The next  day, the Australian guests went to Quanzhou, visiting the Museum  of Sea Communications History and the (Kailian) Temple.</p>

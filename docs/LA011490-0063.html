			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARIS PLEASURE  </P> <P> A travel agent suggested a trip to Paris in early December.  </P> <P> She said that Paris is beautiful at Christmastime and there would be no crowds  as there are in summer, spring and fall. She was absolutely right. And there  were no lines to wait in at either the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay. The French were  friendly and helpful. Winter there was wonderful and I'll jump at the chance to  do such a trip again.  </P> <P> MARGARET HASTINGS  </P> <P> La Canada  </P></p>

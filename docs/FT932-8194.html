			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Inside South Africa's atomic laager South Africa on Tuesday proposed to ban the manufacture of nuclear and biological weapons. This followed an announcement earlier this year by President F W de Klerk that Pretoria had dismantled six nuclear weapons built between 1974 and 1990. The proposed law aims to ensure compliance with international treaties and conventions governing nuclear and biological weapons, including monitoring dual-use equipment. A United Nations embargo prevents the sale to South Africa of arms as well as other items including supercomputers, which have military potential. Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance, trade and industry, told parliament: 'The object of the bill is further to promote and ensure free trade with the international community.' Senior South African officials participated in a recent conference on nuclear non-proliferation in Africa held in Harare in association with the University of Zimbabwe. John Simpson, Darryl Howlett and Jeremy Ginifer of the Programme for Promoting Nuclear Non-Proliferation examine what is known about South Africa's nuclear programme. SOUTH African officials told PPNN that their nuclear capability was not intended for use against Soviet-backed Cuban or African forces as had been previously suspected. Instead, it is claimed this capability was designed to secure western intervention, in particular from the US, in the event of an imminent threat of attack by Soviet-backed forces. It would then have conducted a nuclear test to demonstrate its possession of nuclear devices. By signalling that further devices existed, South Africa thus expected to secure western intervention to halt the conflict and neutralise Soviet nuclear capabilities. Pretoria's nuclear doctrine, which might be termed catalytic deterrence, was never disclosed and has no direct historical parallel in nuclear strategy. Nuclear weapons states have tended to regard their unilateral readiness to use nuclear weapons as central to credible deterrence. South Africa's strategy was driven by its perceived vulnerability to a Soviet-inspired attack through neighbouring African states, backed by the threat posed by Soviet nuclear weapon capabilities. It was felt that this threat could be neutralised only by directly linking South Africa to the west's nuclear deterrence umbrella. The nuclear strategy had three stages, PPNN was told. The first was a deliberate policy of ambiguity. Pretoria would 'neither confirm nor deny' the possession of nuclear explosive devices. It was thought that this stance would persuade western states to pressure the Soviet Union into exercising restraint in the region. If this policy failed, and a substantial military threat emerged, a second stage would be implemented. This was the detonation of a nuclear device. It was assumed that this would lead to frantic western diplomatic activity both to prevent any nuclear devices actually being used and to constrain the Soviet Union and its allies from further military action. The South Africans may thus have hoped to obtain western nuclear security guarantees in return for their non-use of nuclear weapons and for nuclear disarmament. If this did not produce the desired results, the third stage would be initiated by revealing to the west the existence of a stockpile of devices. The strategy was conceived during the mid-1970s, when South Africa felt territorially threatened and diplomatically isolated. The first nuclear device was completed in 1980 but, after problems with the uranium enrichment plant, only six of a planned stockpile of seven devices had been manufactured by 1989 when the programme was terminated. The limited stockpile resulted from the catalytic deterrent strategy. Of the seven devices, three were for use at the Vastrop test site. The remainder were intended as back-ups in the event of a test failure and for demonstrating the existence of a stockpile. Three shafts, drilled to a depth of 180 to 200 metres, were planned for the test site, but one shaft had to be abandoned because of geological difficulties. The other two were completed by 1977 and, although equipped with some instrumentation, were never used. The nuclear devices also appear to have been less advanced than previously assumed. In view of the catalytic strategy, it was decided to develop a nuclear explosive device, not a deliverable weapon of the type currently deployed by the nuclear weapon states. The device chosen - a gun assembly design - was similar in concept to the 'laboratory weapon' dropped by the US on Hiroshima in 1945. It had a yield of 12-15kt and used uranium 235, which could be mined and enriched within South Africa. Light can also be shed on other mysteries surrounding the South African nuclear programme. Intense speculation has surrounded the detection of an unusual double flash in the South Atlantic by a US satellite in 1979, which some considered evidence of a South African nuclear test. According to Pretoria no test occurred and no radioactive fallout was recorded in the vicinity. This may add substance to the claim that the flash was induced by a micro meteorite hitting the satellite. Claims that South Africa's nuclear deterrent programme benefited from co-operation with Israel or any other state were also denied. South Africa's explanation of its deterrent strategy raises additional questions which remain unanswered. One is whether this account is a rationalisation after the event. Only hard evidence that the devices were not produced in weapon form and that there were no aspirations to advance to more sophisticated fission can dispel this possibility. The second is whether the catalytic deterrence strategy would actually have worked if it had been implemented in the manner described. The end of the cold war may have eliminated the specific circumstances, although the idea of using nuclear proliferation as a bargaining tool to exert leverage over the nuclear weapons states probably persists. Is this strategy also the rationale underpinning the activities of other states with ambiguous nuclear programmes, such as Israel, Pakistan, India and North Korea?

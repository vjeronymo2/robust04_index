			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is now an official  candidate for the presidency of the European Commission to  succeed Jacques Delors. The announcement was made a moment ago  at the end of today's cabinet meeting. (Philippe Valcoviaque),  can you tell us how the news was announced?    [Valcoviaque] It is now official: The government is backing  Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the  European Commission. This was announced at the end of today's  cabinet meeting. The government also said it hoped a consensus  could be found in support of Dehaene's candidacy at the Corfu  European summit next week.    After weeks of uncertainty, Jean-Luc Dehaene and the Belgian  Government have broken their silence. Jean-Luc Dehaene himself  remained cautious. He hoped the decision would be made in  Corfu. It would be good for Europe, he said, if things did not  drag on too long.    As to his possible successor as Belgian prime minister,  Jean-Luc Dehaene said there was no reason to worry about the  problem until the situation came up.</p>

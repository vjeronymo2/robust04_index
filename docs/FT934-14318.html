			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / DTI launches linguistic drive THE Department of Trade and Industry has launched a campaign to improve British exporters' language skills after a survey found that a third of small exporting British companies had missed opportunities due to linguistic barriers. Only 4 per cent of Dutch companies had missed out for the same reason, while in Spain, Germany and Denmark the figures were 18, 15 and 14 per cent respectively, according to research by the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research. The campaign, launched by Sir Peter Parker, the former chairman of British Rail, is setting up a new National Business Language Information Service, which will spread impartial information on language training, and also offer advice to companies which need help. Other measures include a DTI-supported 'language audit' service, to help managers check their own linguistic capability, a new British Overseas Trade Board award for UK companies which show 'outstanding performance in the use of languages for exports', and a BBC television programme, to be broadcast in April next year, which will be aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.

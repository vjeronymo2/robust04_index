In order to expedite the recognition procedure, CSA subsequently amended its application to allow the Agency to follow a multi-phase approach. Thus CSA requested initial recognition for its Rexdale (Toronto) facility only and requested that the scope of the application be limited to in-house testing only. CSA's Rexdale (Toronto) facility was accredited by OSHA as an NRTL on December 24, 1992 (57 FR 61452). The second phase of the CSA recognition involves the CSA facilities listed above and this recognition would also be limited to in-house testing only. It is contemplated that recognition of CSA's overseas facilities will be handled separately in a third phase in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the merits of this application, the Canadian Standards Association contends that it meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for recognition in the areas of testing which it has specified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant states that for each item of equipment or material to be certified, it has the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written testing procedures, and calibration and quality control programs) to perform testing and examination of equipment and materials for workplace safety purposes to determine conformance with appropriate test standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSA's application contains sections dealing with background and history; the Certification and Testing (C&amp;T) Division structure; affiliation including a statement of independence; personnel, including experience and expertise, training, a list of key personnel, position descriptions and resumes; the certification process, including testing and evaluation, certification, reports and records and the service agreement; the field services program, including follow-up inspections, re-examination testing and field monitoring; certification services, including prototype (model) certification; testing experience, including recognition by other bodies; control programs, including the quality assurance program, control of technical and quality records, handling and storage/packaging and shipping, and test procedures; laboratory test equipment and calibration of this equipment; facilities; and, finally, CSA's appeal process, the comprehensive system for handling complaints and ultimately providing an unbiased review of any controversial matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Adwest hit by losses in defence division LOSSES IN the defence division hit Adwest, the car parts and power systems group, as it recorded its lowest interim profit for ten years. In the period to December 31 the pre-tax outcome fell 34 per cent, from Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 2.03m. Sales, however, declined only 2 per cent to Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 61.8m). Mr Fred Grant, chairman, offered some encouragement for the full year, however, saying the opening three months of the second half were significantly better than last year. 'The main reason is we are coming to an end of the rationalisation programme,' he said, 'and we are beginning to see the benefits.' The two-year restructuring programme throughout the group had resulted in staff cuts of 24 per cent over 18 months, and nine fewer factories for a total of 17. Indicating that he expected the group to return to its traditional one third/two thirds profits pattern this year, and perhaps even exceed that in the second half, Mr Grant said the interim dividend would be maintained for the fourth consecutive year at 1.25p. This was almost twice covered by earnings per share of 2.3p (3.2p). Analysts welcomed Mr Grant's upbeat comments, although the results came in at the lower end of expectations. Forecasts for the full year to June 30 were pitched at between Pounds 6.5m and Pounds 7.5m, compared with Pounds 7.1m last year. The power systems business had been hampered by losses in defence, which had since been eliminated. Adwest had no intention of abandoning defence, Mr Grant said. 'If everyone else gets out through the exit door, then maybe we would like to stay in.' The property division contributed the majority of profits. Industrial rents had been raised by 12 per cent per annum and Mr Grant expected to achieve Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2m) in rent rolls this year. On the automotive side, which represented some 60 per cent of turnover, the fortunes of the Jaguar group presented some uncertainty, said Mr Grant. 'We do not know from week to week what some of our customers will be doing,' he said. However, that uncertainty was offset by new contracts for Japanese car manufacturers such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.</p>

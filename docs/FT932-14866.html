			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Bosnia waits for Clinton ONLY President Clinton can stop the Serbs. If the job is impossible, at least he - and only he - is in a position to try. It is up to the United States to decide whether the artillery used against women and children in Srebrenica and elsewhere should be bombed. If - when - it does, its Nato allies will participate or acquiesce. Even the importunate Russians may do little more than protest. If a policy of arming the Bosnian Moslems is agreed in Washington it will not easily pass through the Security Council, but in the end it too may prevail. In such circumstances there would be much wringing of hands in London. Grey-faced emissaries would be sent to Washington. Consider the dangers, they would cry. A rational response would be: yes, we accept that the immediate result is likely to be an addition to the Serbs' stores of munitions. So be it. They are already ample. We understand the exposed position of British troops who are bravely engaged in escorting the convoys that distribute food and medical supplies and extricate refugees. Very well, withdraw the troops. We agree that the medium-term effect might be the resurgence of Russian hostility towards the west. That is a serious risk. But the murders are taking place now, on network news, at peak hours. The possible worst consequence of intervening to stop them may never happen, or can be faced. Lady Thatcher is aware of Mr Clinton's dilemma. When she was prime minister she soothed President Reagan as her task force steamed towards the Falklands. Two election victories later she strengthened the resolve of President Bush as he assembled his coalition in the Gulf. Thrown out, she taunted her successor from the sidelines until he evolved the plan to provide safe havens for the Kurds. Now, freed from the constraints of office, she is engaged in a passionate attempt to start a war to end the war in former Yugoslavia. She has run her campaign on television - including, for good measure, breakfast TV in the United States. We cannot yet assess the strength of her appeal to American public opinion, but a fair assumption is that her clarity and evident strength of character will have won her at least some converts, especially in a week in which most of the world has been horrified by TV pictures of dead, dying and wounded youngsters. As to British opinion, the evidence is that there was support for her view before she uttered a word; it can only have increased since she spoke. Her intervention this week has been magnificent. It has forced us to ask ourselves, 'where do I stand?' My answer is: 'full of dread, trembling at unpredictable consequences, but in the end nervously on the side of giving the Moslems the means with which to defend themselves.' For the former prime minister is right. We must not accept that no military counterforce can be deployed when a gang of warriors, acting in the name of national identity, commits every atrocity, every slaughter, in order to gain lebensraum on European soil. If we do, we are nothing. It should be admitted at once that there is compromise and perhaps self-delusion in this stance just as there is falsity in the British government's pretence that a 'tightening noose' of sanctions will force Serbia to accept the Vance-Owen plan. For there is no serious call anywhere  -not in the White House, not in Lady Thatcher's message, certainly not in Downing Street - for the deployment of active British or French or American troops on the ground. We may give the Bosnian Muslims the arms they need and we may risk our pilots in air strikes, but that, rightly, is as far as we are prepared to go. It is for this reason that we should consider the 'do nothing' option before rejecting it. The case runs like this: short of a huge expenditure of outsiders' lives there is no power on earth that will prevent the Serbians from winning. There is no justification for piling up body-bags containing west European and American young men and women by taking one side in an ancient Balkan conflict. Such wars occur all over the world. They always have and always will. The greatest saving in human life will be achieved by standing aside and allowing the natural victors to achieve their ambitions in the swiftest possible manner. That case was best put when hostilities first broke out. If there were to be injustices then, they would at least be the consequence of actions by the parties directly involved. The case was weakened when, at German insistence, Croatia was recognised. It was further diminished when, driven by public opinion, the arms embargo was imposed. That favoured Serbia, which commands the great bulk of the former Yugoslavian military force, plus equipment. The 'do nothing' argument was finally destroyed by the 'humanitarian aid' initiative, which assigned the task of assistant-in-chief to ethnic cleansing to the United Nations. The initial American response, which was to regard the entire conflict as a European responsibility, allowed the European Community to blunder in, wreaking almost as much havoc with its unenforceable good intentions as the former Yugoslavs managed to create on their own. We outsiders are already involved. It is too late to pack up and go home. This is not to say that Mr John Major's approach is, as Lady Thatcher implies, contemptible. The prime minister and the foreign secretary are painfully conscious of their responsibility for the safety of British troops. A parable retailed to me at second hand has Sir Peter Harding, the chief of the defence staff, warning the Cabinet of the logistical difficulties of sending troops to the Balkans. Mr Major is said to have leaned back and remarked 'you have thrown a grenade in my lap.' I cannot vouch for the anecdote, but its spirit reflects the prime minister's legitimate and understandable concerns. Lady Thatcher would not have responded thus. So what? A petty squabble between the present and former leaders of the British Conservative party is insignificant when set against the screaming emergency in Bosnia. Mr Major is doing the job he is cut out to do. That does not embrace leadership of the Nato alliance or the western world. For such a task it is necessary to catch the public mood, or correct it. It is up to Mr Clinton to pick up the challenge, or deflect it with better arguments than have yet been put.</p>

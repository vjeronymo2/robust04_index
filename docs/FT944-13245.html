			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Clarity and intensity - Concert No sooner had pianist Mitsuko Uchida begun her South Bank series of solos juxtaposing Schubert's and Schoenberg's music, than pianist Andras Schiff and friends launched their little Intimate Letters festival (underwritten by Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld) at the Barbican Centre in which Schubert was paired with a composer who seems no more likely a bedfellow, Leos Janacek. They were born within a few hundred Austro-Hungarian miles of each other, Schubert in 1797 and Janacek in 1854, but the gentle Landler influence on the first and wilder Bohemian influence on the second are not very comparable, just as Janacek's compressed, elliptical, nuggety way of writing contrasts starkly with Schubert's serene lyrical expansiveness. Schiff, who tried out the idea at his 1991 chamber music festival in Mondsee (near Salzburg), believes, however, that the two 'strong individual' voices 'work beautifully together' and he is probably, though indefineably, right. The concert he gave in Barbican Hall with violinist Yuuko Shiokawa and cellist Miklos Perenyi interwove Janacek's Pohadka ('Fairy Tale') of 1910 for cello and piano, Schubert's melodious Notturno, D897, for piano trio, Janacek's violin sonata (1922) and Schubert's E flat piano trio, and was deeply satisfying. That is almost an understatement: their account of the great Schubert trio with its vastly sustained finale was a miracle of ensemble intelligence, a ladder leading straight to musical heaven. The stray slow movement of D897 was no less of a joy: here, as in the large-scale work, Schiff perfectly caught that sublime diaphanous quality so notable in Schubert's writing for piano-with-ensemble. But he showed an equal sensitivity to the far other idiom - taut, nervous, abrupt, turbulent  -of Janacek's piano writing: his flurries of notes had a wonderfully decisive clarity and both his duet partners played with searching intensity. Schiff took a modest part in the concert given earlier the same evening by James Wood's admirable New London Chamber Choir and the Guildhall Chamber Ensemble over the water at St Giles, Cripplegate. We heard Janacek's three works for female chorus, all composed in 1916 when men had better - or worse  -things to do than sing. They proved intriguingly diverse in texture, the grim narrative of The Wolf's Trail calling not just for the piano obbligato which Schiff supplied but for a tenor who intermittently shrieks; the gently patriotic Songs of Hradcany subtly coloured by flute and harp; the pacey ballad of Kaspar Rucky stirring up a sonorous devil's brew. The best item was the sequence of 19 pithy nursery rhymes, Rikadla (1926), for small mixed chorus and a bright ensemble including ocarina and child's drum. If the earlier choruses were unusual, this was oddity running riot, and the result a masterpiece. Schubert is rarely if ever odd. Two of his piano-accompanied, female-voice part-songs opened the final concert of the mini-festival last Wednesday at Barbican Hall. Wood's New London ladies with Schiff's exquisitely weighed accompaniments found the full measure of limpid classical beauty in Psalm No. 23 (D706), Gott in der Natur (D757) and, with soloist Sarah Walker, in Standchen (D920), which was at once repeated. That relaxed gesture only confirmed the resemblance of this programme - greatly altered by the indisposition of Ann Murray and Philip Langridge, who should have been giving Janacek's Diary of One Who Disappeared - to a Schubertiad. Schiff offered pellucid performances of two Schubert sonatas, and if he missed the massy raptness of the G major (D894) - the molto moderato first movement being taken almost trippingly - he brought to the A minor (D784) a most moving simplicity and restraint.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (NA) -- Catamarca municipal  workers were involved in serious incidents outside the  provincial government house today. The demonstrators said they  would take over the city hall building tomorrow unless they  receive their May salaries. Meanwhile, the tense situation  continues in Salta and Santiago del Estero.    In Catamarca, municipal workers protested outside government  house, city hall, and the legislature. They lit fires with the  garbage that has accumulated in the streets as a consequence of  the indefinite garbage workers strike that started on 14 June.  [passage omitted]    The fires made aerosol cans explode. The fire damaged the  government house main door before firefighters arrived. Police  and border police agents confronted the demonstrators to prevent  serious incidents. [passage omitted]    A large percentage of public workers continued their "work  to  rule" today, a measure they will continue until they receive  their May salaries.    The protest has virtually paralyzed the provincial public  administration. It includes assemblies and rallies in work areas  to demand their back salaries. [passage omitted]    In Salta, public workers went on strike and mobilized in  front of the provincial legislature demanding a basic salary of  500 pesos.    Miguel Quiroga, ATE-Salta [Association of State  Workers-Salta] social action secretary, said the protest "seeks  the payment of salaries on time because health workers and  pensioners did not receive their salaries yet."    In Santiago del Estero, the State Unions Front organized a  rally for tonight. The rally follows a strike involving teachers  and judicial branch workers that is being widely observed.    The strike was to protest the transfer of the pensions fund  to the nation, to demand an emergency salary increase, and  against the policy of privatizations announced by Federal  Trustee Juan Scharetti.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PANEL TO PROBE SENATORS WHO AIDED KEATING  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee said today it will conduct a formal investigation  of five senators who intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Charles H.  Keating Jr., a wealthy political donor who headed a huge savings and loan  seized by the government earlier this year.  </P> <P> The Keating case can have an enormous political impact for the senators, who  have received more than $1.3 million for their campaigns and causes from the  former head of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. All have denied  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The committee action will begin a preliminary inquiry as the panel tries to  determine whether there was a link between the Keating money and the  intervention by the senators: Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John  McCain (R-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio), Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and  Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.).  </P> <P> Federal banking regulators took control of Lincoln on April 14 in what is  expected to be the nation's worst thrift failure. The cost to taxpayers is  expected to exceed $2 billion.  </P> <P> The Ethics Committee had previously hired an outside counsel, Robert Bennett of  Washington, to determine whether a formal probe should begin.  </P> <P> "It's a good move," said Murray Flander, press secretary to Cranston. "That's  something that the Ethics Committee has a total right in its own judgment to  decide. We aren't at all unhappy.  </P> <P> "The fact that they are conducting a full preliminary investigation and the  fact that he will be cleared, this will obviate any charges of whitewash  afterward."  </P> <P> "As far as we can tell that's what they already are doing," said McCain  spokesman Scott Selley.  </P> <P> DeConcini commented, 'I welcome a thorough evaluation of the facts and feel  confident that I will be exonerated."  </P> <P> Glenn is out of town and not immediately available, said assistant press  secretary Paul Brinkman.  </P> <P> The other senators also could not be reached.  </P></p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / People: King of Soya, and Nightclubs - Olacyr de Moraes, Brazilian entrepreneur, tells Angus Foster he wants to live a little The great American industrialists of the last century started empires based on railways, agriculture and construction. Olacyr de Moraes has gone one better and in a different continent; one of Brazil's most powerful businessmen, he has built an empire spanning all three. In little more than 40 years he has turned his main company, Grupo Itamarati, from a tiny transport firm into a sprawling conglomerate with an annual turnover of more than Dollars 1bn. Known in Brazil as the King of Soya, he is the world's biggest private producer of soyabean. He owns one of the country's biggest construction companies. He is building a private railway, which could eventually stretch for 3,000 miles and which he hopes will open up Brazil's interior. And now, at the age of 63, he is investing in telecoms, banking and power generation. Despite all this, meeting de Moraes is a bit of a surprise. Expecting a strutting tycoon surrounded by maps of his dominions, the visitor finds, instead, a quiet, initially shy man who easily could be mistaken for a provincial bank manager. And there are contradictions. Despite his (presumably) enormous wealth and the success of his businesses, he does not seem content. Recently divorced, he has earned another nickname - King of the Nightclubs - because of his relationships with very pretty, much younger girlfriends. 'When you are single, you come to the conclusion you need to live a little,' he says. 'Why should I live the life of a monk? I am still working the same amount as before with the same responsibilities. Our businesses have never done as well as they are now. In fact, I think going out with beautiful women brings you luck.' Born and brought up in Sao Paulo state, he started in business in 1947, running a small delivery company in Sao Paulo with his father. Its clients were mainly in construction; in 1957 after his father's death, de Moraes decided to enter the industry as well. His construction company, Constran, started with small projects, such as building roads and housing. As economic growth accelerated, construction became an important sector for successive democratic and military governments. Constran prospered under both, and grew into one of Brazil's biggest private companies. From 1968, some of the profits from construction were diverted into agriculture. Enormous mechanised farms were developed in the south-western states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, at that stage thought to be too far from Brazil's main markets to be viable. These farms, up to 250,000 acres in size, needed irrigation and soil correction to reduce acidity. Once prepared, however, they became extremely productive and Itamarati moved from wheat to soya to cattle and sugar. According to his public relations resume, de Moraes built Itamarati 'with the talent and keenness of a great entrepreneur who has never hidden the satisfaction that he has made an important contribution to the economic and social development of Brazil'. In person, the King of Soya tells it slightly differently. 'I've been successful because of hard work. I started working when I was 12, always on Saturdays and Sundays. It wasn't always wonderful. It was extremely difficult. I worked hard.' He says his main job now is to select the managers for each division rather than be involved in day-to-day decisions: 'Each division is now highly professionalised.' His son, Marcos Augusto, 27, is being groomed to take over the group and is at present overseeing investments in telecoms and a satellite joint venture. Itamarati is still wholly family-owned, and de Moraes sees no chance of that changing. 'It is a very big group and there is always some need for one part to help another. For instance, profits from agriculture have gone towards the infrastructure interests. We can do this because we are flexible. It would be difficult if we had outside shareholders.' The group will enter new businesses by providing some capital, but also rely on joint venture partners for skills and finance. Infrastructure projects, including telecoms and power stations, are key growth sectors for de Moraes. He believes Brazil's government will be forced to withdraw from areas of the economy it traditionally saw as strategic. Later this year, for instance, the company will start operating two hydro-electric power stations, a business which until 1990 was closed to the private sector. 'The government no longer has the money to invest in areas like telecommunications and energy. Public opinion is changing too, and not just in Brazil. Where there is opposition, it comes from employees of the state-owned firms or from companies wanting to keep their privileges. But the Brazilian people have matured and the businessmen have changed, too. Today, there is a growing realisation that we have to lower costs and become more competitive.' Itamarati's largest infrastructure project is also one of Latin America's most ambitious. The company is building the Ferronorte railway which would connect southern Brazil by rail to the Amazon and to interior states where existing links are very poor. The first section will run 200 miles inland from Sao Paulo state and is due to open during the first half of 1996. Itamarati has provided more than half the Dollars 625m needed for this. Future stages would require more outside financing. Eventually, the railway could carve through northern and western Brazil, at an estimated cost of Dollars 2.5bn and, Itamarati estimates, make 2m sq km of farm land more accessible. He believes, with a hint of visionary zeal, that Brazil's western states offer the same opportunities that were discovered in the US Midwest last century. De Moraes says that farmers along the line, who now use costly and inefficient lorries, will immediately enjoy much cheaper and quicker transport for their rice and soya harvests. Although the projected route of the railway goes past Itamarati's farms, he says the project is important for the whole region rather than just himself. 'Our involvement in the project was important; it drew attention to the problems caused by the lack of infrastructure. But only a small proportion, at most 10 per cent, of what is carried on the railway will be Itamarati goods. The project is totally viable with or without the Itamarati group.' Outsiders are sceptical about how far the railway will stretch, especially given Brazil's habit of announcing huge projects which are never finished. But they agree that, given de Moraes' record, it is unwise to be cynical. Considering Itamarati's size and range of businesses, it is surprising that the group has yet to develop outside Brazil. De Moraes says he is now too old to consider a serious move abroad. He is also convinced that there are better opportunities in Brazil and that the country will soon stabilise its economy and rediscover growth. A new currency, the real, was launched last July and has led to a sharp fall in inflation, which had reached 50 per cent a month. 'The real has given people a glimpse of what it would be like to have a stable Brazil,' he says. 'The country managed to grow even when there was economic chaos. So imagine what could happen if we had stability; I think we would have enormous development.' Stability is a dream that he and countless other Brazilians have long harboured. But the chaos in their lives has not dented their patriotism. 'If I could start again knowing what I know now, I'd be 50 times richer,' he says. 'But I'd do it again in Brazil, which is still the best country in the world from my perspective. It's just that the people are no good]' he says, laughing for the first time.</p>

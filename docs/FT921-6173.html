			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Observer: Help wanted Local government job of the year. Finance director to 'undertake the challenge of financial management' of a small council. Salary Pounds 38,361-Pounds 41,268 plus Pounds 978 car allowance etc. Candidate must have 'the input and vision necessary to lead the authority through the formidable challenges of the future.' Formidable indeed - the employer is Comhairle nan Eilean, the Western Isles Council, whose Pounds 23m loss in BCCI cost Donald Macleod, last holder of the post, his job. The resulting borrowing is likely to cost the 31,500 islanders about Pounds 3.4m a year for 30 years, and this year's poll tax has gone up 470 per cent, from Pounds 26 to Pounds 122, plus Pounds 58 water charge. The new finance director's salary is a lot more than most of the islands' crofting inhabitants make, and even the higher poll tax shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>

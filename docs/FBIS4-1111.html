			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] fighters continue  their campaign to liberate our country. News from the front  sent to us by Calixte Mugabo says commanders of the government  forces continue to send soldiers to their deaths at Rebero Hill  in Kigali, where 100 soldiers, including their commanders, have  been killed. At Jari Hill, also in Kigali, around 100 also have  been killed.    In Rwamagana in eastern Rwanda, which is in the hands of the  RPF, a colonel who was commanding the government forces was  injured. The question now is why soldiers continue to die  protecting the clique of killers. They should see the truth and  rather fight the killers who are determined to exterminate the  whole country.    Let us return to war news from the Kigali area. Our  colleague Calixte Mugabo informs us that currently the RPF  controls the communes of Gikoro, Gikomero and Bicumbi. In areas  where government forces are withdrawing, they are leaving behind  many heavy weapons.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Israel's growth stalls as more are out of work: Immigration drive may be harmed A TREND of rising output and employment in Israel has stalled since late last year with worrying implications for the country's uphill struggle to absorb mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, according to the Manufacturers' Association. Surveys of employment in 1991 and the performance expectations of industrial companies suggest that public sector expansion and a now flagging construction boom were mainly responsible for GDP growth of 5.2 per cent last year. Since the last quarter, the domestic boom has slowed, with little sign of the export-led industrial expansion that economists say is needed for enough long-term growth to cope with immigration. 'Until now we have not produced enough jobs and we have not produced them in the right places,' Mr Chezi Gutman, head of the Manufacturers Association's economics and foreign trade division, said yesterday. 'We still have the same problems of one or two years ago. Exports are the solution but what happened in the industrialised world did not help us to produce the exports and the right jobs.' The arrival of some 400,000 immigrants in the last two years, the vast majority from former Soviet territories, has pushed unemployment above 10 per cent, which in turn is blamed for a recent slump in new immigrant arrivals. Although a reduced influx would give the economy a chance to catch up, that is politically unacceptable given Israel's commitment to encourage all Jews to immigrate - hence the government's anxiety to win Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in US loan guarantees to help generate investment and job creation. Manufacturers' Association figures show that 69,000 jobs were created in the first nine months of 1991, compared with 34,000 in all of 1990. But more than 30,000 were in the public sector - mainly in health, welfare and education - and more than 18,000 were in construction where a government-fuelled building surge is now declining. Industry accounted for 14,000. The association's latest survey of 133 industrial companies revealed that marginally more experienced a decline in domestic orders rather than a rise over the last months of 1991. About 37 per cent expected a fall in sales in the current quarter, compared with 34 per cent forecasting an increase. More companies predicted workforce cuts than those expecting to employ more. Mr Gutman said he expected domestic industrial growth of more than 8 per cent last year to be halved in 1992. A brighter outlook emerged for exports, which he said could grow by up to 4 per cent after a decline in 1991. But that is still well short of the government target of double-digit export growth needed to cope with the import costs and employment demands of immigration.</p>

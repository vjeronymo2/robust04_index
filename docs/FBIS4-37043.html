			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Officials of the Islamic Republic have repeatedly  commented on the insecurity of the regime and have said that  security should continue to be a major issue. Where does the  regime's concern come from and what plans are officials  preparing to establish security?    Obviously the Islamic Republic is under intense pressure  both  at home and abroad. At home the people's dissatisfaction with  the regime is increasing more each day. The outcome of the  policy for economic adjustment and some minimal economic steps  have only led to more bottlenecks in the lives and livelihood of  millions of Iranians. The policy of economic adjustment that  the regime has adopted has led to the dismissal and unemployment  of tens of thousands of civil servants, workers, and teachers  and more and more people are without jobs in our country. Thus,  the lives of the poor and the destitute are becoming more  difficult each day.    At a time when inflation is soaring, undoubtedly the  disgruntled people will not sit idle but will demand work,  bread, health and hygiene, education, and other needs. This is  one of the main roots of the insecurity that the regime speaks  of. But the regime, which is unable to ensure either the  people's livelihood or work, is preparing to fill the empty  stomachs and protesting throats of these people with [word  indistinct].    Meanwhile, the regime's failure to confront the so-called  cultural onslaught by the West is yet another issue that has  increased its concern and feeling of insecurity. However, the  regime's officials have not only not learned a lesson from their  defeats but they want to continue their blind opposition to the  civilized world and its achievements.    The rulers of Qom and Tehran have also realized that the  preservation and safeguarding of an ideological regime like that  of the Islamic Republic cannot be possible without crushing  freedom and democracy, violating human rights, and interfering  in the people's private lives. They also know that the people  oppose this policy of the regime and will fight it.    The clerical regime, which is politically, culturally, and  philosophically unable to satisfy the people, will undoubtedly  resort to suppression, the gallows, torture, and arrests to  advance its policies and to crush the people's freedom-seeking  ideas. Thus, the regime's inability to meet the people's daily  needs, the deepening of the economic crisis, the fall of  cultural policy into an impasse, the isolation on an  international level, and the pressures of public opinion have  all helped to instill these feelings of concern and insecurity.  Because of all these elements, the regime has deployed all of  the country's potential to ensure its security and to preserve  itself.    The most important part of this security plan is the  centralization of the suppressive organs, the strengthening of  the (?ties) among them, and the elevation of the combat ability  of its forces. It is not without reason that the regime has  assigned Besharati the responsibility of heading the Islamic  Republic's [Supreme National] Security Council in addition to  his position as interior minister. Also, the organizing of its  suppressive forces and of its war machinery is another part of  the regime's security plan. The regime now intends to further  organize its suppressive forces and to increase their strength  in crushing operations.    Seyfollahi, commander of the Islamic Republic's  law-enforcement forces, says that he needs 300,000 fresh forces  to remove the existing problems. In addition, among the  regime's other steps are the return to the scene of the  Resistance Basij and the formation of another body known as  executive officers for judicial affairs to help in the  implementation of the policy of doing good and shunning evil in  a bid to safeguard the security of the Islamic Republic.    In addition to all these, the regime has also issued orders  on the formation of a rapid deployment force to further crush  Kordestan. Efforts to weaken the opposition's activities also  form another part of the regime's policy. The signing of joint  accords with Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to plot against  the Kordestan movement and the Baluchi combatants is the most  convincing proof of this.    In addition to all of this, the Islamic Republic is also  trying to limit the sphere of activities of the [Iranian]  opposition in Europe. To achieve this, it inflicts pressures on  it on the one hand and grants concessions to it on the other.  [sentence as heard] Clearly, the assassination of regime  opponents is the most outstanding aspect of the regime's  security policy abroad.    In short, the regime continues to pursue the policy of  suppression and violence to safeguard its security. But the  question is: Can this policy have a favorable outcome for the  regime? We think not because the methods that the Islamic  Republic has adopted and tested throughout its existence have  all been futile and have not borne any favorable results. Now  that the regime is facing an impasse because of its clerical  policies, thoughts, and culture the only thing that it can use  is suppression and violence. Since it does not know any other  language but that of suppression and arms, naturally we should  expect it to speak in this language. However, sooner or later it  will be proven that the regime's suppressive machinery will not  always be useful vis-a-vis the people's determination and  uprisings and that finally it will have to kneel down in front  of the people and of justice.</p>

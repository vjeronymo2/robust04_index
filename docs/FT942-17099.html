			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Romanians follow IMF's line Romania's government endorsed a 1994 draft austerity budget based on recommendations made by the International Monetary Fund. Revenues are set at 9,660bn lei (Pounds 4bn) and the deficit at 1,878.8bn lei, or 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Romania is seeking around Dollars 700m in new IMF credits to prop up its economy. The spending was meant to boost investment, including housing construction, and to encourage exports, the government said.

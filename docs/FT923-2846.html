			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / EC states move for UN bar on Belgrade THE Serbian-controlled rump state of Yugoslavia came under fire at the opening of the United Nations general assembly session last night, with moves foreshadowed to bar it from UN bodies. Britain's delegate, Sir David Hannay, said the Belgrade government's claim to be the successor of the disintegrated former state of Yugoslavia was 'anomalous and unacceptable'. He said European Community countries would seek a bar on the rump state, which consists just of Serbia and Montenegro. The EC nations would ask the UN Security Council to recommend to the 179-nation General Assembly that representatives of Serbia and Montenegro 'not be allowed to participate in the work of UN bodies.' This would mean the effective suspension of Yugoslav representation in the UN. But Belgrade could later apply for separate UN membership. The breakaway Yugoslav republics of Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina have already done this and have been admitted to the UN in their own right. Their delegates formally backed the EC initiative, which is expected to be considered by the Security Council within a few days. UN diplomats said they did not expect Russia to veto the move in the Security Council. President Boris Yeltsin has been criticised at home for going along with measures against the Serbs in Bosnia-Hercegovina. But even so, diplomats believe Russia may abstain from voting, along with China. The move seems virtually assured of endorsement by the General Assembly. Turkey supported the move on behalf of the 47 members of the Islamic Organisation. Mr Dragomir Djokic, Belgrade's ambassador, stressed that his government did not claim to be the sole successor to the former Yugoslavia. He voiced concern that a move to suspend its representation was coming just as efforts were being intensified to implement decisions of the recent London peace conference. The move could jeopardise those efforts, he warned. It would be the first time since 1974 that a member state has been so ostracised bythe UN. In the earlier case, South Africa was ejected on a credentials challenge but continues as a UN member. Editorial comment, Page 20</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-chairman </F> of the Supreme Soviet of Belorussia, by Lyubov Bazan; place and  date not given: "'I Love Stanislav'"]    [Text] Belorussia [Belarus] is preparing for  presidential elections. One candidate for this office is  Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  Belorussia, who chatted with a ROSSIYA correspondent and shared  his thoughts concerning the country's present and future.    My recall from the office of chairman of the Supreme Soviet  was nothing more than a well-staged political intrigue. I cannot  agree and never will agree with the reasons that allegedly  brought about my dismissal. The charge of corruption is a clever  and skillful lie. The true reasons for my dismissal go deeper,  of course. My disagreements with the majority of the Supreme  Soviet came to light long since, in the first months of business  even. And in the final period the conformist deputies of the  supreme legislative body no longer bothered to keep up a "good,"  democratic appearance even. My entire activity in the office of  chairman was a succession of compromises in the name of the  solution of fundamental questions making it possible to look for  progress in the development of the republic. In a situation of  constant opposition my main task was, perhaps, to push through  as many laws as possible making the process of transformations  irreversible. I went along with much for the sake of this, but  the differences with the nomenklatura majority of the Supreme  Soviet were too serious. My resignation from the office of  chairman does not mean that I have renounced political struggle.  Now, when the government and the Supreme Soviet have brought the  republic to the most severe economic crisis, I believe that to  quit politics would be irresponsible.    The very low level of political literacy of the population  is  a dangerous symptom.    Events could begin to develop in unpredictable fashion,  especially since the republic has, truly, been reduced to a  deplorable condition and many people have lost all bearings as  to what is going on.    Many people like simple, more precisely, primitive,  speeches,  but not everyone wishes to think about what follows them. One  presidential candidate, for example, Aleksandr Lukashenko,  proposes the same simple and eye-catching solutions for all  problems as V. Zhirinovskiy in Russia. Without military pushes  to the Indian Ocean, it is true, but the rest is the same.    The instability in society is being stoked by inflation,  which is running at 50-60 percent a month.    The needy and the retirees are suffering particularly. How  can the state protect them? After all, we have to have something  in order to be able to give it out. There's nothing to be gotten  from an empty pocket, and Belorussia's pocket is now empty.  Structural reforms and privatization are needed, but how is all  this to happen?    The Belorussia People's Movement, which has nominated as  presidential candidates A. Lukashenko and V. Novikov, secretary  of the Party of Communists of Belorussia, is enjoying success in  the indoctrination of the electorate against the background of  the impoverishment of the people. They are promising everything,  and all at once, what is more: the restoration of order, a fight  against corruption, wages for all who want them. Aside from this  populist demagogy and the customary promises of a "bright  tomorrow," the Belorussia People's Movement is preaching  postulates that are fraught with serious complications with  other states of the CIS, primarily with Russia. It is sufficient  to mention the rhetoric concerning the building of Belorussian  socialism or the restoration of the USSR according to the  prescriptions of the Moscow red-brown opposition. And S.  Gaydukevich, chairman of the Belorussia People's Movement, is  declaring publicly that other winds will shortly be blowing from  Moscow. It is the needy and socially unprotected strata of  society that are becoming the social base of these forces,  unfortunately.    Very characteristic of Belorussia today are charges against  the democrats, who have "reduced".... But permit me to ask:  Where in Belorussia are there democrats? And how could they have  "reduced" anything if they have not yet held power even?    The party apparatus and the nomenklatura are the basis of  the  present government and Supreme Soviet. Party officials of all  ranks, who were swept from their positions by the events of  August 1991, have come to head all local government--oblast,  city, and rayon--authorities. These people are continuing to do  what they have done their whole lives: to solicit credit and  then to distribute it, stealing in large and varying amounts.    In a normal society responsibility for what is happening in  the state is borne by the government. With us, however, some  mythical democrats are to blame for all misfortunes.    I have always opposed a vetting act and I do not believe  that, had it been adopted in Belorussia, as in certain  postcommunist states of East Europe and the Baltic, we would  have avoided the crisis. I am convinced that no person should  bear the stigma of his past activity because this was legitimate  activity. A person is entitled to any ideological convictions,  communist included. The Belorussian People's Front has always  insisted on a vetting act, I do not share this opinion.    Such is my approach also to the national question, which has  engendered tumultuous processes in many post-Soviet republics.  Those who want to impose Belorussian by extremist methods are  hardly doing Belorussia or this language any service. Everything  should develop naturally, not forcibly, we should avoid only  adopting any decrees. The Belorussian people are, generally,  very tolerant, and now, against the background of the ongoing  national battles in other countries of the CIS, and not only of  the CIS, Belorussia could set an example of interethnic  relations.    If I am elected president, I shall begin, I believe, with  three most important matters.    First, I shall dismiss all the industrial manager-ministers.  The time for empty prattle is past. People with market thinking  and education who have no connection with the party school of  the Communist Party of Belorussia Central Committee must,  finally, assume the positions of the ministers connected with  economics, finances, agriculture, and foreign economic relations.    Second, the privatization of everything subject to  privatization is essential. There can be no more demagogy on  this problem, and the creeping nomenklatura "plunderization," at  which the Soviet authorities have become so adopt over these  years, must end.    And, of course, elections for a new Supreme Soviet. The 13th  Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR--and it is this that is  still operative in its full composition of 300 people's deputies  elected in USSR times even--can no longer remain the supreme  legislative body of the republic.</p>

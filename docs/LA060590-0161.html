			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS VOW TO CUT EUROPEAN ARMS;  </P> <P> U.S. EXPRESSES CAUTION OVER PLAN TO TRIM 1,500 WARHEADS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union said today it plans to withdraw 1,500 nuclear warheads and  other tactical short-range nuclear weapons from Central Europe by the end of  the year, but the United States expressed caution about the announcement.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who made the announcement, said  later that "a very small amount, relatively," of Soviet battlefield nuclear  weapons will remain in Europe after the withdrawals.  </P> <P> "This is going to be a very substantive amount," said Shevardnadze, in  Copenhagen for a 35-nation human rights conference.  </P> <P> U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, also at the conference, was  cautious in his assessment of the announcement.  </P> <P> "We are still in the process of taking a look at it, analyzing it," Baker said.  He said the extent of the withdrawal is not clear, nor is whether the Soviets  would destroy or simply remove the weapons.  </P> <P> Also, Baker said, it was not clear whether the arms Shevardnadze spoke about  would have been withdrawn in any event with the Soviet troops being pulled out  of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze and Baker are meeting during the human rights conference to push  ahead with issues discussed during the Washington summit between Soviet leader  Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush.  </P> <P> A central issue is the military future of a united Germany. Europe and the  United States want Germany as part of NATO, but the Soviet Union has balked at  that idea.  </P> <P> Speaking at the conference, Shevardnadze said a compromise could be found in  Soviet differences with Washington over Germany. He said that the Soviet-led  Warsaw Pact would begin a "transformation" at its next meeting and that NATO  should do the same.  </P> <P> "This is the way, as we underlined in the past, that we can find a compromise  on the German issue," Shevardnadze said.  </P> <P> Baker planned to assure Shevardnadze at a meeting tonight that the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization would undertake a review of its mission in light  of easing East-West tensions.  </P></p>

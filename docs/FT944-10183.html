			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Anti-cholesterol drug sales lift Sankyo Sankyo, a leading Japanese pharmaceuticals company, posted a firm rise in earnings due to strong sales of its anti-cholesterol drug Mevalotin, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company posted an 8.4 per cent rise in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y43bn (Dollars 439m) in spite of a 2 per cent decline in sales to Y202.2bn. The fall in sales was triggered by cuts in official drug prices by the ministry of health and welfare, and the transfer of sales rights of Zaditen, an asthma drug, to the Japanese arm of Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceutical group. The company posted a 5.6 per cent rise in operating profits to Y42.3bn and an 11.2 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y19.2bn. Sales of its drug division fell 1.9 per cent to Y180.7bn although Mevalotin and Loxonine, an analgesic drug developed by Sankyo, saw sales increases. Revenue from agro-chemicals sales fell 0.6 per cent to Y12bn. For the full year to March, the company expects current profits to rise 3.4 per cent to Y83bn while sales are expected to remain flat at Y396bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 23 May (AFP) -- Official sources have  reported that today, at the conclusion of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN] Special Congress, former Nicaraguan  President Daniel Ortega was reelected secretary general of his  party for a new three-year period.    Ortega was able to secure the support of the majority of the  "orthodox" sector of the FSLN for his proposal to maintain the  party's traditional struggle politicies in opposition to the  current endorsed by his election adversary, Henry Ruiz, a  legendary Sandinist leader who represented the reformist sector  of this political organization.</p>

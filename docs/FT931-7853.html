			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Managers are left behind on way to market: Russian management is ill-equipped for the move away from a command economy to capitalism A YEAR after the launch of frenetic economic reform, the Russian government and western aid donors have yet to tackle a desperate need for management skills to help the state-owned economy switch to a market system. The problem was officially recognised for the first time by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new deputy prime minister for economics, when he said last month that inefficient managers of state-owned enterprises would have to be 'helped' to change their ways or go. Until now the government, focusing on price liberalisation and privatisation plans, has simply hectored managers for not adjusting to new conditions and attacked the central bank for pumping credits into inefficient enterprises. Apart from frequently changing the rules of the game on tax and trading, it has also failed to remove some of the old restrictions which prevent the Russian manager from acting like a western chief executive. Only a minority of managers, long used to receiving orders from above, have tried to learn the ways of their capitalist counterparts. Others, motivated by ignorance or fear, have contented themselves with lobbying the authorities for extra 'working capital' and the write-off of their debts to one another. 'Some officials and industrialists have this idea that indexing working capital can solve the problems of enterprises. But they are fighting with the symptoms rather than the cause of the problem - which is bad management,' says Mr Alexander Rubtsov, head of Ernst &amp; Young's Russian management and accounting joint venture, Vneshconsult. As a result, few managers are equipped to make a success of large-scale privatisation which is due to affect 6,500 enterprises this year. Dr Zubaidur Rahman, of Deloitte Touche in Moscow, says the biggest problem is an absence of management accounting - or the process of gathering information needed to take decisions about present and future business. After seven decades in which there was no need for western-style management because decisions were made by central planners and prices were fixed by the state, he says most managers cannot calculate or monitor their costs properly (notwithstanding the additional complication of very high inflation now raging in Russia). Most enterprises have only a faint idea of the time-value of money. Hence the loud complaints by managers about annual interest rates of 83 per cent being far too high despite the fact that inflation last year was about 2,000 per cent. A primitive banking system aggravates cash-flow management problems. Another big problem is the lack of sales teams at enterprises and of a developed distribution system. But Mr Rubtsov is optimistic that young Russians, 'hungry for work, risk-taking, and free of prejudices from the past' will provide a new generation of enterprise managers. That generation has already been ushered in by older men, like Mr Viktor Korovin, the 40-year-old manager of heavy engineering giant Uralmash. Other pioneers include Mr Nikolai Bekh, general director of Kamaz, the truck maker transformed into a joint-stock company a few years ago as a government-sponsored experiment in capitalism. While most of his colleagues asked for more money and fewer changes in government policy, Mr Bekh told the government last year that directors' main problem was a 'lack of management accounting'. Not surprisingly, management consultants in Moscow have a lot of good ideas around for how foreign technical assistance funds can be deployed. Dr Rahman, who trained more than 100 Kamaz managers, would like to replicate a similar training scheme for managers in the oil industry, a proposal which he has put to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for possible financing. But the real problem will be getting assistance for managers who may be open to change but cannot afford it. Mr Rubtsov, as head of the Russian management consultants' association, is trying to enlist European Community funds to 'train the trainers' - educating hundreds of Russian consultants to provide affordable management advice for enterprises. All agree that training in Russia is not only cheaper but more effective. 'If they go abroad, they want to waste time shopping,' says one. Recognising in the meantime that political pressures will continue for more funds, Mr Rubtsov, who is also a member of the government's advisory industrial council, advocates a carrot-and-stick approach. This would make limited financial support conditional on changes in management practices, fitting in well with the government's determination to tie new funds to an improved performance at enterprises.  ------------------------------------------ SKILLS NEEDED BY ENTERPRISES:  ------------------------------------------ Cost control Marketing and distribution Cash flow management  ------------------------------------------ TASKS FOR GOVERNMENT:  ------------------------------------------ Efficient banking system Cut bureaucracy and provide stable tax and legislative environment Allow for faster depreciation of assets  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, A GIVING GUY, GETS NOTHING;  </P> <P> SUMMIT: PRESIDENT OFFERED ALL HIS CONCESSIONS WHEN HE SAT DOWN AT MALTA. HE MAY  HAVE MADE THEM TO A CORPSE.  </P> <P> In his new biography, "George Bush, an Intimate Portrait," former diplomat  Fitzhugh Green describes a character trait associated with the President since  childhood: his extraordinary generosity.  </P> <P> Green writes: "George was the most giving individual, offering to share  anything and everything -- from food, to toys, to clothes -- with the others.  They nicknamed him, 'Have Half' for this trait."  </P> <P> Generosity has helped make George Bush a popular man all of his life. But there  is a question as to whether this disposition, on display at Malta and Brussels,  well serves U.S. strategic interests.  </P> <P> At Malta, Bush offered all his concessions as soon as he sat down, before  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had a chance to speak. He would grant,  Bush said, favorable trade terms, if only Moscow codified its emigration policy  on Soviet Jewry; he then committed the United States to a new arms agreement by  June. Taken aback by the sweep of the Bush concessions, Gorbachev gave nothing  in return.  </P> <P> In Brussels, Bush told NATO that we would keep U.S. troops in Europe, as long  as our allies wanted them, and he signed on to the conditions, sought by  Britain and France, before Germany is reunited:  </P> <P> "Unification should occur in the context of Germany's continued commitment to  NATO, an increasingly integrated European Community, and with due regard to the  legal role and responsibilities of the Allied powers . . . moves toward  unification must be peaceful, gradual and part of a step-by-step basis . . .  lastly, on the question of borders, we should reiterate our support for the  Helsinki Final Act."  </P> <P> Unsurprisingly, Bush departed to a standing ovation.  </P> <P> One high official was quoted as saying that at Malta, Bush agreed to conclude a  START agreement by June, so that Gorbachev could take something home to the  Soviet military. If so, that official has lost his marbles, for the President  painted this country into a corner.  </P> <P> The START agreement entails deep cuts in U.S. missile silos and submarines,  cuts that are terribly risky in a world where the Red Army could suddenly hold  dictatorial power in Moscow. And a START agreement means indefinite  postponement of strategic defense.  </P> <P> Instead of discussing missiles, which are yesterday's agenda, and utterly  irrelevant to the crisis in Europe, Bush should be talking about getting  Russian troops out. In the six months since he proposed cutting U.S. and Soviet  troop levels to 275,000 on each side, even the Bush plan has been overtaken by  events. With the people of East Europe demanding that Soviet armies pack up and  go home, why sign an agreement legitimizing a permanent Red Army presence?  </P> <P> Nor was Bush's affirmation of the Helsinki Final Act, which ratified the land  grabs of the Hitler-Stalin pact, a wise move. Why commit America to the  finality of borders imposed by Stalin?  </P> <P> In agreeing to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's insistence that U.S.  troops remain in Europe, Bush gave up all of his bargaining leverage. What is  the British-French game? Paris and London want the United States to remain at  risk, in the event of war; they want the United States to continue carrying a  defense burden that belongs to Europe; they want a permanent U.S. presence in  Germany, because they fear and distrust the Germans and secretly share Moscow's  desire that Germany remain divided.  </P> <P> Why is this in America's national interest? Why should we be delighted with a  situation, where, if ever an unstable Europe explodes, the United States is  automatically at war? Why set new conditions for German reunification, when the  rush of history is already making them irrelevant? Why extend trade credits to  a Kremlin with enough cash on hand to give Fidel Castro $5 billion annually to  attack our interests in Central America? Borrowing the title from book that  tops the best-seller list in Japan, we need "An America That Can Say No."  </P> <P> Bush's desire to help Gorbachev is understandable, but he must know that a U.S.  President's embrace cannot help Gorbachev in a showdown with Moscow  hard-liners; and, if a showdown is coming with anti-Communists, we ought not to  be on Gorbachev's side.  </P> <P> In Eastern Europe, the revolution is gaining momentum. The old Stalinists and  orthodox Communists are history. Now it is the turn of the reform Communists,  whose role model is Gorbachev. In Czechoslovakia, East Germany and the Soviet  Union, the idea is taking hold that the whole rotten system can be overthrown.  It is not impossible that Bush made his Malta concessions to a corpse.  </P> <P> In Tehran, in 1943, one hour of U.S. concessions guaranteed half a century of  Cold War. Bush's concessions at Malta are much less dramatic and unlikely to  prove remotely so significant. Franklin D. Roosevelt faced a bloodthirsty  dictator at the peak of his power, but Bush is talking to the czar of an empire  in collapse.  </P> <P> But, still, the United States needs and lacks a vision of a new world and "new  thinking" to realize that vision. And in its absence, that vacuum is being  filled by Europeans, East and West, who have their own nationalist axes to  grind.  </P> <P> Communism's crisis is deepening. Czechoslovakia and East Germany are close to  chaos. Either the Communists there make a stand soon, or they pass into  history. Now the spotlight shifts back to the Soviet Union, and the same  question reasserts itself. Will the party of Lenin go quietly to its grave?  Will the Kremlin permit Stalin's empire to fall apart without a fight? With  such questions extant, it is folly for America to be chatting up deep cuts in  the great arsenal of Democracy that has kept the peace.  </P></p>

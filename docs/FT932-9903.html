			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Major supports me, says Rushdie MR Salman Rushdie, the British author, said yesterday he had received unequivocal support from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, in his campaign to force Iran to lift its death order over his book The Satanic Verses. The Indian-born writer, in hiding for over four years since the fatwa was ordered by the late Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader, said the meeting was 'probably the most important day of the campaign.' 'It will send a message around the world - to our allies and to Iran,' he told a London press conference. 'It is very important that the British government is now leading from the front.' Mr Major's first meeting with Mr Rushdie, indicating a further hardening of Britain's line, is likely to incense Tehran, which claims Mr Rushdie's book is blasphemous. Downing Street said yesterday Britain had great respect for Islam, but added that the fatwa did no service to its religion. Mr Rushdie gave no details or proposals discussed with Mr Major, saying he had undertaken not to reveal concrete plans. Relations between Iran and Britain were 'frosty and might get frostier any second,' he said. Downing Street said no specific action had been decided yesterday. The prime minister had underlined his full support for Mr Rushdie's rights as a British citizen and expressed concern that Iran had not repudiated the fatwa.</p>

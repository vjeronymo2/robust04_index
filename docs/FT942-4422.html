			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World News in Brief: Europeans begin task of selecting new parliament The UK, Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands go to the polls today, opening the continent-wide voting for the European parliament. Balloting in the eight other EU states - Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain - takes place on Sunday. The elections will also be seen as a popularity test for some national governments. The UK's Conservative government led by John Major is under most pressure, expected to lose about a third of its 32 seats in Europe. EU poll issues, Page 2; Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 7 NORTHRIDGE PLAYERS ON ALL-CCAA TEAMS  </P> <P> Craig Clayton of Cal State Northridge was named the California Collegiate  Athletic Assn.'s Pitcher of the Year while teammates Scott Sharts and Denny  Vigo were selected to the all-conference first team.  </P> <P> In all, the 39-member team announced Monday included seven players from Cal  State Northridge, which tied for the conference title.  </P> <P> But the sentiment around the Matador clubhouse a day later was that it was not  nearly enough.  </P> <P> Clayton, a sophomore right-hander who led the CCAA in victories with 12 and  also batted .390, was bypassed in favor of UC Riverside's Pete Weber in  player-of-the-year balloting by conference coaches. Weber, a senior, was among  the conference leaders in runs batted in and batting average.  </P> <P> "He's an outstanding college baseball player, there's no doubt about it," CSUN  Coach Bill Kernen said. "But he's not the player of the year in this  conference. Clayton just has to be. He hits .400 and leads the league in wins.  I've never seen a guy do that before."  </P> <P> Weber was among 10 Riverside players selected for the squad. Including Weber,  the Highlanders had four players on the first team, four on the second and two  honorable-mention picks.  </P> <P> On the second team from Northridge was sophomore outfielder Greg Shockey, who  batted .321, and pitcher Vale Lopez, who was 9-4.  </P> <P> Receiving honorable mention from CSUN were Scott Richardson, a freshman second  baseman, and Eric Johnson, a freshman outfielder. Riverside's Jack Smitheran  was named coach of the year. Kernen, who took his team to a share of the title  while starting four freshman and four sophomores, received two votes.

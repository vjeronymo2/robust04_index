			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Unemployment up sharply in west Germany UNEMPLOYMENT in western Germany increased sharply last month, and short-time working shot up by more than 160 per cent, as the downturn took hold of the economy. The number of jobless rose by 46,700 to 1,830,300, according to the Federal Labour Office, the first time since 1984 there has been an unemployment rise in October. The unemployment rate in west Germany now stands at 6 per cent, compared with 5.4 per cent one year ago. At the same time the numbers on short-time working increased from 122,200 to 326,700, as short shifts were introduced principally in the mechanical engineering industry, iron and steel, the automobile industry and electrical engineering. Although there was a slight fall in the numbers officially unemployed in east Germany - down 13,300 to 1,097,500, a rate of 13.5 per cent - a key factor was withdrawal of job seekers from the labour market. The proportion of women among the jobless in east Germany is almost 65 per cent, reflecting the disproportionate loss of female employment since communism collapsed. Mr Heinrich Franke, the president of the Labour Office, stressed that another 1,700,000 would be registered unemployed in east Germany if it were not for labour programmes designed to alleviate the jobs crisis there. Almost 500,000 are taking part in full-time training schemes and 370,000 in job creation programmes; there are 837,000 on early retirement pensions. Spending on unemployment benefit and other labour market schemes is expected to increase by between DM2.4bn and DM3bn (Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.2bn) in both east and west Germany above the current budget figure because of the economic downturn, government officials said. As part of a package of budget savings measures, the government has agreed to increase unemployment contributions next year from 6.3 to 6.5 per cent of wages to pay for the excess, but to reduce pensions contributions by the same amount. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said the shortfall on pensions would have to be made good in 1994. The German trade union federation (DGB) called for urgent measures from both the Bundesbank, in relaxing the current high level of interest rates, and from the government, in accelerating investment plans, to counteract the rise in unemployment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of the Republic, Lieutenant General  'Umar al-Bashir, has confirmed the revolution's adherence to the  cultural course accepted by the Sudanese people of making god's  law their arbiter. He said that the dogfight of the enemies and  those lying in wait for us would only make us more determined to  move forward to establish a good society, a society of values  and decent morals.    Lieutenant General al-Bashir made it clear in his speech  before the masses during the holding of god's table [ma'idat  al-rahman ayt -- breaking the fast for the poor] at Umm Baddah  that the conspiracy of the West will not frighten us, because we  know that power belongs to god alone. The shortage of funds,  men and fruits [koranic quote] to which we have been subjected  is no more than a trial from god to test the extent of our  adherence to his course and the extent of our turning towards  him.    He stated: We once again declare our rejection of all  resolutions and charters of the security council and the United  Nations which contradict god's law.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lancs Enterprises rises 5% to Pounds 1.43m Lancashire Enterprises, the local economic development company, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.43m in the half year to April 30, an increase of 5 per cent. The interim dividend rises 8 per cent to 1.35p (1.25p). The shares are traded on a matched bargain basis. Earnings per share were 5.4p (4.5p), after taking into account a share split and a 1-for-1 scrip issue in March. Turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds 7.55m (Pounds 6.17m), but profitability was affected by business development costs, including the launch of Partnership UK, which offers packages of employment and economic initiatives to local authorities, and a consultancy service for developing countries, particularly in eastern Europe.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Slight decline in expenditure - Scotland SCOTLAND'S share of government expenditure will decline slightly as a result of updating the formula under which most of the Scottish Office budget is determined. The change is due to the decline in the Scottish population compared with that of England. However, the effect will be marginal in the next financial year and should be offset by measures worth Pounds 208m, announced by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, to boost construction and help business. The Scottish Office's 1993/94 budget will be Pounds 13.5bn, a rise of 2 per cent in real terms, taking into account new responsibilities for universities and community care. Since 1979 the Scottish Office, which funds such matters as health, education, law and order and local government in Scotland, has received 11.7 per cent of any increase in England's share of government spending on similar items. This will fall to 10.6 per cent. The change may satisfy English MPs who claim that Scotland receives too large a share of spending, but does not affect the basic expenditure to which annual increases are added. Wales and Northern Ireland have benefited slightly from the updating of regional spending rules. On the 1991 census, they will receive 6.02 per cent and 2.87 per cent respectively of any changes to comparable programmes in England.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Professor faces more expenses allegations Fresh allegations about expenses on overseas trips were made yesterday against the former chief executive of Health Promotion Wales, a government quango. The allegations emerged as police said a file was being sent to the Crown Prosecution Service following an investigation into expenses claims by Professor John Catford. Lawyers for Health Promotion Wales have been asked to recover more than Pounds 3,000 from Prof Catford, who resigned in February after admitting a brief affair with a woman colleague in Brazil. An investigation by the district auditor has now pinpointed four other trips in which Prof Catford apparently received for work fees that he did not pass on to his employers. Details of the report were made public by Mr John Davies, chairman of Health Promotion Wales, who said visits to Belfast, Denmark, Poland and Germany between 1991 and 1993 were involved. 'We shall be taking the appropriate steps to recover these monies,' he added. Prof Catford, now working abroad, has strenuously denied any misuse of public funds while chief executive. Police confirmed a file was being sent to the CPS following an investigation by fraud squad detectives.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Fidel burger Conclusive evidence that the Cuban revolution is over: the government is trying to interest foreign investors in rehabilitating and operating Havana's Sloppy Joe's bar, formerly one of the country's leading tourist attractions. Closed almost 30 years ago, the bar featured popular, albeit down-market fare. Whoever takes on the job has been promised the same building. But will the famed innocent-tasting but potent daiquiris and planter's punches, as well as the splendid jamon y queso sandwiches return? Missing for sure will be the stunning senoritas once available for encounters at Sloppy Joe's. Some aspects of the revolution continue to defy change. The building containing the bar still has photos of some of its better known clients, including boxer Joe Louis and film stars such as Errol Flynn, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra and Alec Guinness. One thing will have changed: the new bar is certain to have a no-smoking section. Maybe the country's leading non-smoker - Fidel himself - will take a seat.</p>

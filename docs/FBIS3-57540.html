			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vafa Gulizade, state adviser on </F> international affairs, by Beshir Sherifov; place and date not  given--live or recorded]    [Text] [Sherifov] Moscow and Yerevan are reportedly  continuing discussion of regional political problems. The  Armenian side has asked Russia to reconsider the deployment of  Russian troops on the Azerbaijani-Iranian border. What is your  view on this issue?    [Gulizade] Moscow is not discussing regional problems only  with Yerevan. It discussed them with Baku first. Before  [Armenian Foreign Minister] Papazyan and [Karabakh Foreign  Minister] Gukasyan met Kozyrev in Moscow, Azerbaijani Foreign  Minister Gasan Gasanov had already met and given an in-depth  explanation of Azerbaijan's position to Kozyrev. During my  meeting with Gasan Gasanov he told me that Kozyrev heard and  understood all our positions.    We are here to discuss a conflict between Armenia and  Azerbaijan. I don't set great store by such press reports.  Armenia has reportedly asked Russia to consider deploying  Russian troops on the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Armenia can have  no role in this issue. Azerbaijani troops are watching over and  defending--they will defend--Azerbaijani borders.    [Sherifov] It is also being said that at these talks the  view  was expressed that Azerbaijan should accept giving broader  political status to Nagorno-Karabakh and should even concede  Shusha.    [Gulizade] On the issue of status, I can only say the  following, which I have said before: Similar views were also  published in the U.S. press to the effect that Armenia has  suffered a political defeat in its struggle over  Nagorno-Karabakh. Why? Because even if we consider the status  of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast [NKAO], they  can't achieve a broader political status than that. In other  words, the NKAO had a very broad political status. There can be  no discussion about status. It is still very early. Therefore,  first, Azerbaijani land must be liberated. No autonomy will  ever be better than the autonomy that was. Shusha won't be  conceded to them. Indeed, no Azerbaijani city will be conceded  to them. I want to assure our television viewers and  compatriots of this.</p>

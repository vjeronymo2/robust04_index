			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso left home  at 1000 this morning. For 20 minutes he poured his heart out to  journalists. He said he faced much more than a defeat.    Before entering the Finance Ministry, he granted another  interview and said that late this afternoon he will meet  President Itamar Franco at Planalto Palace.    He really poured out his heart during the interview. He even  suggested summoning a national constituent assembly to decide,  once and for all, about the constitutional review. Here are the  main portions of the minister's interview:    [Begin recording] There was no defeat. It was worse than  that. We again lacked a quorum. We again saw that Congress does  not want to perform its responsibilities before the country.  This is not a defeat. It is worse than a defeat. Institutions  are not fulfilling the duties Brazil believes to be theirs.  Brazil wants to see them vote yes or no. If they vote no, we  know what to do, yet Congress simply fails to attend the  sessions.    I will fight. I will fight as long as I can, but only as far  as the president believes to be reasonable, only as long as I  believe there is a possibility of adopting constructive actions.  Someone once said that being a minister is not a permanent  state. One is a minister only for a certain period of time.    The constitutional reform is behind all these difficulties.  There is a so-called leftist group of congressmen that believes  there should be no constitutional reform and simply fails to  attend the session. A conservative group wants the reform but  is afraid of the changes and, for that reason, does not appear  at Congress either. The result is anarchy: There is no review,  reforms are not implemented. The situation is at an impasse.  If there is no reform, which is the basis of these changes, the  main Brazilian problems will remain untouched.    If we try more effectively to fight tax-evasion, for  example,  we are blocked. If we try to increase taxes paid by the  financial sector, we are blocked. It is curious. When we  proposed fining the owners of unproductive land and increasing  taxes on wealthy people, those who always criticized the  financial sector refused to vote. This proves that the Brazilian  legislative branch and our legislative culture are always  seeking alliances and looking for benefits. The price of this  attitude, however, is paid by the people.    If things continue this way -- and I may become convinced  although I have never favored the idea -- we may summon a  national constituent assembly. This specific and new assembly  will have to establish the paths the country will tread.  Frankly, I no longer believe that Congress, which has been  badly damaged, has the energy to adopt the decisions Brazil  needs. Despite efforts by some to apply medicines to heal  Congress without submitting it to surgery -- like the Corruption  CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] -- I believe it has  no energy to make decisions.    Will we have to wait a whole year? Will we have to hold  elections -- God only knows under what conditions -- before  being able to do something? If we want to do anything it will  have to be now because the deadline for the constitutional  reform is near. Would it not be better if the forces that still  believe in this country got together and said: We will elect a  group of Brazilians with the exclusive task of conducting the  constitutional review? This can be done in two or three months.    How long will the Brazilian people tolerate this situation,  particularly when one impasse simply leads to the next? [end  recording]    Minister Cardoso added that he has always been supported by  the president who has given him carte blanche. He confirmed  that he will meet the president this afternoon and that any  decision he adopts will be made jointly with President Franco.</p>

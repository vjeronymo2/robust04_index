			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Belgium and British Gas lead day of large issues A NUMBER of high-quality borrowers raised large amounts in a variety of currencies in the international bond market yesterday, but the heavy supply was readily absorbed. The Kingdom of Belgium raised DM1bn through a five-year Eurobond issue. The amount was above market expectations of DM600m and the maturity shorter than expectations of seven to 10 years. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, said that the proceeds would be used to refinance existing D-Mark borrowings. The bonds were priced at 99.95 to yield 15 basis points over the series 104 of medium-term German government bonds. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened by as much as five basis points before widening out again to about 12 basis points in the afternoon. An official at the lead manager, Deutsche Bank, said that Belgium had been advised to raise a larger amount in order to establish a new five-year benchmark. There was above-average demand from the UK and a good proportion was placed in Switzerland and the Far East. By contrast, the shorter maturity made the bonds less attractive to German institutions which tend to prefer bonds with a 10-year life. The Deutsche official said Belgium had opted for the five-year maturity in order to reap the cost advantage of the sharp drop in yields at the shorter end of the German government bond yield curve, prompted by hopes that the Bundesbank will cut leading interest rates tomorrow. He noted that Belgium would have had to pay 40 basis points more if it had opted for a 10-year maturity. The issuer had also decided against the seven-year area of the yield curve because it would have had to compete with the EC's recent DM2.9bn Eurobond issue. The EC's bonds now yield 12 basis points above underlying German government bonds compared with eight basis points at launch. The recent widening of sovereign yield spreads on D-Mark Eurobonds, triggered by the warnings on Italy's foreign currency debt by leading credit rating agencies, could dissuade similar borrowers from issuing in D-Marks, the Deutsche official said. In an active sterling sector, British Gas made its widely-expected appearance with two issues raising Pounds 200m each, one with a maturity of 10 years and the other with a life of seven years. Both issues were priced to yield 32 basis points over comparable UK government bonds and the spread on both issues had tightened slightly by late afternoon. An official at CSFB, which arranged the deals with Goldman Sachs, said that investors showed a marginal preference for the 10-year maturity but that both issues were quickly placed. There was firm demand from continental European accounts looking for exposure to sterling. Syndicate managers expect more UK corporate borrowers to tap the Eurosterling sector in the near future, encouraged by the tightening of corporate yield spreads. The European Investment Bank also took advantage of the pent-up demand for sterling paper and re-opened its Pounds 400m issue of 8 per cent Eurobonds due 2003, launched in January. The new tranche of Pounds 200m was priced to yield five basis points over the 8 per cent UK gilt due 2003 and the spread tightened slightly by late afternoon. An official at the lead manager, Samuel Montagu, said that most of the demand for the bonds came from overseas. Meanwhile, the Province of Ontario launched its first Canadian dollar global issue and the level of demand was such that the amount was raised from the minimum CDollars 1bn to CDollars 1.5bn. The bonds, which have a life of 10 years, were priced to yield 93 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds, the lower end of the indicated range of 93 to 95 basis points and within market expectations. By late afternoon, the spread on the bonds was unchanged. An official at Merrill Lynch, one of the four joint lead managers, said that 30 per cent of the bonds went to Canada, 10 to 15 per cent to the US, 35 per cent to Europe and the rest was placed in Asia.</p>

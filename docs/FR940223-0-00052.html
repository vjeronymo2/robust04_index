			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsible parties may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS, remedial design and construction, and O&amp;M, or EPA and the States may share costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State cost share for site cleanup activities has been amended by Section 104 of SARA. For privately-owned sites, as well as at publicly-owned but not publicly-operated sites, EPA will pay for 100% of the costs of the RI/FS and remedial planning, and 90% of the costs associated with remedial action. The State will be responsible for 10% of the remedial action. For publicly-operated sites, the State cost share is at least 50% of all response costs at the site, including the RI/FS and remedial design and construction of the remedial action selected. After the remedy is built, costs fall into two categories:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _For restoration of ground water and surface water, EPA will share in startup costs according to the criteria in the previous paragraph for 10 years or until a sufficient level of protectiveness is achieved before the end of 10 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _For other cleanups, EPA will share for up to 1 year the cost of that portion of response needed to assure that a remedy is operational and functional. After that, the State assumes full responsibilities for O&amp;M.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In previous NPL rulemakings, the Agency estimated the costs associated with these activities (RI/FS, remedial design, remedial action, and O&amp;M) on an average per site and total cost basis. EPA will continue with this approach, using the most recent (1993) cost estimates available; the estimates are presented below. However, there is wide variation in costs for individual sites, depending on the amount, type, and extent of contamination. Additionally, EPA is unable to predict what portions of the total costs responsible parties will bear, since the distribution of costs depends on the extent of voluntary and negotiated response and the success of any cost-recovery actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,11  -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Cost category  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Average total cost per site <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> RI/FS  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,350,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remedial design  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,260,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remedial action  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 21,960,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Net present value of O&amp;M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3,770,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 11993 U.S. Dollars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Assumes cost of O&amp;M over 30 years, $400,000 for the first year and 10% discount rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Includes State cost-share.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> Source: Office of Program Management, Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, U.S. EPA, Washington, DC.  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Costs to the State of Texas associated with today's final rule arise from the required State cost-share of: (1) 10% of remedial actions and 10% of first-year O&amp;M costs at privately-owned sites and sites that are publicly-owned but not publicly-operated; and (2) at least 50% of the remedial planning (RI/FS and remedial design), remedial action, and first-year O&amp;M costs at publicly-operated sites. States will assume the cost for O&amp;M after EPA's period of participation. Using the budget projections presented above, the cost to Texas of undertaking Federal remedial planning and actions, but excluding O&amp;M costs, would be approximately $2.78 million. State O&amp;M costs cannot be accurately determined because EPA, as noted above, will share O&amp;M costs for up to 10 years for restoration of ground water and surface water, and it is not known if the ALCOA (Point Comfort/Lavaca Bay) site will require this treatment and for how long. Assuming EPA involvement for 10 years is needed, State O&amp;M costs would be approximately $2.3 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Placing a hazardous waste site on the final NPL does not itself cause firms responsible for the site to bear costs. Nonetheless, a listing may induce firms to clean up the sites voluntarily, or it may act as a potential trigger for subsequent enforcement or cost-recovery actions. Such actions may impose costs on firms, but the decisions to take such actions are discretionary and made on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, precise estimates of these effects cannot be made. EPA does not believe that every site will be cleaned up by a responsible party. EPA cannot project at this time which firms or industry sectors will bear specific portions of the response costs, but the Agency considers: the volume and nature of the waste at the sites; the strength of the evidence linking the wastes at the site to the parties; the parties' ability to pay; and other factors when deciding whether and how to proceed against the parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economy-wide effects of this amendment to the NPL are aggregations of efforts on firms and State and local governments. Although effects could be felt by some individual firms and States, the total impact of this amendment on output, prices, and employment is expected to be negligible at the national level, as was the case in the 1982 RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The real benefits associated with today's amendment are increased health and environmental protection as a result of increased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for more Federally-financed remedial actions, expansion of the NPL could accelerate privately-financed, voluntary cleanup efforts. Listing sites as national priority targets also may give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality surface water, ground water, soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, although difficult to estimate in advance of completing the RI/FS at these sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). No changes were made in response to OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impacts of this action on small entities, or certify that the action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By small entities, the Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this rule revises the NCP, it is not a typical regulatory change since it does not automatically impose costs. As stated above, adding sites to the NPL does not in itself require any action by any party, nor does it determine the liability of any party for the cost of cleanup at the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole. As a consequence, impacts on any group are hard to predict. A site's inclusion on the NPL could increase the likelihood of adverse impacts on responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs), but at this time EPA cannot identify the potentially affected businesses or estimate the number of small businesses that might also be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does expect that the listing of the sites in this NPL rule could significantly affect certain industries, or firms within industries, that have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problems. However, EPA does not expect the listing of these sites to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

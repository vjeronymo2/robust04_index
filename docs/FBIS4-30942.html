UN  special envoy Yasushi Akashi said "the Serbs must withdraw and  until they do the talks will not proceed." But he added that  the talks on a cessation of hostilities with the warring  parties, which were to have started here on Thursday, could  still get underway on Friday if the Serbs pulled out from the  three-kilometre (two mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic insisted in an  interview  with WTN that the Serb forces had withdrawn. "There were not  many there. They left last night," he said.</p>

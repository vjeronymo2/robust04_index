			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CME extends Globex hours THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange is to extend the time its products are traded on Globex, the electronic futures and options trading system operated by Reuters and Chicago's two futures exchanges, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The longer hours, which take effect on November 1, will eliminate a late-afternoon pause and bring the system closer to its intended 24-hour global operation. CME currency and interest rate products will trade continuously on Globex from early afternoon through to 6am next morning. The Chicago Board of Trade is not taking part in the move towards 'seamless' trading.</p>

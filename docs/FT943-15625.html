			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / BBC may launch 24-hour widescreen news The BBC is seriously considering setting up a 24-hour television news service using wide-screen digital technology. The corporation is currently trying to raise finance for the project. Talks will continue for the rest of the year with the government to see how digital services could be introduced and paid for. If approved, the technology would also be used to transmit BBC1 and BBC2. It would give viewers enhanced coverage of everything from sport to drama - with a high-quality picture rather like the shape of a cinema screen. Existing sets would show a narrow picture with a dark band above and below, but the picture would cover the screen on later models. An indication of how seriously the BBC is taking the introduction of digital services is that Mr Michael Starks has been put in charge of the project. Mr Starks was responsible for implementing the controversial 'producer choice' initiative - which gave producers freedom to buy services in the outside market. The change has been credited with making big savings at the BBC. Mr John Birt, director-general, confirmed yesterday that the BBC was seriously interested in launching wide-screen services using digital technology. He declined to elaborate, however, on what additional services were being considered for widescreen in addition to BBC1 and BBC2. Introduction of widescreen services would be very costly because of the need to re-equip studios and transmitters. One avenue of finance was cut off on Wednesday with the publication of the government's white paper on the BBC. That said the licence fee could not be increased to pay for digital services. This leaves the possibility of raising money through transmitter privatisation or ventures with private operators. Mr Birt stressed that he did not regard the white paper as a vindication of his personal policies and reforms. He said it was a group effort. 'It's what all of us at the BBC worked hard on over a long period of time,' he said. 'We developed a consensus, not just in government, but outside.' Mr Birt also cleared up one uncertainty in the white paper - a paragraph that gave both the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority the right to licence services owned or partly owned by the BBC. This is largely a technicality - and does not mean that the BBC will be applying for commercial television or radio licences. The ITC is forbidden by law from licensing BBC satellite services in the UK, so this has to be done by the heritage department.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, June 4 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, chief  strategist in the ruling coalition, called Saturday [4 June] for  policy consultations with the the opposition Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], a former coalition partner.    "Both ruling and opposition parties must consider how they  will act after parliamentary debate on the state budget (for  fiscal 1994) ends," Ozawa, secretary general of shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], said in a speech.    The withdrawal in late April of the SDP, the largest  component in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first  minority government in 39 years.    The SDP walked out of the coalition following the abrupt  formation of a new parliamentary group by other coalition  partners excluding the SDP.    The SDP has demanded that the Hata cabinet voluntarily  resign  en masse after passage of the budget through the Diet. The  overdue budget is expected to clear the Diet in mid-June.    The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party is poised to  submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet.    If the SDP supports the motion, Hata has to disband his  cabinet or dissolve the House of Representatives.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo predicted Saturday the  Hata  cabinet will resign en masse if such a motion against his  cabinet is approved.    "If a no-confidence motion is approved, the Hata cabinet  will  have no other choice but to resign en masse," Kubo told  reporters in Hachinohe in Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan.</p>

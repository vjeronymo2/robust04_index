			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Treasury toes production line: Peter Marsh weighs the criticism of an initiative that gives senior civil servants a taste of industry SIR DOUGLAS Wass, Treasury permanent secretary between 1974 and 1983 and the person who has served longest in the post since the 1950s, likes to tell acquaintances how he would have done his job better if he had had more insights into the business world. In the past few months Britain's most powerful government department has been trying to transplant knowledge of industry into the minds of its top officials, most of whom have never worked outside the Civil Service. The top 100 civil servants have been ordered to visit an industrial site at least once a year. The Treasury has also set up a new 'supply side' unit which will try to ensure that more of its officials think about manufacturing issues. It aims to do this while at the same time fulfilling its two main functions of controlling public spending and co-ordinating macroeconomic policies in pursuit of low inflation. While some see the moves as practical steps to introduce new thinking into the department, others believe they are aimed at deflecting criticism away from the Treasury and keeping pace in the Whitehall pecking-order with a resurgent Department of Trade and Industry. The drive has been given new emphasis by the appointment as chancellor of Mr Kenneth Clarke, who has stressed a new commitment to helping wealth creation. It was set in train last year by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury since 1991 and the government's chief economic adviser before that. Many have identified Sir Terry as having presided over a series of mistakes in economic policymaking. In particular he is said not to have paid enough attention to the role of manufacturing, to have underestimated the inflationary boom of the late 1980s and to have misjudged the seriousness of the recession. The new programme is described by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary at the Treasury, as a effort to create a 'friendly environment' for business in the department. The Treasury's 'supply-side' unit is in its industry division and headed by Mr Bill Guy, a long-serving Treasury official. Mr Guy will have just one other colleague in his unit, an economist. Although Mr Dorrell concedes that two people on supply-side policies does not sound very much, 'it's more than we've had before'. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, criticises the Treasury for its past attitudes to business. Even so, he finds the new initiatives encouraging. He said: 'You will see quite an impact (in government policies) if the Treasury begins to build up its own contacts with industry and gain a better understanding of what business does. What we are seeing is a shift in the balance of government policy a little more towards industry.' Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, an independent think-tank, is more sceptical. 'In part the effort is an understandable self-defence against the threat of a rejuvenated Department of Trade and Industry which is stepping up its own contacts with business. The programme also represents belated recognition by officials that they need to correct the impression of having underperformed during the 1980s.' One former senior official at the Treasury, who left in the past five years, says better contacts with industry might be a useful step but should go further than short factory visits. The former official said: 'If the Treasury really wants to understand industry it should go to the trouble of fixing up discussions with specialised people such as finance directors, whose pre-occupations are similar to those at the Treasury but who offer a private-sector view. I don't see that spending a few hours watching widgets bashed out will help very much.' In spite of these comments, one of the businessmen on the receiving end of a Treasury visit a few weeks ago thought it a useful exercise. Mr Paul Farrow, managing director of West Midlands engineering company Deritend Precision Castings, said of the half-day he spent with his Treasury guest: 'The Treasury guy listened and at the end of his day with us understood some of our problems. In the past, Treasury officials have lacked understanding about industry because they've so little experience of it.' Mr David Smith, managing director of Nesbit Evans, a maker of hospital beds, also in the West Midlands, is similarly pleased about the visit two Treasury officials made to his company recently. He said he told the Treasury pair how the National Health Service could save 'tens of millions of pounds a year' by ordering his own variety of power-assisted, washable hospital beds rather than the less sophisticated types currently purchased. He insisted this was not an example of 'special pleading' aimed at increasing his factory's orders, but a straightforward case of exchanging information in a way which - if his ideas are acted on - could cut Britain's soaring public borrowing. The Treasury has also been making greater efforts to talk to Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation. Mr Johnson is pleased by Mr Clarke's declaration of greater interest in manufacturing. However, he still thinks the Treasury is too much weighed down by its public-spending remit. 'I'm encouraged by the progress so far,' Mr Johnson said, 'but the Treasury needs to go further in moving from a negative, counting-house mentality towards a style which fits in with the real world.'</p>

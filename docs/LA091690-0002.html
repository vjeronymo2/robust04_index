			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I played the sappy music behind Secure Horizon's "Harry" commercial of which  Lorraine Evans (Viewers' Views, Aug. 19) is so tired.  </P> <P> She should realize that the actor who portrays Harry probably will retire  comfortably, and I will have my monthly phone bill paid each month by royalties  we receive when the commercial is running.  </P> <P> So in the interest of commerce and long-distance rates, hang in there,  Lorraine, and hope for the version when Beth doesn't make it.  </P> <P> Peter Siebert, Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WILDLIFE RETURNS TO CITY AS POLLUTION, INDUSTRY DECLINE  </P> <P> Less pollution, more garbage and the decline of heavy industry have brought  wildlife to London.  </P> <P> Squirrels abound in the parks, perching on trash cans at Marble Arch to munch  discarded sandwiches and lick candy papers.  </P> <P> Crows strut in Hyde Park, contesting for fast food remnants with the squirrels,  pigeons, blackbirds and sparrows.  </P> <P> Salmon, migrating from the sea, were caught in the Thames this year, a tribute  to two decades of pollution control.  </P> <P> "Foxes have moved in, rearing cubs on railroad embankments and in derelict  basements and finding food in streets and back yards," said Jeff Edwards,  conservation officer at the London Wildlife Trust.  </P> <P> One of London's glories is its parks and wild open spaces. It's also a  gardener's city, in which almost every home has its green back yard.  </P> <P> Turning up in the unlikeliest inner city corners are the ubiquitous allotments,  small patches of land distributed to retirees to raise vegetables and flowers.  It's a vestige of World War II, when the British were commanded to grow food on  every possible square foot of their island.  </P> <P> Edwards said the 1956 Clean Air Act, prompted by killer smog, stopped coal  fires being burned in homes, cleaned the air and improved the prospects for  wildlife, although increased traffic cancels out some of the gains.  </P> <P> "Kestrels are nesting in high places and preying on sparrows where they used to  eat small rodents in the country. Magpies were once seen only in the country  but are nesting in trees in the streets and pinching the eggs of smaller birds,  as well as scavenging.  </P> <P> "Wildlife can't survive in bits of formal parkland -- it needs wild places as  well," he said.  </P> <P> A prime example is Camley Street in King's Cross, where volunteers cleared  derelict land, dug ponds and then left nature to create a remarkable patch of  the wild in the midst of one of the capital's seediest districts.  </P> <P> "It is wonderful for children in the heart of London to see frogs, toads, newts  and minnows a few yards from a busy street," Edwards said.  </P> <P> But change has its price.  </P> <P> The Camley Street park is under threat from its landlord, British Rail, which  needs room to expand.  </P></p>

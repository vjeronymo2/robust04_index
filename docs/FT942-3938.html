			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Kyrgyzstan 'needs Russia' Mr Askar Akayev, the reformist president of the poor and remote republic of Kyrgyzstan, was quoted at the weekend as saying that his country was doomed by its backwardness to return to Russia's economic orbit, Leyla Boulton reports. According to the Russian Information Agency, President Akayev, in a surprisingly frank description of his nation's prospects, said its industry could not attract 'serious' foreign investment and would remain 'on the sidelines of economic progress' for at least 10 to 15 years.</p>

Sorokin, engineers; UDC  621.039.56]    [Abstract] After the 1986 Chernobyl accident, a large-scale  program to improve the safety and reliability of all plant units  with type RMBK reactors by improving the reactors' physical  characteristics was implemented. Specifically, the void  reactivity coefficient (_a_[.sub]_P_[/]) was reduced by  placing additional absorbers into the reactor core's fuel  channels and switching the reactor over to fuel that was 2.4  percent enriched in uranium 235 (instead of 2.0 percent).  Between 1986 and the present, the number of additional absorbers  in the reactor cores of the first, second, and third units at  the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was increased to 80, 85, and  93 units, respectively, and between 51 and 63 percent of the  fuel assemblies contained fuel that was 2.4 percent enriched in  uranium 235. The safety of these measures was regularly checked  by measuring the reactors' key physical parameters. The void  reactivity coefficient and fast power reactivity coefficient of  the reactors were checked at least every 200 effective operating  days, and each time a unit was shut down for repairs, the  reactors' subcriticality was estimated experimentally. The  essence of the method used to measure the void reactivity  coefficient lay in determining the weighted response of the  reactor control system's automatic regulator when the feedwater  flow rate was varied and the content of steam in in the core was  altered. Preliminary analysis of the results indicated that the  main factors affecting _a_[.sub]_P_[/] are the number of  additional absorbers in the reactor and the number of fuel  assemblies that are 2.4 percent enriched with uranium 235. A  simplified model was then developed for use in estimating the  effectiveness of safety measures taken on reactors. The analysis  performed on the basis of the model indicated that installing 10  additional absorbers in a reactor reduces the void reactivity  coefficient by 0.25_b_[.sub]ef[/] and switching the reactor  to fuel that is 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 reduces  _a_[.sub]_P_[/] with an effectiveness of  0.35_b_[.sub]ef[/] per 1,000 fuel assemblies that are 2.4  percent enriched in uranium 235. These results are consistent  with published data from experiments performed at all nuclear  power plants with RBMK reactors. Next, the effect of dewatering  the coolant loop of the reactor protection system was estimated.  No significant dependence of the magnitude of the effect on the  number of additional absorbers or the number of fuel assemblies  that are 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 was discovered.

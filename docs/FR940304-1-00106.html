			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Pilot Light Design Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that ``reduced pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light input rate'' should not be considered as a design option because pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inputs have been reduced to the optimal point. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, No. 40 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this issue. Therefore, further reductions in pilot light input rate were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northern Indiana Public Service stated that the elimination of a pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light has a very small savings. (Northern Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4). Washington Gas Light Company noted that not all of the heat from a pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light is wasted. (Washington Gas Light Company, No. 37 at 9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that only a portion of the heat from a pilot light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is wasted. In the analysis, DOE assumed 76 percent of the pilot light's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy went to maintaining water temperature. This is based on the theory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a pilot light would have the same efficiency as the recovery efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the water heater. Therefore, only the 24 percent of the pilot light input  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to be saved by an intermittent ignition device was included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Design Options for Electric Storage Water Heaters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association stated that off-peak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters save energy. (National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 17 at 1). Vaughn said that off-peak electric water heaters can save  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy use by controlling time period elements are allowed to heat water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Vaughn, No. 75 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department did include off-peak water heaters as a design option in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Engineering Analysis for electric water heaters. However, as stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the Department believes that the economics of this design option, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the absence of the nationwide availability of time-of-day rates, precludes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using this design option in setting national standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crispaire provided unit energy consumption and annual performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors for heat pump water heaters and electric resistance water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crispaire also stated that its studies showed consumer acceptance of heat pump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters. (Crispaire, No. 19 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department included two existing models of heat pump water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the analysis of electric water heaters. One was an E-Tech brand model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured by Crispaire. Energy consumption for this model was calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the energy factor derived from the DOE water heater test procedure in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect prior to October 17, 1990, <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  derated by 25 percent to account for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated reductions due to the current test procedure relative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous test procedure. This derating value was based on estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions of 15&hyph;20 percent from ETL Testing Laboratories, <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  27 percent from the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  and 30 percent from Electric Power Research Institute <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  simulation models. The Gas Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association estimate was based on the difference between data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplied in support of the rulemaking and the least efficient heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater listed in its directory. This is a minimum estimate of the difference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department requests test data on heat pump water heaters, in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the existing test procedures, for consideration in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Gas Applicance Manufacturers Association, Consumer's Directory of Certified Efficiency Ratings for Residential Heating and Water Heating Equipment, October 1990, pg 184. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> John Sabelli, ETL Labs.

(Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heat pump water heaters were analyzed as a design option for electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage water heaters. Increased jacket insulation and heat traps were also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included as design options for this product class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ohio Sierra Club commented that in many parts of the U.S., a solar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heating system is considerably more cost-effective than an electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heater.

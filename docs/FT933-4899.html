			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / City TV cameras to fight terrorism CITY OF London offices are being asked to focus their closed-circuit television cameras on public places to help combat terrorism and other crime. Plans for the 'Camerawatch' scheme were drawn up by the City of London police following the April 1992 St Mary Axe bombing by the IRA and were reinforced by the Bishopsgate bomb last April. Police believe the network of television systems has the potential to improve security in the City dramatically. Organisations with cameras are being approached to discover the extent of their coverage and their efficiency. Information already gathered shows some public areas which could usefully be covered and others where the system could be improved. Companies will be encouraged to switch their cameras to continuous monitoring of public places. They will be asked to bring the efficiency of the systems into line with recommendations being developed by the Home Office. City of London police commissioner Owen Kelly, who will formally announce the scheme today, said the knowledge that television systems were operating would deter terrorist and other criminal activity, and would provide the means of detection and evidence should offences occur.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Instant fortunes leave Medway dockers dazed THE DOCKS at the port of Sheerness were eerily quiet yesterday evening. A temporary secretary staffed the phones in the main office. Two large ships waited to be unloaded but the gantries stood idle. The beneficiaries of Britain's latest buy-out bonanza were crammed into the canteen overlooking the docks, hanging on every word about their instant fortunes from Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive of Medway Ports. The company, which owns the ports in Chatham and Sheerness, agreed yesterday to be taken over for Pounds 104m by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. Some 300 full-time employees of Medway who backed the Pounds 37m management and employee buyout of the former Trust port in March 1992 will make a killing as shareholders. Shares they bought for Pounds 1 are worth Pounds 37.25 each in the takeover. The average holding, according to Mr Vincent's back-of-an-envelope calculations, is 2,000 shares, valued at just under Pounds 76,000. One labourer bought 7,000 shares at Pounds 1 each. He is now worth Pounds 245,000. A friend said: 'He cannot believe it.' The company's four directors received, between them, shares and cash worth Pounds 20m. Mr Vincent is Pounds 12m richer from the takeover. 'Even our Mrs Mops are going to get at least Pounds 25,000 each,' Mr Vincent said yesterday. 'I think everyone will be drinking champagne for some time to come.' The sharp increase in the value of the company last night rekindled the debate over its privatisation price. Ms Joan Walley, Labour's shadow minister for shipping, called for a ban on the sale of further Trust ports. The rise reflects the transformation of Medway's performance after a halving of its workforce and the introduction of new working practices. It employed 600 employees at privatisation, of whom nearly 300 were dockers. Late last year, 269 dockers opted to take redundancy rather than accept new working practices. They were required to sell their shares back to the company for Pounds 2.50 under an independent valuation by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. But even from the dockers still employed there was no stamping and cheering as Mr Vincent gave details of the takeover - although the broad smiles seemed strong enough to disperse the rain clouds. As the employees streamed out of the meeting, few seemed inclined to resume work. Steve Craig, a docker who is 20 and single, was elated. He was granted 850 shares. He said: 'How do I feel? How do you think I feel? I might go out and buy a pub tonight.' He added: 'No, seriously, it is a one-off, something that happens only once in your life. I live in a flat. I intend to buy a property and invest the rest of the money. I want to get more stable.' Ashley Crichton is 23 and also single. He said: 'I feel as if I had won the pools. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something with my life.' Both say they will continue working at Sheerness. They are local men and have been working in the port for two years. The mood at 52 Second Avenue, the modest semi-detached home of Mr Les Harris, was rather more sombre. He was holding a meeting with a few of his friends who were among the workers made redundant by the company last November, and who were required to sell back their shares for Pounds 2.50. Mr Harris had 1,000 shares. Asked whether he was angry, he said: 'Of course I am - angry and bitter.' Takeover details, Page 19</p>

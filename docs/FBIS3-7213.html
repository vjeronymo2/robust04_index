			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Le Huu Xanh, Ho Chi Minh Institute of National </F> Politics]    [Text] In our country's rural areas today, there are more  than 987,000 party members active in more than 630,000 party  chapters. They live and carry on activities together with more  than 80 percent of the country's population in more than 8,800  villages composed of more than 50,000 hamlets. These party  members play a very important role in the movement to develop  rural life and our country's agriculture in all respects.    Reality shows that the strength of the party members and of  the movements in the rural areas depends mainly on the quality  of the core cadres at the primary level. There is no doubt about  this.    1. Looking at the past 8 years of carrying on renovation, in  difficult conditions, most of the primary-level cadres in the  rural areas have remained zealous and dedicated to the work, and  they have overcome the difficulties, maintained their quality,  and striven to complete the tasks assigned them. Some of the  primary-level cadres have matured, actively overcome the  difficulties, expanded agriculture with a commodity production  orientation, begun to tie production to markets, and contributed  to changing the socioeconomic situation in the rural areas in  basic and important ways.    Result will vary depending on the region and base, but  clearly, if most of the cadres fail to maintain their quality  and prestige and cadres lack the ability to carry out the tasks,  it will not be possible to make good changes in the various  spheres in the rural areas.    Surveys in a number of localities show that 77 percent of  the  cadres in general, 69.7 percent of the cadres in the 10 primary  positions, and almost 75 percent of the cadres in the 3 key  positions have made a great effort to carry out the tasks.    Some people say that the great leap forward made by our  country's rural areas and agriculture is due to the fact that  the mechanism has been renovated and not to the ranks of  primary-level cadres. But that is not true. It's true that this  is due in large part to the mechanism. But without people, how  could the mechanism "enter" life? Furthermore, the mechanism is  set up by people. Without people, how could there be a  mechanism? The reason why the mechanism to renovate agricultural  management has been able to manifest strength is that it has  been developed, tested, and reviewed at the primary level. The  great achievements scored by the primary-level cadres are very  clear and cannot be denied.    The rural area cadres have matured through production and  work realities, and they are tied to production and the lives of  the people in the locality. Because of this, they have the  capabilities to find real solutions to the conflicts and  problems that arise in the rural areas. This is a great and very  basic advantage. At the same time, among these cadres, a rather  large percentage have undergone training and matured in the  military and in organizations, enterprises, and schools.  Statistics from a number of localities show that in the 10  primary positions, 58 percent are demobilized soldiers and 3  percent are retired cadres. As for the three key positions, the  percentages are 64 percent and 6 percent respectively. This is a  special characteristic of the ranks, because their structure has  undergone clear changes during the past 15 years.    The average age of the rural area cadres has gradually  declined, forming clear age-group categories. In 1992, surveys  conducted at 100 villages in five rural areas representative of  the entire country showed that 40 percent of the cadres were age  35 or below (an increase of 2.3 percent as compared with 1989),  34 percent were between the ages of 36 and 45 (an increase of  1.8 percent as compared with 1989), and 26 percent were 46 or  older (a decline of 0.8 percent as compared with 1989). In  particular, in the three key positions, 47 percent of the cadres  were 40 years old or younger (a decline of 3 percent); 42.5  percent were 41-45 (a decline of 2.8 percent); and 10.5 percent  were 51 or older (a decline of 1.1 percent).    Another point that must be affirmed is that the  primary-level  cadres, particularly those in the key positions, have made  important advances with respect to cultural, theoretical, and  managerial standards. As for cultural standards, 50 percent of  the cadres have level-II standards, and 26.3 percent have  level-III standards. In the 10 primary positions, 54.5 percent  have level-II standards, and 38.4 percent have level-III  standards. As for political theory standards, in the 10 primary  positions, 52 percent have elementary standards, and 18 percent  have middle- and high-level standards, and in the 3 key  positions 35.1 percent have elementary standards and 38 percent  have middle- and high-level standards. As for managerial  standards, in the key positions, 24 percent have studied  economic management, and 18 percent have studied state  management. In each of these spheres, the percentage has  increased an average of 1.8-2.5 percent as compared with 1989.  What should be pointed out is that at many bases, this factor  has played a decisive role with respect to development in the  locality.    2. However, it must be admitted that among the ranks of  rural  area cadres, there are many problems that need to be solved.    Surveys conducted at many village bases show that 14 percent  of the cadres in general, 17-21 percent of the cadres in the 10  primary positions, and more than 16 percent of the key cadres  need to be replaced. The limitations of the primary-level cadres  in the rural areas today are evident in the following main  aspects:    First, the standards of a large percentage of the cadres are  low (also, there are rather wide variations between regions). In  the 10 primary positions, more than 11 percent of the people  have level-I cultural standards (in the Central Highlands the  percentage is 17 percent). In the three key positions, more than  8 percent have only a level-I education (more than 14 percent in  the Central Highlands). As for economic management standards, in  the 10 primary and 3 key positions, the percentages of people  who have received training are 11 percent and 24 percent  respectively. The percentages for state management standards are  8.2 and 18 percent respectively.    For the entire rank of cadres, with respect to cultural  standards, 19 percent have only a level-I education (more than  58 percent in the Central Highlands), and almost 2 percent are  illiterate (17.2 percent in Gia Lai and Kontum Provinces). Only  3 percent have received training in economic management, and  only 2 percent have received training in state management.    In general, cadres in the rural areas have not been trained  in all respects, and they cannot carry out the tasks assigned  them. Because of this, in carrying out the tasks, they rely  mainly on their experience and do things in an arbitrary manner.  They do not do things democratically, and they act in an  irresponsible manner. This is the case in many places to varying  degrees.    Second, the forces of young cadres are still sparse, and the  number of female cadres, of whom there are already very few, is  clearly declining. Surveys conducted in 19 villages in Thai  Binh, Quang Nam-Danang, and Minh Hai Provinces during 1991 and  1992 show that in the 10 primary positions, only 15 percent of  the cadres are below the age of 30, and only 10 percent are  women (both categories have declined an average of 0.6 percent  as compared with 1989). In the three key positions, only 5  percent of the cadres are below age 30, and only about 1 percent  are women (a drop of 0.2 percent). In particular, surveys  conducted in 11 villages in Hai Hung, Thua Thien-Hue, and Ha Tay  Provinces show that 10 of the villages do not have any female  cadres in the three key positions.    The same is true nationwide. Of those participating at the  village party committee echelon during the period 1991-1993,  only 17 percent of the cadres were below the age of 30, and only  11 percent of the cadres were women. Those are alarming figures  that need to be given attention.    Third, the work style of cadres in general is administrative  and bureaucratic in nature. Above all, the key village cadres  meet too often. We noted that in seven villages in two  provinces, during the first 3 months of 1992, there was an  average of seven meetings a month. The activities of many  primary-level cadres, particularly those in the 10 primary  positions, consist mainly of going from their homes to their  offices. Because of this, they are unaware of what is happening  in the hamlets and villages or learn about what has happened  only much later.    3. The material and spiritual lives of the primary-level  cadres are very difficult, and many of these cadres have many  desires and concerns.    Surveys conducted in six villages in Hai Hung and Minh Hai  provinces show that up to 9 percent of the families are poor. As  for those cadres who were "pillars" in previous years and who  have remained loyal, upright, and incorruptible, they and their  families are still living in poverty. Most of the recent  arrivals are former soldiers who have just matured. Because of  this, they are in dire economic straits.    The "hunger" for information among primary-level cadres is a  widespread phenomenon. Normally, each village receives only a  few newspapers, and these are reserved for the key cadres. Their  information is mainly in the form of official letters and  directives from higher echelons. The rest comes from listening  to the radio, but fewer than half of the cadres have a radio. In  the past, a number of villages had a system of public  loudspeakers, but because of poor management and the elimination  of state subsidies, almost all of these are broken. Because  economic life is still difficult, few primary-level cadres are  able to obtain information and study on their own in order to  raise their standards.    For several years now, many places have had a policy of not  promoting primary-level cadres to the district level. Because of  this, the young cadres at the primary level have not seen any  way to advance. At the same time, because the procedures and  policies regarding primary-level cadres are inappropriate, the  common tendency of cadres today is to "concentrate on engaging  in economic activities for their families." If they participate  in activities, they want to participate only in cooperatives and  administrative organizations. They are very afraid of engaging  in party and mass organization activities.    Besides this, at times the echo of a "new authoritarian"  class in the rural areas has generated many concerns among the  primary-level cadres, particularly the young cadres.    Also, the ideological differences among the various strata  of  cadres are becoming clearer and clearer, and these have led to  unfortunate conflicts. Some older comrades think that younger  cadres are impolite, rude to superiors, and unwilling to listen.  Conversely, younger comrades think that older cadres are  conservative, paternalistic, and empirical.    4. From various studies, we can see a number of factors that  exert a powerful effect on the ranks of rural area cadres:    a. Prior to the Fifth Plenum of the Communist Party of  Vietnam Central Committee, we had not conducted in-depth studies  or formulated a basic and synchronized economic and social  development strategy or strategy for building the new rural  area. Many of the economic and social policies on rural areas  were inappropriate and slow to be changed. We were slow to  clarify the functions and tasks of the organizations in the  political system at the primary level, and we were slow to  formulate unified work regulations based on cadre positions.    b. There are still a number of shortcomings concerning the  leadership and management responsibilities of the echelons  directly superior to the primary level. They have not adhered  closely to the ranks of primary-level cadres (monitoring things  mainly through records and reports), and appropriate and  effective policies and solutions have not been implemented.  Staff and support elements have not done a good job of guiding  and controlling the bases.    c. Primary-level cadre planning and training has not been  carried on well in accord with the the positions of the cadres.  The selection and assignment of cadres is still characterized by  either a lack of democracy, localism, and rightist tendencies or  an attitude of "wait and see" and "lethargy."    d. Many of the policies on primary-level cadres are sketchy  and even "uneven" and irrational, but little has been done to  overcome this situation. There are no effective regulations or  solutions to prevent and put a stop to corruption, undemocratic  actions, local thinking, and factionalism, which are things that  have led to disputes and disorder in the rural areas.    5. Based on the present situation, in order to solve the  above problems, in my view, efforts should be concentrated on  clarifying and resolving the following:    As for organizational activities, solidifying and improving  the party and administrative organizations, cooperatives, and  mass organizations should be closely tied to implementing the  programs and hitting the targets related to developing the  economy and society and building the new rural area in accord  with the special characteristics of each region. Based on  regulating the assignment of the managerial and leadership  positions of the administrative and party organizations at the  primary level, studies should be done in order to "frame the  responsibilities" of a number of key and primary cadre positions  at the primary level in places where this is possible in order  to improve the effectiveness of the apparatus. The experiences  of Hai Hung, Thai Binh, and Ha Tay Provinces show that the  village party committee secretary can serve concurrently as the  chairman of the village people's council or village people's  committee and that the party chapter secretary can serve  concurrently as hamlet chief.    In my view, the lessons in establishing "hamlet  administrative committees" in Dai Loc in Quang Nam-Danang  Province and the "hamlet administration" form--a partial echelon  in Thai Binh--are good lessons. The task of these units is to  help the village people's committees manage all aspects in the  hamlets over which the village people's committees have  jurisdiction. They can even regulate production (the function of  the production units).    As for cadre work, the echelons directly superior to the  bases must regularly make inspections and categorize the ranks  of key cadres by position in order to organize and arrange  things in an appropriate manner. At the same time, cadre  standards must gradually be formulated by position. For example,  cadres in the delta areas must be at least level-II graduates.  Depending on the conditions, those in the mountainous areas and  Central Highlands can have lower standards, but cadres engaged  in some task must definitely receive training concerning the  responsibilities, tasks, and technical aspects of that job. At  the same time, the cultural standards of the cadres must  gradually be raised.    The system of classes and cadre training programs must be  renovated in accord with the special characteristics of the  rural area. These should be short-term classes that are tied to  the positions of the cadres. Attention should be given to the  forms used to introduce and study the good experiences at rural  bases.    Cadre work, from observing and evaluating to training,  assigning, rewarding, and disciplining cadres, must be  democratized. Biased, narrow, and local thinking must be  avoided. Along with perfecting the the work regulations of the  organizations, we must continue to formulate and perfect the  stipulations on the rights and responsibilities of all types of  cadres based on their position. These regulations and  stipulations must be made public in order to facilitate  controlling and monitoring the activities of the organizations  and cadres.    As for policies, village cadres are part of the ranks of  party and state cadres in the present four-echelon party and  administrative system. Because of this, studies should be done  so that, if possible, the wage system can be applied in a  suitable manner. The first thing is to unify the system of  allowances based on position for the cadres at the primary  level. At the same time, we must continue to examine,  supplement, and perfect the procedures and policies regarding  state cadres who work in rural areas for long periods,  particularly technical cadres.    In summary, in expanding agriculture and developing the  rural  areas in our country, the primary-level cadres in the rural  areas play a very important role. Whether our country's  agriculture and rural areas make rapid and good progress depends  to a great extent on the standards and strength of these cadres.  Building and strengthening the ranks of primary-level cadres in  the rural areas is a basis for strengthening the role and  increasing the strength of the party.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The retail price effects for specific engines may be more or less than the costs shown here, depending on the specific technology of the engine. However, the price increases shown here reflect the relative price increases considering all types of engines in the market. Therefore, these estimates are not indicative of the price increase specific to any particular manufacturer's engine or equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Fuel Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is expected to decrease fuel consumption significantly. The average sales-weighted handheld engine is expected to experience a 13 percent decrease in fuel consumption and the average sales-weighted nonhandheld engine is expected to experience a 26 percent decrease in fuel consumption. However, these decreases are translated into small discounted lifetime sales-weighted fuel savings of approximately $0.22 for a handheld engine and $2.79 for a nonhandheld engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Maintenance Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimates that the engines produced to meet the proposed emission standards will be higher quality: the parts and raw materials will be more durable and less likely to malfunction. See Chapter 2 of the draft RSD for further discussion of this phenomenon. This will result in equipment which is operational a higher percentage of the time and which lasts longer. EPA is unable to estimate the increase in useful life or the decrease in maintenance costs at this time. EPA requests comment on the potential decrease in maintenance costs and potential increase in useful life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Lifetime Consumer Cost Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The lifetime consumer cost impact was assessed by considering the decrease in maintenance cost and the fuel savings along with the increase in retail price of the average, sales- weighted engine. The increase in price of an engine will be mitigated somewhat by these other impacts. Applying the lifetime savings in fuel costs, the average sales-weighted handheld engine's lifetime increase in cost will be adjusted to $3.82 and the average sales-weighted nonhandheld engine's lifetime cost impact will be a savings of $0.44. If catalysts are necessary this will be $4.08 for a handheld engine and $.89 for a nonhandheld engine. EPA requests comments on lifetime consumer costs. Submission of quantified estimates would be beneficial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Incremental Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA considered the potential incremental economic impacts due to today's proposal. EPA estimates the net present value of pollution control capital costs to be approximately $27 million. EPA estimates that there will be no long run negative impacts on employment as a result of this rule. Costs can be recovered through increased prices. Any potential decreases in employment that might occur due to obsolescence of product line should be offset by increased production of engines meeting emission standards. Total demand for these products has traditionally been relatively inelastic, and thus industry sales volume is not expected to decrease. Energy impacts will be positive, freeing up approximately $9 million for other uses in the economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Cost-Effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the costs and benefits in the previous discussion, EPA has prepared a cost-effectiveness analysis and has performed a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this proposal. See ``X.A. Administrative Requirements'' for an explanation of the mandate for an RIA. Because the benefits of this proposal are not easily monetized, a cost-effectiveness analysis has been prepared. The complete RIA is contained in the draft RSD. Presented here is a summary of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed small SI engine Phase 1 program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If all program costs are allocated to HC reductions, today's proposal has a cost-effectiveness of $197 per ton of HC reduced. Alternatively, if all program costs are allocated to CO reductions, the cost-effectiveness would be $37 per ton.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the costs of the program were equally split between HC and CO, the cost-effectiveness of HC reduction would be $99 per ton and the cost-effectiveness of CO would be $19 per ton.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These cost-effectiveness numbers are significantly lower than costs per ton of other available control strategies. The cost-effectiveness estimates, underlying quantitative methodology, and comparisons to other available control strategies discussed above are explained further in the draft RSD/RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the cost-effectiveness of the standard included in the current proposal is favorable relative to the cost- effectiveness of several other control measures required under the Clean Air Act. To the extent that cost-effective nationwide controls are applied to small SI engines, the need may be reduced to apply in the future more expensive additional controls to mobile and stationary sources that also contribute to ozone nonattainment, nutrient loading, and visibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, (58  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  51,735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

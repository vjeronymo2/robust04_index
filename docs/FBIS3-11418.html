			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rosa Miriam Elizalde and Amado del Pino] </F>   [Excerpts] Working from their rank and file organizations,  the party and UJC [Union of Young Communists] are waging a hard  fight against the corruption and demoralization that are  starting to flourish in the current situation. JUVENTUD REBELDE  presents today's debate on prostitution and hustling.    The packed bus stop is right across from the house, but that  is not where she will go for her night out. Somewhere else her  "friends" await--leaving other homes, crossing other thresholds,  leaving behind other families--to pair up or proceed separately  to a foreseeable destination, beginning the game that takes them  away from commitments, the daily routine, clean, everyday love.    She adopts a theatrical pose and signals to a taxi for  tourists. She is lucky: A hand opens the back door and someone  makes room. The first glance seems to put her in her place as if  she were one more object among the cheap goods, as if one could  guess the vignettes that every element of her attire could tell.  The blouse, for example, would tell of the double she drank in a  hotel bar; her shoes the screech of tires skidding to a halt;  the other items words not understood and loveless nights that  have gradually filled the clothes rack in her room.  <H5>  Parallel Histories </H5>   A number of myths are collapsing. Evidence of prostitution  does not mean that the anecdotes, the motives, the interests of  this notoriously unstable group that frequents a number of the  capital's streets and tourist zones fit together into one whole.    After weeks of research and many interviews with persons  involved or connected with it, we discovered that the topic is  far broader and more complex than appearances might suggest. Not  all the prostitution afflicting us fits the most common  definition of the term precisely, nor can it be categorized  under the picturesque label of "hustling"  jineterismo, a word in widespread use in Cuba that  apparently comes from Mexican popular speech and describes the  activities of those who make a profit in an improper or  exploitive way.    Nor is it organically linked to the form of tourism most  commonly seen here, the type that arrives on "package" tours  with a schedule organized ahead of time. Although it can also be  seen in this connection, it tends to proliferate in highly  singular, specific sectors, with a preference for temporary  residents in Cuba. Estela, one of those interviewed, explained  why:    (She is 18 but looks older under her makeup. She is  dark-skinned and has a slinky, provocative walk. In the dazzling  noonday sun, she wears a brightly colored, very low-cut dress.)  "You don't go out with just anyone who comes along. For example,  a man who stops on 5th Avenue is nearly always someone who has  been in Cuba for some time, who comes and goes freely, who  sometimes even has business here. The ones who come on  excursions are generally penniless, and since they have a set  program, they do not have time and are not interested in looking  for a woman to spend time with."    Neither Estela nor the others become prostitutes to meet  pressing economic needs. The study done by the JUVENTUD REBELDE  research team reveals that these persons sell their bodies to  buy whatever strikes their eye, luxuries, things like trips,  clothes, cosmetics, shoes. They sometimes do so with the  complicity of workers at the tourist complexes they frequent.    It would be erroneous to view the phenomenon in political  terms. Only two women openly expressed a desire to leave the  country. The rest of those interviewed merely want to have a  good time and buy things they cannot find on the market. They  want to satisfy a consumer need awakened by the movies,  distorted education, a pattern of happiness that makes material  things a cult. Prostitution here borders on the ethical. It is  the demoralization of a minority on the threshold of or within  the confines of crime and that tries to monopolize relations  with foreign visitors.    One also observes a certain somewhat caricaturish  reproduction of the structure of classic prostitution. However,  most of the persons interviewed are not connected with pimps, or  with the somewhat ghostly "houses." Estela is the exception  among the women who spoke to the newspaper:    "I began about a year ago. In the eleventh grade, I fell in  love and dropped out of school. Then I got bored with the  relationship and started going to bed with anyone that appealed  to me. I met Julian, who told me about the business with  foreigners and who initially made my `dates' for me. However,  they caught him selling clothes from the `shopping center' and  threw him in jail. Now I am `helping' him!"    JUVENTUD REBELDE interviewed several dozen persons picked at  random from among those "in the business." Their ages range from  18 to 25. We interviewed 33 of them at length. They have all  completed at least ll years of schooling and many have an  "intermediate" technical education. One girl has a degree in  accounting and finance.    While they have highly diverse backgrounds and experience,  the group shares a lack of vision of the future. Very few give  much thought to the risks involved or are troubled by the  prospect of what they do. [passage omitted]  <H5>  No Set Price </H5>   The rate changes and varies. JUVENTUD REBELDE learned that  one young woman said she set a price for her "work," while  another, a procuress, demands at least $30 from her "girls" or  the equivalent in kind (clothing, jewelry, shoes, and so on,  whose prices at stores for tourists she knows well!). However,  in general, there is no set price, nor is one thought out in  advance.    The middleman--a specimen also existing in this  milieu--usually hikes up the price of the "goods" when dealing  with a foreigner. All the women interviewed said the same thing,  although they also said they are not taken advantage of.  [passage omitted]    The belief that this type of prostitution is very cheap is  rather deceptive. Having sexual relations in exchange for a cute  child, for example, would amount to economic suicide in Spain or  France or exoticism in extremely poor taste. The high cost of  living even inflates the price of love for money.    However, in Cuba, with an economy that gives priority to the  basic needs of the population, shortages on the market and crime  that imposes exorbitant prices on the black market substantially  raise the real worth of the "presents" on which our specific  type of prostitution is based. Someone acquiring a pair of shoes  and a blouse might be earning in a matter of hours the  equivalent in money of several months of professional wages!    In addition, one is struck by the fact that JUVENTUD  REBELDE's informants come from families whose economic level is  far above the national average published by the State Statistics  Committee.    The results also suggest that the practice of prostitution  in  the capital does not coincide with other very isolated and  primitive forms of selling sex included in other studies. The  women we interviewed do not come from homes characterized by a  criminal or antisocial atmosphere. They do not even come from  homes with crammed or precarious living conditions.    The lack of any systematic elements is the very reason why  this group is so unstable. The frequency of relations varies  quite a bit, to the point where it becomes difficult to find  anyone engaging in them on a daily basis. Our research showed  that those engaging in the "hunt" for foreigners do so three or  four times a week, basically from Friday to Sunday. The rest do  so two or three times a month.    Over 60 percent of them work or go to school and not a  single  one is forced to engage in prostitution in order to eat every  day or have a roof over her head every night. Nevertheless, one  observes a trend of going from the purely "vocational" practice  of prostitution to making it a way of life. [passage omitted]    What about their families? Their social environment? With  what concealed complicity does this environment spread?    The family was present in nearly all interviews, explicit in  some and by omission in others. For most, the home is not  removed from or totally oblivious to the going out, type of  company, and gifts that many of these young women do not hide.  Only three of the women interviewed said they engaged in  prostitution unknown to the family and only two were seriously  worried about being discovered. All exhibited marked evidence of  having grown up with deficiencies in their upbringing resulting  in being dazzled by material things and a search for easy  economic benefits.  <H5>  Law of the Body </H5>   The hardening and alienation typical of these young people  as  they increasingly engage in such relations is alarming. They all  separate sexual activity from any sentiment even remotely  connected with love. Bitterness and even cruelty mark arguments  over the issue and some, who also confess their experiences with  no reserve whatsoever, speak of prostitution as "a profession  like any other." [passage omitted]    What is sad is that no longer can she tell who is a friend  and who simply wants to use her. She is not happy and stopped  being happy long ago. Anyone who takes up this type of life  becomes hollow inside and loses the ability to love, believing  that love has to be repressed because it is an ugly, inhuman  world. The enchantment of life turns into distrust.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Sowing Shame </H5>   Confronted with certain views, many would say we have no  other choice but to resign ourselves once and for all to the  "girls" who go around holding up aging tourists, as our  colleague Soledad Cruz learned while writing this piece. One  even hears with some frequency the tolerant apology, the  conformist indulgence toward those who throng to our hotels and  thoroughfares, trading sex for dollars.    There are even those who take the ostrich attitude,  suggesting that prostitution be assigned a street in Havana that  is less popular than Fifth Avenue, a practice followed in most  of the world's cities. It is a hypocritical theory, a kind of  duplicity that would lump us together painfully with those who  practice it.    Fortunately for us, we continue to use the exact same  definition of "prostitution" given by the dictionary. It is what  it is: debasement, vile use made of a thing, rather than a sign  of modernity and free sexual expression by which some would try  to justify it. These are the very people who forget that we were  once the victims of it, that Cuba was the great prostitute of  the Caribbean and, whether they want to admit it or not,  following the Revolution, that there was not a single district  where it was tolerated or a single woman who had to sell herself  in order to eat.    That is still the case. Our prostitution is notoriously one  of a kind. This is probably the only place on earth where it is  practiced for the sole purpose of enjoying luxuries. The  romantic world of La Dame aux Camelias or those poor creatures  who in so much good and bad literature alike debased love just  to survive is totally foreign to those practicing the so-called  "oldest profession in the world" in this country.    This is borne out by the research done by JUVENTUD REBELDE  over a period of months, by interviews with dozens of persons  who frequent the milieu and who admit selling themselves to  anyone willing to pay and without feeling anything remotely  connected with love.    Although the motives of those engaging in prostitution are  not all the same--there is evidence of family abandonment, the  practices of teenagers seeking the recognition of peer  groups--there is a general moral and human deterioration among  these persons who, in addition to viewing life with deep  cynicism, feel no inherent need for virtue, dignity, or decorum.    They are afflicted with an absence of values and even though  the malady is grave--even incurable in many practitioners--it is  not something that we have to resign ourselves to tolerating  permanently. Nor does the fact that it now exists in proportions  difficult to measure, threatening in certain sectors to  monopolize relations with foreigners, mean that we must tolerate  it, much less give our blessings to it. We even believe it is  possible to cure it, to stop its spread in time.    Moving toward austerity, goodness, honesty, and decency,  viewed as discretion and nobility of customs, is not enough if  the family and our surroundings, our centers of work and study,  do not harshly penalize such forms of conduct.    Without turning into policemen of sexual mores, without  turning to castrating morality, it is time to say what we think,  time to call such attitudes by their real name and--in an  attempt to to duck the issue--stop hiding behind the country's  situation or the equally hypocritical phrase that "everyone is  free to do with his/her body what he/she wishes," as if both  things pardoned the vanity, selfishness, ambition, and criminal  result of such an attitude.    It is a fact that the economic depression catalyzed the  phenomenon, but the "bad seed" already existed. Its origins lie  in the home which worships trash and needs great ostentation to  conceal the internal vacuum. How else is one to interpret the  fact that all the persons interviewed by JUVENTUD REBELDE have  decent homes, their families have a living income, some even  work and earn a good wage and yet, it is not enough!    In the face of all this, we still have to defend staunchly  one's enjoyment of the human body, the freedom to love, a  freedom that neither needs nor demands payment, one that thrives  without betrayal of the soul. In a country that freed itself  from it, why take on that shameful spectacle of Fifth Avenue and  other streets of Havana crowded with this new breed of  prostitutes?    It is not irrelevant to recall the tradition of the tribe of  Amazon women that once baffled a famous novelist: Living without  identity was the sanction imposed on the women who traded their  favors for crystal beads and fake feathers. They could not paint  themselves with the solar signs or colored stripes that were the  secular guarantee of dignity and beauty. Without a face to show,  without any personal traits with which to worship the gods, they  were no one. They had only their shame.</p>

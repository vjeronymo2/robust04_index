			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARTS;  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS 'OBSCENE' ART TESTS  </P> <P> The House approved legislation today restricting federal assistance for art  "considered obscene," a compromise that averted stricter prohibitions sought by  conservatives.  </P> <P> On a 381-41 vote, the lawmakers sent a spending bill containing the language to  the Senate, which is considered likely to accept it.  </P> <P> The art provision, worked out by House-Senate negotiators last week, represents  a dilution of a measure sought by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) forbidding the  government to finance artwork that is obscene or indecent or that offends any  religion, race, ethnic group, age group or handicapped group.  </P> <P> Instead, it establishes a two-part test for support by the National Endowment  for the Arts.  </P> <P> The government would be prohibited from providing money to exhibitions "that  may be considered obscene," such as works depicting sadomasochism,  homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in  sex acts. In addition, the work would have to lack "serious literary, artistic,  political or scientific value."  </P> <P> Both decisions would be left up to NEA officials. The language would be in  effect for one year, during which a commission would study how the NEA makes  grants and whether permanent standards for the art it supports are needed.  </P></p>

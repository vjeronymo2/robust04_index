			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.Cz., M.U., and J.B.L.: "Pawlak-Rosati Meeting </F> on Saturday"]    [Text] On Saturday [12 March], Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak will meet with Dariusz Rosati, candidate of the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] for the post of deputy prime  minister and finance minister. Only after this meeting will he  make a final decision concerning his appointment. Upon his  return from India, President Lech Walesa said at the airport  that he had not been consulted concerning Rosati's candidacy and  that he does not know him. The SLD insists upon appointing  Rosati as quickly as possible; the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]  has not submitted any objections and has left the decision to  the prime minister.    Yesterday's meeting of the coalition leadership at the  Parkowa Hotel lasted only two hours. Jerzy Szmajdzinski,  general secretary of the Social Democracy of the Polish  Republic, did not conceal after the meeting that the SLD would  like Dariusz Rosati to be appointed to the post of deputy prime  minister and finance minister as soon as possible. "The prime  minister is, by his nature, a tight-lipped man, and he is not  willing to express his opinions," replied Szmajdzinski, when  asked about the prime minister's opinion on the candidacy of  Rosati. The prime minister has put off making a final decision  until after his meeting with the candidate, for which "he  reserved a lot of time." Dariusz Rosati told us on the night of  8 March that he has an appointment to hold such a long meeting  with the prime minister on Saturday and that he has so far only  spoken with him twice on the phone.    Also discussed at the evening meeting was the announcement  by  National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk that he will  submit an objection in the Constitutional Tribunal to the  provisions of the Budget Law, which obliges the Ministry of  National Defense to purchase equipment from Polish factories,  including Mielec.    We hope, Szmajdzinski said on behalf of the SLD, that  Minister Kolodziejczyk will be able to fully present his stance  in the Senate. We get the impression that it is not all that  clear. The Senate should hold a satisfactory discussion of the  budget. In the Senate, Kolodziejczyk is supposed to take the  floor on behalf of the government, not the ministry.    It was agreed that, after the government forwards the law on  ratification of the Concordat to the Sejm, it will be necessary  for parliamentary clubs to discuss the procedures, pace, and  time of the first reading of this law.    The coalition members declared on behalf of the government  that they are ready to conduct talks with Solidarity and reach  compromises.    The PSL deputies are "quietly waiting for new developments,"  said Franciszek J. Stefaniuk, deputy chairman of the club,  before the meeting at Parkowa street. The PSL has not submitted  any objections to the candidacy of Rosati and left the final  decision to the prime minister. Rosati's statement that he  would continue the policy pursued by Borowski disturbs the  peasants. "Why, we will not question the budget that we have  ourselves passed," he says. "Rosati declares an honest  privatization policy, which is exactly what we want."    "I do not know him personally; however, from publications  and  opinions of the milieu, I know that he was critical of the  Balcerowicz plan, which draws us closer to him. One can count  on good cooperation with him," said Sejm Deputy Waldemar Michna  (member of the Budget Committee).</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FCC WOULD LET SOME CITIES REGULATE BASIC CABLE TV;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: THE AGENCY'S PROPOSALS ARE IN RESPONSE TO A RISING TIDE OF  COMPLAINTS ABOUT PRICE HIKES.  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed new rules that could  return to some cities the right to regulate basic cable television rates.  </P> <P> Under existing rules, only about 3% of the nation's 9,500-plus cable TV systems  are under price restraints, and there have been rising complaints that cable  systems raise prices willy-nilly and get away with poor service.  </P> <P> The proposed new rules, adopted on a 5-0 vote, would make it tougher for cable  systems to avoid price regulation, while at the same time avoiding what FCC  officials view as heavy-handed controls.  </P> <P> The proposal says local communities may regulate a cable system's "basic tier"  of services, which includes network broadcast stations, unless one of the three  following conditions exist:  </P> <P> * There are six or more unduplicated over-the-air channels available and the  cable system is subscribed to by less than 50% of the TV homes in a community.  </P> <P> * There are other multichannel service providers in the community, such as  microwave cable or direct broadcast satellites, that are available to 50% of  the homes with cable and are actually being subscribed to by 10% of those  homes.  </P> <P> * The cable system offers a minimum level of service and programs at a  reasonable price that is comparable to communities in which there is effective  competition. This so-called good actor clause is favored by a number of FCC  commissioners.  </P> <P> FCC officials would not speculate on how many cable systems could avoid rate  re-regulation under the new proposals.  </P> <P> The proposals could affect parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties where cable  penetration is above the 50% level.  </P> <P> Following a period of public comment, the commission will adopt final rules  sometime next year.  </P></p>

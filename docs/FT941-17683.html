			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: A change of channel for Flextech - Oil services company agrees merger with US cable TV group Mr Roger Luard, managing director of Flextech, which yesterday announced agreement to merge with the European programme interests of TCI, the US cable television giant, is the first to admit that he is no media mogul. When the substantive talks were over with Mr Fred Vierra, executive vice president of TCI - itself in the midst of a multi-billion dollar merger deal with Bell Atlantic, the US telephone company - Mr Vierra hopped on a corporate jet to return to Denver. Mr Luard, a 45-year former Price Waterhouse accountant, jumped on the train to Gloucestershire and treated himself to a burger on the way home. The Flextech managing director will have under his wing stakes in cable and satellite channels as diverse as Bravo, the old movies channel, Children's Channel, UK Gold - the channel based on the programme libraries of the BBC and Thames Television - and UK Living. Yet four years ago Flextech was an oil services company and Mr Luard had no experience in the media at all. 'Business is business. What is this mystique about the media? You control costs and you control margins,' says Mr Luard, who began a deal-making career in 1980 with the Pounds 52,000 purchase of a Somerset textile company. The deal was a good one, and unused land was sold for Pounds 800,000 and Mr Luard moved on to other deals - some more successful than others - buying boiler and engineering companies before, in 1986, being asked to look at Flextech, an oil investment company whose assets included Expro, a loss-making oil services company. Mr Luard said yesterday that over three years a Pounds 2m a year Expro loss was turned into a profit of more than Pounds 6m. 'We had always flagged that we wanted to move into something else. We did not want to be a hostage to the price of oil.' The something else turned out to be the media, which Mr Luard says 'has to be a great business' because he believes there is no reason why the UK should be any different from the US and other parts of the US in embracing multi-channel choice. Flextech's existing media interests include a 24 per cent stake in Hit Entertainment, a successful distributor of children's and nature programming, 50.1 per cent of The Children's Channel, 39 per cent of The Family Channel and a stake in IVS, a company which owns five cable television franchises in the UK covering 265,000 homes. Under the new deal, Flextech will acquire all the European programme assets of United Artists European Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCI. The assets are made up of 100 per cent of Bravo, an additional 24.6 per cent of The Children's Channel, 25 per cent of UK Gold, 31.3 per cent of UK Living, and Pounds 44m nominal value loan stock associated with the stakes. There is also a 100 per cent stake in United Artists Entertainment Programming, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAEH. UAEP manages Discovery, the factual channel, The Learning Channel, The Parliamentary Channel and Wire TV, a service exclusive to cable which mixes soaps, games shows, sport and live studio discussions. The subsidiary is also responsible for the sales and marketing of The Country Music Channel. The Flextech deal will not result in management changes at UAEP and Ms Joyce Taylor, chief executive, and Mr Mark Luiz, chief financial officer, will form the senior management team of Flextech as chief executive of programmming and chief financial officer. In return, TCI takes a 60.4 per cent stake in Flextech - 62.2 per cent if all financing options are exercised. The TCI stake in Flextech, an Unlisted Securities Market company is valued at just over Pounds 200m. In addition TCI will provide Pounds 12.5m in cash and a Pounds 10m loan in working capital. There are also agreements on a further Pounds 14m in shares and unsecured loan stock. 'It's a very good deal for TCI and for Flextech,' said Mr Anthony Fry of NM Rothschild, which represented Flextech. For TCI the deal provides a more European vehicle for future programme expansion at a time when European ownership and content of cable and satellite channels is becoming an increasing political issue. It also offers a quick valuation for channels that are all still loss-making. Shareholders, upon whose approval the deal is conditional, were warned yesterday that the performance of the company was very dependent on the future development of cable and satellite. There would be no dividends at least until 1995. TCI will have three members of the eight-strong board. Mr Adam Singer, vice president international of TCI will become an executive director. Mr Vierra and Mr Stephen Brett, senior vice president, will become non-executive directors. 'This is a most wonderful platform to do other things. It gives us enormous firepower,' said Mr Luard, who retains 600,000 Flextech share options at 92p. When the share price was suspended because of the deal it stood at 379p.</p>

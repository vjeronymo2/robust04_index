			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Pointers to an economic upturn Sir, I refer to Peter Marsh's article 'How To Figure Out The End of Recession' (Management, May 18). If one accepts the thesis that it is small business which generates underlying growth in the economy and creates employment, then statistics on new business start-ups and liquidations/insolvencies will provide a valuable indicator. There are many sources of this information and I would like to highlight one set of figures which may be of interest, new company formations. Limited companies are predominantly private rather than public and small rather than large. New company formations may therefore provide a useful indicator of start-up activity. Year on year growth in new company formations was the norm until the year ended March 1989. Over the most recent three years numbers have progressively fallen and we are yet to see an upturn. When and if an upturn occurs, maybe this will be an important indicator that the UK is moving out of recession. M Whitwell, chief executive, Jordan and Sons, 21 St Thomas Street, Bristol BS1 6JS</p>

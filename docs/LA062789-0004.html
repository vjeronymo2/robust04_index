			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-UGLY SILVER STRAND TAKES ON RICH LUSTER OF PLATINUM  </P> <P> Development in the Silver Strand area just west of Marina del Rey is less than  10 years old, but already the neighborhood may have outlived its name.  </P> <P> "It's a misnomer," said Mary Legg, a real estate broker and a pioneer in the  development of the Strand. "They should have called it the Platinum Strand."  </P> <P> In less than a decade, the Strand -- a sliver of land two blocks wide and 10  blocks long wedged between Venice and Marina del Rey -- has been quietly  transformed from an ugly, scarred and pitted oil field into an architecturally  eclectic mix of multilevel, million-dollar single-family homes.  </P> <P> "The area looks like a movie set," said Santa Monica architect Marshall Lewis,  who has designed five houses on the Silver Strand.  </P> <P> Indeed, the combination of big houses of many styles crammed together on small  lots gives the area a slightly unreal, movie-backdrop appearance. The  impression is enhanced by the serene Ballona Lagoon -- home to a surprising  variety of shore birds -- which many of the homes face.  </P> <P> Homes in the interior of the Strand are separated by landscaped malls. One of  the remaining footbridges built by Abbot Kinney, the father of Venice, crosses  the waterway to connect the Strand with the Venice community and beach.  </P> <P> Despite the traffic and noise of adjacent Marina del Rey's restaurants and  crowded apartment complexes, the area remains a hideaway. Most days on the  Strand are free of either vehicular or pedestrian traffic.  </P> <P> It is that insulation, with proximity to urban Los Angeles, that has made the  area attractive to working professionals.  </P> <P> Randy Epstein, a Strand homeowner and a broker with Darrell Lee &amp;  Associates in Marina del Rey, said the Strand could become even more desirable  than Malibu for working professionals because it offers a waterfront location  and is closer to downtown Los Angeles, to freeways and to Los Angeles  International Airport.  </P> <P> "This is the last area other than Malibu in which you can have a large  single-family home and still walk to the beach," he said. "Yet it's closer to  everything."  </P> <P> The demand for housing has led to skyrocketing prices for land and homes.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, the 35-by-90-foot lots were worth about $20,000, but today  those lots are valued closer to $500,000.  </P> <P> Real estate broker Darrell Lee, who has sold 50 to 60 lots since 1981, said the  amount of appreciation has surprised him.  </P> <P> "My personal forecast was that lots would only go up to $250,000," he said.  "Now I wish I had kept some (land)."  </P> <P> Homes, many featuring atriums and rooftop decks, start at $1 million. Epstein  said 3,000- to 5,000-square-foot homes have been appreciating by about $200,000  to $250,000 a year in the last three years.  </P> <P> "I predict that by next year we could be hitting the $2-million mark for  homes," Epstein said.  </P> <P> Although development started in the early 1980s, the Silver Strand got its name  and was subdivided in 1906 by Kinney, who built the Venice canals, which feed  into the Ballona Lagoon. But it remained a subdivision on paper, and  development became even less of a priority when oil was discovered in the area  in 1930. For nearly 40 years, the Strand was a forest of oil pumps and wells.  </P> <P> By the late 1960s, dwindling oil field production combined with development of  Marina del Rey in the adjacent county-owned wetlands revived interest in the  Silver Strand. Because Los Angeles County retained ownership of all the land in  Marina del Rey, developers with long-term leases concentrated on building a  rentals-only community there.  </P> <P> But the Strand was located in the city of Los Angeles and privately owned,  allowing for the development of single-family homes.  </P> <P> In 1972, voters created the state Coastal Commission to oversee development  near the beach. Heightened awareness about the environment meant a growing  resistance to development.  </P> <P> "It was never about the environment," Legg said recently as she sat in a  trailer outside three homes she and her son, Dan, are building on Via Dolce.  "They thought they were trying to stop a bunch of rich people looking to build  an exclusive community near the beach. But we were just a bunch of regular  people who happened to own those lots."  </P> <P> After a five-year fight, building permits were issued. The city of Los Angeles,  however, said it would be several years before it could build streets, sewers  and lights for the area.  </P> <P> In 1979, about 150 property owners banded together to raise $4.5 million to  build the infrastructure themselves. The first homes were built in 1983.  </P> <P> Real estate brokers say the Silver Strand remains something of a secret because  it was developed by several individual property owners without any major  marketing.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Sir Richard sets his target - Bottom Line What a week for Sir Richard Sykes. On Tuesday the chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs company, went to Buckingham Palace to be invested as a knight of the realm. On Wednesday, he was named chairman of the company's executive committee, a privilege denied his predecessor, Ernest Mario. The executive committee runs the company on a day-to-day basis and has until now been controlled by Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo's chairman since 1985. And on Thursday, Sir Richard announced six-month results better than any City analyst had forecast. Glaxo broke the Pounds 1bn pre-tax profits barrier for the first time for a half-year, raised the dividend by 29 per cent to 9p and saw the shares gain 22p on the day. Sir Richard took it in his stride. His slight physique belies his evident stamina. He presents a determined, enthusiastic and approachable personality, and has kept his Yorkshire accent. The company he runs, on the other hand, is an almost frightening combination of size and power. It is the second biggest in the UK by market capitalisation. It makes the world's biggest selling drug, Zantac, an ulcer treatment, which saw six-month sales grow by 5 per cent to more than Pounds 1.2bn. Coming up behind Zantac are two of the most promising drugs in any company's portfolio. Imigran is a migraine treatment that does not have any competitors. First-half sales grew from Pounds 35m a year ago to Pounds 113m. Zofran is used to control nausea in cancer patients and those who have just had an operation. Six-month sales grew 17 per cent to Pounds 207m, and work continues on new applications for the drug such as in Alzheimer's disease. The bottom line is that it took less than four years for Glaxo to move from making Pounds 1bn pre-tax profit in a year to Pounds 1bn in six months. If product strength is anything to go by, there is little to stop that growth continuing. And yet the shares have not been popular for many months. In parallel with the rest of the pharmaceuticals sector, investors have been selling and the price has underperformed the market dramatically. As a result, what was once the darling of the capital growth investor has become a buy on the basis of its 4 per cent-plus yield. What the capital growth investors fear is that one day the gravy train will hit the buffers of international healthcare reforms. The signs are there. Behind the spectacular headline figures, some markets are in trouble. Zantac sales in Germany fell by 21 per cent as healthcare reforms cut doctors' prescribing powers. Sales in Italy (state contributions to the cost of drugs are being reformed) fell by 6 per cent. And in the UK, sales fell 9 per cent, partly because the UK government last year cut drug prices by an average of 2.5 per cent. Sir Richard says the sales falls are just hiccups, not symptoms of a creeping disease. The German and Italian markets are already beginning to 'turn around', he says, and the upward slope in sales and profits will reappear, although perhaps not as steep as it used to be. He may be right on Europe. But it is likely that healthcare reform in the US will provide the key to the company's fortunes. Glaxo does 47 per cent of its business in North America, up from 42 per cent a year ago. It is an increasing dependence that comes as healthcare costs are under scrutiny by the Clinton administration. Changes already under way include a switch to 'managed health care', in which providers of healthcare agree to look after the ailments of a group of people in return for a fee. The key to winning in this market may be to create alliances that can offer a broad range of medical services. Last year, Merck, the biggest US drugs company, set the pace by buying Medco, one of its biggest customers. Glaxo knows it must respond by creating a 'matrix' of alliances. This could include other drugs companies and distributors. Sir Richard wants to build his matrix by the end of the year. He may have another triumphant week next year, if he meets that target.</p>

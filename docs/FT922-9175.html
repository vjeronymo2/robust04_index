			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Russia assures survival of Moscow Narodny Bank RUSSIA has guaranteed the survival and long-term prospects of Moscow Narodny Bank by injecting more than Pounds 300m of new capital into the London-based trade and project finance bank. Although Russia is suffering from a shortage of hard currency, it has used almost Pounds 310m of sterling and dollars to buy new preference shares in Moscow Narodny, which was the main overseas commercial banking arm of the former Soviet Union. As a result, Moscow Narodny's issued share capital is now more than Pounds 500m, compared with its loans and other assets totalling Pounds 1.1bn at the end of 1991. It made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 121m, compared with a Pounds 5.8m profit the previous year, mainly because it was forced to make a provision of Pounds 131m to cover possible losses on loans. Most of these provisions related to Pounds 500m of Russian loans. The bank said profit before provisions was almost unchanged at Pounds 10.7m. Last summer, Moscow Narodny's depositors began rapidly withdrawing funds as they were losing confidence in the bank because of its exposure to the disintegrating Soviet Union. Since then, Moscow Narodny has been trying to reassure the financial community it has a long-term future, said Mr Andrei Rozhdov, an assistant director. The bank, supported by the Bank of Eng-land, persuaded Russia to convert much of its deposits with the London bank into new capital. With the break-up of the Soviet Union into the Commonwealth of Independent States, ownership of Moscow Narodny changed. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation is now controlling shareholder, replacing the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs. Mr Bill Newman, assistant general manager, said profits in the current year were likely to be hit again by big provisions against Russian loans. But he was cautiously optimistic about the long term, saying deposits were returning to the bank. In future, Moscow Narodny will concentrate on five main areas: trading in debt of the former Eastern bloc countries; bullion trading; counter trade, or the process of receiving payment for exports to Russia in the form of commodities and goods; trade finance; arranging finance for construction projects.</p>

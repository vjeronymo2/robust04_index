			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOBLER OR NOT, 'REDUCED' BARD TO PLAY IN O.C.  </P> <P> To most people, doing a 40-second version of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" would be  like traveling to New York by tricycle or bathing in a sink: You might be able  to do it, but it wouldn't make much sense.  </P> <P> After all, Shakespeare is subtlety, breadth, lyrical complexity, musical  language -- and a lot of words. Chopping his classics to thimble size through  hatchet editing and stage mischief is just not done -- at least not in polite  society.  </P> <P> The Reduced Shakespeare Company, which brings "The Complete Works of  Shakespeare (Abridged)" to the Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton tonight, never  said it was polite. Nor that everything it does makes perfect sense.  </P> <P> But it does claim to be funny.  </P> <P> "Everyone is just supposed to have a really good time -- that's what this is  all about," said Daniel Singer, one of the Los Angeles-based troupe's three  members. "We have respect for Shakespeare. In fact, we all started out doing  him seriously, (but now) we're into the comic possibilities. And, you know,  there are plenty."  </P> <P> RSC finds them by starting with one inarguable point, at least to its way of  thinking: for all the Bard's intensity and depth, he can be a real bore. From  there, it is lampoon time as they mix goofy cut-and-paste editing (often  running several plays together) with very physical comedy.  </P> <P> Adam Long (the pretty one) plays all of Shakespeare's heroines under a  startling floor-mop wig. Singer and Jess Borgeson take on the hero roles. They  all move around quite a bit, and they sometimes abuse people in the front row.  Sometimes they even make them come up on stage.  </P> <P> "The Two Noble Kinsmen" has become "The Chernobyl Kinsmen." Tragedies get  introductions such as this one for "Macbeth": "Never was there a story of more  blood and death/Than this one of Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth." The histories are  condensed into a football game.  </P> <P> "This is like what you hated most in school about Shakespeare; we parody it all  over the place," Singer said. "We take stuff from the Marx Brothers movies,  even Bugs Bunny cartoons. This is acrobatic Shakespeare."  </P> <P> RSC, in one form or another, has been at it since 1981, when Long, Singer and  Borgeson brought their act to Renaissance faires, first in Northern California  and then in the Los Angeles area. Back then, they did a 30-minute "Hamlet" that  was pretty successful with audiences. Later, they were asked to do a half-hour  "Romeo and Juliet" at a wedding reception.  </P> <P> "We told them that if they wanted to give us the money, sure, we'd do that,"  Singer recalled. "We kept doing the 'Hamlet,' but that started to get boring,  (and we began to change our minds) about the 30-minute format."  </P> <P> It wasn't until RSC booked itself into Scotland's Edinburgh Fringe Festival in  1987 that it finally came up with the current show's organization. "The  Complete Works" was a hit, both with crowds and many of the critics, who may  have come as skeptics but were apparently impressed by the company's verve.  </P> <P> Wrote one festival reviewer: "With the energy of acrobats and the spontaneity  of talented comedians, their riotously funny interpretation of our greatest  poet will be one reason for getting out of bed early."  </P> <P> Singer acknowledges that not all critics or scholars have been pleased --  "Sure, some have gone away shaking their heads" -- but he believes most  appreciate what the company is doing because at the heart of the parodies is a  genuine admiration for Shakespeare.  </P> <P> "We've loved his plays for a long time, and that shows. The more people know  about Shakespeare, the more they tend to like us. We have lots of (references  and inside jokes) for them. We performed for MENSA (the club exclusively for  high-IQers), and they were falling out of their chairs.  </P> <P> "But we also know that Shakespeare, like all good writers, had good moments and  bad moments. I don't think the comedies are very funny -- the tragedies are  funnier -- and the histories can get really boring; they just weren't as  inspired from a dramatic point of view. You find humor in that."  </P> <P> Since Edinburgh, the company has played at the Los Angeles Fringe and at  several Los Angeles-area theaters, usually to praise. The members don't have  many illusions about making it big, however.  </P> <P> As part of the New Vaudeville, a movement that includes the likes of the Flying  Karamazov Brothers, Bill Irwin and Penn and Teller, they realize their  audiences may be dedicated, knowledgeable and adventurous, but also that they  tend to be relatively small.  </P> <P> As Long put it in a 1987 interview: "When you eat fire or play spoons, you're  probably never going to become a household word. You do it for the love of it."  </P> <P>  The Reduced Shakespeare Company performs tonight at 8 p.m. at Plummer  Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. Tickets: $7.50 to $12.50.  Information: (714) 773-3371.  </P> <P> </P></p>

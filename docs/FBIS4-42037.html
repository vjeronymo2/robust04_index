			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Tushynski, Belarusian first </F> deputy defense minister, by Irina Kovaleva; place and date not  given: "A Weapon Even in Africa Is Still a Weapon"]    [Text] Belarus' profits from the sale of military  equipment and weapons amounted to $20 million last year.  Payments for Russian energy sources consumed 30 percent of  those revenues. A SEM DNEY correspondent has interviewed  Alyaksandr Tushynski, first deputy defense minister of Belarus.    [Tushynski] First of all, I must make it clear that the  Defense Ministry does not deal with the arms trade. According  to the government's resolution, only three firms are allowed to  conduct this kind of business. They look for partners and  coordinate prices. Then, they submit a contract to our  ministry, and if the products are included on an appropriate  list, the Defense Ministry gives the go-ahead for the sale. Our  responsibility is to prepare the equipment for sale.    Anticipating your question, I will tell about the moral  aspect of the arms trade. Many states do that. We are used to  emulating the United States. So, the United States is currently  holding the lead in the world's arms trade. Russia's defense  industry has practically been dislodged from the former USSR's  markets. Over the last five years, its exports have decreased  five-fold, and they now amount to only $2 billion.    [Kovaleva] Apparently, the Army is experiencing hard times,  if servicemen have had to get involved in trade.    [Tushynski] Exactly. Only 50 percent of money, which is  essential to maintain the Army, was allotted for this year. Out  of this sum, one must allocate funds necessary to dismantle  conventional weapons in accordance with our international  commitments. We plan to raise the remaining funds through  commercial activities. Why should the Army keep its surplus  weapons? We must sell them in time. No one will buy them in  five years, and they will have to be scrapped. If we stopped  trading, what would happen with the staff of the Test Range  Equipment Plant, whose production is sold in Russia? There are  many other enterprises that only profit from the sale of  military equipment and weapons.    [Kovaleva] The Defense Ministry is suspected of selling  weapons to "hot spots." Are these suspicions substantiated?    [Tushynski] I can certainly state that we deliver weapons  only to countries which are not embargoed. You probably have in  mind Alyaksandr Lukashenka's statement indicating that we have  sold weapons to Croatia. This statement is groundless. All  decisions concerning deliveries of weapons are made collectively  at the governmental level, and they are coordinated with the  Foreign Ministry, which has a list of states to which arms  deliveries are allowed. There is a system of strict control,  providing responsibility of all -- the KGB, the Interior  Ministry, the Customs Committee, and the Defense Ministry.  Moreover, an inspection conducted by competent bodies has  revealed that all contracts were legal, and that they include  certificates listing the final users. Still, if the military  equipment has ultimately been resold, this weighs on the buyer's  conscience.    [Kovaleva] Russia is unable to conquer foreign markets. Can  Belarus do that?    [Tushynski] Many of our enterprises are already exporting  their products. This is excellent equipment, and therefore,  there is a huge demand for it. However, we must compete for  markets. I will provide an example. Russia announced that it  would deliver rocket technology and equipment to India. The  United States did not wait: Sanctions were imposed on India,  and the contract was not concluded.    [Kovaleva] What does Belarus sell, and for what products is  there the greatest demand?    [Tushynski] To Russia, we sell products from the Test Range  Equipment Plant, to Africa, South America, and other regions --  optical equipment produced by the BelOMO company, night vision  equipment from Rogachev, tractors from Minsk... We plan to  expand our markets. After all, during the Soviet Union, 360  people worked in the trade mission in India alone, moreover, two  thirds of them dealt with arms deliveries.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Purchasing managers warn on effect of supply bottlenecks The manufacturing sector continued to expand last month, but the rapid growth may be creating supply bottlenecks and pushing up prices in some sectors, a business survey suggested yesterday. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's survey of purchasing managers showed the price index rose to a seasonally adjusted 73.7 per cent last month, up from 73.2 per cent in July. The institute said this was the highest level since the index started in 1991, indicating that more manufacturers were reporting price increases. Purchasing managers in the plastics, paper and steel sectors had seen significant price rises, with more than two-thirds of respondents in the chemical, rubber and plastics industries reporting increased costs, it said. Although rising commodity prices accounted for part of this surge, growing demand was also pushing up prices. In another trend that may point to capacity constraints in some sectors, suppliers' delivery times were also growing. The suppliers' deliveries time index fell to 36.6 per cent last month, the lowest rate in its three-year history. Meanwhile, the overall index, compiled from the separate figures on output, orders, purchases, delivery times, stocks and employment, fell to 59.6 per cent in August compared with 62.0 per cent in July. Any reading above 50 per cent indicates an increase in activity compared to the previous month so manufacturing activity was continuing to expand last month in spite of the slight slowing, the institute said. Mr Peter Thomson, the institute's director-general, said: 'This strong recovery presents a great opportunity for UK manufacturers. However, they urgently need to increase capacity and shorten delivery times to customers if they are to take full advantage of the growing demand.' Concerns about the price increases were yesterday echoed by City analysts, who warned that it might add to pressure on the chancellor to raise base rates. Mr Robert Barrie of brokers BZW said: 'The message from this survey, and recent surveys from the Confederation of British Industry, is that capacity pressures in manufacturing are growing.'</p>

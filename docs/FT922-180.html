			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / People: From Drambuie to sweaters Peter Shakeshaft, who left the privately-owned Drambuie company in February after an unexpectedly brief stay, has resurfaced. He has bought Bryant of Scotland, a small high quality knitwear company, from the receivers Ernst &amp; Young, and plans to develop it. Shakeshaft, 44, a Glaswegian, was a director and divisional chief executive with John Waddington before joining Drambuie in Edinburgh in late 1990. But after making one acquisition with a view to diversification, little was heard of him until news leaked out of his resignation, apparently because he found Drambuie resistant to change. Bryant employs 131 people and exports 90 per cent of its output. It went into receivership in April 18 months after a management buyout from Laura Ashley. ***** The Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland, the professional association whose senior members run the top Scottish life insurance companies, has elected an academic as its head for the first time in its 136-year history. John McCutcheon, professor of Department of Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, has been a fellow of the Faculty since 1965. McCutcheon graduated from St John's College, Cambridge, after reading mathematics and received a DPhil from the University of Liverpool for his early research in mathematics. McCutcheon points out that the work of actuaries is not limited to the insurance and pensions industries; in the First World War they helped calculate the likely position of German mines in the path of an assault. ***** Mark Kettle has been appointed a director of LLOYD THOMPSON Ltd. ***** Gerhard Kurz, president of Mobil Shipping and Transportation, has been elected chairman of the executive committee of the OIL COMPANIES INTERNATIONAL MARINE FORUM. ***** David Hughff has been appointed a director of SMITH &amp; PINCHING.</p>

A sentence has been added to 10 CFR 12.307 requiring the initial decision to be issued within 90 days after completion of proceedings on the application, but permitting the adjudicative officer to extend the time limit after notice to the parties of the reason for the delay. Authority is provided for the adjudicative officer to extend the time period in order to prevent the interruption of cases presenting pressing health and safety concerns. The NRC expects that extensions will be issued sparingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ACUS stated that if the NRC believes that a request for administrative review should be a prerequisite to judicial review, it should recast 10 CFR 12.308 (Agency review) in light of the Supreme Court's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Darby  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cisneros, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 113 S.Ct. 2539 (June 21, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within the last year, the Supreme Court cast new light on the requirements for exhaustion of administrative remedies before appealing an agency decision to the courts. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Darby  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cisneros <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Court held that an agency cannot insist on exhaustion of intra-agency appeals prior to judicial review unless the agency promulgates rules that require intra-agency appeals and stay the effect of agency decisions during such appeals. The Commission believes that for purposes of judicial and administrative economy a request for administrative review should be a prerequisite to judicial review, particularly because the NRC frequently entertains proceedings that encompass highly technical matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cross-reference in 10 CFR 12.308 to the review procedures set out in 10 CFR 2.786 should be sufficient to satisfy the commenter that the NRC has addressed the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Darby <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case ruling in these regulations, because 10 CFR 2.786(b)(1) expressly provides that the filing of a petition for review is mandatory for a party to exhaust its administrative remedies. Nevertheless, it may be considered fairer notice to state the requirement in 10 CFR 12.308 itself. Therefore, the NRC has amended 10 CFR 12.308 to state unambiguously that an aggrieved party is required to seek Commission review of the adjudicative officer's initial decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application of the part of the Court's opinion on staying the effect of the initial decision seems inapposite in the context of an EAJA administrative proceeding, because it makes little sense to speak of a stay of an initial decision denying the application for award of attorney fees, which is the type of decision most likely to be appealed. A successful applicant for an award is not likely to appeal unless he or she is dissatisfied with the amount of the award. This poses a very different type of situation from that in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Darby <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case, where the Court had before it an agency decision debarring petitioners from participating in Federal programs. Nevertheless, in what is perhaps an excess of caution, we have included in NRC's EAJA rule a statement on staying the effect of the initial decision during an appeal to the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Proceedings Subject to the EAJA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NUMARC commented that the rule should be revised to make clear that the only proceedings subject to NRC's EAJA rule are those conducted pursuant to the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EAJA applies only to an agency adversary adjudication. 50 U.S.C. 504(a). The term ``adversary adjudication'' is defined by 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C) to mean an appeal of a decision made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before an agency board of contract appeals, a hearing conducted under 31 U.S.C. ch. 38 (PFCRA), and an adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 (the Administrative Procedure Act). Section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act expressly states that (with certain exceptions) it applies ``in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proceeding for the purpose of granting or renewing a license is expressly excluded from EAJA coverage by 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(C). However, there is no express exclusion of proceedings suspending, revoking, or amending a license, including that for a nuclear reactor. As indicated in the Supplementary Information for NRC's proposed EAJA rule, the question of such proceedings was at least addressed partially in 1983, when a materials license amendment proceeding was judicially held as not being required by statute to be conducted ``on the record.'' In that case, the court declined to read section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) as requiring an on-the-record hearing, in the absence of clear Congressional intent to trigger the formal on-the-record hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> West Chicago, Ill.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  701 F.2d 632 (1983). Since that time, the Commission has gone on record that it interprets section 189a of the AEA as not requiring formal hearings in reactor licensing proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> En Banc  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brief for Respondents dated August 30, 1991 (filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No. 89&hyph;1381,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nuclear Information and Resource Service <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  NRC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at pp 32&hyph;38).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the above, it is not unreasonable to conclude that no NRC proceeding other than an appeal to a board of contract appeals under the Contract Disputes Act or a Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act hearing is covered by the EAJA. Nevertheless, the Commission does not wish to frame its EAJA regulations in such a way as to preclude potential applicants for attorney fee awards from raising the issue of EAJA coverage, if they can make a good faith argument that the proceeding in which they have been involved falls under the EAJA. In addition, there is always the possibility of new enactments that could make the EAJA applicable to proceedings not previously entertained by the agency. Therefore, the Commission has decided not to state that the NRC's EAJA rule applies only to a proceeding under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the Commission has decided to amend 10 CFR 12.101, 12.102, and 12.103 to clarify its intent regarding the scope of coverage of the regulations. The amendment does not make express reference to any type of proceedings other than appeals under the Contract Disputes Act and adjudications conducted pursuant to the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, but it contains a general provision that will encompass other types of proceedings that may fall within the parameters of the EAJA. This leaves room for case-by-case determinations on applicants' claims of coverage in areas that have not been addressed previously by statute, case law, or express Commission interpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Companies fail to follow accounting guideline LARGE COMPANIES are continuing to use extraordinary items in their accounts in spite of recent efforts by the Accounting Standards Board to reduce their use. Extraordinary items, which measure profits or losses outside normal trading activity, are likely to be all but outlawed under a draft financial reporting standard due to be introduced later this year. The February report from Company Reporting, a monthly monitoring service of company accounts based in Edinburgh, shows that at least four large British companies have used substantial extraordinary items in their most recent annual reports and accounts. A statement issued by the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in October warned that all the restructuring and reorganisation costs of a business should be treated as exceptional items - which are included in the calculation of earnings - from November 23 1991, unless they stemmed from an extraordinary event. All the accounts identified in Company Reporting are for 1991 financial years ending before the new pronouncement came into force, but may have to be restated in the next set of accounts. Trafalgar House, the construction and shipping conglomerate, wrote off Pounds 26.5m as an extraordinary item against Brel, the privatised train maker, which is an associated company. Associated British Foods, the milling and baking group, reclassified its 22 per cent stake in Berisford International as a current asset and wrote down its value as a Pounds 100m extraordinary item. Burton, the retailer, made an extraordinary charge of Pounds 155m, reflecting its withdrawal from property development, on top of a similar Pounds 169m charge in the previous year. Raglan Property Trust, the development and investment company, counted as extraordinaries losses on a subsidiary placed in receivership and a provision against legal action against lenders to the subsidiary. Company Reporting also highlights two companies that have complied with the ASB's draft standards. Both BOC, the chemicals group, and Vaux, the hotels and brewing group, counted business disposals as exceptional items. The definition of extraordinary items is still under intense debate and is likely to cause the ASB some difficulty as it tries to impose and police the new standard. An official for Associated British Foods said last night: 'We think our treatment would be correct under the new and the old rules. We are whiter than white when it comes to extraordinary and exceptional items.'</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> AFTER THREE YEARS, THE STATE LIFTS ITS RESTRICTIONS ON MONARCH BANK  </P> <P> Monarch Bank is out from under regulatory restrictions for the first time in  three years.  </P> <P> The California Department of State Banking recently lifted its order requiring  the bank to raise more capital and to correct lending and management problems.  In March, federal regulators lifted a similar order.  </P> <P> Removal of the restrictions is "a significant step in our recovery," said E.  Lynn Caswell, the bank's chairman, president and chief executive.  </P> <P> A stock offering last year raised $1.7 million in new capital for the bank,  enough to bring it above federal requirements. It also has been profitable  every month for more than a year, Caswell said.  </P> <P> The bank posted $3.2 million in losses for 1986 and 1987. Last year, it  produced a modest $26,000 profit, and it earned $46,000 in the first six months  of this year. Meantime, assets shrunk from $88.1 million at the end of 1984 to  $52.1 million at the end of last year.  </P> <P> The bank also has whittled down its bad loans. It has only $50,000 in  delinquent loans out of $40 million, compared to a high of $2 million in bad  loans out of about $44 million two years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Panetta's reputation for tight discipline pays off For Leon Panetta, President Bill Clinton's new chief of staff, lessons in money management began early. He is fond - critics might say too fond - of telling the story of how his father, who emigrated to the US from Calabria in the 1930s, 'beat the hell' out of his then 18-year-old son on discovering he had secretly acquired a credit card. His father, he says proudly, never had a credit card in his life. The lessons were well learned and Mr Panetta went on to build his political career on the kind of rigid financial discipline that has often brought him into conflict with his fellow Democrats. However, Mr Clinton's new right-hand man started his political life as a liberal Republican, mixing, then as now, his hard-nosed stance on fiscal matters with a softer line on social issues. That stance soon brought him into conflict with the Nixon White House, where he served as director of the Office of Civil Rights. Conflict over the pace at which President Nixon was moving on desegregation led to Mr Panetta being squeezed out of office in 1970, under the accusation of being too aggressive, and he quit the Republican party soon after. Elected to the House for a Californian seat in 1976, Mr Panetta quickly made budgetary matters his principal area of expertise, and was finally elected chairman of the House budget committee in 1989. During his time in Congress, he opposed the balanced budget amendment as a gimmick, but unlike many of his fellow Democrats he advocated constantly that any new spending programmes had to be financed either by tax rises or cuts elswhere. This earned him the reputation among party critics of being a budget chairman first and a Democrat second. His record as budget hawk, coupled with his outspoken criticism of Mr Clinton's economic programme during the 1992 presidential election campaign for being soft on the deficit, made his eventual nomination as head of the Office of Management and Budget all the more surprising. Mr Panetta's successor, former budget office deputy Ms Alice Rivlin, is as hawkish on budget matters - if not more so - than her old boss. Mr Panetta delivered handsomely for his president, pushing through, as Mr Clinton acknowledged yesterday, the first two budgets to be adopted on time for 17 years and 'three years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman'. Mr Panetta's record of dogged and successful management has contrasted sharply with the impression of disarray elsewhere in the Clinton White House. But his tenure at the budget office has not been all plain sailing. Mr Panetta stunned Washington and infuriated Mr Clinton in April last year by an extraordinarily frank interview in which he admitted that the president's legislative programme was in deep trouble in Congress. That was all forgotten yesterday as Mr Clinton hailed 'the budget director who began to slay the deficit dragon.'</p>

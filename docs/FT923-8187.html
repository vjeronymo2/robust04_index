The environmentalists, and their powerful allies in Congress, will urge the inclusion of a funding source to pay for clean-ups, worker retraining and border infrastructure. Mr John Adams, executive director of the US Natural Resources Defence Council, said yesterday that, although the pact contains 'some positive features', it lacks sufficient measures to protect the environment.

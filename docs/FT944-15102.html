			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Carrot and stick for Zil The US Trade and Development Agency yesterday offered Mr Alexander Vladislyavlev, the chairman of Zil, the Russian limousine maker, assistance with restructuring but warned that, until this took place, planned joint ventures between the Russian vehicle manufacturer and western companies were in jeopardy. Mr Vladislyavlev, accompanied by Zil shareholders, yesterday in Washington met representatives of US government agencies, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Overseas Development Agency, and the Fund for Large Enterprise Restructuring. Also present were representatives of two US companies - Caterpillar of Illinois and Seattle-based PACCAR - which have signed four joint venture deals signed with Zil. The TDA has offered to help Zil devise an overall restructuring plan, an effort which would take at least a year.</p>

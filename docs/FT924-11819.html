			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major defends shift on economy MR JOHN MAJOR justified the shift in emphasis in economic policy yesterday by warning that worsening conditions in Europe and beyond meant ministers had to put growth and job creation at the top of their policy agendas. In his first remarks to the Commons after the new stress on growth was announced on Tuesday, the prime minister said it was 'essential' those goals moved 'to the centre of thinking in each and every aspect of government policy'. 'It is our intention to pursue a strategy that will bring recovery, with it growth, with it jobs and with it prosperity,' he told MPs at question time. Mr Major also made clear that further cuts in interest rates would be pursued in conjunction with continued vigilance over inflation. 'When it is safe to make further reductions without imperilling our inflationary objectives, that certainly would be the Government's intention to do so,' he said. Mocked by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for being driven by events beyond his control into daily 'U-turns' in order to mollify his backbenchers, the prime minister insisted that economic conditions had 'darkened and become more difficult' across Europe. He stressed that the public-expenditure round was forcing the government to take tough decisions, but confirmed that the new emphasis for spending will be on job creation and capital projects. While public expenditure would be contained wherever possible, the prime minister said that 'particular care' would be given to schemes that had positive implicationsfor employment and growth. 'We shall certainly look more carefully at ensuring that we seek to get the private sector working more effectively to assist in capital projects.' Downing Street confirmed that the emphasis on a growth-led economic strategy had been discussed by the prime minister and the chancellor with Cabinet colleagues yesterday. More details would be disclosed at Mr Norman Lamont's Mansion House speech next week before a comprehensive policy framework is announced in the Autumn Statement on November 12. With the public-expenditure committee meeting on an almost daily basis, the final shape of next year's spending plans will probably go to Cabinet the week after next. Officials insist that the worsening international economic outlook would not allow any upward revision of the Pounds 244.5bn ceiling on spending, which remains sacrosanct.</p>

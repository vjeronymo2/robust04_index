			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW JUMPS 41.83 TO NEAR RECORD;  </P> <P> PROGRAM TRADES PUSH RALLY TO CLOSE AT 2,932  </P> <P> The stock market swept ahead to a 3 1/2-week high today, rebounding from  Tuesday's setback.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 23.27 points on  Tuesday, climbed 41.83 points to 2,932.67, its highest close since it stood at  a record 2,935.89 on June 15.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 969 up, 498 down and 517 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 162.22 million shares, against 147.63 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index gained 2.35 to 197.11.  </P> <P> The advance picked up momentum as the session progressed, propelled by  computer-program buying from professional traders engaged in multiple  strategies involving stock-index options and futures.  </P> <P> Analysts said stocks also seemed to benefit from a slight decline in  open-market interest rates.  </P> <P> Prices of long-term government bonds edged upward in the credit markets,  putting their yields in the 8.55%-8.60% range.  </P> <P> But perhaps the biggest plus, brokers said, was the market's steady showing of  late in the face of a succession of disappointments as companies begin to make  their earnings reports for the second quarter of the year.  </P> <P> Bond prices headed higher at midday today, reflecting the success of Tuesday's  auction of savings and loan bailout bonds by the Resolution Funding Corp.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year bond was up 1/2 point, or $5.00 per $1,000 face  amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, was down to 8.52% from 8.57%  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Prices of shorter-term issues also rose.  </P> <P> Bond prices had been falling since last Thursday, with traders concerned about  the market's ability to absorb new government securities up for auction and  slim prospects for lower interest rates.  </P> <P> But the market perked up today, analysts said, after Tuesday's auction, in  which Refcorp, the agency set up to help finance the thrift bailout, sold  $5-billion worth of 30-year bonds at an average yield of 8.93%.  </P> <P> Refcorp received bids totaling $15.5 billion, or more than $3 in bids for every  $1 in bonds sold. Demand was stronger than in two earlier sales of 40-year  bailout bonds.  </P> <P> "Obviously the Refcorp auction went well," said Carl Napolitano, market  strategist at R. C. Government Securities.  </P> <P> But traders were keeping their eyes on another new issue this afternoon -- the  sale of $8 billion in seven-year notes.  </P> <P> Analysts said the market will also take cues later this week from two economic  indicators due for release on Friday: June retail sales and the June producer  price index.  </P> <P> By midday in the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term  governments gained 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose by 5/32 point to  11/32 point and long-term issues rose as much as 1/2 point, according to  Telerate Inc.  </P></p>

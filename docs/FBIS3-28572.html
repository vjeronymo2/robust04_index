Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today notes the United  States recently deployed new-type F-16 fighter-bombers on a new  combat mission at U.S. military bases in Japan and is now  scheming to bring Patriot missiles and other sophisticated  military hardware into South Korea.    The analyst says:    The hardline conservatives are crying that "the United  States  cannot avoid a showdown with North Korea."    This is a grave military provocation against the DPRK and  shows that the U.S. policy of overpowering the DPRK with  strength remains unchanged.    The U.S. moves to beef up its forces in Japan are part of  the "strategy of forward deployment" aimed at hurling its huge  forces into the Korean peninsula without difficulties in "the  event of contingency".    On the other hand, the United States is planning to stage  the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises against the DPRK under  another name or in another place, if necessary, breaking its  promise to refrain from using nuclear weapons and any other  armed force and threatening the DPRK with them.    It is also intensifying ideological offensive in a bid to  disintegrate the DPRK from within. The U.S. plan to set up  "Radio Free Asia" is part of such moves. The United States  employs smiling diplomacy at the negotiating table, as if it  were interested in peace, and tries hard to isolate and stifle  its dialogue partner behind the scene. This is really the  height of duplicity and impudence.    The United States must know well of the opposite side.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Police probe firm censured by regulator POLICE are investigating the affairs of Lovell, a private client stockbroking firm based in Newcastle upon Tyne which dealt in securities and traded options, it was disclosed yesterday. The move follows an inquiry into the firm by the Securities and Futures Association which yesterday announced it was finally expelling Lovell from its membership on the grounds it was no longer fit and proper to carry out investment business. The inquiries by the Northumbria police fraud squad are focusing on the withdrawal of funds from the clients' bank account to buy a financial services company. Two directors of the firm, Mr Thomas Lovell, the chairman, and Mr John Hickey, the compliance and finance director, have already been severely reprimanded by the SFA over the withdrawals, which abused its Client Money Regulations. Earlier this month, the SFA reprimanded Mr Lovell and Mr Hickey, along with Mr Robert Foster-Moore, the traded options director, and Mr Richard Hexton, an options dealer, for dealing in traded option contracts for clients without having reasonable cause to believe the contracts were suitable. The SFA also found that Mr Hexton, Mr Hickey and Mr Foster-Moore had issued a misleading advertisement to induce prospective clients to invest. Lovell was wound up in the High Court in October 1990 after being suspended by The Securities Association for failing to meet capital adequacy requirements. Since then investors have been paid more than Pounds 650,000 from the Investors Compensation Scheme.</p>

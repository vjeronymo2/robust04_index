			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA PANEL BACKS DRUG FOR AIDS-RELATED PNEUMONIA  </P> <P> Final marketing approval for aerosol Pentamidine, a drug to prevent  AIDS-related pneumonia, was unanimously recommended Monday by a Food and Drug  Administration advisory committee.  </P> <P> FDA officials said the drug, made by Lyphomed Inc. of Melrose Park, Ill., could  gain final agency approval "in a matter of weeks."  </P> <P> The drug is already widely available to AIDS patients in this country under a  special FDA effort to cut through red tape when desperately ill or dying  patients are involved.  </P> <P> After reviewing research results and hearing two hours of testimony from the  public, the committee concluded that aerosol Pentamidine is safe and its  benefits outweigh its risks in the prevention of AIDS-related pneumonia.  </P> <P> Researchers who had evaluated the drug in a trial involving 408 patients in the  San Francisco area told the panel it reduced the risk fourfold when given once  a month in a 300-milligram dose, compared to a 30-milligram dose.  </P> <P> FDA staff reviewers said more study is needed to gauge the drug's long-term  side effects and benefits, but recommended approval nonetheless.  </P> <P> The same panel today will review the safety and effectiveness of another drug  for an AIDS-related infection. It will examine a drug called Ganciclovir, made  by Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto.  </P></p>

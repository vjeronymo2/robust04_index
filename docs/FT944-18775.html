			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Cookery: Comforts of autumn With all hope of an Indian summer now seemingly gone, this is the start of the season for comfort foods. Goodbye, lightweight snacks, and hello to meals you can sink your teeth into. Soon, we can expect the return of porridge to the breakfast table, with kedgeree as a weekend treat. Crumpets, toasted in front of the fire at tea-time, will follow along with a regular intake of steaming soups and good, old-fashioned stews. As the days get colder, there will be calls for even more substantial offerings - such as sticky-rich oxtail, served on a bed of butter beans; braised lamb shanks with split peas or little green lentils; beefsteak, kidney and oyster pudding; lemon and treacle sponge; Sussex pond pudding; and bed-time mugs of hot lemon and honey fortified with whisky or brandy. Such extreme remedies are not required just yet, though. While some things must be held in reserve for February, when winter's grip is at its iciest, mild soothers are all you need to maintain morale in these days of early autumn. POTATO PIE WITH GREEN HERBS (Serves 6) Potatoes and pastry sound too heavy by half, but this combination is more refined than it sounds: it satisfies but does not stuff you solid. Serve it tepid or, better still, just cold; indeed, it is recommended with cold roast game birds after cups of hot consomme at shooting picnics. Lemon-and-herb grilled chicken thighs and sauteed duck breasts are other meaty alternatives. Use the lovely old English potato called Pink Fir Apple if you can. Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb waxy potatoes such as Pink Fir Apple, La Ratte or Charlotte; 1-2 garlic cloves; a bunch of parsley (preferably flat leaf); a bunch of thyme; 12-14oz puff pastry (made weight); 1 egg yolk beaten;  1/4 pt double cream. Line a shallow 8-9in flan tin with just over half the pastry. Peel and slice the potatoes thinly and chop the garlic finely. Mix them together with plenty of pepper, some salt, 6 tablespoons chopped parsley and 1 1/2 -2 tablespoons fresh thyme. Pile the mixture into the tin. Cover with the remaining pastry, damp the edges, seal and trim. Knock up and scallop the sides and decorate the top. Beat the egg with the cream and glaze the pie with some of it. Make a steam hole in the centre of the pastry lid and insert a piece of rolled card to hold it open. Chill the pie for 20 minutes, then slide the tin on to a hot baking sheet and put it into an oven heated to 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6). Turn down the heat immediately to 375`F/190`C (gas mark 5) and bake for one hour until the pastry is puffed up and brown and the vegetables feel tender when pierced with a skewer. Pour the rest of the egg-and-cream mixture carefully into the pie. Discard the funnel of rolled card and bake for 10 minutes more. Cool the pie to tepid or let it become just cold before serving. APPLE AND ELDER PLATE PIE (Serves 6) On September 29, according to country lore, Lucifer spits on blackberries to spite his rival, St Michael the Archangel, whose feast falls on that date. Time to cook apples with hedgerow elderberries instead. These tiny, jet-black fruits hang their heads heavily like Victorian beads when fully ripe. The taste of them is dark and mysterious: slightly sharp and cloying, rich and pungent (a world apart from the Muscat subtlety of elderflower blossom) and excellent for Sunday lunch puddings such as this. Pick far more than you think you will need, as the fruit must be stripped from the stalk with a fork before weighing - and the stalks are surprisingly heavy. Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb cooking apples; 10oz elderberries (weighed after stripping them from the stalks); the juice of 1 lemon; shortcrust pastry or pate brise made with half a pound of flour; beaten egg to glaze;  1/4 lb caster sugar;  1/4 pint creamy-strained yoghurt or fromage frais or a mixture of the two. Peel and core the apples and put them into a bowl of water with the juice of the lemon to keep them white. Put the apple cores and peel into a saucepan with 5oz only of the elderberries, add 6-8 tablespoons water, cover tightly and simmer for 20 minutes, crushing the ingredients with a potato masher occasionally. Remove the lid and cook for about 5 minutes more to drive off some of the liquid - but take care not to burn dry. Tip the contents of the pan into a sieve placed over a bowl and press to extract all the flavoursome pulp and juices. Sweeten the puree with 1oz sugar. When cold, stir in the yoghurt and/or fromage frais gently, and refrigerate. Line a nine to 10in pie plate with half the pastry. Dry the apples, slice them and toss them with the remaining 3oz sugar and the rest (5oz) of the elderberries. Heap the fruit into the pie plate. Cover with a pastry lid. Seal, trim, decorate, glaze with beaten egg and make steam slits. Bake on a hot baking sheet at 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6) for 35-40 minutes. Serve hot with the well-chilled sauce.</p>

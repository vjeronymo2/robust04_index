Schmidt of the Russian Academy of Sciences; submitted 24 Oct  92; UDC 550.34.013.2]    [Abstract] Short-term precursors of earthquakes were  defined as variations in a geophysical field that satisfy three  primary conditions for the amplitude of the variation (it must  exceed a precursor threshold equal to two standard deviations of  the quantity in question during periods of seismic calm), the  time interval prior to a particular seismic event (hours and  days), and the distance from where the precursor was measured to  the epicenter of the earthquake (epsilon[.sup]M[/]  kilometers, where M equals magnitude). Each of these components  of the definition was elaborated individually. This definition  was then used as a basis for performing a statistical analysis  of a wide variety of short-term precursors recorded at a number  of observation stations over a large area around the epicenters  prior to the Tanshan*** and Haichen*** earthquakes in China. The  quantitative analysis of this data point to a definite  correlation between the short-term precursors of an earthquake  and the formation of its seismic focus. According to all the  data available for this particular study, the value for the  correlation between the time frame and amplitude of short-term  precursors, on the one hand, and the distance of these  precursors from an earthquake's epicenter and the magnitude of  that particular earthquake, on the other, lies between 0.57 and  0.84, with an average value of 0.70. It was concluded that the  statistical correlation between short-term anomalies in a  geophysical field and specific earthquake parameters indicate  that these anomalies are indeed precursors of actual earthquakes  and that they should be used to forecast the time frame within  which a particular seismic event is expected to occur.

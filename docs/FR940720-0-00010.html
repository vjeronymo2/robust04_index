			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the questions raised by B&amp;W, GA, and other fuel facilities regarding exemptions from fees and proper fee category classification, the NRC plans to reexamine the fuel facility subclass categorizations. Any restructuring that results from this reexamination will be included in the proposed FY 1995 fee rule for notice and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC adopts General Atomics' suggestion that the NRC consider a waiver of the FY 1994 annual fees if, within the 30-day period after the NRC acts on their exemption request, it notifies the NRC in writing, in accordance with 10 CFR 70.38, that it wishes to relinquish the portion of their license permitting fabrication of fuel elements or to obtain a POL. In order to be considered for the waiver of the FY 1994 annual fee, General Atomics must permanently cease fuel fabrication activities within the 30-day period after NRC acts on the exemption request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the argument that reclassifying the license is inconsistent with the NRC's stated underlying basis of ``charging a class of licensees for NRC costs attributable to that class of licensees'', costs for providing an identifiable service related to a specific application, license or approval are recovered under the fee regulations in 10 CFR Part 170. For generic and other regulatory costs not recovered under 10 CFR 170, the NRC, in compliance with the requirements of OBRA&hyph;90, has allocated these costs to major classes of licensees. The law permits, and the NRC has established, a schedule of annual charges in 10 CFR Part 171 that assesses different annual charges to different licensees or classes of licensees. To the extent practicable, and where necessary for a more fair and equitable allocation of costs, a major class of licensees is divided into subclasses. Within a class or subclass of licensees, the costs are uniformly allocated to each licensee in the class or subclass based on the premise that there is no significant difference in the generic and other regulatory services provided to each licensee within a class or subclass. This approach and principle are used for all classes of licensees (57 FR 32693; July 23, 1992). The Commission has carefully reviewed the costs allocated to the LEU fuel fabrication subclass and concluded that the budgeted costs have been properly assigned to those licensees within the subclass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters also objected to the increases in annual fees for Category 1.A.(1) (low-enriched fuel facilities) and Category 1.A.(2), (other materials licenses authorizing critical quantities of special nuclear material). Commenters indicated that the base fee for low-enriched fuel facilities has increased from about $700,000 in FY 1991 to $1.4 million in FY 1994, while Category 1.A.(2) increased from about $175,000 to $304,000 (including surcharge). These increases, commenters claimed, place an undue hardship on the profitable operation of these facilities and are grossly out of proportion to any warranted increase in the effort expended by the NRC in regulating these classes of licensees. One commenter stated that the NRC's practice of retroactively revising annual fees causes major corporate budgeting problems, especially when large increases between the originally invoiced quarterly payments and actual annual fees are the result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amount of the NRC's fees are based on the budget authority for a class of licensees and do not consider impact on a company's profitability. The NRC budgeted costs for this class of licensees have increased because the NRC budgeted and the Congress appropriated greater resources to regulate the safety and safeguards of fuel facilities. Under the 100 percent recovery statute of OBRA&hyph;90, charging this class of licensees fees that fail to recover the full budgeted amount, would mean that other licensees must pay additional fees which provide no benefit to them. NRC promulgates its final rules as early as it can subject to certain time-sensitive constraints: the NRC must receive a Congressionally approved budget, calculate the numerous fees in question, issue a proposed rule for comment, evaluate the comments, and issue a final fee rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, Allied-Signal (A&hyph;S), believed that the costs allocated to the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion subclass should be divided equally between two licensees rather than one, even though the second licensee has a possession only license (POL). A&hyph;S argued that the NRC has not provided a rational basis for exempting that licensee from the annual fee. A&hyph;S noted the NRC's policy that it is the existence of a license, not operations, that determines allocation of costs for recovery through the annual fee. A&hyph;S believes that a licensee that has a license to operate but does not do so is no different from a licensee that has operated, stops doing so, and holds a POL. A&hyph;S believes that, in each case, the NRC's regulations are equally applicable and the licensee benefits from them. A&hyph;S pointed out that it is the only entity in the U.S. engaging in UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion operations and although it has attempted to pass the cost of fees on to its customers, it has not been able to do so on a broad-scale basis. A&hyph;S claimed that the proposed fee would raise its costs by 6 cents per pound and that winning bids from Canadian and European UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  converters are decided by as little as 1 cent per pound of UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;S also argued that the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  conversion license should be removed from the fuel facility class of licensees and included in the uranium recovery class because the operations of the UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  converter are more similar to those of a uranium mill than to a fuel facility. Additionally, there is now only one UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  converter in the U.S. and a subcategory of one does not accurately reflect the relevant amount of NRC's resources devoted to the license and for that reason is inappropriate. Therefore, according to Allied-Signal, the annual fee is not fairly and equitably allocated as required by OBRA&hyph;90, and does not bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing regulatory services, also required by the statute. A&hyph;S, therefore, believes the resulting fee for UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  converters is disproportionately higher than that charged to licensees in the uranium recovery category and disproportionately close to what is assessed to operating reactors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has a long-standing policy of not assessing annual fees to those licensees who have indicated to the NRC that they wish to amend their license to permanently withdraw authority to operate and have been issued a possession only license (POL) (51 FR 33228; September 18, 1986). In FY 1991, the NRC reconsidered and reaffirmed its policy that licensees with POLs would not be subject to the annual fees when it initially established fees to recover 100 percent of its budget authority under OBRA&hyph;90 (56 FR 14873; April 12, 1991). Recently, the Commission revisited this issue as part of its fee policy review required by EPA&hyph;92, and affirmed its decision to continue the policy of not assessing annual fees to licensees when the license is amended to authorize possession only or decommissioning. This is consistent with the concept that those who benefit from a license that authorizes operation or use of material should pay annual fees. Therefore, consistent with agency policy included in the past fee rules, and the FY 1994 proposed fee rule, the NRC will not assess FY 1994 annual fees to Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, previously a UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  converter but now is not authorized to operate as a UF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  converter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

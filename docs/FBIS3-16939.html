It was constructed using unique Russian technology,  and is the only one of its kind, not only in Russia, but,  experts concede, in the whole world, in terms of the level of  technological safety and of the efficiency of rendering the  chemical charges harmless, the so-called discharge process  [rassnaryazheniye]. The military unit on whose books this  factory is today is forced to find substantial resources for the  maintenance of the mothballed works, though a decision was made  back in 1989 to set up a training center here that would use  neutral media.    Administration heads of seven Russian regions where all  chemical weapons of the former USSR are now stored recently  visited the installation: Everybody seems to have woken up to  the fact that it is more dangerous to store than to destroy  them. Therefore, technologies for chemical disarmament should  be moved closer to places of storage: A state program of  financing, and, more importantly, an open discussion in the mass  media over location of chemical disarmament enterprises are  needed to achieve this. Otherwise, things will happen as they  did in Chapayevsk -- the installation was built in secret, with  immense resources, but it is not working.</p>

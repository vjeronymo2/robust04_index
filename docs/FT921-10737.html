			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Marchand refuses to quit over Habash FRENCH interior minister Philippe Marchand refused to resign yesterday over the harsh criticism of Palestinian leader Mr George Habash's visit to France, Associated Press reports from Paris. Meanwhile, a voter poll, published in the newspaper Le Parisien, found 55 per cent in favour of bringing forward the National Assembly elections which are scheduled for spring next year; 39 per cent were opposed. The poll reflected surging discontent with the governing Socialist Party over a stagnant economy, long-running finance scandals and what is now known as 'the Habash affair.' President Francois Mitterrand was scheduled to give a television interview on the controversy last night.</p>

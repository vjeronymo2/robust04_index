			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (14): No longer the poor relation - Television fees / Six months ahead of the first skier hitting the piste, CBS had already sold 85 per cent of all the advertising time available within its Lillehammer coverage - compared with 60 per cent at the same time prior to Albertville If pictures speak louder than words, George Washington on a dollar bill is the image that shouts loudest of all. The increasing interest and esteem enjoyed by the Winter Olympics is reflected by the willingness of leading broadcasters to bid handsomely for the Games that were once the poor relation of the Olympic family. CBS, for example, paid Dollars 300m for the American rights to telecast from Lillehammer. That was Dollars 57m up on the figure for Albertville in 1992, where CBS was also the rights-holder. Sentiment did not come into the equation. 'The ratings we had from Albertville were just sensational. Also, the demographics were far more broadly spread than you would normally see for a sports show audience in the States: a great many women and older viewers,' said Mr Barry Zegel, director of the 800-strong CBS beachhead in Norway. Post-Albertville research released by the International Olympic Committee showed that in key markets the Winter Games was close behind the summer Olympiad in terms of appeal. In the US, Spain, and UK combined, nine out of 10 people watched some TV from Barcelona. But an extraordinary seven out of 10 also watched coverage from Albertville, earlier the same year. The 1992 gross cumulative TV audience - added across all Olympic transmissions in all countries - is estimated at 24.6 billion (16.6bn for Barcelona and 8bn for Albertville), compared to only a 17bn total in 1988 (10.4bn for Seoul and 6.6bn for Calgary). Yet the growth in telecast hours and global audience is not just the result of the addition of new countries. In the key regions of the US, Europe and Japan, representing 73 per cent of the world's economy measured by gross national product, audiences grew since 1988 by 16.2bn; up 38 per cent. Despite its massive expenditure in Norway - and the logistical effort must cost at least as much as the rights, although the exact sum is a commercial secret - CBS is smiling through. Six months ahead of the first skier hitting the piste, the network had already sold 85 per cent of all the advertising time available within its Lillehammer coverage - compared with 60 per cent at the same time prior to Albertville. American TV industry predictions suggest CBS could make a gross profit of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 60m on the deal. If so, the negotiations for the rights to the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, will be ferocious. Mr Dick Ebersol, NBC's boss, is determined to make his channel 'the Olympic choice' and will fight hard to maintain momentum from Atlanta. Overall, the Norwegian officials report that the value of the various TV contracts has increased between 20 and 40 per cent compared with Albertville. This is despite the fact that Albertville contracts were signed in a period of economic boom whereas Lillehammer's were signed during the worst economic depression for two generations. One thing is certain; that the European Broadcasting Union will never again pick up an Olympic bargain like Lillehammer, for which they paid a scant Dollars 24m rights fee. To secure the rights for Barcelona the EBU paid Dollars 90m; Atlanta cost the consortium Dollars 250m, reflecting both the increased value of the summer Games and the European market area. Although the IOC has consistently said that it will not entertain broadcasters who cannot deliver the majority of a national audience - thus ruling out many individual satellite operators - the EBU is itself a consortium. A 'patchwork deal' over the skies of Europe that met the Olympic body's criteria, and promised more dollars, could further increase the value of snow and ice.</p>

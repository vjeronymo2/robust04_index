			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF THE AK-47;  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSIAL WEAPON, LIKE OTHER SEMIAUTOMATICS, IS ACTUALLY PRECISE AND  DURABLE AND HAS NOSTALGIC APPEAL, OWNERS SAY  </P> <P> Squinting down the sights of his rifle at the paper target 100 yards away,  yellow shooting glasses resting on his nose, Wayne Tom slowly squeezed off  another round with a short, unremarkably loud bang. Nothing out of the  ordinary.  </P> <P> Tom, who was shooting one of his two semiautomatic AK-47s at Irvine's South  Coast Gun Club, noted that the weapons are "part of a collection. And they're  fun to shoot."  </P> <P> "People say you can't hunt with them," said Tom, a production manager for a  remodeling company who lives in Corona del Mar, "but that's not true."  </P> <P> "They're excellent at medium range, for medium-sized game and plinking," he  said, referring to shooting at objects such as cans and bottles.  </P> <P> Tom, like other shooters of assault weapons at the range, said the rifles add  variety to his collection. "I have about a dozen guns . . . and I like all my  rifles equally," he said. "These two are just something different."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weapons Called Practical  </P> <P> To Tom Mancusi of San Pedro, shooting his American-made AR-15 assault rifle a  few positions down from Wayne Tom, military assault weapons offer practicality.  </P> <P> "It's just a high-performance rifle," Mancusi said of his gun of choice. "It's  a semiautomatic version of the military M-16, and it was meant to be abused.  You can drop it, get it muddy. You don't have to baby it. Some other guns you  have to clean every five rounds, but this gun was meant to have hundreds of  rounds run through it."  </P> <P> And, he said, the AR-15's service in Vietnam -- as the M-16's -- enhances its  appeal.  </P> <P> "It's a little piece of history, really," he said.  </P> <P> When Patrick Edward Purdy walked into a Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17 and killed  five children and wounded 29 others with a semiautomatic AK-47 rifle, he  ignited a firestorm of revulsion against military assault weapons.  </P> <P> Within hours of the slayings, an entire nation became familiar with the  Chinese-made AK-47 and, in the following days, other assault weapons such as  the Israeli Uzi and the U.S. AR-15.  </P> <P> With recognition came outrage. On Feb. 7, the Los Angeles City Council passed  an ordinance barring the sale and possession of semiautomatic, military  assault-type weapons. At least six more cities in the state have adopted  similar laws, and at least 13 others are considering them. Throughout the  country, nearly a dozen additional cities, from New Orleans to Boston, are  pondering bans on assault weapons, as will the California Assembly and other  state legislatures.  </P> <P> Assault weapons, their opponents say, are highly dangerous, are designed  expressly for killing people, serve no other practical purpose and have,  therefore, no place in the hands of private citizens.  </P> <P> Given all that, why would anyone want to own one?  </P> <P> That question seems to genuinely puzzle the owners of assault weapons, who say  the loathing directed at the guns makes no sense. To them, the weapons simply  differ in look and feel, and possibly in capacity and caliber, from other, more  conventional semiautomatic guns.  </P> <P> They see them instead as objects of history or nostalgia, curiosities for their  collections, accurate long-distance rifles, target-shooting weapons or as  effective means of personal protection.  </P> <P> Tihamer Bocz, a computer programmer from Buena Park, bought his AK-47 partly  for protection. "If there's going to be a big earthquake, there's going to be  some trouble, like looting," said Bocz, a Hungarian immigrant who has lived in  the United States for 10 years.  </P> <P> "This gun has a lot of stopping power. I don't want to kill anybody, but if  people loot or try to rape my wife, I'm going to shoot them. My father and my  church have a different point of view, but I have a responsibility. My  Christian mind says no, but for survival, I say yes."  </P> <P> The weapon, he said, is also "fun for sharpshooting. And I will hunt with it,  but not right now."  </P> <P> Bocz said he "didn't know (the AK-47) existed here until the news media brought  it up (after the Stockton killings). Before they came out with all this, I  never would have bought it."  </P> <P> For another gun enthusiast, the AK-47 presented a range-shooting challenge.  </P> <P> "People say, 'Now why would you need that AK-47?' " said Steven D. Bromberg, a  lawyer with a practice in Encino and a former AK-47 owner. "And in some cases  that would be a valid question.  </P> <P> "If you were going to use it for hunting, they'd be right. But if you were  going to use it for target shooting or self-defense, they'd be wrong."  </P> <P> AK-47s, in particular, he said, appeal to the sport target shooter because of  the weapon's accuracy at long distances but are "very cumbersome for hunting."  </P> <P> They also have the disadvantage of looking fearsome and deadly, he said, which  has probably pushed many a hot button.  </P> <P> "I think the looks of the weapons have a lot to do with" opposition to the  guns, Bromberg said. "When people see someone go into a schoolyard and shoot a  bunch of children, their senses are so inflamed that all they see is an AK-47.  If the crazies out there had been using something other than AK-47s, there  wouldn't be so much going on now about AK-47s."  </P> <P> When Bromberg, a Newport Beach resident, owned his AK-47, he said, he used it  strictly as a target rifle.  </P> <P> Although Bromberg sold his AK-47 two years ago "because I had accomplished what  I wanted to accomplish with it," he said he now regrets selling it and is in  the market for another one. Its "capacity and maneuverability and accuracy," he  said, recommend it as an effective self-defense weapon.  </P> <P> "I'm not a survivalist," he said, "and I don't believe that you or I have to  turn our homes into arsenals against someone coming to get us. But if, God  forbid, you are in a situation where you have to defend yourself with a handgun  and your opponents are using a semiautomatic weapon, it would be like throwing  rocks at them."  </P> <P> (The AK-47, like the AR-15, the Uzi and all semiautomatic weapons, fires a  round each time the trigger is squeezed. A fully automatic weapon, which fires  a rapid, constant spray of bullets while the trigger remains pulled, is what is  known as a machine gun and is illegal in California for the general public.  Assault-type weapons sold legally in California are semiautomatic, although  their military antecedents are fully automatic.)  </P> <P> Nearly all of the shooters and owners interviewed for this story said they  would not oppose registering assault weapons or having a 15-day waiting period  imposed on their purchase. But every gun enthusiast interviewed strongly  opposed legislation to bar the sale and possession of the rifles.  </P> <P> "I personally think the AK is ugly," one said, "but there's no reason to hate  it just because it's a semiautomatic weapon."  </P> <P> And at a recent gun collectors' show and sale at the Orange County Fairgrounds,  exhibitors selling assault rifles encountered not hatred but a great deal of  enthusiasm for the weapons.  </P> <P> "Business is booming," said Maurice Danaher, a dealer for Mitchell Arms Inc. of  Santa Ana. "Those clowns up in L.A. have got everybody scared. Before all the  attention . . . I'd sell one or two assault rifles at a show. Now I can't get  enough. People who don't even know how to load them are buying them."  </P> <P> And buying continues to be a simple process.  </P> <P> By California law, such weapons can be taken home the same day, provided the  buyer has the money and agrees to sign a form for the dealer asserting that the  buyer:  </P> <P> Is not a convicted felon or mental patient on leave from a mental institution.  </P> <P> Has not been adjudicated by a court as being a danger to others.  </P> <P> Has not been found incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> Is not addicted to drugs.  </P> <P> Has not been found guilty by reason of insanity in any crime.  </P> <P> (Buyers of handguns must wait 15 days to pick up their weapons while their  backgrounds are checked. There is no waiting period for shotguns or rifles.)  </P> <P> While many buyers may be snapping up the guns in reaction to the Los Angeles  ordinance, Danaher said, others are motivated by nostalgia.  </P> <P> "A lot of the people who buy them," he said, "are Vietnam vets who are  nostalgic for the type of gun they had then. With the younger guys, they buy  them more for target shooting than anything else. That's what they're for:  target shooting for fun."  </P> <P> Standing nearby, Bill Spincola of Mission Viejo -- an Army veteran who said he  carried the M-16 during his four-year hitch -- said "there's a kind of mystique  about these weapons. I think it's kind of like a trend. When the Rambo movies  came out, there was a run on these kinds of guns. For me, (the AR-15 displayed  at Danaher's booth) has historical value, and it's just a neat machine."  </P> <P> Non-veterans, said Bromberg, a former Marine reservist, probably "have a  fascination with military-style weapons."  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people go for them because of the John Wayne syndrome,"  Bromberg said, "but that wears thin after a while."  </P> <P> Still, at the gun show, John Wayne was served up as a selling tool. One dealer  who was selling semiautomatic versions of the Ingram Mac-10 -- a small,  pistol-like military assault weapon originally manufactured as an automatic gun  -- attracted customers by playing a videotape of Wayne firing a Mac-10 in the  film "McQ."  </P> <P> In the picture, Wayne, who is introduced to the weapon at a firing range,  riddles a barrel of water with a short, intense burst and walks away  awe-struck.  </P> <P> On another videotape monitor, a dealer advertised a lever-type trigger assembly  that allows the semiautomatic weapon's shooter to modify the gun to fire a  bullet when the trigger lever is both pulled and pushed. A gun modified with  the device remains semiautomatic and, therefore, legal under federal law  because the weapon is still not capable of expelling bullets in a steady  stream.  </P> <P> Semiautomatic assault weapons in their present legal incarnations are not  inherently more deadly than their more conventional hunting-style cousins, Los  Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said.  </P> <P> Patrick Purdy, he said, "probably" could have wreaked equal havoc in Stockton  had he used a more common semiautomatic weapon of a caliber and clip capacity  similar to the AK-47.  </P> <P> "I do not agree with those people who try to say that this (gun) is inherently  more dangerous than that (gun)," Block said. "A semiautomatic rifle is a  semiautomatic rifle, whether it was designed for military or other purposes,  and the reality is that semiautomatic military weapons have been available for  many years, certainly since World War II or thereabouts.  </P> <P> "But the reality also is that it's only been in the last four or five years  that semiautomatic weapons of this type have become a problem relative to  criminal violence. This is a phenomenon that I really can't explain, but it  almost seems to correlate with the beginning of importation of significant  numbers of these weapons from foreign countries.  </P> <P> "For some reason," he added, "the American-made, existing, semiautomatic  military weapons don't seem to have any great appeal to gang members and drug  dealers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular With Drug Dealers  </P> <P> The foreign-made weapons, particularly AK-47s, are popular with drug dealers  and gangs because of their easy accessibility and their low price, Los Angeles  Police Department spokesman Don Lawrence said.  </P> <P> "A lot of the rapid-fire weapons are in the price range of $600, $700 or $800,"  he said. "But you can buy an AK-47 for around $300 or so."  </P> <P> Also, Lawrence said, a weapon such as the AK-47 may become "the weapon of  choice because it's talked about a lot" in gang hierarchies.  </P> <P> "Let's say that I picked up an AK-47," Lawrence said, "and I have a lot of  people who look up to me. They might say, 'Hey, Don has an AK-47. I want one  too.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sheriff Favors Removal  </P> <P> Block said he favors removing the guns that generate that appeal.  </P> <P> "The effort I support," he said, "is one that tries to focus on that narrow  range of weapons . . . (and) prohibit semiautomatic, military assault weapons  generically, but provide an exemption for those semiautomatic or hunting  weapons that have been on the scene for years."  </P> <P> Also, he said, referring to the Los Angeles prohibition of assault weapons, "I  do not subscribe to the recommendations for confiscation (of any weapons). If  the weapon was obtained legally and in good faith by a law-abiding citizen,  that person should be able to apply for a license for it and be scrutinized for  criminal background or drug use or mental illness."  </P> <P> In the current panic-buying climate, however, even people with an aversion to  the weapons are buying them as a hedge against the day when they may be  illegal, one Orange County gun show dealer said.  </P> <P> "People tell me, 'I don't like the AK, but I'm gonna buy a couple of them now,'  " said Darren Johnson, who said he had sold nearly 200 AK-47s in one week.  </P> <P> "People don't need them," he said. "They don't really have a purpose for them.  People like to go out into the desert and shoot and feel powerful."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Desert Firing Range  </P> <P> The desert is where James Everett fired his assault weapons -- an AR-15, a  Galil (an Israeli-made assault rifle) and an Italian Fie SPAS 12-gauge shotgun.  </P> <P> However, he tired of them and took them to the gun show to sell.  </P> <P> "I never thought I'd buy an assault rifle," said Everett, who lives in Santa  Ana and works in the personnel department on the battleship Missouri in Long  Beach. "I bought these just basically to plink around. I also collect."  </P> <P> Still, Everett said he does not know "what drives people to buy them. The  animal instinct to destroy something, maybe. There's no purpose to having them  in your home. The big revolution isn't coming."  </P> <P> Likewise, Chris Draper, a Huntington Beach tool dealer, said he has no  intention of using his AR-15 for protection.  </P> <P> "I think the AR would be a fairly stupid home-protection weapon," he said.  "There are pistols that would more than adequately accomplish that. Even if  civil disorder should strike, using that weapon against people hasn't even  crossed my mind."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Bought as Reaction  </P> <P> Draper said he bought his AR-15 in reaction to the Los Angeles ordinance and  the news coverage that accompanied it.  </P> <P> "It was in my plans to buy an assault-type rifle for my gun collection," he  said, "but I wouldn't have bought it now if it hadn't been for the media hype."  </P> <P> Draper said his AR-15 is a target-shooting weapon only.  </P> <P> But why the AR-15 and not a more conventional target gun?  </P> <P> "That's a good question," Draper said. "I probably would just have bought a .22  (-caliber) long rifle before all the news media reports about the assault  weapons. That and the fact that if I didn't it would probably be worth twice as  much in 6 months. I bought mine for $735, and I figure I got a deal."  </P> <P> For Draper, the long-distance accuracy of the AR-15 is the big plus.  </P> <P> "My attraction to the AR," he said, "is that it's a very well-crafted piece of  weaponry, very easy to handle, and when you're shooting it's a lot of fun. The  object of target shooting is to lay in a fairly tight group of your shots. If  you can't do that, the piece isn't fun to shoot. If you can, it is.  </P> <P> "It isn't that much different from getting up on Sunday morning and driving a  ball accurately off the tee."  </P> <P> Many foes of the weapons, of course, do not see such a relationship. They see  killing machines. Their defenders assert, however, that had Patrick Purdy  opened fire on the Stockton schoolchildren with a semiautomatic, hunting-style  rifle with clip capacity, caliber and power similar to the AK-47 -- a gun just  as cheap and easy to obtain -- the consequences would have been just as  horrifying.  </P> <P> Other semiautomatic guns "don't kill you any less," Bromberg said. "There's no  good way to die."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Netherlands Troops Now in </F> Srebenica"]    [Excerpts] The Hague/Pretoria -- The Netherlands UN troops  who have just arrived in the former Yugoslavia are simply  continuing their journey to their positions in Bosnia. The  first 120-strong engineering unit arrived in the Srebenica "safe  area" yesterday evening, the Defense Ministry said.    At present there are two other groups of Netherlands  soldiers  in Bosnia, in addition to the engineering unit. Eighty percent  of the 400-strong logistical unit is in Lukavac, some 10 km west  of Tuzla in central Bosnia. And the first company of the  airborne brigade, numbering some 200 soldiers, is driving  through central Bosnia toward Lukavac.    Despite the increased tension in Bosnia and increased  concern  on the home front, another group of 280 UN troops will leave  Schiphol airport today for the Croatian harbor town of Split.  With the arrival of this group, some 1,100 of the total 1,230  troops in Dutchbat will be in Bosnia this week.    The maintenance of the plan to deploy the Netherlanders in  the Muslim enclaves of Srebenica and Zepa and the logistical  center in Lukavac is illustrative of the determination of the  Netherlands Government and Parliament to maintain its commitment  to the international crisis management operation in the former  Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]    Defense Minister Ter Beek and Foreign Minister Kooijmans  said  on Monday [28 February] that the shooting down of the four  Serbian bombers by NATO fighter aircraft under the Deny Flight  operation was "logical and inevitable." The parliamentary  parties also followed the same line.    A Defense Ministry spokesman said that Netherlands F-16's  could have shot down the planes violating the international  no-fly zone over Bosnia. He said it was chance that two U.S.  planes were in the vicinity after a U.S. AWACS had detected the  violation of the ban by six Serbian planes.    The Netherlands has 14 F-16's at the Italian Villafranca  base. They take it in turns to operate in pairs in the Deny  Flight operation.    Ter Beek said that the intervention underlined the fact that  statements by the international community should be taken  seriously. "That means that in extreme cases, the use of  violence is not excluded," he said. Ter Beek cancelled taking  part in a PvdA [Labor Party] election meeting in The Hague so  that the crisis team at his ministry could keep him constantly  informed about the latest developments in Bosnia.    Prime Minister Lubbers is in South Africa with Deputy Prime  Minister Kok and Kooijmans. Lubbers, who said that first of all  he was shocked by the news that the Serbs had flown fighter  aircraft over Bosnia for the first time, said in Pretoria he  agreed with the NATO intervention. He said the line had to be  drawn somewhere against the Bosnian Serbs.    Lubbers said he was concerned about the Netherlands UN  troops  in Bosnia. "But I would have been more apprehensive if NATO had  done nothing," he said. "Then they would have been in even  greater danger."    Kooijmans's thoughts were also with the Netherlands troops  who at the moment were still en route to Srebenica. "We hope  with all our hearts that nothing happens," he said.    As far as he was aware, it was fairly quiet in their area.  "There has been shelling in Tuzla," he said. "But it started so  soon after the planes were shot down that it is not clear  whether there is a direct connection between the shooting down  of the planes and the shelling." Therefore, for the time being  he saw no reason for extra safety measures.</p>

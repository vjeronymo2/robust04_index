			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (6): Environmental time-bombs - Chris Clark on liability for injuries caused by delayed-action pollution A LOT attention is being paid to a series of judgments handed down by the supreme judicial court in France, the Cour de Cassation, in December 1990. In these, the court effectively outlawed 'claims-made' policy wordings which liability insurers now rely upon to manage their exposure to claims from the past. Under a claims-made policy, the policyholder is covered only for claims submitted during the policy period. Under earlier 'occurrence based' policies, the cover remained open into the future for claims arising from events that occurred during the policy period, but whose consequences were discovered years later, such as asbestos bodily injury, latent defects in buildings and gradual pollution. The claims-made form, as similar policy wordings based on manifestation or discovery of harm, allow insurers and reinsurers much more control over the size of outstanding liabilities at the end of each underwriting year. In 1990, the French court ruled, on the grounds of consumer protection, that such policy restrictions imposed an unfair burden on the insured and that, regardless of the wordings included in an insurance contract, the policy holder would be entitled to cover on the basis of the original act causing the harm ('fait generateur'), which insurers see as an even wider trigger than occurrence wordings. Initially, French insurers thought that the ruling was confined to a narrow class of business relating to the construction industry, but the court seems determined to apply its decision to all liability insurance. To add to these worries, similar developments have since occurred in Belgium and Spain, the first under an article in a non-marine insurance contract law passed in June 1992, and the second following Spanish supreme court judgments in 1991 and 1992 concerning medical liability policies. In each case, claims-made policy wordings were deemed unfairly restrictive on the policyholder. Because of past experience with long-tail liabilities, most insurers today are unwilling to write liability insurance on an occurrence or similar basis. They simply do not know how to set realistic premiums for such wide exposure to unpredictable risks. These rulings therefore pose a fundamental threat. There are some signs that regulatory authorities in Belgium and Spain recognise that something needs to be done to stop liability insurance drying up altogether in their countries, but both insurers and reinsurers remain extremely concerned about the French position, according to Mathias Schubert of Cologne Re. Everyone is hoping that French legislators will do something to correct the situation. If they do not, there is a real danger of leading insurers and reinsurers pulling out of the French liability market, although at present insurers are continuing to write claims-made policies on the understanding that policyholders will not attempt to enforce the supreme court judgment. Juerg Spuehler of Swiss Re believes that much of the difficulty here is based on misunderstanding of the claims-made principle. Far from penalising the insured, he argues, claims-made wordings simply move claims to a different policy, which is in fact a more favourable one for the policyholder. Claims that, on an occurrence basis, would have had to be attached to old policies, written many years in the past, under claims-made now trigger today's policy, which is likely to have much higher policy limits and is less likely to have been partially exhausted by previous claims for general liability or product liability losses. The insured therefore benefits, rather than suffers, under the claims-made form and Mr Spuehler feels that it is essential that insurers and reinsurers take the time to clarify this with regulators and others who fail to appreciate it. Apart from this issue, environmental liability continues to worry almost everyone, in two forms: the overhang of exposure to claims from past pollution and the development of an effective insurance market for the future. On the historic backlog of pollution incidents, those who wrote general public liability policies over the last 30 years or so are to some extent holding their breath. As governments progressively insist that such pollution is cleaned up, often to expensive standards, the parties responsible for clean up are digging out their old liability insurance policies to see if they offer any cover, with a growing community of insurance 'archaeology' companies on hand to help them. So far, most of this has been taking place in North America, where US environmental regulation imposes strict, joint and several, and effectively retroactive liability for problems like contaminated land and groundwater. Under a tidal wave of multi-million dollar claims, US courts separately in each state have a queue of legal cases outstanding in which insurance companies are attempting to resist claims for gradual, or intentional, pollution. European policies have yet to come under this pressure, largely because policyholders have not yet had to pay out much on environmental clean up. Some policyholder lawyers believe that, as environmental regulations tighten, past policy wordings in Europe will be just as vulnerable to claims as their US counterparts. Other people foresee greater difficulties for policyholders here, because European courts tend to reach more restrictive judgments on commercial law. With this past experience, many insurers want to have as little as possible to do with future environmental liability. From 1986, all pollution risks have been excluded from general liability policies in the US, while in Europe the partial, 'sudden and accidental' exclusions have mostly been introduced more recently. For wider cover, insurance market pools in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Denmark, and individual insurers elsewhere are offering specialised environmental impairment and other pollution liability policies (loosely known as EIL), which use claims-made wordings and require detailed site inspections before cover is offered.

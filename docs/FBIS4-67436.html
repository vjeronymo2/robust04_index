			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Davydova: "The Ministry Responsible for </F> the Future"]    [Text] Under the new Constitution, we all have the right  to a healthy environment and reliable information on its  condition. The president's recent message to the Federal  Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State" laid special  emphasis on the duty of all organs of power to create conditions  conducive to improving the environment. After all,  environmental safety is an integral part of Russia's national  security. For a long time our country fought vigorously with  nature, subjugated it, and transformed it, and now the time has  come to settle the accounts. We are paying with our health and  the future of our children. If we were to calculate the  monetary equivalent, ecologists estimate that our country would  need fantastic sums of money to bring the environment up to  Western standards. Many readers write and ask who exactly in  Russia watches over citizens' constitutional right to clean  water, air, and soil. The question is more than relevant.  Everyone has heard of the "Green" movement, "Kedr," and similar  social organizations, but we also have state structures. How  many are there, what do they do, and what are their  responsibilities? We will discuss this under our new rubric,  "Nature and Power."    The Russian Federation now has an established system of  bodies responsible for environmental protection: a federal  ministry, territorial subdivisions for the protection and  rational use of natural resources, and a number of state bodies  whose functions include monitoring and inspecting the use of  certain natural resources and pollution of the environment: the  State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision;  committees for land resources and land management, geology and  the use of mineral resources, fisheries, and water resources; a  federal service for hydrometeorology and monitoring of the  environment; and a federal forestry service.    A Higher Environmental Council is being formed in the State  Duma. In addition, a Council for Environmental Policy has been  set up under the Russian Federation president, and the Russian  Federation Security Council has an interdepartmental commission  for environmental safety. The General Prosecutor's Office has a  department for supervising implementation of environmental  protection legislation. In fact, there are special subdivisions  responsible for environmental protection in the organizational  structures of every branch of power.    We will start by acquainting ourselves with the country's  main environmental department: the Ministry for Protection of  the Environment and Natural Resources.    It enjoys the status of a federal ministry in the structure  of organs of executive power approved by presidential edict in  January. However, the work of the ministry, whose objectives  are incorporated in its name, is not very well known to a broad  audience. Moreover, the social status of our environmental  department does not correspond to the status of similar  structures in Western countries.    The structure of the ministry's central apparatus is as  follows. The leadership forms the upper level. Below are the  main administrations: environmental expert assessment; mineral  reserves; science and technology; environmental safety; use of  natural resources; environmental programs; nature reserves;  natural biological resources; international cooperation; legal  normative regulation; financing and development of materials and  equipment; protection of the atmosphere; protection of the water  table; the environmental protection maritime service; protection  of soil and land resources; and protection of the environment  from industrial and consumer waste.  A federal environmental fund and a public reception center are  attached to the ministry. As a whole, the structure of the  central apparatus corresponds to the main areas of environmental  protection activity. There are also shortcomings typical of  state bodies in our country: the organization and  administration department, for example, whose staff is more than  double that of far more important subdivisions. I should point  out for the sake of objectivity, however, that it is proposed to  improve the ministry's structure.    Protection of the environment is one of the main national  priorities of developed countries, where state environmental  services have been in operation for decades. In our country,  however, the environmental department is still in its infancy,  as the RSFSR State Committee for Nature Protection was set up  only in 1988; this was later transformed into a ministry, and  the law "On Protection of the Environment," which is essentially  the basis of the ministry's activity, came into effect only in  1992. Our main environmental protection department has  undergone several reorganizations in the last five years,  apparently whenever the ministry has been finding its feet and  starting to monitor monopolistic departments responsible for  pollution. Clearly, such reorganizations are not conducive to  resolving environmental problems at state level and prevent the  environmental protection department from fulfilling its basic  tasks.    The Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural  Resources should be responsible for general coordination of the  activity of ministries, departments, enterprises, institutions,  and organizations in the field of protection of the environment  and natural resources; conduct an integrated science and  technology policy in this sphere; develop and improve economic,  legal, and administrative mechanisms for the use of natural  resources; organize and set in motion state commissions of  environmental experts; and much more.    The ministry has a sufficiently sound research base: Under  its jurisdiction it has more than 20 institutes and centers,  whose main function is to form science and technology policy in  the field of environmental protection. In addition, it can  enlist the scientific potential of the Russian Academy of  Sciences and state universities.    The ministry draws up specially targeted environmental  programs. The best known is the federal science and technology  program entitled "Russia's Environmental Safety," the drafting  and implementation of which have had strong repercussions in  environmental circles. Environmental protection problems are  also reflected in other major programs: "The Revival of the  Volga," "The Oka -- a Clean River," "Waste," "Conversion --  Ecology," "Radon," "Dioxins," and others.    First Deputy Minister Professor A.F. Poryadin has  highlighted  the following priority areas of the ministry's activity: First,  it is vital to secure legislative and normative support for  environmental protection activity and to adopt a complex of laws  and legally binding acts in this sphere. The law "On Protection  of the Environment" has undoubtedly played a positive role, but  it is impossible to improve the environment in Russia without  the system of environmental legislation that exists in Western  countries. Second, there must be financial and economic support  for environmental protection activity, so that the thin,  constantly interrupted stream of budget funding is augmented by  resources received on the basis of the principle "there are no  free natural resources" and "polluters must pay." Finally,  optimum organizational and structural support based on Russia's  specific features will have considerable importance for the  efficiency of all environmental protection activity in our  country. There is no developed system of organization and  collaboration between all the structures functioning in the  environmental protection sphere. There are no clear  responsibilities, while at the same time, for example,  territorial environmental protection bodies are subordinate to  the ministry, on the one hand, and to the local administration,  on the other. In such cases there is always "confusion and  hesitation," financial complications, a lack of responsibility,  and the possibility of arbitrariness.    Ecology is part of the economy and politics, so drawing up a  strategy in the environmental protection sphere is the state's  prerogative. In this sense, the recent presidential edict "On  the State Strategy of the Russian Federation To Protect the  Environment and Ensure Its Stable Development" is more than  topical. Having said that, it will require colossal efforts --  mainly on the part of the Ministry for Protection of the  Environment and Natural Resources and territorial environmental  protection bodies -- to achieve a breakthrough in the  environmental situation in our country.    We will continue to acquaint you with various environmental  protection structures and talk about their work and the problems  facing them in coming issues.</p>

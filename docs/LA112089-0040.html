			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 96 RACE BIAS CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED SINCE COURT'S JUNE RULING ON RIGHTS LAW  </P> <P> The Supreme Court decision last June that sharply restricted the reach of a  major civil rights law has resulted in the dismissal of 96 race discrimination  claims, nearly one every business day since the opinion was issued, a study  released Sunday by a civil rights group says.  </P> <P> The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reviewed court actions between  June 15, the date of the Supreme Court's decision in Patterson vs. McLean  Credit Union, and Nov. 1.  </P> <P> Judges, acting on their own or at the request of those being sued, dismissed 96  discrimination claims in 50 cases as a result of the Patterson decision, the  study by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People found.  </P> <P> In Patterson, the court said an 1866 civil rights law that prohibits race  discrimination in the making of a contract -- known as section 1981 -- "extends  only to the formation of a contract but not to problems that may arise later  from the conditions of continuing employment."  </P> <P> The Legal Defense Fund study found that 31 claims of racial discrimination in  firing were dismissed as a result of the decision and 22 claims of racial  harassment were thrown out.  </P> <P> In addition, judges cited Patterson in dismissing 16 claims alleging that  promotions or transfers were denied on the basis of race, eight retaliation  claims and six demotion claims.  </P> <P> Seven complaints that did not involve employment discrimination were dismissed  along with six miscellaneous complaints involving the workplace.  </P> <P> The study pointed to a case involving an industrial nurse whose supervisor  repeatedly made explicit racial and sexual remarks to her, and on two occasions  showed her pictures of interracial sexual acts and told her she had been hired  to perform them.  </P> <P> The woman's claim alleging that the harassment violated section 1981 was thrown  out by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, which concluded that  her claim did not relate to "conduct which impairs the right to enforce  contract obligations" and therefore had to be dismissed.  </P> <P> Although the court majority in Patterson said section 1981 had to be narrowly  interpreted to avoid overlapping with Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,  the study found that a "significant number" of claims dismissed in light of  Patterson could not be brought under Title VII because they did not involve job  discrimination, which is all that Title VII covers.  </P> <P> Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he could not comment  specifically on the report because a copy had not been provided to the  department.  </P> <P> But he said that "a conclusion that these (cases) somehow show some  diminishment of equal opportunity or commitment to civil rights could be  misleading" since many cases would be covered under Title VII and others could  be "resolved at state and local human relations commissions or in other laws  which bar discrimination."  </P> <P> He said the Justice Department also has been monitoring cases to determine the  effect of the Supreme Court decision. "The review to date in general terms . .  . indicates that there is nothing that has occurred in the lower courts which  would lead the department to see a need for any major rewriting of the  country's civil rights law," he said.  </P> <P> Eric Schnapper, the author of the NAACP study, said: "If the Justice Department  said they've been reviewing a lot of decisions and they found no evidence that  Patterson has any impact, I don't question the veracity of that comment. It  seems to confirm our concern that the Justice Department isn't reading American  court decisions any more but may be reading decisions from the Transvaal."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The United States had by  last Sunday deployed in South Korea part of the up-to-date  Apache attack helicopters it plans to bring into Korea to build  up the battle ability of the U.S. Forces in Korea, a Japanese  daily reported Monday.    In a dispatch from Seoul, the ASAHI SHIMBUN quoting a South  Korean military source said the first batch of ground-to-air  Patriot missiles, too, is expected to arrive in South Korea  toward this weekend and early next week timed with U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry's visit to Korea.    Both Apache helicopters and Patriots are designed to help  prepare against contingency on the Korean peninsula, the paper  said.    ASAHI said they were initially set to be deployed in Korea  by  mid-March but their deployment has been delayed in consideration  of the inter-Korean contacts that had been going on at that time  on the issue of exchanging special envoys.    About 30 Apache helicopters are set to be taken into Korea,  including those already deployed at U.S. military installations  north of Seoul, it said.</p>

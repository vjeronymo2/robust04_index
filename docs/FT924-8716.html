			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Lift industry fights for breath in bargain basement: Manufacturers warn that a fall in sales threatens to end UK production THE UK lift industry, which only three years ago was benefiting from the construction boom , is stuck firmly in the bargain basement. Prices have been slashed, hundreds of jobs have been lost, and small service companies which dabbled in the new equipment business have collapsed along with their customers in the building industry. In real terms, the new lift market is probably at an all-time low. 'There's never been a better time to buy a lift,' says Mr John Leingang, the stoical chief executive at Otis, the US-owned liftmaker which leads the UK market. With no end to the recession in sight, there are fears about the future of lift manufacturing in the UK, which was formerly a net exporter of lifts but has been a net importer during the past decade or so. 'I've not seen the market at such a low ebb, or so much pessimism, in the 20 years I have been in the industry,' says Mr David Fazakerley, director of the National Association of Lift Manufacturers. 'The effect could be a shift of manufacturing away from the UK.' Just as in many other sectors of the engineering industry, the recession is particularly painful because it follows the boom years of 1988 and 1989. The industry was at full pelt, producing lifts for a construction sector that was often too busy to take delivery on time. Even abandoned mineshafts were pressed into service as lift stores, says Mr Fazakerley. 'We had lifts stored all over Northamptonshire,' says Mr Kevin Gamble, managing director of Northampton-based Express Lifts. Skilled staff were being poached, sometimes in groups, as the liftmakers tried to keep pace with their customers. Otis and Express, which dominate the UK industry, thrived at the top end of the market - the high-specification, custom-built and hence higher-margin lifts for lavish new office blocks in the City and Docklands. 'US and Japanese companies were saying we've got to have a foothold in Europe, and London was the logical place,' says Mr Leingang. 'But it was clearly unsustainable . . . it was patently obvious that after the boom there would have to be a crash.' Otis had a contract worth nearly Pounds 40m to supply lifts to Canary Wharf; most of the money was paid and final payments are being discussed with the administrators. Express has about 280 lifts in the Docklands, including the oldest at the Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels. Lift-makers are still installing equipment in some big City projects, but new orders at the top end of the market have virtually dried up, especially in London. So, while Otis estimates the new lift market has almost halved overall from 10,233 units in 1989 to a forecast 5,200 this year, the value has dropped much more steeply: from Pounds 330m to Pounds 111m. 'You can buy the equivalent lift for about the same price as was paid in 1983,' says Mr Leingang, 'and I can't think of any way in which it would not be a better lift for reliability and quality.' At the lower end of the market, however, the fall has been less severe. Unit sales last year of passenger hydraulic lifts, which cannot be used beyond six-to-eight floors, dropped from 3,320 in 1989 to 2,077, underpinned by sales to hospitals, nursing homes, and sheltered housing. But the entry barriers to the standard lift market are lower, and a big push by both Otis and Express into hydraulic lifts has intensified competition. Mr Gamble sees the market staying flat at 2,000 units this year and next. Even the lift refurbishment business, which normally acts counter-cyclically, looks like slipping next year to Pounds 80m from Pounds 90m this year, says Mr Gamble. In a property recession, tenants put immense pressure on landlords to refurbish in return for staying put, but this time landlords are worried that their tenants will go bust anyway. That leaves the lift maintenance market, which remains a steady earner. However, landlords are cutting corners by extending service intervals, potentially threatening safety. Mr Gamble sees the maintenance market, which could normally be expected to grow in real terms, stabilising at Pounds 200m a year until 1995. Employment in the industry, which peaked at around 11,500, has fallen to about 10,000, says Mr Fazakerley. As new equipment orders are completed, numbers will fall further. Otis has reduced employment by 25 per cent to 3,000, although the reduction includes 150 overseas Otis employees brought in for Canary Wharf. Express, a subsidiary of the UK's General Electric Company, has cut its workforce by 300 to 1,450, although it is still recruiting on its service side. But the news is not all bad. Galvanised by a Nedo report in 1988 which criticised the industry's failures to respond to customers' needs, the liftmakers have sharpened up their act. Both Otis and Express have withdrawn from national pay bargaining and have negotiated productivity deals with employees. Otis has built a new service and training centre in west London to strengthen its position in the refurbishment market. At Express, where profits have improved throughout the recession, Mr Gamble has introduced project management to the lift industry, and manufacturing has been reorganised. A new computer-aided design system is enabling the company to make a single lift for the same cost as a larger batch. All this has helped the larger companies weather the recession and to compete hard for overseas orders. Last week Express announced the largest order in its 75-year history: a Pounds 6.9m contract from the Singapore Housing Development Board for 200 traction lifts. But what the lift-makers need most is a boost to domestic demand, and nobody is holding their breath for a rise in construction activity. 'It's going to be a 4,000-5,000 unit market for the next five years,' says Mr Leingang. Mr Fazakerley believes the recent one percentage point cut in interest rates may halt any further decline, but Mr Gamble believes that even if interest rates were to fall to two per cent, it would take two years for confidence to return to normal levels. Whatever happens, the heavy investment in the late 1980s in training new employees has been turned to waste by the recession, and is unlikely to be repeated. Devaluation will add to the pressures on smaller companies which entered the new equipment business during the boom - typically by 'packaging' thousands of imported lifts parts - and are already suffering as customers delay payments, nitpick over details - or go under.</p>

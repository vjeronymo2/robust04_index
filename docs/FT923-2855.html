			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Moves over German bank cartel inquiry THE German Cartel Office has confirmed its 'suspicion' that German banks misused a market-dominating position to pay consistently low interest rates on savings accounts held by millions of Germans. 'The initial suspicion has been borne out and early next month we should be able to decide to proceed with the investigation' Mr Dieter Wolf, the new president of the Cartel Office, said. A public hearing of the banks may take place first. German banks were shocked last month when the Cartel Office announced an investigation into interest rates paid on small savings accounts. Rates paid in the last four years were between 2.5 and 3 per cent for savings accounts of less than DM2,000 (Pounds 716), although the discount rate had more than doubled. 'Our findings would not be legally relevant if savers could go elsewhere. But they cannot unless they invest considerably more money' Mr Wolf said. In order to lower costs, the investigation launched last month is limited to eight banks operating in Berlin. They include the three leading German banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank - as well as Postbank, the large postal bank, and four banks operating mainly in the Berlin area. However, the Berlin-based Cartel Office said its suspicion applied to banks throughout Germany. The Cartel Office's next step is to decide whether to order the banks to raise interest rates on small savings accounts to a level which would exist if there was genuine competition.</p>

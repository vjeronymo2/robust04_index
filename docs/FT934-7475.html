			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread One must beware of Whitbread's tendency to strip pension fund contributions out of its margin calculations. Since the holiday appears over for good, they will be a regular feature from now on. Even so, its interim results show its focus on strong brands and retailing paying off handsomely. There is evidence of organic growth to compensate for the failure to bag Chef &amp; Brewer at a reasonable price, although that also increases the regret that it missed out on the chance to apply its skills to such an enticing opportunity. For the time being, Whitbread should be buoyed by economic recovery, though, again, it may be overstating the prospects in the southeast where some sales must have been lost permanently to parallel imports. Sooner or later, more strategic decisions loom. The stakes in big companies such as Grand Metropolitan, which it is acquiring with the Whitbread Investment Company, will clearly be sold. Such is the strength of its balance sheet that, were it to sell the regional brewers as well, it would have virtually no net debt. The natural response might be for Whitbread to buy one of these regional companies such as Boddington or Marston outright. But the purchase of WIC was less a matter of strategic design than a bi-product of the decision fully to enfranchise 'A' shareholders. Whitbread's true intentions remain obscure. While it stays in brewing - which may be necessary to secure cask ale brands - any addition to its pub estate will be complicated by competition rules. Whitbread is adding to its network of budget hotels. It may move more into leisure. Happily it need not hurry to decide.</p>

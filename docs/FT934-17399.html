			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Fishermen set out quota proposals SCOTTISH fishermen, who comprise the majority of the UK fishing industry, yesterday put forward a package of measures which they say would enable the government to scrap its highly unpopular scheme for restricting the number of days they may spend at sea, due to come into force in January. In what could be a significant concession, the fishermen say they would be prepared to accept limits on the amount of time they spend at sea, provided the UK abandons the system of quotas on the quantity of fish they can catch, which is a central part of European Community policy. The package of proposals, which includes some that are less radical, was put forward yesterday in response to an invitation from Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture secretary. Fishermen believe that the restrictions on the number of days they may spend at sea will cause them severe hardship. They object to the quota system which they believe has a shaky scientific justification. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation proposes that the government abandons quotas, either unilaterally or in agreement with its EC partners. A 'more equitable sea time system' would be introduced, but fishermen would be entitled to sell all the legally sized fish they have caught. The federation believes its suggestion would enable the government to meet its target of cutting fishing capacity by 19 per cent by 1996.</p>

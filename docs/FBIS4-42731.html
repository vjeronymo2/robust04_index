			<p>BFN     [Text] Our guest in the second part of this broadcast is  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. He is a member of the  European Union troika which has expressed its support for the  economic reforms and political dialogue in Algeria while  condemning violence in that country. This took place last  Monday after a short visit to Algiers by the three ministers.  Willy Claes therefore talks about the result of this visit to  Algeria. The interview was conducted by Anne-Marie Mouradian in  Brussels:    [Begin recording] [Claes] First, the government authorities  as well as the presidency are firmly determined to continue the  monetary and economic reform policy. Second, in order to  establish a pluralistic democratic system where human rights are  fully respected, they confirmed that they want to continue the  dialogue with any political tendency or faction which expresses  the willingness publicly to reject the use of violence and  terrorism.    [Mouradian] Europe has expressed its determination to help  Algeria to overcome the economic difficulties on which Islamic  fundamentalism thrives. How is Europe helping?    [Claes] The European effort should be seen in combination  with the activities and actions of other international  institutions. As for the European Union [EU], we already  decided a few weeks ago to grant the last instalment of a  financial aid package to Algeria's balance of payments worth  ECU150 million. Now we have realized that this is not enough.  We are now waiting for a concrete proposal by the president of  the European Commission to strengthen this aid to the balance of  payments -- this could amount to ECU200 million -- as well as  helping the social policy program which, with the job creation  program, is the absolute priority of the Algerian Government.  It would not surprise me if, within the next few months, the EU  Council of Minister mandates the Commission to start  negotiations with the Algerian Government in order to sign a  partnership agreement along the lines of what is also being  negotiated with the other Maghreb countries, Morocco and Tunisia.    [Mouradian] Mr. Claes, a recent NATO report stressed the  rise  of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa, particularly in  Algeria. Is this Islamic fundamentalism a major threat to the  West at the moment?    [Claes] I believe that the EU is threatened by the rise of  nationalism and racism on its eastern borders and by Islamic  fundamentalism, which is fanaticism based on religion, on its  southern borders. We should not underestimate this danger which  is threatening us in Europe. Hence our responsibility to fight  against this fanaticism by trying to work out social and  economic answers. It is clear in fact that the fundamentalists  take advantage of social and economic weaknesses to make  progress and do away with democratic regimes.    [Mouradian] Isn't there a fundamental difference of approach  between the United States and Europe? The Americans seem to  have encouraged Algiers to negotiate with the fundamentalists  even if this means their participation in government, while the  Europeans seem to be more reluctant?    [Claes] First, this is not an official opinion of  Washington.  But I cannot deny that officials of different ranks have  recently adopted positions in favor of this approach. I know  North Africa quite well. I honestly think that this U.S.  approach is naive, because embarking on such a dialogue requires  partners. As far as I am concerned, I don't know where these  so-called moderates are. I would say that the moderate  fundamentalists were at the National Conference and are in the  government in Algeria. Up until now, I have not been able to  see anyone within the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], that famous  movement, coming out as valid partners, rejecting extremist  options and, above all, violence.    [Mouradian] A last question: Are there not differences among  the Twelve? Is there really a common European foreign policy  vis-a-vis Algeria?    [Claes] I am not sure if we can speak of big differences. It  is true that some countries have always been more interested in  a community Mediterranean policy than others. This is not  surprising in fact. Having said this, let's be honest, there is  not, as yet, a common foreign policy on North Africa. The  Maastricht Treaty only came into force on 1 November last year:  we cannot expect miracles. As you know, we have agreed on some  common actions in the Middle East, South Africa, and in the  former Yugoslavia. But I think I can say that basically, the EU  Council of Minister unanimously agrees that the policy of  economic and monetary reform absolutely must be supported in  order to help -- in the case of North Africa -- the fight  against fundamentalism. There are no contradictions on this  matter among the Twelve. [end recording]</p>

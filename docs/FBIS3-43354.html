			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Action Needed on Peacekeeping Force -- Johannesburg THE STAR  in English on 5 January in a page 10 editorial notes that the 27  April election "is supposedly to be policed by a body that does  not yet exist, the National Peacekeeping Force. Unless work  takes place at the speed of greased lightening, we could have a  problem." "It is now much too late to ask the United Nations  for an international contingent. The National Peacekeeping  Force is the most vital single bridgehead on the next leg of the  forward path. Get moving."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Too Late for Peacekeeping Force Before April Election --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 5 January in a page 6  editorial says there is "a strong case" for a national  peacekeeping force, but the project "has been left so late, and  political problems are so complex, that there seems little  chance it would be ready in time to accomplish anything. It  would be better to scrap the idea than thrust responsibility on  to an inadequate, poorly trained force." BUSINESS DAY advises  the Transitional Executive Council, TEC to "lower its sights,  form a small, symbolic squad for special duties, and concentrate  its efforts on restructuring the security forces as a whole."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   TEC Must `Be Seen To Have Teeth' -- The TEC will have to  "define its role very clearly if the institution is to gain  credibility," remarks Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 5  January in a page 6 editorial. "It will also have to be seen to  have teeth to earn respect." The TEC gas asked the government  to deploy the South African Police in northern Natal, including  parts of kwaZulu, but the government says "it is still studying  the request." The TEC has ordered the kwaZulu Commissioner of  Police to supply it with information about alleged hit squads in  his force. The kwaZulu chief minister "has stopped him from  co-operating with the TEC." Now the African National Congress,  ANC, "seems set to ask it to intervene in the purchase by  kwaZulu of a luxury R[rand]33 million jet. The TEC will have to  strenuously avoid being seen as a tool of the ANC in its fight  against the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. It has to work on  projecting an image of impartiality."  <H6>  ILANGA </H6>   New South Africa Can Only Hope for 'Gradual Change' --  Durban  ILANGA in Zulu for 30 December to 1 January in a page 4  editorial says: "The hot topic these days among many people is  that 1994 heralds a new South Africa. We believe that the black  nation can hardly wait to leave apartheid behind. Let us,  however, give a word of caution! To some, this new South Africa  spells heaven on earth. You hear them say: Come oh new South  Africa and let us eat well, live in new houses. Even among  school pupils you hear things like: Even if we fail come year's  end, it will not mean much, because in the new South Africa it  will be pass one pass all. No such thing will happen. Those  who imagine that come 27 April this country will be a land  flowing with honey are to be pitied as they live in a fool's  paradise. All that can be hoped for is that if all goes well  politically, things will gradually change for the better, but  not in the blinking of an eye." "The new South Africa will  yield good and enjoyable results only if we all work with  determination to make it so in all aspects of life, and not just  in the political field."</p>

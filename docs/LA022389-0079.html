			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> A former Mississippi sheriff has filed an $8 million libel suit against the  makers of the film "Mississippi Burning," claiming he was portrayed unfavorably  in the film. "They have sure done some terrible harm," the former Neshoba  County sheriff, Lawrence Rainey, 65, told the Associated Press on Wednesday.  "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in  that movie is referring to me." The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District  Court at Meridian charges defamation of character, libel and invasion of  privacy, attorney James G. McIntyre said. Rainey, who now works for a  black-owned security guard service, was sheriff at the time of the 1964  slayings of three civil rights workers near Philadelphia, Miss. The deaths  prompted an FBI investigation that led to conspiracy charges being filed  against 18 men, including Rainey, who was later acquitted. The movie, an Orion  Pictures release starring Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, is a fictional account  of the slayings of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman. It has  been criticized by some civil rights activists who say it maligns blacks and  portrays the FBI agents as heroes. Rainey said the film falsely portrayed his  activities and attitude during the period and had wronged the people of Neshoba  County. Rainey said that both he and his employer had been "catching some  playback" from those who had seen the film. Orion's in-house attorney in New  York, John Hester, said Wednesday that he was not aware of any papers being  served to the company. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

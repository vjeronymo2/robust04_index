			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 22, 23-29 May </F> 94]    [Text] The French Aerospaciale's cooperation with  Ukrainian space rocketry manufacturers (the giant Yuzhny MIC  [military industrial complex] works and Yuzhnoe designers in  Dnepropetrovsk) started last year and involved designing and  manufacture of small rockets and the French Arian-5 rocket.    As of today, four contracts were signed by the Ukrainian and  French partners, which provide for the Yuzhnoe designers'  involvement in the following projects:    - utilization of SS-24 missiles' oxygen tanks as kerosene  and  liquid oxygen containers to replace heptyl and amyl. A contract  to this effect embraces a seven-month period and is estimated at  100,000 FF;    - utilization of SS-24 missiles and their components for  manufacture of new small rockets intended for placing satellites  on low orbits launched from the French space center in Guiana.  The 300,000 FF contract's term may stretch from six to twelve  months depending on Aerospaciale's response to the Yuzhnoe  designers' draft documentation;    - utilization of a solid propellant 30t.-thrust engine as  the  second-stage booster for small rockets. The 120,000 FF  contract's term is three months;    - utilization of SS-24 components as Arian-5 boosters  (200,000 FF).    The Ukrainian party is reported to have arranged all export  control formalities.    The Yuzhnoe designers' technologies for blasting welding are  the object of negotiations underway with a view of contract  signing.    The Yuzhnoe-Aerospaciale duet is reported as intending to  secure the French government's financing of small rocket  manufacture designed to lift commercial payloads.    According to Andrei Zhalko-Titarenko, deputy  director-general  of the Ukrainian National Space Agency, Ukraine's skilled and  cheap labor makes cooperation attractive and lucrative in the  eyes of French space researchers.</p>

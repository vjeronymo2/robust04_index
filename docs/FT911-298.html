			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / IMF chief backs Egypt on debt MR MICHEL Camdessus, IMF chairman, yesterday pledged support for Egypt's efforts to persuade foreign creditors to forgive a large part of its Dollars 35bn (Pounds 20.7bn) foreign debt. Mr Camdessus told President Hosni Mubarak the fund would back Egypt's application for debt forgiveness at a meeting of the Paris Club of creditor nations this month. He was speaking on the eve of this week's signing in Washington of a new Dollars 400m standby agreement, under which Egypt has pledged to press ahead faster with liberalising its economy. 'Your country has a convincing programme. I think it will get strong support from the international community,' Mr Camdessus is reported to have said. Mr Mubarak leaves later this week to visit France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Turkey, in efforts to secure debt forgiveness under terms like those accorded to Poland recently. The Paris Club last month agreed to cut Warsaw's Dollars 35bn official debt by 30 per cent over the next three years and by 20 per cent more if Poland stuck to an agreed economic reform programme. Egypt recently raised energy prices and import tariffs in a drive to cut its budget deficit, a key IMF demand.</p>

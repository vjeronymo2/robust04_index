			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFOUND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS FACE X-30;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: BECAUSE IT IS BEING DESIGNED TO GO 17,000 M.P.H., IT WILL NEED NEW  MATERIALS, A NEW ENGINE AND NEW COMPUTERIZED CONTROLS.  </P> <P> The aeronautics industry has not produced an aircraft capable of setting speed  records since the early 1960s, but that is expected to change by the end of  this decade.  </P> <P> The National Aero-Space Plane, under development by Rockwell International and  a team of three other firms, is being designed to fly at least 24 times the  speed of sound or about 17,000 miles per hour, fast enough to soar into Earth  orbit.  </P> <P> The success of the $5-billion project depends on technology breakthroughs in at  least three major areas: materials that can survive high temperatures, a new  type of jet engine and computerized controls to operate the craft.  </P> <P> The plane, also known as the X-30, would use a supersonic combustion ramjet  engine or "scramjet." The scramjet is sometimes called a "flying stovepipe"  because it consists simply of an inlet, a fuel combustion chamber and an  exhaust nozzle.  </P> <P> Unlike a conventional turbojet engine, which uses a mechanical compressor to  feed high-pressure air to the engine, ramjets and scramjets rely on the force  of air rushing into the inlet to compress and provide oxygen to the engine.  </P> <P> A scramjet is similar to a ramjet, but with the important exception that the  air flow into a ramjet slows to subsonic speeds before it is burned. In a  scramjet, the air must be burned while moving at supersonic speeds.  </P> <P> It may sound simple in concept, but burning liquid hydrogen fuel with oxygen  moving at supersonic speeds is a daunting task. The air must mix with the  liquid hydrogen, and the chemical reaction of burning must take place with  precise timing.  </P> <P> "In a scramjet, the mixing, transition and reaction (all occur at the same)  time . . ., so everything is always dynamic," said Barry J. Waldman, the  program's national director.  </P> <P> An Air Force official in the Pentagon said serious questions remain as to  whether engine combustion in the X-30 can be controlled adequately to prevent  shock waves from interrupting the burning.  </P> <P> A National Research Council report last year warned, "Flow instability poses  the possibility of developing strong shock waves and catastrophic loss of the  engine."  </P> <P> Astronaut Joe Engle, who is consulting for Rockwell on the X-30 design, said  the craft would have to be carefully flown, since abrupt maneuvers would affect  the flow of air into the engine.  </P> <P> Since such an engine can operate only during high-speed flight with onrushing  air, the craft may have to carry two other types of engine: a standard turbojet  to get it up to ramjet speed and a rocket for maneuvering in airless space.  </P> <P> The scramjet cannot even be tested on the ground, so it will involve new risk.  All previous manned spacecraft have had rocket engines that were tested  repeatedly before their first flights.  </P> <P> A partial test of certain X-30 components will be possible in a new wind tunnel  -- or "shock tunnel" -- that Rockwell's Rocketdyne unit is building in Ventura  County. It will create a Mach 25 air shock for a thousandth of a second over an  area of a few square feet.  </P> <P> The tunnel, called the Rocketdyne Hypersonic Flow Laboratory and costing about  $18 million, is just one example of the profound technical problems involved in  developing the X-30. The fluid dynamics of designing a craft to fly with  lifting wings at very high Mach numbers is requiring the employment of several  supercomputers.  </P> <P> The inlets and exhaust nozzle of the scramjet, for example, include the  underbody of virtually the entire aircraft. It is the first time that the  propulsion system and airframe of an aircraft are so totally interdependent. At  Mach 25 the aircraft would travel at nearly five miles per second and  undergoing tremendous heating from the friction of air against its surface. The  underside of the aircraft would heat up to 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit and the  nose to 3,000.  </P> <P> The skin of the X-30 will likely be made of a new material, known as titanium  aluminide, according to Rockwell Vice President Robert H. Gulcher.  </P> <P> If funding continues uninterruptedly, test flights would begin in 1996 and a  flight into Earth orbit attempted in 1998.  </P> <P> * MAIN STORY: A1  </P></p>

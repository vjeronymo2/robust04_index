			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Europe 'in need of a democratic overhaul' Member states of the European Union should set up a two-chamber European parliament to improve democratic control of decision-making, according to an international report published today. This is among a series of recommendations for a fully-fledged European constitution, put forward by a group of 13 academics and researchers from seven European countries. The report says the need for a broad public debate on a European constitution has been underlined by difficulties over ratifying the Maastricht treaty. In addition, the prospective enlargement of the Union in coming years requires important changes in EU decision-making. The study group includes representatives from universities and research institutes in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK. It says the legal basis of the EU has become 'incomprehensible' as a result of two important amendments to the original Common Market treaty: the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty. Europe needs a constitutional framework to define where European governments should take on collective powers, and where these powers should best be exterted at the local and national level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, the report says. The bicameral parliament advocated by the report would add to the present directly-elected European parliament a second chamber of 175 deputies, chosen by national parliaments. Their role would be to review the need for Europe-wide legislation and to check whether proposed laws met constitutional guidelines. The report suggests strengthening the Council of Ministers and introducing a better balance between larger and smaller states through a new system of majority voting. The report says the goal of economic and monetary union should be achieved through 'market process' which exclude any 'artificial deadlines'. It terms the proposals for Emu in the Maastricht treaty 'ill conceived', saying: 'They attempted to achieve political union by slight of hand. Contempt for open debate and for the inconveniences of public opinion is not the way to build European Union.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister  Eijiro Hata said Tuesday he hopes that subcabinet-level talks  with the United States this week will pave the way for "a  political decision" on resuming bilateral trade "framework"  negotiations.    Speaking at a press conference, International Trade and  Industry Minister Hata said the high-level talks will take place  in Washington from Thursday.    Apart from the Washington talks, a subcabinet-level U.S.  trade official may visit Tokyo in the near future, Hata said.    Hata said Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and  industry minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki  Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, will be  sent to Washington for the talks, the duration of which has yet  to be fixed.    Hata said they will not carry "specific answers" to three  new  U.S. proposals presented to Tokyo in April as conditions for  resuming the negotiations on a new framework for bilateral trade.    The two Japanese officials will strive to "bridge the  perception gap" between the two countries, Hata said.    The framework talks have been deadlocked since the February  summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The two sides have been at  odds over the U.S.-proposed "objective criteria" for gauging  American access to Japanese markets.    Turning to Russia's participation in political talks at the  Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries  in July, Hata said he personally supports the idea.    The global trend is moving toward accepting Russia as a new  member of the G-7 club, he said.</p>

In light of this situation, the National Assembly unanimously  and with the presence of all deputies -- those of the National  Opposition Union, the Center Bloc, and the Sandinist National  Liberation Front -- called for an end to the massacre and for  peace in the countryside once and for all.    Let us listen to the statement:    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] 1. The National  Assembly, in view of the armed conflict in municipalities in the  north, believes it is necessary to work for a peaceful solution  to avoid the death of Nicaraguan people.    2. We urge the government to maintain the halt of military  operations and to carry out all actions to facilitate and  promote a direct dialogue that should contribute to the creation  of situations suitable for a definitive demilitarization of  irregular forces.    3. The National Assembly urges the irregular forces to put  down their weapons and rejoin civilian life to contribute to  peace and to the economic and social recovery of the  municipalities affected by the war.    4. We urge the government to adopt the necessary measures to  evacuate the wounded, care for them, and to respect the lives of  the rebels. We also urge the government to make efforts to  create jobs and to integrate the rebels into the productive  process.    5. The National Assembly reiterates its commitment and  support for the peace process and urges the country's various  sectors to contribute to the overall objective of definitively  ending the dramatic war in this country.

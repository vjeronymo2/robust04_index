The alleged meeting took place  a few days before the resuming of the plenary session of the  transition parliament, due to open Saturday in Kinshasa to elect  the prime minister.    The papers said the meeting between the two was the crowning  of a series of secret deals which have been undertaken by a  number of prominent Zaireans. Among those who involved in the  secret conciliation efforts was the chairman of the Zairean  National Union of Employers, Bemba Saolona, who is a close  associate of President Mobutu.    Tshisekedi and his radical Union for Democracy and Social  Progress (UPDS) have insisted that his sacking from the  premiership was illegal because he was democratically elected by  the 1991 national conference and not by the president.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Newly-formed regions prepare to flex their muscles - Mark Suzman predicts tussles for power with the national government as regional administrations try to assert themselves Estate agents are warning that house prices in Cape Town are about to rocket. The reason? The National party scored its one election triumph in the Western Cape and the view is that whites fleeing black rule elsewhere will boost the region's property sector. Such a response is one indication of the way the country's new regional structures might affect the shape of national policy. The nine new regional parliaments, which sit for the first time today, mark as big a change from the past as the new national order. They replace four old provinces - the former Afrikaner republics and British colonies which became the Union of South Africa. . Now, the new regions are striving to create a distinctive identity while portraying themselves as dynamic, stable growth spots that are well positioned to attract foreign investment and government resources. This is where the Western Cape, under the premiership of Mr Hernus Kriel, is likely to try to flex its muscles. The National party will be hoping to make the Cape - one of two regions without a black African majority - a showcase of economic growth and stability. The region has a diverse economic base and strong growth potential in its big industries of agriculture and tourism. Cape Town's proposed facelift in preparation for a bid to become South Africa's candidate for the 2004 Olympics will also strengthen its hand, although a housing shortage and infrastructural problems may restrain real growth. But as the regions prepare for a new era, it is unclear just how much power they will have. In four years of tortuous negotiations leading to all-race elections, the most contentious issue was federalism. The final constitution allowed each region significant powers including authority over health, education and limited tax-raising powers. The central government reserves the right to intervene on almost any issue - but the terms are vague. Its rights will almost certainly be tested in the new constitutional court. Although final power resides in the national assembly, some strong local governments might swing the balance the other way. In the likely tussles between central and regional government, it is possible that Mr Kriel and Mr Frank Mdlalose, the Inkatha Freedom party premier of KwaZulu/Natal - the only other province without an ANC majority - might find an unlikely ally in Mr Tokyo Sexwale. Mr Sexwale is the charismatic ANC leader of the region of Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging. Mr Sexwale, a former guerrilla leader who enjoys widespread support among the radical youth, will assume control over the wealthiest and most densely populated of the nine provinces. Containing the cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg and a string of other industrial towns, the region generates about 39 per cent of South Africa's gross domestic product and an even larger proportion of its tax base. The province fears being treated as the country's milch cow to fund development projects in other regions. Mr Sexwale has only a slim majority in the regional assembly and he may feel compelled to resist government attempts to take funds from the region in favour of addressing local needs. He has acknowledged that central government should exercise 'critical powers', but Mr Sexwale has also indicated a willingness to protect local interests if necessary - a stand that the ANC's national leadership would find difficult to overrule. Mr Patrick 'Terror' Lekota, the articulate ANC premier of the Orange Free State, is likely to test the limits of his power, and he will be hoping to use the post as a vehicle to higher office. The desperately poor Eastern Cape is also a potential source of friction. As the former home region of both Mr Nelson Mandela and Mr Thabo Mbeki it will be expecting tangible rewards for its position in the forefront of the struggle against apartheid. If they are not forthcoming, regional leader Mr Raymond Mhlaba will have a hard task juggling his local and national responsibilities. The other regions are unlikely to spring any surprises. In the poor provinces of the north-west, the Northern Transvaal, and the Eastern Transvaal, the ANC has an overwhelming majority and local leadership will cheerfully submit to national policy in the hope of gaining development aid. But an outstanding problem for the regions is that none of their borders has yet been finalised. There is even speculation that Eastern Cape may be divided in two. In the sparsely populated Northern Cape, the ANC has narrowly failed to secure a majorty, gaining 50 per cent of the vote. Outstanding disputes, which will be adjudicated over the next few months, will be further complicated by the proposed negotiations for an undefined white homeland that could include portions of several regions.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Generator faces pressure to scrap contracts THE GOVERNMENT is putting pressure on state-owned Nuclear Electric to cancel some of its contracts for selling power to regional distribution companies. The aim is to create more room in the market for electricity generated from coal, and so ease the conclusion of British Coal's latest round of contracts, which are due to be negotiated while it is still in the public sector. Although British Coal has agreed terms for new contracts with the power generators, they still depend on the ability of generators to sell the power on to the regional distributors. The government's attempts to make space in the electricity market have angered Nuclear Electric, which operates the 12 nuclear power stations in England and Wales, and the distributors. It is still not clear whether the tactic will succeed. Neither the Department of Trade and Industry nor Nuclear Electric was willing to comment, and Norweb, one of the distribution companies involved, said it could not discuss commercial negotiations. The contracts date back to December last year when Nuclear Electric held an auction at which the distribution companies bid for short-term and long-term supplies. They were signed at an average price believed to be 2.8p per kWh, but the new coal-based contracts are being offered at between 3.2p and 3.5p. Regional companies are therefore in effect being asked to buy costlier power. Although they are allowed to pass all changes in their electricity costs through to their customers, higher prices would still damage their image and their sales. The government may also be counting on driving a wedge between those distribution companies which have nuclear contracts on what now appear to be very good terms, and those which do not and therefore resent being obliged to buy costlier power. If the government persuaded Nuclear Electric to cancel the contracts, it seems that the distribution companies would be told it was because of force majeure. The contracts are based on hedging arrangements, rather than direct supply, and would not affect the capacity of Nuclear Electric if they were cancelled. The company, which as a generator has about 20 per cent of the market, is keen to demonstrate commercial independence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Piotr Sliwinski, chief of Piotrkow </F> Trybunalski Voivodship Military Headquarters, by correspondent  Pawel Larecki; place and date not given]    [Text] [Larecki] Voivodship Military Headquarters and  Military Clearing Centers are being besieged by young candidates  for military schools. What is the reason for such a surge of  interest in military education?    [Sliwinski] The Army gives people concrete skills and  occupations. After graduating from a military school, a young  man has a guaranteed job with us, a substantial salary, and the  promise of getting an apartment soon--in other words, prospects  of security and stability. Young men are increasingly eager to  join our establishments. It is not that they follow a  fashionable trend--rather, it is their chosen way of planning  their lives.    [Larecki] Let us begin with university-type schools, which  educate their students to master's degree level.    [Sliwinski] There are three well-known educational  establishments at that level: the Military Technical Academy in  Warsaw, the Military Medical Academy in Lodz, and the Naval  Academy in Gdynia.    [Larecki] What about other higher education establishments?    [Sliwinski] After the planned reorganization, we will  recruit students to four establishments training students to the  level of higher technical college education. These will be:  the Tadeusz Kosciuszko Officers College in Wroclaw, the Stefan  Czarniecki Officers College in Poznan, the Jozef Bem Officers  College in Torun, and the Air Force Officers College in Deblin.    [Larecki] There is a particularly large number of applicants  hoping to join warrant officers schools.    [Sliwinski] We have 14 such schools in the country, with a  range of specialized profiles--for example, mechanized troops,  engineering troops, signals troops, air force, military police,  and navy. These schools train students to the level of  technical high school education. In addition, there are four  noncommissioned officers schools training students to the level  of occupational colleges: the Navy College in Ustka, the  Military College of Music in Gdansk, the Air Force College in  Deblin, and the General Military College in Czestochowa.    [Larecki] What documents are required for admission to  military colleges?    [Sliwinski] An application, in preset questionnaire format,  to join the given college (application forms are available on  request from the Military Clearing Centers), two photographs, a  handwritten curriculum vitae, the original copy of the  graduation certificate from the relevant occupational college or  high school, a reference or recommendation document from the  school (if the application is submitted in the year of  graduation), a copy of the birth certificate (if the candidate  does not yet have a full or provisional identification  document), a signed declaration undertaking to perform  professional military service for a period determined by the  parliamentary act on professional military service, a reference  or recommendation from any social or political organizations to  which the candidate may belong, and, if previously employed, a  reference from the latest employer.    The documents should be submitted at the appropriate  Military  Clearing Center during the months of March and April.  Candidates will have to sit examinations in mathematics,  physics, and a foreign language, and also a current affairs  knowledge test.    [Larecki] What if a candidate does not want to study but  just to do career service instead?    [Sliwinski] He has two recently created military career  opportunities open to him. The first is a five-year contract  service for officers, ensigns, and noncommissioned officers.  This can be extended by another five years twice, so that the  total length of contract service can be 15 years. The other  possibility is extended basic national service, which will be  offered for up to four years.    [Larecki] A scheme has been launched whereby students of  university-level military academies are sent to do their study  courses abroad.    [Sliwinski] Yes, at some of the more distinguished American  and French military academies. Admission is contingent on the  candidate's passing an examination in the appropriate language  at the relevant country's embassy in Poland.    [Larecki] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

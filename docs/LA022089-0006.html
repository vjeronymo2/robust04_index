			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Saying it is time for the newcomers to fend for themselves, city officials in  Miami are dismantling a controversial special relief program for Nicaraguan  immigrants. "You have to kick them out of the nest," said Martha Torres, a  volunteer official. The assistance had drawn criticism from black leaders in  the wake of last month's disturbances in Miami's black neighborhoods. They  claimed Latino immigrants were granted special privileges while blacks were  relatively ignored. The city had assembled two shelters to handle the more than  300 aliens who were living in a baseball stadium. They were later placed in  apartments. Critics of the city's recent decisions say the Nicaraguans are  unlikely to be able to become self-sufficient because most will not have work  permits while immigration officials decide whether they will be permitted to  stay.  </P></p>

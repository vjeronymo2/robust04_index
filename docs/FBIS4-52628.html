			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Idemitsu Kosan Co. and seven  other Japanese oil companies announced Thursday [12 May] they  will raise their wholesale prices of gasoline, kerosene and gas  oil by 0.80 or 0.90 yen per liter for deliveries after May 16.  The companies blamed the scheduled price hikes on a rise in  crude oil prices, which they said more than offset the  appreciation of the yen against major foreign currencies last  month.    Cosmo Oil Co. and three other companies said they will raise  their prices by 0.80 yen, while Idemitsu and three other  companies said they will hike theirs by 0.90 yen.    All companies, except Mitsubishi Oil Co., will implement the  raises for deliveries beginning May 16. Mitsubishi will do so  on June 1. Nippon Oil Co. announced Wednesday it will implement  similar raises on May 20.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: Flying on wheels under the Channel - Christian Tyler travels safely by Eurostar, but feels he hasn't travelled at all If there were a few flat-earthers who condemned the Channel tunnel as a crime against nature, most of us could not wait for the day when the journey from London to Paris or Brussels was reduced to a seamless three-and-a-bit hours. But Eurostar is a breach of the rules. Planners, engineers, architects and designers have conspired to overturn the laws of physics - never mind the conventions that once made foreign travel a sensory adventure. There is no more 'abroad'. From the moment when the wide-eyed passenger enters the terminal he is denationalised, desensitised and disembodied. He, or she, might be in transit to Mars, were it not for the fact that the spaceship's yellow nose is pointing aggressively to the horizontal. Once aboard the steel projectile, all contact with the external world is snapped. An invisible controller delivers over the intercom some bureaucratic banalities: 'Please ensure that your seat number corresponds to the number on your ticket', and so on. The rocket ship pulls away but there is no sense of forward motion. Instead the scenery of a now alien world is wound energetically past the window in the way they used to do for the silent movies in Hollywood. There is no wind or weather here, no smell of ozone, no clank of old machinery, no whiff of Gauloises or strange foreign oaths. All we hear is the distant hum of electric power and the squeak of the food trolley as it is dragged down the aisle by its well-pressed, bilingual attendant. As the mouth of the tunnel looms, the invisible controller makes a brief announcement. Some of the passengers fidget and wipe their palms on the grey moquette upholstery. But nothing very much happens. There is a 'pop' as the atmospheric pressure rises and the scenery-projectionist changes a reel. For 20 minutes the passengers are shown a piece of cine-minimalism. It is the story of passing lights in a grey wall with all the visual excitement of an Andy Warhol epic. Another atmospheric pop signals the end of the tunnel. Now Eurostar sets off across country like a racehorse and the invisible controller boasts that the train has reached its maximum speed of 300kph (186mph). Yet all the passengers notice is a slight lateral movement of the carriage. The burst of speed does not last long. Eurostar may be the most efficient, hygienic mode of transport since the wheel. But plainly there are sacrifices. For myself, on a recent trip from London to Brussels and back, what was missing was the sense of passing from one country, one culture, to another. This is not train travel. It is flying on wheels. The compartments (at least the second class compartments) seem to have been purposely designed to inhibit all movement, conversation or cultural intercourse. Rows of high-back seats are set out just as in the cabin of an aircraft. There are little mustard-yellow anti-macassars, fold-down tables and not nearly enough room between rows for any normally-designed adult human being. But it is amusing to be de-materialised in London and painlessly reconstituted in another capital. It was piquant to go from the quaint English atmosphere of the Turf Club, where I had been invited to lunch, to the trendy purlieus of a Brussels brasserie where I had dinner. Apart from a short taxi ride at each end there was no sense whatever of having travelled.</p>

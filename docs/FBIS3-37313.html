Under the bill, the islands of Suur-Pakri and Vaike-Pakri,  as  well as the Pakri Peninsula, will be transferred to the Padise  and the Keila administrative districts, while the town of  Paldiski is to be temporarily administered by the town of Keila.  Thus, Paldiski may acquire the status of a district of Keila.    The bill terminates the authorities of the Paldiski Town  Council and the mayor elected in 1989. The government has the  right to restrict entrance into the town until hazardous  radioactive substances are removed from it.    The bill stipulates that the special order of Paldiski's  administration becomes invalid immediately after the election of  new local government bodies in the town.    The government passed the bill to the parliament.</p>

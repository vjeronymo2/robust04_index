			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UCSD CHANCELLOR CALLS FOR NATIONAL PROGRAM TO AVERT PH.D. SHORTAGE  </P> <P> UC San Diego Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson on Thursday called for the creation  of a fellowship program to encourage more graduate students in science and  engineering to pursue Ph.D.s and prevent a threat to the U. S. economy and  defense in the next century.  </P> <P> Appearing before the University of California Board of Regents, Atkinson, in  prepared remarks, warned that "there is an increasing demand for Ph.D.s that  will not be met by the supply." Government participation will be necessary to  fill the critical shortage, Atkinson said, because the private sector can play  only a limited role.  </P> <P> In the decade beginning with the year 2000, the United States will need about  18,000 new Ph.D.s each year, but the nation's universities will be producing  only about 12,000, Atkinson said. Of these, about 5,000 will be non-citizens,  and 70% of them will remain to work in this country, leaving only about 10,500  new Ph.D.s a year.  </P> <P> The shortage of Ph.D.s, which Atkinson said will become evident in five years,  "will have devastating consequences for colleges, universities, business and  industry."  </P> <P> In order to encourage more science and engineering graduate students to pursue  Ph.D.s, Atkinson called for the federal government to establish a national  fellowship program for graduate students at an annual cost of $300 million. He  envisions a massive research program in the sciences and engineering much like  the one begun by the government after the Soviet Union launched its first  Sputnik satellite in 1957.  </P> <P> "The program should provide appropriate incentives for college students  considering graduate work; a fellowship of $25,000 per year for four years of  study would be a strong attracter for potential Ph.D. students," he said. "To  deal only with the shortfall in the natural sciences and engineering, at least  3,000 new fellowships per year would be needed."  </P> <P> Many of the Ph.D.s awarded annually by U. S. universities go to foreign  students. According to Atkinson's figures, foreign students receive 60% of the  Ph.D.s in engineering, 50% in mathematics and 30% in the physical sciences.  </P> <P> American academia is also suffering from the shortage of Ph.D.s and is in  danger of losing its "intellectual capital," he said. He predicted that U. S.  universities will compete heavily with government and private industry to  recruit Ph.D.s for the classroom.  </P> <P> Many faculty members are quickly approaching retirement and will need to be  replaced. Atkinson said Ph.D. faculty members in the sciences and engineering  are retiring at a rate of about 2,000 a year, but that figure will increase to  more than 4,500 per year in 15 years.  </P> <P> "The need to replace a large number of retiring faculty, combined with an  increasing demand in the public sector, suggests that academia will have  serious problems in recruiting faculty in the near future," Atkinson said.  </P> <P> This acute competition for Ph.D.s could have a serious effect on "second-tier"  colleges and universities, he said. "The top research universities may be able  to compete for the best people. . . . Second-tier institutions probably will  experience serious difficulties in attracting and holding faculty," he said.  </P> <P> Atkinson also warned that "a bidding war between industry and academia . . .  would have serious consequences for the nation's economy and defense."  </P> <P> The projected shortage of Ph.D. faculty could result in a "corn seed problem,"  he said, " . . . because it is the scientists and engineers in the academic  community who do our basic research and train future generations of scholars  and researchers."  </P> <P> In order to stave off the looming shortage of Ph.D.s, more junior high school  students need to be encouraged to major in the sciences and engineering,  Atkinson said. The next boom in the college-age population will begin at the  turn of the century, and young people who will receive Ph.D.s in 2004 are now  in junior high.  </P></p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (2): The search for a reliable income - Investment and finance / Net investments by life companies in the first six months of this year amounted to only Pounds 424m. And inward investment from foreign buyers has slowed to a trickle MR Alan Winter, managing director of Legal &amp; General's property arm, is quietly pleased with the performance of his portfolio. Even in central London lettings are being achieved: last week for example, British Rail took 42,000 sq ft in Euston House. The latest industrial development - the Campus Estate in Hemel Hempstead - has also just become fully let, with the last 25,000 sq ft unit going to Modern Alarms. Of the eight shopping centres owned by the life company, only one has spaces of more than 5 per cent - and that is a new development in Ipswich open for trading only since the beginning of October. The most recent retail investment purchase - the Grange shopping centre in Birkenhead, bought for Pounds 24m in October to show a 12 per cent return - is 100 per cent let. In today's market, such a smooth performance has not been achieved without cost. Early this year Legal &amp; General decided to cut asking rents across the board even though it had not pushed them up as aggressively as others during the boom years of the mid-1980s. The result, says Mr Winter, is that 'rents are now broadly supported by today's trading levels.' Unlike most of his competitors, therefore, Mr Winter is actively buying properties in the market (although not, it must be said, London offices) and he expects to invest a total of Pounds 350m in property this year with further net investment in 1993. Investment statistics for the market as a whole show this strategy to be markedly against the trend; net investments by life companies in the first six months of this year amounted to only Pounds 424m compared with Pounds 1.48bn for the whole of 1991. Pension funds were even more reluctant buyers, putting Pounds 189m into the market compared with Pounds 564m. And inward investment from foreign buyers has slowed to a trickle. Legal &amp; General finds itself in the fortunate position of being able to hunt bargains in this weak market having sold Pounds 800m of property at the peak of the market in 1989 and 1990. This reduced the percentage of property in the main life fund from the high 20s to just under 16 - at the bottom of the 15-20 per cent range which Mr Winter now believes to be a comfortable long-term benchmark for a large fund. Despite the deliberate contra-cyclical approach, Mr Winter's choice of purchases does offer pointers to the market. Erstwhile prime property does not appeal: the target is higher yield - industrial and retail warehousing at about 9.5 per cent; land banks for the future even if presently covered by poor quality buildings; and shopping centres on yields as high as 12 per cent. Developments are a thing of the past; Legal &amp; General has run down its development team from 30-strong in 1989 to just five and it is unlikely to volunteer for fresh development schemes before the end of the decade. The search for reliable income streams has been a feature of the investment market for two years and now favours the industrial sector because it has suffered less than offices from speculative over-building. But, in an ominous sign, third-quarter yields on industrial units moved above 9 per cent; a symptom of the fall-off in manufacturing demand which seems set to accelerate into the final quarter. According to agents Healey &amp; Baker, only a few choice distribution centres can now fetch 9.25 per cent; less than prime estates are touching 10 per cent. The retail investments market has also turned soggy again, although the necessarily limited supply of top locations has sustained prices for the very best high street units even without prospects for rental growth. Healey &amp; Baker confirm that most interest is being shown in smaller investments - under Pounds 5m - and smaller towns and market centres. The less said about central London offices the better: over-supply and over-renting are the market's two main nightmares. But in all areas and sectors medium-term prospects continue to deteriorate and perhaps only the largest funds with no liquidity problems can afford to take a sufficiently long-term view. That certainly does not apply to most property developers. Forced to abandon speculation, those in a position to do so are busy repaying borrowings. Bank of England figures show that total borrowing by property companies fell by 5.2 per cent in the 12 months to May and total outstanding bank advances in May were Pounds 38.6bn, down 1.6 per cent since February. These figures show just how long it will take to bear down on the excesses of the 1980s. The shallow decline in bank lending revealed in the Band of England figures represents, according to Jones Lang Wootton, net repayments of Pounds 1bn in the first half of this year. Property companies will be occupied with repaying loans for many years yet.</p>

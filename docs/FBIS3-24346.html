V. Kozyrev and Personal Envoy of the RF President,  Ambassador for Special Commissions and the Leader of the Russian  Mediation Mission for Peaceful Settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh  V. N. Kazimirov, 22 November"]    [Text]    [Kozyrev] What we are talking about is a truly extraordinary  incident that will be related in detail by V. N. Kazimirov.  Unfortunately this isn't just simply an incident. The impression  is created that politics are behind it. I'll be happy if my  impression is proven wrong, but this will depend now on swift  and determined actions, chiefly by the Armenian leadership.    Let me acquaint you with the text of the Statement of the  Council of Ministers and Government of the Russian Federation.  The statement speaks for itself. I can add that we have already  been waiting 2 days for an official explanation from the  Armenian side. I discussed this in my first statement right  after information on this incident became known. Unfortunately  all I've received so far is an incomprehensible paper from  Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs V. A. Papazyan, which I  can't accept, and on the basis of which further contact with him  is hardly possible.    I would like to say that we believe the version of this  incident told by the Russian personal envoy of the president,  who was directly conducting negotiations with Armenian leaders  at that moment. I have to believe my own ears, because I had a  telephone conversation with Armenian President L. Ter-Petrosyan,  and by the way with Azeri President G. Aliyev as well; moreover  this mission was being conducted on the basis of a personal  agreement in accordance with instructions from the RF president.    One more remark. There has recently been considerable  discussion of our position regarding protection of the  Russian-language population. I must say firmly that we will  closely protect the Russian-language population, and defend its  interests and Russian interests, no matter where this happens  and no matter in whose presence, even if these are our friends.  In this case I'm referring to Armenia. The attitude toward  Russian official envoys, Russian servicemen and compatriots on  the territory of any state, be it in the near or far frontier,  will be the touchstone upon which the sincerity of friendly  relations, and of the possibility in general of any  good-neighbor relations with any state, will be proven. And  transgressions upon these persons will be viewed in the minimum  as an unfriendly act, and in the absence of a swift and  determined reaction to rectify such a situation the most  decisive measures will follow immediately, automatically, as  emphasized in the Statement of the RF President. I can assure  you that we need not wait long for the most decisive steps to be  taken in this case.    [Kazimirov] In accordance with A. V. Kozyrev's telephone  conversations with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia and  with leaders of Nagornyy Karabakh, a special envoy of the RF  president was sent to Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert to work out  specific issues concerning cessation of military activities in  this conflict.    After a few days in Baku it became necessary to go first to  Yerevan and then to Stepanakert. It was arranged on the basis of  a suggestion by authorities from the administration of the  president of the Armenian Republic that the Armenian-Azeri  border would be crossed in the vicinity of the Azeri city of  Kazakh. I must emphasize that this point has nothing in common  geographically with Nagornyy Karabakh, it is in the northern  part of the Armenian-Azeri border, far from Nagornyy Karabakh.  Consequently the cast of characters consisted of the Armenian  and Azeri sides, plus a Russian mediator. Such was the mutual  understanding that was reached. We set off for the city of  Kazakh. Unfortunately we arrived late, after dark, and therefore  we had to postpone crossing the border to the morning of 20  November. In the meantime the Azeri side made radio contact with  the Armenian side, negotiations were conducted, and the place at  which our group was to cross the Armenian border was designated.    At the very last moment the Armenian side raised objections,  which is something that has already become an absurd tradition  in the course of the conflict. Each time, coordination of the  routes of travel of peacemaking missions--Russia's in this case  and that of the SBSYe [not further identified]--has invariably  transformed into an absurd contest between the sides as to what  routes particular envoys are to travel.    But in any case the Armenian side--Yerevan, the  administration of the president of the Armenian Republic--was  quite well aware of the place to which the Azeris were going to  take us. We arrived in this place at 10 o'clock in the morning  of 20 November. Azeri Colonel Sadykhov, the regional commandant,  implemented precautionary measures, and would not allow us to  travel together as a single column, preferring instead that we  waited behind a hill at the outskirts of the partially destroyed  town while he sent only the lead vehicle forward. The vehicle  was gone for 40 minutes, we were worried that something might  have happened to it, since it takes no more than 15 minutes to  drive there and back. We soon heard shots, isolated ones at  first. We later found out that they were firing at the wheels of  the Jeep occupied by the Azeri battalion commander and three  private soldiers sent ahead with the purpose of reaching  agreement with the Armenian side, after which the entire column  was to begin moving.    The isolated shots were followed by automatic fire, and then  a large-caliber weapon went into action. Experienced servicemen  determined from the sounds of the shots that the fire was from a  Shilka antiaircraft gun and from grenade launchers mounted on an  APC. In any case this was intensive, coordinated fire, and not  just one or two random shots, as was asserted.    It became clear that something happened with this vehicle,  because all of the shots were heard in direct proximity. The  Azeri soldiers tried to rescue the ones who were in trouble, but  their attempts to approach were cut of by fire from the Armenian  side. That's the way the incident developed.    It seems to me that the latest incident once again  demonstrates the entire absurdity, the entire senselessness of  this conflict, and it should encourage its fastest possible  settlement. It is precisely toward this, toward cessation of  fire and military activities, that the Russian mediation mission  was working.    The participants of the press conference replied to  questions from journalists.    [CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, USA] Can you talk in a little  more detail about the explanations from the Armenian minister of  foreign affairs? Why do you call them inadequate?    You said that decisive steps would be taken in the immediate  future unless an adequate response is forthcoming from the  Armenian government. What do you mean by "decisive steps" in  this particular case?    [A. V. Kozyrev] I wouldn't want to go into the details now.  What we're talking about is diplomatic exchange of notes, but in  this case it all boils down to an attempt by the Armenian side  to accuse, naturally, the other side, as is regularly done in  the course of a conflict. Obviously there are times when it's  hard to determine exactly who is responsible for a particular  incident. I'm reminded in this connection of my own experience  when I was in Karabakh last year. Many of my traveling  companions--the military and my security service--assert that  our helicopter was fired on between Stepanakert and Shusha (at  that time Shusha was still in the hands of the Azeri side). But  then first of all, it was rather difficult to determine the  nature of the fire, because the helicopter wasn't hit, and  second, it was impossible to make any conclusions and prove what  side was firing, because we were in a zone between the two  warring sides.    In the latter case--that's what I started with--we have all  the grounds for believing the president's personal envoy and  ambassador for special commissions, who has lengthy diplomatic  experience, including in zones of conflict--not only in  Karabakh, where he's already been working for 2 years with the  mediation mission, but also in Angola. Such that he encountered  nothing new either in the smell of gunpowder or in determining  where the border was, and so on. The attempt to send me a note  that was clearly based not on a wish to get to the bottom of the  affair but on a desire to automatically deflect accusations  can't be viewed as anything more than a personal attack. That's  first. Second. The note contains the implication that if the  appropriate interpretation isn't made, it would be difficult for  V. N. Kazimirov to continue his mediation mission. I must say  that if I were in the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I'd  be worried about something else right now. Not about the choice  of Russian diplomats to carry out peacemaking missions, but  about a swift reaction to our offers.    This brings us to your second question. We're not talking  about some kind of threats. I hope there aren't any  "super-insightful" reporters around, Western or Russian, who are  going to start talking about "neo-imperialism"--I don't wish to  let my imagination run away with me, but I can probably say that  if something similar happened at the level of a personal envoy  of the country's president, and in such blatant form, in the  case of an American diplomat in some part of the world for  example, I think that we would have already seen an aircraft  carrier within not binocular but visual range. This isn't  "gunboat diplomacy," it's a policy of normal protection of one's  interests and of citizens, supported by all of the rules of  international law.    I repeat that I'm not going to let my imagination run away  with me, but we are talking about the government's statement,  which says distinctly and clearly that it "...reserves the right  to take the most decisive steps." And because we're naturally  assuming that this paper--I can't even call it a note--this  paper that Mr. Papazyan sent isn't the opinion of the Armenian  president, I think that there's still time. Frankly speaking I'm  certain, I simply can't even imagine something different, all  the more so because I personally reached agreement with  President L. Ter-Petrosyan, whom I know very well, and I haven't  the slightest doubt that no one is about to take matters to such  an extreme, that what the statement calls for will be done  swiftly--an official apology and immediate steps to punish those  who are directly responsible for this act.    [Interfaks Agency, RF] Will Russia's peacemaking mission in  Nagornyy Karabakh be continued?    What is Russia's relationship to Ukraine's nuclear drift in  the course of ratification of the START-I Treaty by the  Ukrainian Parliament?    [A. V. Kozyrev] What we need to do now is get to the bottom  of this incident. Let me turn your attention once again to the  text of the statement, which says that in this case primarily  the Armenian leadership, and of course the other participants as  well, would have to guarantee the necessary conditions for  carrying out the mediation mission. We are not refusing to help.  This is all being done incidentally at the request of the  supreme leaders of these states, on the basis of agreements  between the presidents, both written and oral, in close contact  with the SBSYe.    I feel that we will of course continue providing aid in the  appropriate forms, but I hope that this incident will help our  partners to realize certain realities.    It may be that the parties to the conflict, including the  Armenian side, have already essentially reached the point beyond  which direct harm begins to be inflicted not only on the  population drawn into these conflicts but also upon the national  and state interests of Russia. This can do unpredictable harm  both to the interests of Armenia and, let me repeat once again,  the interests of Russia. Therefore I hope that the last  incident, which is of independent significance, will help people  to regain their senses in terms of general military policy in  this region as well.    As far as Ukraine is concerned, I can say once again what I  said before: This has nothing to do with some sort of  Russian-Ukrainian dispute. It's a great pity certain SMI [not  further identified], both here and in the West, render these  problems precisely in this key. What we are talking about is  whether the regime of nuclear nonproliferation will persist in  Europe and in the world as a whole, or whether it will be  brought down. After all, Article 1 of the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons makes references precisely  to rejection of nuclear weapons or the impossibility of  possessing them. Unfortunately the Ukrainian Parliament's  announcement made reference to their possession, to the notion  that the nuclear warheads are Ukrainian property. Thus what  we're essentially talking about is the first announcement in  many decades of a direct violation of the regime of nuclear  nonproliferation. This has nothing to do with Russian-Ukrainian  ties, there's only the one fact. I am personally convinced that  Russia is interested, perhaps even more than any other state, in  preserving and strengthening the regime of nuclear  nonproliferation, inasmuch as it is on the perimeter of our  borders that their spread is probable. Understandably, violation  of this regime by one state can quite possibly evoke a chain  reaction. We already have North Korea, with which complex  negotiations are being carried on, and as you know, we are  displaying sufficient restraint and calm, but this question  naturally continues to trouble us. We are in contact with the  North Korean side. Collapse of the regime of nuclear  nonproliferation is naturally impermissible to us. I'm certain  that this is precisely the key in which the discussion on this  question should proceed. As for whether the discussion will  involve a possibility or a fait accompli will depend entirely on  how Kiev itself interprets the parliament's decision. We know  that there are nuances in the approaches, at least judging from  press reports, in the approaches of the president and government  on one hand and of the Supreme Soviet on the other.    All of this requires definite and precise clarification.  Otherwise this is a decision that is doubtlessly equivalent to  shaking up the entire system of modern international relations.  Under the system that has evolved, there have been five nuclear  states up until this time. With the disintegration of the Soviet  Union and formation of the CIS, documents clearly and distinctly  saying that only one nuclear state should remain on the  territory of the former USSR were signed at the highest level in  Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. In other words five  officially existing nuclear powers must remain in the system of  international relations. The Ukrainian Parliament's decision  essentially says in legal language that there is now a sixth  state that is openly and legally a possessor of nuclear weapons.  This is a new international situation.    [LOS ANGELES TIMES, USA] What national interests is Russia  pursuing in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast?    In light of the approaching winter, it would be interesting  to learn how Russia plans to change its aid to Armenia. Where  can we get any specific information as to what Russia is doing  in terms of social, military and other aid to Armenia and  Azerbaijan?    [A. V. Kozyrev] Russia has a very broad spectrum of  interests  in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, beginning with purely  humanitarian (in the final analysis, this war is a tragedy) and  ending with geostrategic. This region is a zone of special  interests and special responsibility to us. We have historical  ties with this region, including a long history of various sorts  of legal international acts and agreements. Naturally none of  this has been cancelled out, all of this still stands. And we of  course will work to stop the war in the region.    Finally the widening of the conflict that recently occurred.  What we are dealing with now is not the territory of Nagornyy  Karabakh as it was in the past, but with territory extending far  beyond all reasonable limits in the description of Nagornyy  Karabakh itself. Matters have gone as far as streams of  refugees, and situations creating a possibility in the region,  or an excuse--we can call it different things--for drawing other  forces into the conflict. You can understand why I'm talking  about Russia's national and state interests. I personally saw to  it that the corresponding leaders would know that we have our  limit, beyond which the mediation mission could grow from  persuasion into something else. In any case we can consider no  only reinforcing the mission's efforts at persuasion and  negotiation, but also other methods. I believe that this should  be clear.    It is the Russian Federation that has the highest interests  there. We highly value the interest shown in this region by the  SBSYe, and we are working very actively with other states, but  this is a region in which our interests are affected much more  directly than the interests of many other states, including due  to the presence of a Russian-language population there, our  economic ties, and so on.    As far as specific information is concerned, I believe you  can get it from the Russian Federation State Committee on  Economic Cooperation With Member States of the Commonwealth. But  if the situation doesn't change, I'm afraid that no specific  information will be needed, things will remain at zero.</p>

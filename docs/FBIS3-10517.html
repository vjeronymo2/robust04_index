During these operations, a  stockpile of weapons, ammunition, and explosives were seized,  and some people were arrested.    The preliminary elements of the investigation, according to  the press release, confirm that this group of terrorists  intended that same day to attack military posts in the capital  and in the Central Department, to perpetrate attacks against  civilian leaders, and against members of the Haitian Armed  Forces and their relatives.    The Army Headquarters, in this press release, asks all  Haitians for actions favoring the spirit of dialogue,  consultation, and reconciliation in view of finding a Haitian  solution to our country's problems, for too long wounded by the  division among its children.</p>

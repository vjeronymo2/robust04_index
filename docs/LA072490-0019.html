			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> 'Die Harder,' Born Earlier: The non-stop action in "Die Hard 2" may have been  too much for Kami Core of Atlanta, Ga., who gave birth Saturday in the theater  restroom.  </P> <P> Core, 18, wasn't particularly concerned going to the theater since she wasn't  due for almost two months. But about halfway through the thriller, Core began  feeling labor pains. She went to the restroom, where paramedics were summoned.  About 20 minutes later, she gave birth to Cortney Brion Samuels on the restroom  floor. Core was to be released Monday from the hospital, but Cortney won't go  home for another two weeks.

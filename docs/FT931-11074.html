			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Japanese lessons JAPANESE manufacturing companies, throughout most of the past decade, have been feared and admired in equal measures by their competitors in Europe and the US. But three years of falling profits has brought many Japanese companies down to earth. The electronics industry is becalmed; Japan's personal computer makers are facing an onslaught in their own market from US producers such as IBM, Dell and Compaq; the car makers are struggling with the depreciation costs of their huge investments which have left them with vast overcapacity in Japan. Throughout the 1980s western companies were urged to learn many Japanese lessons. Sony and Toyota were held up as models of the lean, innovative and far-sighted company. Western firms were urged to make production more efficient and improve quality through more flexible working practices and to emulate Japanese producers which, in cars and electronics, have developed a wider range of products with greater speed than their competitors. But not all the sources of Japanese success in the 1980s have been properly understood, as a recent Bank of Japan report concludes. Much of the improvement in Japanese manufacturers' finances was due to the availability of cheap finance from banks and the stock market. Japanese companies' profits rose and their market valuations soared, enabling them to buy foreign companies and build plants abroad. This cheap capital helped to mask a deterioration in performance at most companies where fixed costs rose. As the stock market has fallen, the cost of capital in Japan has risen, thereby undermining one of the main advantages of Japanese companies. Yet the downturn is exposing the real strengths of the best Japanese companies: a well-educated workforce; deep financial reserves built up over time; good technology to exploit strong market positions and, at some companies, far-sighted senior management. Past economic crises forced Japanese manufacturers into wrenching restructuring from which they emerged much more competitive. The oil shocks of the 1970s forced a shift from heavy industry to light industries such as electronics. The yen appreciation of the 1980s led Japanese companies to diversify internationally. This capacity to reinvent its corporations and to remake its industrial structure still persists in Japan. Companies are retreating from some of the gospel of the 1980s. Product ranges are contracting. The life-cycle of products is being extended. Supplier networks are being rationalised. The lifetime employment system is being reformed with retirements among older workers more commonplace. Companies are paying greater attention to controlling costs and expanding their profit margins. The last few years have thrown up some new Japanese stars, such as Nintendo and Seaga, the electronic game companies which dominate industries which did not exist 10 years ago. These nimble, entrepreneurial companies should serve as a model for restructuring which is much needed at the lumbering giants such as Matsushita, the electronics group. Japanese companies will come out of this downturn deprived of some of the advantages they enjoyed in the 1980s. Some may never again experience the glories of the 1980s. But it would be very unwise of any western company to assume that the Japanese challenge is bound to fade.</p>

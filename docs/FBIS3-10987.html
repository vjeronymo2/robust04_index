			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gaspar Ilom, leader of the Guatemalan </F> National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, by Henry Hernandez  Marroquin; place and date not given]    [Text] [Hernandez] Mr. Ilom, the guerrilla struggle began  many years ago. Do the insurgents still think the same way?    [Ilom] I believe that first of all there was a fundamental  decision. It was to struggle and dedicate oneself to the  people's cause. As of that moment, it became an historic option  and path, motivated by structural reasons in the country. It  was not a romantic decision, but a very serious, profound, and  delicate political decision. We had to respond to the situation  that had existed in the country for many years when we took up  weapons in 1962. The armed struggle is a last resort, not  tactical or casual.    [Hernandez] Everything seems to indicate that there were  options to solve problems, but perhaps you were closed to  establishing an open dialogue?    [Ilom] No, history has demonstrated that political spaces  have been totally restricted. Other times they have been  formal, but we believe that real democracy still does not exist  in Guatemala.    [Hernandez] Why didn't you negotiate from the beginning and  not after 33 years of armed struggle?    [Ilom] One could say now that the conditions are right.  Seeing what has occurred at the national and international  level, we could say the time is right for negotiation.    [Hernandez] Could this represent a success or satisfaction?    [Ilom] Satisfactions are of a moral nature and the greatest  is having contributed so that the people can organize,  demonstrate, defend themselves, and struggle for their rights.  I believe that is my greatest satisfaction, and also being able  to participate in the people's armed struggle.    [Hernandez] How would you refer to the case of the millions  killed?    [Ilom] War is always painful. One goes to war when there are  supreme reasons that justify it or make it necessary. In  Guatemala the social cost has been quite high, but the majority  of those killed was a result of the manner and means used by the  Army to repress and massacre entire populations.    [Hernandez] Did the guerrillas provoke that repression?    [Ilom] I believe that we seek only general objectives. In  war there is a substantial difference. One is the military  struggle on which we base ourselves. It could be described as a  clean war with the painful loss of human lives.    Unconventional warfare is different because of the tactics  involved. The Army, however, kidnaps, tortures, and kills, and  that is repression. Sabotage becomes a military technique,  recognized by any treatise writer (tratadista). We are involved  in a unconventional war.    [Hernandez] There is talk of a war, in the field and  politically. The military claim they won the first one and that  the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] seeks to win  the second one. How do you view this?    [Ilom] That is a very fanciful and absurd view. On the one  hand, because it does not respond to reality, because the URNG  has not been defeated, despite the fact that the Army has  proclaimed itself the winner approximately 800 times in the past  10 years.    Another mistake is to say that there is a political and  military war. For us it is an overall form of struggle. This  enlightens us and preserves the armed movement. These are  affirmations by recalcitrant sectors who do not want to seek a  peaceful solution.    [Hernandez] Why do you maintain a contradictory position  and conduct terrorist acts while engaging in a peace dialogue?    [Ilom] Let us make one thing clear. We conduct military  activities, not terrorist activities. As long as a cease-fire  is not agreed upon, the URNG actions will continue. It depends  on the Army to make a counteroffensive, although it can be  resolved through political negotiations. Then, it is wrong to  say that while there is dialogue there will not be war. It does  not represent a lack of will, however.    [Hernandez] Don't you think the people see this as an  inconsistency?    [Ilom] No.    [Hernandez] Why?    [Ilom] For us it means remaining in the struggle. What has  not been said is that there are sectors seeking to block the  progress in the peace talks.    [Hernandez] What sectors?    [Ilom] Both the Army and private enterprise have come out in  that direction.    [Hernandez] What makes you think they are the ones, and what  objectives do they seek?    [Ilom] It is clear, because they are the minority privileged  sectors that do not want transformations that are necessary for  the country in every respect. They want to maintain society as  they have for the past 30 years, to maintain a counterinsurgency  situation that has led the majority of the people to poverty.  This is always done at the cost of the people, who must endure  subhuman conditions.    [Hernandez] By blowing up bridges and electricity towers,  are  you directly struggling against those sectors?    [Ilom] Of course. We have conducted military sabotage of  bridges and some electricity towers that specifically affect the  large producers of the country who do not want the people to  organize and claim their rights. In the same way, last August  we began to charge the war tax on farms, in view of the  intransigence of sectors that do not want the negotiations.    The checkpoints and highway holdups are not our actions.  They are carried out by the military, with the aim of  discrediting us. I would also like to explain that the latest  incidents, such as the demolition of the San Juan River bridge  on the way to the Atlantic was not the work of the URNG.    [Hernandez] Don't you stop to think that the people are the  ones who suffer from the demolition of bridges and the lack of  electricity?    [Ilom] It only causes them inconveniences. Of course, we  would not like it to happen, but reports exaggerate how people  are affected. They are inconvenienced by having to transfer  from one vehicle to another and having to wait for electricity  repairs to be made to restore service.    [Hernandez] Have you ever considered other methods that do  not affect the population?    [Ilom] Yes, we have other alternatives such as the practice  of the war tax. This has been selective and carried out at very  specific political moments.    [Hernandez] When you speak of the war tax, how many victims  have had to yield to your demands?    [Ilom] Look, I can't say how many, because many of them have  paid their tax and they could have been affected. It is an  important activity and we have made some tax extensions for  humanitarian and labor reasons.    [Hernandez] How successful have you been?    [Ilom] We have been successful economically.    [Hernandez] Is part of the success you speak of the  kidnapping of Franterno Vila Giron?    [Ilom] No, that was not done by the URNG. It is quite  different to collect taxes from a farm than to kidnap persons.  In this case the Army must be investigated.    [Hernandez] Yet the guerrillas are accused of having links  to  the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] to conduct  kidnappings.    [Ilom] That was a baseless charge aimed at affecting the  FMLN  and the URNG. We have clearly said so.    [Hernandez] Are you going to continue with the war tax?    [Ilom] Until the process of negotiation concludes. We are  only beginning and that activity has been reported at the  international level.    [Hernandez] In other words, the URNG does not have economic  resources?    [Ilom] Economic resources are always insufficient, but the  URNG has been struggling for 12 [number as published] years and  can continue to do so with or without money. It is not an  economic problem, but rather a political one.    [Hernandez] There are guerrilla forces that are out of  control. Is this so, and could it be described as a  disintegration?    [Ilom] There is no force out of control in the URNG. It  involves bandits or special Army groups who conduct  counterinsurgency activities.    [Hernandez] It was reported in Europe that Commander Ilom is  tired of the struggle and is searching for new objectives. Is  this true?    [Ilom] You can say you have seen Gaspar Ilom and that he has  the same revolutionary enthusiasm he had on the first day, only  with 30 more years of experience. I am not tired. On the  contrary, each day I am ready to struggle for my people in  whatever form is necessary.    [Hernandez] When the URNG becomes a political party, what  will your wishes and role be, and who among the commanders could  be a presidential candidate?    [Ilom] That is not a function of the URNG. We have not  strived for leadership, much less for any candidacy. We have a  project that will permit the country to progress and to resolve  an armed conflict. Then the bases can be established to resolve  the economic, social, and political crisis.    [Hernandez] But for such a project, one needs to be in the  presidency.    [Ilom] We are a developing political force and a real  alternative for uniting efforts and seeking consensus.</p>

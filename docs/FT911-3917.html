			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (22): Testing the water for entry to mainstream - Imaging and Scanning, an immature technology grows up THE technology for scanning documents is most commonly seen in the ubiquitous fax machine. It is not complex: a scanner detects the presence of shaded dots on the page and then converts this information into an easily manipulated stream of ones and zeros. In spite of the relative simplicity of the technology, document scanners for reading this information into computers are still rare. Scanners have, for the most part, been eschewed as an immature technology although the big banks have long used scanners for automatically reading cheques and simple forms, and supermarkets and manufacturers have bar-code readers to identify products. For at least 10 years, market forecasters have been predicting an explosive growth in the use of scanning and its related applications, most notably document image processing (DIP). So far, almost all the projections have proved to be optimistic, many of them wildly so, but there are at last signs that DIP is about to enter the mainstream and that market growth rates are accelerating. As a result, all the big computer and office equipment suppliers are introducing products and investing heavily in research and development. There are several reasons why image processing has remained a niche activity. The specialist equipment can be expensive; in addition to the scanners for reading documents or other items, a user must have software to manage the information, terminals with big clear screens for displaying the images, and powerful computers and high capacity disks for holding large amounts of information. Software for converting the scanned image into character-based text (optical character recognition) and for managing the movement of images (usually known as workflow) has only recently reached a point where it is widely available, reliable and cost-effective. Most of the products available have not been developed with specific applications in mind. This means that potential users must customise their systems and develop their own application specific software. Inevitably, this has limited the market. 'The problem is that vendors have been selling the technology as a technology, not as a solution to a business problem,' says Mr David Kelly, document management systems marketing manager for computer supplier NCR. Users often end up developing simple, sometimes ineffective systems: 'If you look at the applications, they are not very sophisticated, nor as widespread as the technology will allow,' he says. Image systems have been developed separately from other business applications. The big banks and insurance companies which have invested in DIP systems have all struggled with the issue of how to integrate their image applications with their traditional business applications. The technical problems of putting effective image systems together have been compounded by a simple one of scale: a normal A4 page of wordprocessor text takes up about 1 kilobyte of computer memory or disk space, but a scanned A4 page can take up as much as 30K to 80K of memory (depending on complexity). Such large volumes of information can quickly fill up magnetic disks and clog up communications networks. Each of these obstacles is now being tackled and to a large extent overcome. The cost of raw computer power has fallen rapidly over 10 years, while optical disk technology has solved the storage problem: each compact disk can store thousands of scanned images. Compression techniques, high-speed local area networks and high band width communication lines have solved the document distribution problem and now make it feasible for scanned images to be distributed across large companies. Scanners have improved and fallen in price, with the Japanese taking a growing market share. At the top end, specialist scanners for reading cheques can read up to 400,000 documents a day, some reading both sides. Full colour scanners, although still expensive, are also finding their way into some desk top publishing applications. The biggest market for document scanners is at the low end, where quality is improving and costs are falling. Kurzweil, a leading supplier, has a system in the Pounds 15,000 bracket which can read up to 50 pages a minute at a high-quality 400 dots-per-inch resolution. Hand-held scanners for attaching to personal computers are available for a few hundred pounds. Last year, an international group called the Scanner Programmers Interface Association announced they were developing international standards to make it far easier to use scanners with simple office software programs. Until now, fax machines, photocopiers and computer-attached scanners have been separate devices serving separate purposes. But some suppliers believe that eventually the use of 'scan servers' will become widespread: documents will be scanned once and automatically indexed, after which any user on an office network can make copies, distribute them electronically, or manipulate them on-screen. Xerox, developer of the photocopier and the inventor of the windows graphical user interfaces used by Apple and others, is leading the way. It announced in October 1990 that in the US the Xerox Docutech Production Publisher 'will ignite a revolution as profound as the introduction of the first plain paper copier in 1959'. The system can be used to scan colour images from paper, manipulate them on-screen using 'cut and paste' techniques, and print up to 135 high quality copies a minute. But it is not cheap: an initial configuration costs in the region of Dollars 220,000. The most impressive examples of document image processing in use can be seen in the financial sector, where the big paper-bound institutions have developed corporate-sized systems. Norwich Union, for example, recently revealed its new mainframe-based insurance claims handling system, based on IBM's Imageplus system. Eventually, it intends to deliver document images to as many 10,000 terminals throughout the organisation. The benefits of image processing can be seen at Royal Life, part of the Royal Insurance Group. It installed an Olivetti Filenet document image processing system in late 1989 to store copies of its pension plan documents. It has spent a bout Pounds 500,000 on the computer hardware and about Pounds 300,000 on software. The Filenet system is being used to hold about 180,000 executive pension plan documents which have been scanned in and are then stored on video disks which can hold up to 40,000 A4 pages. The Filenet scanner is theoretically capable of scanning 40,000 A4 pages a day; Royal Life uses it to process 3,000 a day (it is not an automatic process; each document needs to be scanned, checked and indexed in a process which takes about 20 minutes per page). Before the system was installed, the paper files were kept in vast archives. Existing policies took several days to retrieve manually and new policies took between eight and 30 days to process. Financial intermediaries frequently complained about the long delays. Now, new policies can be processed within 24 hours, while checking on existing policies is immediate. 'We can get any A4 page off the system in between two and 17 1/2 seconds,' says Mr Alex Littlejohn, Royal Life's customer service manager. The fastest growth in demand for image processing applications is being seen at companies such as Royal Life, where there is a serious paper storage and management problem which is affecting business efficiency. According to market researchers Ovum, the price of a typical multi-user DIP system will fall from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 400,000 over the next four years, attracting thousands of new customers.</p>

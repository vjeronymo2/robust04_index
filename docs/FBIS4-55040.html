			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Julius </F> Gembicky; place and date not given: "The Aim Was Not To Bring  About My Dismissal But To Besmirch Me"]    [Text] Bratislava -- The extraordinary 31st meeting of  Parliament started after midnight, that is, actually, on  Thursday [5 May]. The sole point on the agenda was a motion by  a group of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] deputies  that Roman Kovac be recalled from the post of deputy prime  minister. The 100 minutes of a pitiful debate without any  conclusive arguments in support of the accusations were  concluded by a vote. The first attempt to wipe out the  coalition government minister by minister did not come off.    [Gembicky] Deputy prime minister, did you have any idea  about the specific contents of the accusations?    [Kovac] We have known about the HZDS tactics to propose  dismissals of government members for about three weeks. They  were laid down by Vladimir Meciar in the HZDS Club of Deputies.  In line with these tactics, at every plenary meeting of  Parliament they will come up with at least one motion to recall  a member of the coalition government. I do not know whether I  should consider it an honor that I was chosen as the first  target. We did expect, however, that one of the former  collaborators, who have now automatically become the biggest  enemies for the HZDS, would be chosen first. I knew very little  about the accusations cited in the motion -- that they concerned  the inability to cope with the post of deputy prime minister, a  suspected attempt at corruption, and a flawed moral profile.  That was all I knew.    [Gembicky] But already at that time reports were leaked from  HZDS lobbies that the matter supposedly concerned an order for  Siemens medical appliances....    [Kovac] The problem is that not a single specific accusation  was raised by HZDS deputies in Parliament. They only wanted to  discredit me in the eyes of the public. They will never prove  what they accused me of. I knew that the proposal to recall me  would be put forward by Mr. Masiar. His speech was followed by  statements by a group of female HZDS deputies. That came as a  surprise to me, and so did the statement by deputy J. Rea, who  is a deeply religious man. While working at the Government  Office, we used to go to the chapel for services together. It  took my breath away that he, as a Christian, lowered himself and  put his signature to such a heap of lies. The paradoxical thing  is that I was hardly involved in the whole Siemens case. I met  the firm's representatives only when they presented their offer  to extend a loan to Slovakia. I was unable to assess how  advantageous the terms of the loan were, which is why I invited  Finance Minister Julius Toth, who was to assess the quality and  specifications of the loan, as well as Health Minister Viliam  Sobona to attend the talks. That was my first and last meeting  with Siemens representatives. Ultimately, the agreement was  signed by Viliam Sobona and handed over to Siemens by Vladimir  Meciar.    [Gembicky] Your signature did not figure under the  agreement?    [Kovac] No. And I was not invited to any subsequent talks.  I came across the offer from Siemens once more when this  material was submitted to a meeting of the cabinet that I  happened to chair. It is remarkable that, originally, it had  been submitted to the government as a financial credit but the  Slovak National Bank governor objected that it was not a  financial credit but a supplier's credit. Besides, the material  had not been supplemented with any mention of a competitive  tender. There were also objections to the repayment timetable,  which is why we withdraw the item from the agenda. That was all.    [Gembicky] On Wednesday [4 May] evening, speaking at the Na  Pasienkoch indoor stadium, former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  also accused you of having embezzled $5 million earmarked for  media policy....    [Kovac] Deputy J. Rea, too, reiterated this absurdity later  that night. The sum of $5 million is an enormous one. It is  not customary to give sums of this magnitude as a bribe. I  would never be able to accept such money and, if I could, then  only for state coffers to subsidize much needed and  loss-generating periodicals, such as children's periodicals.    [Gembicky] You supposedly brought it up at a government  meeting?    [Kovac] I beg your pardon, if someone wanted to collect such  a sum in dollars, would he bring it up at a government meeting?  This is ludicrous....    [Gembicky] But supposedly there are witnesses....    [Kovac] When J. Rea uttered these accusations, not a single  former member of the government -- three of whom were present --  got up and said that this was true.    [Gembicky] One cannot seek redress in court against  something that was said in Parliament. What about the things  that were said at the rally at Na Pasienkoch?    [Kovac] I must get hold of the exact transcript of the  rally. Then I will decide whether to seek redress in court. I  believe, however, that the HZDS will be sued by Siemens, which  has been accused of being a corrupt firm.    [Gembicky] How did your coalition partners respond to the  accusations?    [Kovac] The aim was absolutely clear to everyone. I  appreciate their statements.    [Gembicky] In what way did you fail to cope with the post of  deputy prime minister, according to the motion?    [Kovac] I supposedly did not cope with the management of  ministries. However, I was only supposed to coordinate their  activity. Furthermore, I supposedly bear my share of  responsibility for the catastrophic situation in the health  services. But I did not run the ministry. Quite the contrary,  I beseeched Vladimir Meciar not to recommend Viliam Sobona for  that post and asked him five times to recall him from it.  Deputy Meciar denied this, even though witnesses were present.  They also blame me for having established an advisory  commission to analyze the situation in the health services. My  third sin concerns the dispute between [former Health Minister]  Sobona and [former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs]  Keltosova over the concept of the National Insurance Company. I  have also been accused of failure to cope with the tripartite  council, even though I succeeded in maintaining social peace in  a complicated situation when unpopular measures had to be taken.  Nor did I obstruct the signing of the general agreement  [between government, employers, and trade unions]. It was  [Finance Minister] Julius Toth who vetoed the acceptance of the  social fund. Trade unionists could confirm my words. At night,  after recalling me from the government, they sent a car to  Piestany to fetch [chairman of the Confederation of Trade  Unions] Alojz Englis and [chairman of the Employers'  Association] Mr. Lach in order to sign the general agreement  early in the morning, after an unnecessary delay of six weeks.  It was necessary to prove that things work better without Kovac.    [Gembicky] And what about the moral accusation that, by your  personal approach, you stood in the way of an HZDS-Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL] coalition?    [Kovac] This coalition had been blocked by a decision of the  HZDS national leadership, not by me. Some HZDS deputy even  accused me of having actually changed the history of Slovakia.  The best reply to this accusation was given by [SDL Chairman]  Peter Weiss.    [Gembicky] What affected you most strongly about the  accusations raised by your former colleagues from the HZDS?    [Kovac] I am grateful to those people from the HZDS who  refused to sign the motion that I be recalled. However, some of  the 35 names [that signed the motion] did surprise me.    [Gembicky] Could you be more specific?    [Kovac] Yes. I was surprised by the readiness of deputies  Aibekova, Valcekova, and Romanovska to put their signatures to  the motion.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback in BAe NOT EVEN the most pessim-istic market forecasts had predicted the scale of losses at British Aerospace, one of the UK's leading manufacturers. The news nearly halved the share price to a new low and trading volume rose to its highest recorded daily total. The setback cast its shadow over other aerospace and engineering stocks. The company revealed a first-half deficit of Pounds 129m, down from a profit of Pounds 86m last year, and also deferred and cut the dividend for the first time, by 5.9p to 3p. Dealers rushed to sell the stock, driving it down 57 to 142p within the first hour of trading. Investors sold into any signs of a rally and at the day's worst the shares were at 107p for a drop of 92. A gloomy meeting with analysts brought little respite, not only raising questions over the year-end dividend but also leading some analysts to question the future of the company. Researchers were also concerned that BAe has yet to announce an expected order from Saudi Arabia for Tornado aircraft; most now fear that BAe will report losses of around Pounds 100m for the full year but return to profit in 1993. The afternoon brought some relief to the selling pressure as bargain hunters chose to focus on the company's restructuring plans and the shares were finally 86 off at 113p, a record closing low after volume of 30m shares. Amstrad surprise An early upsurge in Amstrad to around the 30 1/2 p mark put dealers on the alert for a subsequent announcement that Mr Alan Sugar, founder and chairman of the electronics concern, was about to take the troubled electronics group private. But the price at which Mr Sugar pitched the offer, 30p a share, was much lower than expected, and well below the 45p that was being mentioned in the market. After the announcement the stock fell back to close a net 3 up at 28p. Turnover totalled 5.7m shares. Market reaction to Mr Sugar's move was less than complimentary. 'It is a bit cheeky to say the least,' said one electronics specialist. Mr Sugar prompted raised eyebrows in the City in March last year when he sold a block of 42.75m shares, representing a 7.5 per cent stake in Amstrad, at 79p, only days after a profits upgrading by James Capel, the company's broker. Mr Sugar currently has a near 35 per cent stake in Amstrad. In July Amstrad issued a warning that losses for the year to end-June would be much greater than had been expected; most analysts have factored in a projected deficit of Pounds 65m for the year. KIO/Hays deal The reason for sluggishness in the share price of Hays on Tuesday, in spite of better than expected preliminary figures, became evident yesterday as the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) revealed that it has sold a block of 7.6m shares into the market. The sale reduced its stake in the business services group to below the 3 per cent level at which shareholdings have to be declared. An official statement said the KIO holding now stands at 11.85m shares, or 2.96 per cent. The 7.6m shares are believed to have been placed in the market by Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, at 178p a share ex-dividend, equivalent to 180 1/2 p cum the dividend, a substantial discount to the ruling share price of around 184p. The KIO has been steadily reducing its holding in Hays over the past year, down from 10.3 per cent to the current level. By the close yesterday the shares had risen 5 to 189 1/2 p. The decision by Chemical Bank to forsake office space in Canary Wharf for Alban Gate, in the City of London, lifted MEPC, Alban's developer. 'The millstone has been lifted from around MEPC's neck,' commented one analyst, following the bank's letting of 173,000 sq ft on a 25-year lease at a rumoured Pounds 30 per sq ft. The shares closed 13 ahead at 252p after a hefty 5.4m turnover. At that letting price, the net savings and benefits to the group would be in the region of Pounds 10m, enough in the market's view to protect the dividend. TSB eased 1 1/2 more to 126 1/2 p, with the market said to be concerned about the bank's Hill Samuel merchant banking operation. SG Warburg, the merchant bank, jumped 19 to 530p, still boosted by hints that a link with one of the top-rated US money centre banks could be on the cards. Barratt Developments forged ahead 17, or 34 per cent, to 67p, after the housebuilder unveiled much better than expected preliminary results. Costain, on the other hand, slipped 2 to 27p after confirming market fears that the interim dividend would be eliminated. Taylor Woodrow lost 3 to 62p as one securities house bought a block of 7.8m shares at 60 1/2 p and placed them at 60 3/4 p. Among other housebuilders, Cala rose 6 to 45p, Crest Nicholson 9 to 43p and Westbury 6 to 59p in a belated reaction to the cut in UK interest rates. Pharmaceutical issues continued to suffer from profit-taking and currency worries, with sentiment also being depressed by reported bearish comments from Goldman Sachs. Fisons shed 5 to 183p, Glaxo 19 to 797p and Wellcome 32 to 955p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have turned positive on the brewery sector. Bass moved ahead 12 to 587p, Grand Metropolitan 18 to 455p and Guinness 25 to 566p. Supermarket group Tesco retreated 10 to 214p as some brokers found themselves long on stock following the interim statement released on Tuesday. J. Sainsbury continued to benefit from comparison with Tesco, climbing 4 to 460p. In food manufacturing, Smith New Court was among those advising investors to take profits after recent outperformance in Cadbury Schweppes, which receded 9 to 451p, and Unilever, 18 lighter at 1034p. Smith also advised switching into Tate &amp; Lyle, 17 stronger at 357p, United Biscuits, 10 ahead at 297p, and Northern Foods, 13 up at 270p. Tour group Airtours advanced 10 to 223p after announcing the purchase of the Pickfords Travel agency chain. Paper company Bunzl added 5 at 102p, aided by an agency cross by Credit Laing Lyonnaise of 2.5m shares at 101p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (127).

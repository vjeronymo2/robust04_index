			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 24 (AFP)--China sought to reassure  investors Thursday of Hong Kong's long-term stability following  the decision by the territory's oldest trading house to  discontinue its listing on the local stock exchange.    Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin also reiterated  pledges  that Beijing would not discriminate against British companies  because of a dispute over Hong Kong's electoral reform -- while  hinting that the government could not eliminate all the row's  "adverse effects" on business.    Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., which has been the target of  Beijing's wrath because of its support for Governor Chris  Patten's democratic reform package, announced Wednesday it would  leave the exchange from December 31, 1994 -- exactly 2-1/2 years  before the British colony reverts to China.    "It is a matter for Jardines to decide whether it will end  its listing on the Hong Kong market," Wu told a weekly news  briefing. "As for the future of Hong Kong and the stability and  prosperity of Hong kong, not only the Chinese side but the large  number of investors abroad are confident in this regard," he  said. "That's why so many investors have entered the Hong Kong  market."    Jardines chairman Henry Keswick said in a statement  Wednesday  the move was not related to concerns about Hong Kong's future  but to the Bermuda-registered group's failure to get exemption  from the local takeover code.    Wu reiterated Premier Li Peng's recent pledges not to block  British companies from the booming Chinese market but added that  Britain's "non-cooperative attitude" on political issues had  taken its toll on Sino-British cooperation. "The Chinese side  wishes to reduce as far as possible the adverse affects of this  issue on the conduct of business activities by British  companies," he said.    China attracted widespread criticism last month after it  warned that British interests would suffer as a result of the  Hong Kong legislature's adoption of the first part of Patten's  reform package.    Legislators are expected to adopt the second and final stage  of the reforms by mid-year, despite Beijing's vow to scrap the  changes and stage fresh elections in 1997 in accordance with its  own, as yet unspecified, criteria.</p>

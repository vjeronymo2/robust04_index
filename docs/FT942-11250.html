			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Wassall Wassall's acquisition of General Cable appears classic conglomerate strategy. As a partially demerged subsidiary of a US financial services group, General Cable has been neglected by its owners. Capital spending has been falling for three years to a level well below depreciation. An operating margin of less than 0.5 per cent last year leaves plenty of room for improvement. Since Wassall is more than doubling its turnover as a result of the deal, even modest gains in margin will have a big impact on profits. The wonder is that another conglomerate or cable industry rival had not stepped in before. With 22 US manufacturing sites to work on and a product range covering 10,000 lines, there is scope for rationalisation. That hints at sizeable fair value provisions. Though with fresh equity under its belt from yesterday's rights issue, Wassall's balance sheet is unlikely to be stretched even if goodwill write-offs result. The main worry is whether it has the management resources to swallow such a large morsel without indigestion. On the strength of its record so far, Wassall probably deserves the benefit of the doubt. Rising US construction orders may make it easier to pass on higher copper prices to customers, which would provide some breathing space. With the shares already on a heady multiple in anticipation of a deal, Wassall has its work cut out to maintain upward momentum. But its first substantial acquisition since September 1991 seems to justify the market's considerable faith.</p>

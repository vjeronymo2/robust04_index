			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Constantly Lower and Lower"] </F>   [Text] According to the Ukrainian Ministry of  Statistics the indices of our economic activity, or more  precisely, our inactivity, are going down.    Thus in the first quarter the decline of social production  accelerated in the country. The gross domestic product decreased  by comparison with the same period of last year by 34 percent  and the national income produced was down 36 percent. The volume  of production as compared with the first quarter of last year  dipped by 38 percent while labor productivity went down by 32  percent. Production cutbacks took place at up to three-fourths  of the industrial enterprises. The drop in production affected  the absolute majority of basic types of production both in  industry and agriculture.    In the first quarter of 1994 collective and interfarm  agricultural enterprises and sovkhozes produced almost a third  less meat in live weight than in the corresponding period of  last year, 21 percent fewer eggs, and the milk yield was almost  at the level of last year. Cattle and poultry breeding decreased  by 11 percent.    The building of production facilities declined. There was a  slowing down in the rates of construction of projects in the  social sphere and some 46 percent less housing was made  available than in the same period of last year.    The operation of transport deteriorated further as a result  of the decrease in production, the break in economic ties,  nonfulfillment of contractual obligation, and the shortage of  fuel: the dispatch of freight by rail was down 25 percent. The  greatest drop in shipments (more than twofold) was noted in  motor transport. The rate of decrease in passenger  transportation on the whole amounted to 18 percent.    The report of the Ministry of Statistics stresses that the  further growth of processes involving lack of balance in state  finances is also one of the manifestation of the crisis  situation in the economy of Ukraine.    The state budget of Ukraine involves a deficit of 8.6  trillion karbovantsy. The budgets of the Republic of Crimea and  of the oblasts and cities of Kiev and Sevastopol were prepared  with an insignificant excess of revenues over expenditures.    Currency emission in the first quarter of this year came to  10.8 trillion karbovantsy and increased by comparison with the  same period of last year by a factor of more than 36.    At the same time a monthly decrease in inflation was  observed  in the first quarter of 1994. In January its index amounted to  119.2 percent, in February to 112.6 percent, and in March to  105.7 percent.    During the quarter consumer prices rose overall by a factor  of 1.4 as compared with a factor of 2.7 during the same period  last year. It should be noted that in the first quarter of 1994  the rate of price increases for nonfood consumer items and paid  services for the population outstripped those for food products  by a factor of two.    A decrease in prices took place for certain groups of  foodstuffs, such as meat products, butter, eggs, and citrus  fruit. Products in mainly the fruit and vegetable group (except  citrus fruit) became more expensive.    Parenthetically it is necessary to note here that both  domestic and foreign expert economists explain the paradox of a  decrease in inflation rates by the fact that wages are not paid  the population for months at many enterprises, which further  aggravates the already extremely low purchasing power of the  citizens of Ukraine.    Among essential nonfood consumer items the prices for  children's clothing, children's shoes, books, and newspapers,  office supplies, and pharmaceutical products increased the most.    The cost of public transportation, leisure and cultural  services as well as barbering services rose the most among paid  services for population.    The situation with production of consumer goods remains  difficult. Thirty-nine percent less was produced in the first  quarter than in the first quarter of 1993. Almost three-fourths  of the enterprises cut back their output and by comparison with  the first quarter of last year the shortfall in consumer goods  amounted to 38 trillion karbovantsy. Over 45 percent of that sum  is accounted for by products of enterprises of the State  Committee on the Food and Processing Industry and the Ministry  of Agricultural Production, and almost 20 percent by those of  the State Committee for the Light and Textile Industry.    The number of those employed in all spheres of economic  activity in the first quarter remained virtually unchanged and  amounted to almost 24 million persons (without those engaged in  study while on leave from production, military personnel, and  those in housekeeping). By the beginning of January the  unemployment level in Ukraine as a whole was 0.29 percent of the  able-bodied population.    Again, let us note parenthetically that what is desired is  being depicted as reality inasmuch as that figure certainly does  not reflect the massive hidden unemployment that exists today at  hundreds of enterprises in the country.    The Ministry of Statistics notes that the crime rate  continues to rise. The number of crimes recorded by organs of  internal affairs exceeded the level reached in the same period  of 1993 by 16 percent.    Over two-thirds of all recorded crimes were against  property:  theft of state and collective property and crimes against  private property of citizens.    There was an increase in illegal foreign currency  operations.  Some 1,030 cases of illegal trade activity were revealed  exceeding the amount in the first quarter of 1993 by a factor of  3.3.    The population of Ukraine on 1 April 1994 was 52.1 million.  In the first quarter the number of deaths exceeded births by  75,000.</p>

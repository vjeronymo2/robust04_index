			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / BT pledges improved services BT yesterday promised to 'put customers first' as it announced improved service initiatives on the first anniversary of the telecommunications group's reorganisation, Michiyo Nakamoto writes. Extended opening hours, from 8am to 6pm, simplified contact numbers for inquiries and a faster, more efficient complaints-handling system are planned. BT will also guarantee prompt installation and fault repair in a customer-service guarantee programme. If it fails to install a line by the agreed date or repair a fault by the end of the next working day after it is reported, residential customers will be able to claim a month's network rental for every extra day they wait. Business customers will be able to claim Pounds 25 a day.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Observer: Cuckoo Do the Swiss have a sense of humour? Contrary to popular belief, occasional outbreaks of humour have been reported in Switzerland and the latest comes courtesy of the Hotel Schweizerhof Zuerich, one of Zurich's main business hostelries. It has started issuing foreign guests with a list of authentic Swiss jokes: 1. What fairy tale does a Swiss enjoy most? His income tax returns. 2. A Swiss who had come into money announced: 'At last I can afford champagne and caviar. All I've got to do now is learn to like them]' Nevertheless, Observer still needs to be convinced that a sense of humour has taken firm hold in Switzerland. A bottle of the finest malt for any sign of Swiss humorous life capable of withstanding publication. Samples by mail or fax to 071-873 3926 - not telephone please.</p>

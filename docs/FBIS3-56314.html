Contrary to widespread reports, he said, no agreement has so  far been reached with Minsk on how to run the budget systems, at  what rate to exchange Belarusian currency units into rubles and  how to readjust the two countries' prices.    The main sticking point is prices and fuel prices in  particular, President of the National Bank of Belarus Stanislav  Bogdankevich told Interfax. He spoke of waiting until Moscow  announced uniform prices if the money union agreement was  implemented.    Kazmin says his ministry is insisting that currencies be  stabilized and the gap in their purchasing power narrowed stage  by stage as part of implementing the multi-lateral agreement on  the new ruble zone. At present, 1 ruble fetches 4.51 Belarusian  coupons at the money market in Minsk.    The Russian official also said that the movement towards  bridging the gap between currency rates must pass through market  mechanisms which will take some time to achieve.    On financing Belarus' budget deficit, Kazmin called for  forming a consolidated joint budget and establishing a special  order to grant credits to Minsk to cover its budget deficit.  However, Minsk opposes this on the grounds it is an  encroachment on its sovereignty, preferring the deficit to be  qualified as the country's internal debt instead.    The ministry doubts that a final agreement on unifying the  monetary systems could be signed later this month despite an  earlier announcement. Kazmin says the Russian ministry wants an  early but justifiable rapprochement of the two monetary systems  and is now considering new proposals from Minsk.</p>

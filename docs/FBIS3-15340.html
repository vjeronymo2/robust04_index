He declined for the time being to disclose the names of the  companies.    The details of the lease will be worked out in the course of  the talks, Molder said, but the ministry gives top priority to  border guard and defense forces' vessels having access to the  port.    One of the two companies plans to use the port facilities  for  trade in groceries, and the range of activities proposed by the  other firm is even wider, Molder noted.    The ministry expects to wrap up the deal by March 9. The  port will be rented out for a term of three years.    The Tallinna Sadam (Port of Tallinn) company is seeking a  good business plan to develop Paldiski's South Port. It has so  far received about a dozen projects but as new plans keep coming  in the company's administrative board at its recent meeting put  off making a decision, General Director Peeter Palu said in an  earlier interview with BNS.    The South Port of Paldiski is ice-free round the year.    The projects mostly propose building an oil terminal at the  port or using it for export of timber and metal, Palu said.    Neither the Defense Ministry nor the Port of Tallinn is  prepared to consider joining the two ports, since one is  determined to keep it a naval port and the other regards it as a  commercial port.</p>

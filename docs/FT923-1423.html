			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Labour calls for banking review THE LABOUR party called for a thorough review of banking regulations yesterday once the results of the inquiries into last year's collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) are published. A 600-page US Senate report on the BCCI affair is due to be published today and is expected to be sharply critical of the role of the Bank of England. A report by Lord Bingham into whether BCCI was supervised properly by the Bank and the government is now likely to be published in the week beginning October 19, when parliament reassembles for normal sittings - well after the date originally set for publication. It, too, is expected to be critical of the Bank's performance. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is to make a statement to MPs when the report, or as much of it as possible, is published. The government has consistently said it will not make public any part of the report that might prejudice criminal trials. Yesterday's move by Labour is an attempt to ensure that even if the Treasury is not heavily censured by the Bingham report, ministers do not escape all responsibility for the affair. It also forms a further element in the opposition's attack on Mr John Major's record as chancellor before he became prime minister. Labour claims that when Mr Major answered an emergency question on the inquiry in July last year, he promised to report personally to the Commons. 'I shall publish the inquiry and then answer for it before this House,' the prime minister said then. 'Mr Major has hidden behind Mr Lamont for far too long: it is high time he learnt to carry the can. 'We will not stand for his ducking behind Mr Lamont yet again,' Mr Alistair Darling, an opposition treasury spokesman, said yesterday. He said that confidence in the UK banking system had been severely eroded. Ministers should immediately set in motion a review of the working of the Banking Act 1987, to ensure that 'regulation under the Bank is not a paper exercise but provides a guarantee of effective regulation and protection for customers and investors alike'.</p>

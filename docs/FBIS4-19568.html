			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, Apr 19 (CNA)--U.S. President Bill Clinton  has said "there is currently a window of opportunity" that  should not be allowed to close without an agreement being  reached on the U.N.-proposed confidence building measures  (CBM's) aimed at bringing the Greek and Turkish Cypriot  communities closer.    He said those measures provided real benefits to both  communities, not least of which was that they could form the  base for the two sides to resume discussions on an overall  Cyprus settlement.    This was stressed in President Clinton's report on progress  towards a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem, to the  American House of Representatives and the Senate Foreign Affairs  Committee, released yesterday.    The current report covers the remainder of November 1993,  when the previous report was submitted, through March 1, 1994.    Referring to the efforts of his administration towards this  end, President Clinton said U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator  Robert Lamb arrived in Cyprus the first day of his appointment,  underlining the U.S. Government's resolve to achieve progress on  the island.    President Clinton added Lamb had conveyed the message that  the CBM's were "a balanced, workable package for both  communities" and that the United States was prepared to work  with both communities to ensure that their concerns were  addressed satisfactorily.    He also said U.S. Assistant Secretary Stephen Oxman and the  director of the State Department Office for southern Europe,  Marshall Adair, met in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller and other Turkish officials to emphasize the importance  of moving forward on the CBM's package.    According to President Clinton, the Turkish side "pointed  out  that Turkey had spoken out in support of the secretary general's  efforts for the CBM's package, and assured Mr. Oxman of Turkey's  continued cooperation."    Clinton referred to the latest developments on the Cyprus  problem, such as the extension of the mandate of the U.N.  Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for another six months,  and the release of two studies by UN experts on the CBM's,  concluding that the implementation of the package would offer  significant benefits for the two communities.    The report reveals that during President Clinton's European  tour, he met in Brussels on January 9-11 Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou and Mrs. Ciller and told them that "we must  move forward with a fair and permanent settlement. Both leaders  assured me of their interest in finding a solution on Cyprus and  promised to work diligently toward this goal."    The report finally refers to the proximity talks opened on  February by UN Special Negotiator and former Canadian Premier  Joe Clark on the CBM's and the consultations Lamb had with  Russian and British officials in Moscow and London respectively.    Regarding Lamb's consultations in London and Britain, it  said  "these meetings with two representatives of the permanent  members of the security council once again demonstrated the  international resolve to find a fair solution to the Cyprus  problem."    Bill Clinton's report concluded pointing out that "there is  currently a window of opportunity that should not be allowed to  close without an agreement being reached on the CBM's.    ``They provide real benefits to both communities, not least  of which is that they can form the base from which the two  parties could resume discussions on an overall settlement.''    Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops  invaded and occupied 37 percent of its territory.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Juba political conference of peace forces  convened today in the town of Juba and comes as a confirmation  and reassurance of the peace process and territorial integrity  within the federal system. The conference also confirms that  the Sudanese people share a common destiny, reject violence and  fighting, and that the rebel movement still has the chance to  return to the mainstream of the homeland so that all the sons of  the homeland could embark on development and social and economic  reconstruction.</p>

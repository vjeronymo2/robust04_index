			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Eridania down despite improved sales ERIDANIA, the agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group, suffered a fall in consolidated net profits to L230bn (Dollars 176m) last year from L298bn in 1989, writes Haig Simonian. The decrease, which partly stemmed from a drop in net extraordinary items to L61bn from L150bn in 1989, came despite a 2.9 per cent increase in sales to L9,165 from L8,909. Net profits at parent company level fell to L60bn from L68bn in 1989. Eridania, which earlier this month announced a rights issue of up to L281bn, is paying an unchanged dividend of L240 for ordinary shares and L270 for savings shares. The group, which last year raised its share of national sugar production in Italy to almost 37 per cent, said dry weather conditions in Europe had combined with the Gulf crisis and the rise in the value of the dollar to make business conditions more difficult last year. However, net operating profits rose by 8.8 per cent to L594bn. The company said it expected improved results for the current year, both in terms of operating earnings and sales.</p>

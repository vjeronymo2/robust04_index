			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> President Bush tells us we need to continue massive aid to the El Salvadoran  government. Congress approves continued military aid.  </P> <P> El Salvador's President Cristiani is not able to control the atrocities  committed by members of the military.  </P> <P> He promises to bring the murders of the Jesuits to justice -- something that  has never happened in similar cases.  </P> <P> U.S. aid goes to the military which is out of the control of the country's  president. The U.S. supports atrocities committed against innocent people in El  Salvador. The U.S. violates its own stated principles of respecting basic human  rights.  </P> <P> Where's the greatness of a country that can't coherently promote its own  ideals?  </P> <P> REV. THOMAS H. RUSH, O.M.I.  </P> <P> Pacoima  </P></p>

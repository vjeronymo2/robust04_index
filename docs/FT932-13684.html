			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The people shake the pillars of state: After this week's Italian referendums, electoral reform can no longer be avoided With an apt sense of symbolism, Mario Segni, the leader of Italy's referendum movement, chose to celebrate this week's triumph of the vote for electoral reform in Rome's Piazza Navona. It was in those same magnificent, baroque surroundings that jubilant crowds toasted a plebiscite in May 1974 which introduced the controversial principle of divorce to largely Roman Catholic Italy. That was the first occasion since the second world war that the Italian public forced a reluctant political establishment to recognise a social reality, when a Christian Democrat-dominated parliament had declined to do so. Once again, with Sunday's eight referendums, the Italian people have spoken. An extra-parliamentary instrument was necessary to remind the politicians that Italy is changing and that the electorate wants a political system commensurate with such change. 'It's the victory of the Italian people, who in an overwhelming majority have today laid the foundations of the new republic,' Mr Segni told his supporters. 'Other peoples have obtained such reforms only after wars or dramatic convulsions . . . This has been achieved peacefully and with a democratic instrument.' If the people are the winners, the politicians are the losers. They have been arguing about electoral reform for more than a decade and have quite simply failed to grasp the urgent need to come up with concrete proposals. As a result of the referendum, they are now forced to adapt legislation which introduces a first-past-the-post electoral system in the Senate, the upper house. Even so, Italy may risk missing a big opportunity to overhaul the constitution if another weak government now emerges to replace that of Mr Giuliano Amato's outgoing four-party coalition. Reform could remain piecemeal, rather than tackling pivotal issues, such as the ill-defined position of the presidency, the absurd duplication of the roles of the upper and lower houses, the weak powers of the prime minister subordinate to the party leaders, and the excessive number of parliamentarians, currently 845 strong. When the legislature opened last June, electoral reform was a central item on the agenda. All parties agreed the existing system of proportional representation was to blame for encouraging small political groupings, which in turn produced unstable coalition governments. (The Amato government is the 51st since the end of the second world war.) A joint parliamentary commission was set up last autumn, on President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's insistence, to review the entire 1947 constitution. At the commission's back was the near-certainty that the proposed referendum on electoral reform of the Senate would go ahead, and be approved. Nevertheless it wasted precious time in procedural arguments, while the Christian Democrats and Socialists fought a rear-guard action to retain proportional representation and prevent the introduction of a first-past-the-post system. In January, the two parties belatedly changed course and the commission finally adopted the principle of majority voting for the bulk of the seats in both houses. But this was less out of conviction than it was a cynical calculation to avoid what would be an inevitable referendum vote being turned into a plebiscite on the government (which had happened with the June 1991 referendum abolishing the system of multi-preference votes). Since then the commission has judged it prudent to await the outcome of the referendum. This week's result has set forth two inter-related political imperatives. First, a new government has to be formed, taking account of the overwhelming vote in the eight referendums favouring political change. Second, parliament  -with 16 parties that are even more fragmented than a year ago as a result of growing internal contradictions and the shocks caused by the continuing wave of corruption scandals - has to forge a consensus on electoral reform. Such reform is a pre-condition for fresh elections, which are essential to provide legitimacy to parliament. Only a new parliament can take account of both fast-changing political alliances and the public's desire to see the back of a political class thoroughly discredited by corruption scandals. In the past 10 months the current parliament has received 302 requests to waive immunity of legislators under investigation on various charges, mostly related to corruption. Only a new parliament can have the moral standing to take measures to deal with the very real problems created by the hundreds of prosecutions which threaten to clog the courts for the next decade. The choice of the next prime minister and the composition of the government depend in good measure on how the party leaders judge the referendum. Does it mark the beginning of a wholly new era or is it the final phase of the first republic? On balance they are likely to accept that the transition is still in progress. Despite the changes of the past year, including the rebuff to the long-ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists in the April general elections and the convulsions caused by the corruption scandals, the process will only be complete after fresh elections. This means that the life of the next government will be as short as is practical to produce new electoral laws. It must have sufficient weight to chivvy parliament, and possess the technical competence to manage an economy still in recession. It must also deal with the worrying overshoot in government borrowing requirements as well as sustain the momentum of the privatisation programme. The state of the country is such as to make it difficult to postpone elections beyond the autumn, after the political feeler of partial municipal elections due in June. But producing electoral reform may take longer - even the referendum movement is divided over what form of majority voting is best. The parties are also bereft of funds to fight an election this year; one of the weekend referendums abolished state funding of parties. Against this backdrop, Mr Segni, who emerged victorious in the referendum fight, has obvious credentials to be the next premier. Having courageously split with the Christian Democrats after 16 years, he is a new face and, at 53, represents a younger generation of political leadership. But he has no organised party, and may seek a longer period for the current legislature. He also could lose standing during the difficult transition process. It may therefore be more practical to choose either an independent figure, with experience of parliament, or someone with a known track record who can find a parliamentary base broader than the current four-party coalition. In these circumstances, Mr Amato, who has performed an extraordinary act of survival while preparing the way for economic reform, may yet have a role to play. But Mr Amato, or any other prospective candidate in tandem with President Scalfaro, must convince new allies to come on board. The Lombard League, the one new significant force in parliament, accounting for a third of the vote in the north, would be a sufficient ally to give credibility to a coalition centred on the old four parties. But Mr Umberto Bossi, the Lombard leader, is wary of such a commitment. So too are other potential allies, such as the Republicans. The underlying problem behind the absence of national unity in this crisis can be found in the respective attitudes of a dispirited Christian Democratic party (which is considering changing its name to the Popular European party) and the communists, metamorphosised into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) under Mr Achille Occhetto. Italian politics since the second world war has been conditioned by their mutual antagonism. Even now, the Christian Democrats are traumatised by the suggestion that Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the former communist leader of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament, might be chosen as an above-party figure to head a transitional government. Equally, the PDS is shackled by the psychology of an opposition party, and is reticent about supporting any government, essentially for fear of being associated with a discredited political class. For an effective solution, the political parties must recognise that they are no longer playing a game of musical chairs in which no one ever pulls away a chair. The electorate and the investigating magistrates have already removed several. If the politicians do not realise this soon, Italy faces a dangerous vacuum of authority, which is precisely what all the politicians say they wish to avoid.</p>

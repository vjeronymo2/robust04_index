			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MULRONEY FACING CRISIS OVER QUEBEC, AIDE'S RESIGNATION  </P> <P> Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was embroiled in the worst crisis of his six  years in power Tuesday after his top Quebec minister resigned in a dispute over  French-speaking Quebec's future in Canada.  </P> <P> Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard, who was the leader of Mulroney's pivotal  Quebec caucus, quit the Cabinet on Monday after sending a telegram hailing this  week's 10th anniversary of Quebec's separatist referendum.  </P> <P> Bouchard said he quit because attempts to re-negotiate the Meech Lake Accord  bringing Quebec into the constitution were an insult and humiliating to his  province.  </P> <P> Last week, Francois Gerin resigned in protest over the constitutional impasse  and predicted that others in the 61-member Quebec caucus would follow.  Mulroney's Conservatives now hold 164 seats in the 295-seat House of Commons.  </P> <P> Bouchard, along with other Quebec members, are angry over the process to bring  their province into Canada's 1982 constitution.  </P> <P> Mulroney forged the so-called Meech Lake accord in 1987 to amend the  constitution and recognize Quebec as a "distinct society." However, the deal  appears to be dying as three of the 10 provinces refuse to ratify it by the  June 23 deadline unless there are changes.  </P> <P> Among other things, they are worried that Quebec is being given too much power  at the expense of other regions.  </P> <P> Mulroney now has to contain a potential rebellion within his government that  threatens not only to derail his constitutional plans but also to seriously  destabilize his government.  </P></p>

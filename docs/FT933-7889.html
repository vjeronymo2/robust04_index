			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Japan shies away from interest rate cut THE Bank of Japan has no plans to cut the official discount rate, despite the yen's sharp rise against the dollar, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank's governor, said yesterday. 'The mechanism for economic recovery is in place,' Mr Mieno said. The Bank did not consider that the Japanese economy had hit bottom yet, Mr Mieno said, but neither did it see any grounds to change its view that the economy would pick up in the latter half of the fiscal year. While consumer spending and private capital investment remained sluggish, recent progress in stock adjustment and past fiscal and monetary measures were providing the fundamental conditions for recovery, he said. Mr Mieno's remarks came amid widespread expectations of an easing of monetary policy to stimulate Japan's still weak domestic economy and help curb the recent sharp rise of the yen. The currency's movement has been largely attributed to speculation on the markets that the US sees a higher yen as a means of reducing Japan's trade surplus. The yen took a breather on the markets yesterday, trading in a narrow range between Y101.32 and Y101.70 against the dollar, as market traders waited for further developments to give them direction. Its future movements will depend largely on what, if any, specific measures the Japanese government comes up with today, at the emergency meeting of ministers, to address the country's high surplus. Businesses and economists alike have been calling for a substantial reduction in the discount rate to provide a psychological boost to corporations, help stimluate the domestic economy and send a clear sign to the currency markets that Japan is serious about tackling its huge trade surplus. Although Mr Mieno expressed strong displeasure with the current speed of the yen's rise, which was 'excessive' and would have an adverse effect on Japan's economy, the best way to tackle the surplus was to get the economy back on the road to growth by taking dramatic steps to open and deregulate Japan's markets, he said. Deregulation, which is an issue the coalition government is keen to address, was important not just to help imports enter the country but to increase investment in Japan, he said.</p>

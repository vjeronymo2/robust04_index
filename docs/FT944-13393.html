			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Optimism about EU poll helps Swedish krona The Swedish krona was the main mover on the foreign exchanges yesterday as the currency continued to benefit on optimism about a positive vote next month to join the European Union, writes Philip Gawith. The krona was also helped by details of a planned fiscal austerity programme to deal with the country's large budget deficit. The currency rose as high as SKr4.71, from Tuesday's close of SKr4.728, before giving up some ground to finish at SKr4.723. In quiet trading conditions, the dollar moved in a fairly narrow range, untroubled by the day's data releases. It closed in London at DM1.4953 , from DM1.492, and at Y97.035, from Y96.86. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.5 from 80.7. The Bank of Portugal trimmed two money market rates, cutting its regular rate for draining funds to 8.5 per cent, from 8.75 per cent, and its average repo rate to 8.875 per cent from 9 per cent. The escudo closed unchanged against the D-Mark at Es102.1. In Greece the interest rate on 12 month treasury bills fell by 50 basis points to 19 per cent. The rate on three and six month bills was cut by 150 basis points to 16.5 per cent and 17.5 per cent respectively. Although the latest opinion polls show sentiment towards the EU to be evenly balanced in Sweden, markets have priced in a pro-EU vote at the November 13 referendum. Also supporting the currency is the new government's apparent commitment to reduce the budget deficit. The most recent development was the call by Mr Goran Persson, the new social democrat finance minister, for all government departments to cut spending by 20 per cent. The government is also committed to cutting SKr150bn off the deficit by 1998, though there is some scepticism about whether lower interest rates and higher employment provide a plausible basis for expecting the deficit to fall. The prime minister, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, is also on the record saying that if the Swedes do not vote yes at the referendum, then even greater policy cuts will be required. Other Nordic currencies were also firmer on the back of the krona, with the Finnish markka touching a high of FM3.025 to the D-Mark. The Bundesbank council meets today for the first time since the German elections, amid conflicting views on the policy outlook. Official rates were last moved on May 11, while the repo rate has been at 4.85 per cent since July 27. A Reuters poll found that of 20 economists surveyed, only three of the nine still forecasting further monetary easing expect this in 1994. On Tuesday economists at six leading institutes said there should be no more major reductions in official rates. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Kidder Peabody in London, said there was a reasonable prospect of the Bundesbank announcing a further fixed repo, but trimming the rate by, say, five basis points. She said month-end volatility made a variable repo unlikely, as this could result in rates being bid up, confounding the signals the bank may want to send. But yesterday evening, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank deputy president, fanned speculation about a variable tender. He said: 'One should not rashly conclude that any switch in the form of the tender means a change in the line on interest rates.' The dollar had a steady day, but sentiment remains resolutely negative. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, commented: 'DM1.50 is now turning out to be a resistance level, rather than a support level.' Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg, provided a counsel of despair, saying: 'The dollar (is) now equally vulnerable to strong and weak economic data.' He said strong data would fuel fears of higher rates, adding to concerns that the Fed had tightened policy too little, too late, while weaker data would reinforce the view that the Fed would delay a further tightening. Mr Magnus concluded: 'The dollar will be vulnerable either until confidence that inflation will be kept under control is restored or until the currency forces the authorities' hand.' The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.35bn shortage in UK money markets at established rates. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 and 5 per cent, and three month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 per cent.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Housing activity declines in US Home building activity fell in the US last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, showing that rising interest rates were starting to damp the housing market even before this week's Federal Reserve decision to raise short-term rates by  3/4 of a percentage point. Privately owned housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42m in October, the Commerce Department said, 5 per cent below September's revised rate of 1.5m and only fractionally above the rate in October last year. The drop was created by a 7 per cent fall in the number of single family homes started to an annual rate of 1.14m in October. The number of new building permits issued also fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4m, 2 per cent lower than in September but still 8 per cent higher than in October a year ago.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / People: Morley and the trainers At 63, Peter Morley, the new chairman of the National Council of Industry Training Organisations admits to having been a workaholic for more than 40 years. NCITO is the umbrella body which represents the views of more than 100 Industry Training Organisations to government and other agencies. ITOs are the independent voluntary bodies which are responsible for promoting good training within most industrial sectors. Morley says he aims to build on the work of his predecessors and to raise the profile of NCITO. Since his retirement towards the end of last year after 27 years with Tesco, where he was group personnel director, he has been occupied six days a week. As well as being a magistrate and sitting on industrial tribunals, he is chairman of the National Retail Training Council and the British Association of Commercial and Industrial Education in addition to enjoying a variety of hobbies. His business baptism gave him a taste for overwork. At 22 he suddenly found himself, through death in the family, in charge of two furniture shops. It was not a job for which two years of national service had prepared him. However, he ran the business successfully for 11 years and then sold it to Tesco. He regrets not going on to higher education and becoming his own boss before he had worked for anyone else. He says it is not a career path he would recommend.</p>

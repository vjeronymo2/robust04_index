			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The right time for vegetables - Cookery This week's snow was, in some ways, a happy reminder that February is winter  -or can be. In recent years, we seem to have had no winters to speak of. No summers, either. The fresh produce in our shops seems similarly unseasonal and ever more uniform. A few years ago, I lamented the sight of brussels sprouts on sale in time for the August bank holiday, and strawberries the week before Christmas. Now, there is hardly a week when strawberries, blueberries, asparagus and mangetout are not to be found in our shops. On the other hand, winter vegetables such as parsnips, Savoy cabbage and curly kale are difficult to find. If you share my old-fashioned notion that there is a proper time and place for everything, including winter vegetables in winter, then ask, ask and ask again. Do not take no for an answer . . . BRUSSELS WITH FUSILI To serve 2-4 people depending on the rest of the meal Choose 10oz of the firmest, smallest sprouts you can find. Slice each of them thinly three or four times from crown to stalk end and steam them over a pan of fast-boiling, well-salted water in which 7oz dried fusili are cooking. Drain both ingredients when ready and toss them together in melted butter until gleaming. Season with salt, pepper, freshly-grated nutmeg and two or three spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese. Serve with more Parmesan on the side. LEEK PUREE . . . Wash and chop enough leeks to yield 1 1/2 lb of edible vegetable (tender green parts as well as white). Cook them in fast-boiling salted water until perfectly tender - al dente is inappropriate here. Drain the leeks none too assiduously and add them to a food processor in which you have chopped some parsley already. Add salt, pepper, nutmeg and 2oz diced butter and whizz until smooth. The lime green colour of this puree might cause alarm, but the taste - buttery, yet fresh - is delicious, making it a fine partner for a joint of boiled or baked gammon. . . . IN CHEESE TARTS For more chi-chi presentation, the freshly-made leek puree can be spooned into hot, fully-blind, baked cheese pastry cases and topped with an extra grating of farm-made Cheddar. To make enough intensely-flavoured cheese pastry to line up to 15 three-inch muffin tins, you will need 3oz wholewheat flour, 3oz white household flour, 3oz butter, 3oz grated richly-flavoured farm Cheddar, and 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon well-salted water. Chill the pastry before rolling it out and chill it again in the tins before baking. SPICED CARROTS For a dish with medieval undertones, first soften a small, finely-chopped onion in a large lump of butter. Stir in a minimum of half a dozen cloves, 2-3in of cinnamon stick and a scant 1 sp cumin seeds, all well bruised. After a couple of minutes, add 1lb thickly-sliced carrots and pour on enough water to come nearly level with the top of them. Add the juice and zest of an orange and a good pinch of sugar. Boil without a lid, stirring often, for about seven minutes until the vegetables are tender and bathed lightly in syrup. (If the liquid evaporates too fast, cover the pan and cook very gently until the vegetables are done to your liking. Or, if the carrots are ready before the liquid is syrupy, lift them out of the pan and fast-boil the liquor to reduce it.) Check seasoning, adding pepper, sugar and ground cinnamon or cloves to taste. Cover the pan and set it aside until the vegetables are tepid before scattering with split and toasted almonds and serving</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Singer] </F>   [Text] A master plan to set up a dense settlement bloc,  which would make Jerusalem the center of a built-up area from  Ma'ale Adumim in the east to the 'Etzyon Bloc in the south, is  currently in the process of being approved.    The main effort is focused on linking Ma'ale Adumim and  Jerusalem in order to create a single populated bloc. The  Ministries of Defense, Interior, Construction and Housing, and  Industry and Trade are behind the plan. It was approved by the  Civil Administration's Supreme Planning Council after receiving  the approval of the committee dealing with exceptional cases,  headed by Noah Kinarti, the defense minister's assistant on  settlement matters.    If implemented, the plan will be the first stage in the  establishment of a new settlement bloc to be called the Adumim  Bloc. It will include the town of Ma'ale Adumim, Kfar Adumim,  Mitzpe Yeriho, and Qedar. Under the plan, the bloc will be  linked to Jerusalem through uninterrupted construction along the  new highway linking Ma'ale Adumim with the capital. After  completion the distance between Ma'ale Adumim's municipal  boundary and that of Jerusalem (the Pisgat Ze'ev neighborhood)  will be some 400 meters, which means that in fact it will be a  single bloc.    The planned construction will include housing, hotels, and  commercial building over an area of some 5,000 dunams. It will  come under Ma'ale Adumim's jurisdiction, along the highway to  Jerusalem, where there are no Arab villages, except for  (al-Zayyam) -- which under the plan will remain outside the area  of construction.    The Ma'ale Adumim Municipality wants to extend the plan  eastward toward Mitzpe Yeriho and the other Jewish settlements  in the area, but it does not have the backing of the relevant  government ministries for that.    According to Ma'ale Adumim Mayor Beni Kasri'el, the plan has  the blessing and support of Ministers 'Uzi Bar'am and Binyamin  Ben- Eli'ezer and the support of "the government's and Labor's  right-wing flank," in addition to that of leading opposition  Knesset members.    At the same time, a similar plan is being prepared for the  'Etzyon Bloc, linking it to the Green Line through the  establishment of new settlements. In the first stage, a new  settlement will be set up near the 'Adulam Bloc and the  paramilitary outpost of Giv'ot, located between the 'Etzyon Bloc  and the settlement of Betar 'Elit, which will be civilianized.    The 'Etzyon Bloc plan, prepared with the Jewish Agency's  Settlement Department, has already been presented to Minister  Shim'on Shetrit, and according to regional council head Shilo  Gal has already received his blessing. It will be presented to  the construction minister later in the month.    The plan is based on the idea of setting up territorial  contiguity between the bloc and the Greater Jerusalem area by  building on state lands in areas not populated by Arab  settlements.    North of Jerusalem, a plan to expand the municipal area of  Giv'at Ze'ev up to the Ramot neighborhood in north Jerusalem is  in advanced stages of being approved. Giv'at Ze'ev's current  municipal area stretches to the foothills of al-Nabi Samu'il, a  distance of only 150 meters -- as the crow flies -- from  Jerusalem's boundary, but privately-owned Arab land stand in the  way of the planners.</p>

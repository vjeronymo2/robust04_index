			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Migraine costs at more than Pounds 600m WORKERS who suffer from migraines cost their employers between Pounds 611m and Pounds 741m a year in lost working time and reduced productivity, according to research led by Dr Roger Cull, a consultant neurologist at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. There are an estimated 3.5m adult migraine sufferers in the UK, of whom about 2.3m are in work. The cost to the National Health Service of dealing with migraine is relatively small - between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a year, says the Office of Health Economics. The study of the cost to employers, published in the British Journal of Medical Economics, found male sufferers lost an average of 5.6 working days because of attacks. That comprised 1.5 complete days off work and the equivalent of 4.1 days lost through reduced efficiency. Female sufferers lost an average of 6.7 days.

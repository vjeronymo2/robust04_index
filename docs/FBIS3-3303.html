			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gong Xin (7895 2450): "The Ministry of Public </F> Security Issues a Circular on China's Criminal Cases in 1993"]    [Text] A spokesman of the Ministry of Public Security has  revealed that, in 1993, the Chinese public security organs  handled 1.617 million criminal cases and cracked 1.212 million  which occurred in the same year, up by 2.2 and 12.3 percent over  the 1992 figure. Meanwhile, over 290,000 cases which had  occurred before 1993 were also solved in that year. This serves  to show that the public security organs have enhanced their  case-cracking capacity and have increased the intensity of their  struggle against crimes.    Among the 1.61 million criminal cases handled by public  security organs across the country in 1993, 539,000 were major  and serious ones, representing an 18-percent increase over 1992.  Of all the major and serious cases, 302,000 robbery cases  involved an amount of 2,000 yuan and above, a 20.2-percent  increase over the 1992 figure and accounting for 60 percent of  all major cases. Moreover, a 23.4- percent increase has been  registered in the number of major criminal cases cracked by  public security organs which occurred in the same year, bringing  the number up to 370,000.    The spokesman has also pointed out that the present security  situation remains grim in a handful of cities and counties,  where murders, robberies, and "highway and railway lootings" are  happening all the time. The masses in those areas have  vehemently condemned the practice. In view of such a situation,  the Ministry of Public Security has called on public security  organs in all localities to strike more relentless blows at  crime and pay special attention to rectifying the social order  of problem-ridden areas.</p>

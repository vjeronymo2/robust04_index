			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Aircraft crash kills 47 A military transport aircraft crashed yesterday morning in Siberia, killing all 47 passengers, in Russia's third aviation disaster this year. The crash, which brings the death toll in Russian skies this year to 270, offered a bleak rebuttal to assertions by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday that Russian aircraft are as safe as western ones. The Antonov-12 transporter crashed while coming to land at the Boda military airport near the Chinese border. This year's other two big crashes were of civilian aircraft, but yesterday's accident suggests that safety and maintenance standards have also plummeted in the traditionally more elite world of military aviation.</p>

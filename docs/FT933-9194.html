			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Valleys welcome falls on deaf ears MANY ENGLISH company executives remain unconvinced by male-voice choirs pledging a warm welcome in the hillsides and valleys of Wales. A survey of 500 company directors based in the south of England shows that more than a third believe that the Welsh are anything but welcoming to people moving in from over the border. The survey, by Cardiff-based SRD Consultants, suggests that while south Wales has been successful in attracting inward investment from overseas it has yet to convince many 'foreigners' closer to home to set up shop in the principality. A quarter of English company executives said that their children would be disadvantaged by being brought up in Wales. More than half said the range of facilities available to families were below the standards in England. 'It is just such considerations that could lead to Wales losing its competitive edge in company relocation and new investment decisions,' said Mr John Smith, former Labour MP for Vale of Glamorgan, and campaign manager for Gwent Image, a partnership between the public and private sectors. Gwent Image is dedicated to sweeping away the old image of coal-black terraces and endless tips and promoting a more positive, modern image. He said that although many English businesspeople had crossed the border and happily settled, perceptions of remoteness, run-down industries and unfriendly communities prevented many others from joining them. Mr Smith added: 'We are making great strides in remedying the first two factors. People are beginning to appreciate that industrial sites have been cleaned up and that south Wales is just across the Severn Bridge. 'But we have to work on convincing potential business investors that the Welsh are friendly and welcoming.' Gwent is about to begin a promotional campaign aimed at attracting investment. More than 1m letters will be sent to potential immigrants. It could be an uphill struggle - 42 per cent of businesspeople surveyed did not even know where Gwent is.</p>

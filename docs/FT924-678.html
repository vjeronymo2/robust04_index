			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Italy cuts discount rate again: Amato rules out early return to ERM THE Bank of Italy yesterday announced a cut of one percentage point in the discount rate, from 13 per cent to 12 per cent, writes Robert Graham in Rome. It is the third reduction since the rate was raised to 15 per cent to protect the lira in September. The new rate, effective from today, is now back to that of December 23 last year. The Bank of Italy has been under pressure to cut interest rates to force the banks to lower lending rates to industry, increasingly hard hit by recession and high debts. With growth projected optimistically in 1993 at 0.8 per cent, industry fears 1993 will be the bleakest year for more than a decade. The three cuts in the discount rate would have been impossible if the lira had not been in free float since its devaluation and withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Yesterday Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, ruled out a return of the lira to the ERM early in 1993. He said it was unrealistic to expect the lira to re-enter the ERM while currency markets remained unstable. Although no timetable was fixed, officials had initially indicated a return to the ERM would be possible by year's end.</p>

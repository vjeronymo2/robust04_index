			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian coal industry faces 'critical year' - Efforts to raise productivity and improve labour relations Mr Bob Humphris, the chairman of the Australian Coal Association, describes this as 'a critical year' for the world's largest coal exporter. The industry, long hampered by poor labour relations and low productivity, is trying to shake off the past and protect its share of the booming Pacific rim coal market. In the next few weeks, a joint government-industry-labour council will receive the report of Mr Rae Taylor, a former civil servant who has been studying the impediments to the growth of the Australian coal industry, and particularly to its exports. He is expected to highlight high production costs, poor labour relations, and other obstacles such as the government monopoly of the railway system. The employers and mine owners hope that this report will finally clear the way for the industry after years of labour confrontation. In their submission to the inquiry, they said: 'Coal industry management has been trying for years now to break out of these inherited shackles and attitudes, and to transform the industry into one more befitting the competitive environment of the 1990s'. The submission pointed out that Canada and the US had higher productivity rates for thermal coal than Australia, and were raising it at a faster pace. At the same time, new producers are entering the market, notably Indonesia whose most expensive mines are lower cost than Australia's cheapest. In coking coal, Australia has a stronger position, but the submission warned: 'The North Americans are achieving big gains in productivity, and are in the market looking to expand tonnage substantially'. The labour organisations, not surprisingly, dispute these claims. The mineworkers union blames the Australian industry's high costs on poor management, and its low profitability on the failure of company negotiators to obtain the best prices for coal, particularly from the Japanese. Earlier this year, a dispute on this issue led to walk-outs by miners, and unions are threatening further disruptions in the latest round of price negotiations. Whatever Mr Taylor has to say, however, important changes are already afoot. In a major departure, the special labour tribunal which has existed for the coal industry since the last war, is due to be linked to the mainstream industrial relations tribunal next July. The old tribunal, from which there was no appeal, was widely seen as an encouragement to mineworkers to consider themselves 'special'. Nor is the sense of crisis which the coal owners seem keen to foster reflected closer to the ground. Last year, the industry produced a record 180m tonnes, and exports, at 132m tonnes, were also the highest ever. That made coal the largest single contributor to Australia's foreign earnings with nearly Dollars A8bn (Pounds 3.89bn). The coal industry also has some major expansion plans afoot. Shell, the third largest producer after BHP and CRA, is heading a consortium including Japan's Marubeni and Showa that is investing Dollars 270m in a new underground mine at Dartbrook in the Hunter Valley. The mine will produce about 3.5m tonnes a year, largely for export to foreign electricity utilities, beginning in 1996. Shell stresses, however, that heavy investment in Dartbrook is only possible because it has a very thick seam (an average 3.8m) capable of being mined with the most modern high-capacity, longwall equipment. 'Margins in coal mining are slim, making investment in new mines difficult unless you have super geology. We have that at Dartbrook,' says Mr Gordon Summers, Shell's general manager for coal. The mine is also strategically located on the railway connected to the modern coal loading terminal at Newcastle, about 200km north of Sydney. The government of New South Wales recently agreed to open the line to competition from private hauliers, a move which it estimated would save coal producers Dollars 1.80 to Dollars 1.90 a tonne. Shell is considering two further major investments in Queensland, for which the final go ahead is unlikely to be given until after the Taylor report has come out. One is Moranbah, a coking coal mine with a 3m tonnes a year capacity, where an investment of Dollars 270m is foreseen. If work started in early 1996, it would be producing in 1999. The second is Theodore, which would export 4m tonnes of thermal coal. Ironically, some of the new investment may have been triggered by the uncertainty surrounding the future of the industry. If big changes are indeed on the way, they should create new opportunities for those who can seize them. Mr Humphris says; 'Before, we all travelled at same rate because of the restrictions on the industry. Now, the smarter companies are going to do better'. But there is also a sense that prices are recovering from a three-year slump, which took them down by 20 per cent or more, and that long term demand prospects are good in the region. Large purchasers like Japan and Korea see demand growing, and new customers such as Thailand and India are stirring. According to Mr Humphris, there is no 'Euro-style swing away from coal' in the Far East and Asia. Were it not for concerns about 'greenhouse' gases and the environment, he believes that coal would be 'on the verge of most exciting expansion in history'.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: Discord in the regions - It will be a miracle if there is not a high profile orchestral casualty The Arts Council yesterday refused to help out the hard-pressed regional orchestras, and returned the ball of inadequate funding of the arts firmly into the government's court. Secretary-general Anthony Everitt said 'if we had the resources we'd help, but we don't'. Last November the government, through the Department of National Heritage, took a hard line with the Council, and the arts, and reduced its grant by Pounds 3.2m for 1994-95. The Council is getting its revenge by refusing to put together rescue packages when arts organisations face financial crisis. The latest potential victim is one of the best respected arts groups in the country, Simon Rattle's City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. It has a deficit of Pounds 250,000 and at one time Rattle threatened to quit as conductor unless more money was forthcoming. Birmingham City Council, a stalwart supporter of the arts, came up with Pounds 125,000 for each of the next two years and Rattle agreed to stay for an extra year, until 1997. But Birmingham expected a matching sum from the Arts Council. In the old days this would have been forthcoming, but not now. Richard York of the CBSO said yesterday 'the City has staved off the awful day, but by the autumn we will be in severe difficulties.' Everitt estimates that by March 1995 the five regional orchestras - the CBSO, the Halle, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Bournemouth Orchestras, and the Northern Sinfonia - will have between them an accumulated deficit of at least Pounds 1.5m. An Arts Council working group says, rather tortuously, 'we cannot absolutely guarantee that none of the orchestras will consider liquidation within the coming year'. Another victim yesterday was the RPO, which received a minimum Pounds 300,000 grant for its regional work based in Nottingham. The RPO has had its subsidy for 1994-95 reduced by Pounds 100,000, or 25 per cent. There is a feeling that the Arts Council would not be too unhappy if a major client went belly up: it would prove its point that with box office revenue down as well as sponsorship and local authority support, it was madness for Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke to cut its grant. Earlier this week the much respected boss of Welsh National Opera, Matthew Epstein, quit, saying he could not carry on in a financial climate which forced him to cut staff and productions rather than plan an ambitious programme. All the major national arts companies are coping with either accumulated or annual deficits, and usually both, and it will be a miracle if there is not a high profile casualty among arts organisations during the year. The Arts Council does not anticipate a public change of heart by the government and a sudden influx of new cash but it hopes the parlous state of the arts will force the announcement in the autumn of a substantial rise in subsidy for 1995-96.</p>

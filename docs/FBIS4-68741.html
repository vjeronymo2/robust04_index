			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Economists Promise Production </F> Upturn, But in 1996"]    [Text] At the traditional Thursday briefing at the Working  Center for Economic Reform, journalists met with two "retired  members" -- Professor Richard Layard of the London School of  Economics, a former adviser to the Russian Government, and  Andrey Illarionov, former leader of the Russian Federation  premier's Analysis and Planning Group.    Richard Layard dwelt in detail on the problem of the decline  in production. The professor claims that it is wrong to view  the recession in industry -- which in the first quarter of 1994  was 24.9 percent of the first quarter of 1993 -- in isolation  from similar indicators in other spheres. Thus, construction  volumes during this period fell by 24 percent; production  volumes in agriculture fell by 5.5 percent; market services fell  by 15 percent; and nonmarket services (services whose prices are  state-regulated) fell by 4 percent.    In all, the national product in the first quarter of 1994  was  17 percent down on the first quarter of 1993. This means that  consumption also fell by 17 percent on average.    Admittedly, the question arises of just how accurate these  figures are. In general it has to be said that our country has  never had access to reliable information that would allow us to  calculate the volume of production accurately. In the era of  general socialist competition it was advantageous to distort  figures. Now, in the era of universal struggle against the tax  inspectorate, it is advantageous, on the contrary, to play down  output volumes. Moreover, the huge amount of all possible kinds  of small producers -- private plots and small-scale cottage and  collective labor -- are not officially registered at all. So we  have to content ourselves with the figures we have.    Incidentally, Richard Layard and his colleagues attempted to  get out of the situation as follows. In calculating GDP levels,  they took account of Russian citizens' income indicators.  Figures from the State Committee for Statistics were used. As  were the results of a survey of cottage industries which this  organization carried out using methodology recognized around the  world.    Incidentally, research has shown that working people's real  consumption in Russia increased by 21 percent from the first  quarter of 1993 through the first quarter of 1994. Consumption  by pensioners increased by 11 percent.    The overall 17-percent drop in consumption is due to the  fact  that spending on arms purchases and investment is considerably  down. And although the London professor sees this trend as  undoubtedly negative and a result of inflation, he sees the fall  in arms spending as an indicator of the restructuring of the  economy.    How long could the recession continue? Discussing this  subject, Richard Layard cited the following figures. GDP in  Russia has fallen by 50 percent since 1989. The comparable  indicator in Poland and Hungary is around 20 percent. In  Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania it is around 40 percent.  Russia's isolation, in Mr. Layard's opinion, is due to the  military-industrial complex' greater share of the economy and to  the collapse of the USSR.    The likeliest extent of the further decline in GDP, in the  professor's opinion, is another 10 percent. GDP growth usually  comes through two to four years after reforms begin. But  Russia, Mr. Layard believes, has already gone halfway and can  expect its upturn in 1996. Provided, of course, that the  authorities create certain economic prerequisites. Above all in  the financial sphere -- in the fight against inflation.    But Andrey Illarionov, who spoke next, noted that the  achievements have so far been slight. In particular,  Chernomyrdin's main adviser sharply criticized the budget  discussed by the Duma. First, its revenue. In 1993 revenue  came to 10.6 percent of GDP. In 1994 the Finance Ministry is  planning for 17.1 percent -- proving that growth is entirely  possible, since the methods used to calculate revenue have  changed.    But, Illarionov noted, average revenue levels have come to  just 8.3 percent of GDP in the first three months of 1994. And  the deficit is 9.2 percent. Yet the deficit in the first three  months of 1992-1993 was either no more than 1 percent, or there  was no deficit at all. And in some months there was even a  surplus -- budget indicators are traditionally good at the start  of the year.    The expenditure side is also bad, in Illarionov's opinion.  According to the budget, expenditure over the year should be 27  percent of GDP. But expenditure is already nudging 17 percent  after the first three months.    Andrey Illarionov insists that the government has not made a  single reformist decision in the first three months of the year.    At the same time, Illarionov noted, many other decisions  have  been made. And, alongside such well-known decisions as the  conclusion of the agreement with Belorussia [Belarus] and the  introduction of import tariffs and a state monopoly on the  production and sale of alcoholic drinks, there was the  little-known Russian Federation Government directive of 28  February 1994 on the presentation to the U.S. and Spanish  peoples of two statues to mark the anniversary of the discovery  of America -- the "Birth of the New World" and the "Birth of the  New Man."    Admittedly the works of art will be produced on site, and  therefore the Russian Government is so far only presenting the  aforesaid peoples with construction materials. But what a lot  of materials! Some 60 carloads of cement, 80 carloads of  fittings, 66 carloads of steel, 11 carloads of glass, and 170  carloads of copper (or 10 percent of Russia's entire copper  exports in 1993) will be exported duty-free.    These large amounts of construction materials are intended  for the creation of just one sculpture.</p>

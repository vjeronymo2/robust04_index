The news analyst says:    We can get along with or without talks with the United  States. We are not afraid of any kind of "sanctions."    Grave obstacles have cropped up in the process of a peaceful  settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the  atmosphere of confrontation is getting more acute in this part  of the world. This is entirely because the United States  reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S.  contact in New York and is pursuing the purpose of stifling the  DPRK.    The United States announced later than the agreed date that  it would suspend the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in  1994 and open the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks on March 21.  Worse still, when we accepted the inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for the continuity of  safeguards and the working-level contact for the exchange of  presidential envoys between the North and the South was resumed,  the United States set such unreasonable preconditions as  "satisfactory inspection by the IAEA" and "realisation of the  exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South"  which are not specified in the agreed conclusions. This was  obviously a wanton violation of the New York agreement.    In raising the unreasonable preconditions, the United States  sought to avoid implementing the New York agreement and,  further, break up the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    It intends to isolate and stifle the DPRK with the nuclear  issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an expedient.    After reversing the New York agreement, the United States  openly revealed its intention to resume the Team Spirit  exercises in 1994 and manipulated the dishonest quarters of the  IAEA Secretariat to adopt an unjust "resolution" against the  DPRK and demand a reinspection.    The United States has taken the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK  to the United Nations Security Council in an attempt to  intimidate it.    On the other hand, it is making a military threat to the  DPRK  by moving aircraft carriers and naval fleets close to the Korean  peninsula and deciding to deploy Patriot missile units in South  Korea.    The situation on the Korean peninsula is getting more grave  hourly due to the United States and the South Korean puppets.    We will not allow ourselves to be a victim of the strong-arm  policy and pressure of the United States, nor will we tolerate  infringement on the dignity and sovereignty of the nation in any  circumstance.    The United States must clearly know what the DPRK's position  to carry into practice the measures proclaimed in the DPRK  Government's statement of March 12 last year in face of its  strong-arm policy and pressure means and what the consequences  will be.    We do not like an empty talk, and we mean what we say.    We are prepared to cope with any event.    Those who attempt to solve the problem through a strong arm  and pressure must know that they will not be safe, either.</p>

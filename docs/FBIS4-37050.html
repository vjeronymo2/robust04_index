			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by T.V. Venkatachalam] </F>   [Text] India's policy of developing nuclear energy for  purely peaceful purposes remains without any change. When the  prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, in his address at the  All-India Congress Committee [AICC] session a few days ago ruled  out India unilaterally giving up the nuclear option, he was only  restating the existing policy. The reiteration of the policy,  however, is important because of pressures coming from two  contrary directions.    On the one hand, the weapon-possessing members of the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], particularly the United States,  want India to join the NPT, renouncing the right to make the  nuclear weapons forever. Their conception of a strange club in  which the haves and have-nots ever remain separate is, of  course, not acceptable to India. The NPT is due to come up for  review next year. If and when the review takes place, India's  attempt will be to make the treaty a nondiscriminatory  instrument to promote global nuclear disarmament.    The other source of pressure on our nuclear policy is from  developments in the neighborhood. Pakistan has not made a  secret of its efforts to acquire the nuclear weapon. In fact,  this development is made use of by the United States as an  argument to persuade India into giving up its option to use  nuclear energy for defense purposes. By coincidence, about the  time of the AICC session came also the news of China having  carried out another nuclear test. The NPT does not come in the  way of the five weapon haves, who are permanent members of the  UN Security Council, from adding to their nuclear arsenals. It  is not surprising that the disturbing international environment  should persuade even sections within the country to demand a  change of the policy of purely peaceful use of nuclear energy.    The prime minister's statement indicated that the government  will not give in to such demands. The prime minister underlined  the fact that the country has been having a consistent policy on  the nuclear issue. The first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru,  and defense minister, Mr. V.K. Krishnamenon, had clearly stated  this policy at a Congress session in 1953, much before India  carried out the implosion experiments. This policy remains  valid.    The prime minister made it clear that the government would  watch the trends and developments on global disarmament in  exercising its options. He said, quote: We have the choice of  making or not making the bomb. I do not want to leave that  option. Unquote. In this connection, it should be noted that  the nuclear situation today is complex. While some countries  are in possession of the nuclear bomb, some others are in the  process of acquiring it. But a large number of countries do not  have any nuclear capability at all. The developing global trend  has to be watched. To those who advocate the manufacture of the  nuclear weapon, Mr. Rao aptly replied that if we make the bomb  and the world tomorrow decides in favor of total disarmament,  then what will we do?    The thrust of India's international policy is to promote  disarmament and outlaw the use of nuclear weapons by all  nations. India had put forward concrete suggestions for nuclear  disarmament at the special session of the United Nations General  Assembly in 1988. The stage-by-stage disarmament proposal  presented to the UN by Rajiv Gandhi called for the conclusion of  a new global treaty, eliminating all nuclear weapons by the year  2010 to replace the NPT. Even by the end of the first stage in  1994, much more was expected of the nuclear weapon powers in the  sphere of disarmament than what has been achieved so far.    Mr. Narasimha Rao had followed it up with the demand for  urgent measures to spread nuclear nonproliferation at the  Security Council summit held in 1992. The conference of  Nonaligned foreign ministers at their meeting in Cairo recently,  acting on a proposal made by India, called for a special session  of the UN General Assembly for a comprehensive assessment on the  progress toward disarmament. The directions of India's policies  are clear. We are for peace and we cannot accept nuclear  subservience.</p>

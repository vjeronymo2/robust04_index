			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Germany plods on to interestrate cuts THE Bundesbank will soon be turning into the home straight and on the way to the finishing line and the long-awaited prize of interest rate cuts. But the track is uneven and littered with hurdles, and Germany's central bank can be relied on to complete the course at its customary cautious pace rather than dash for home. The run-in, according to most German economists, will take up to three months. It is now more a matter of 'when' than 'if', says UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which expects rate reductions at the end of March at the earliest. The bank's verbal intervention in support of the French franc yesterday, in a joint declaration of solidarity with the Bank of France and the German and French governments, successfully drove off the speculators. There were some who found within its nine lines hints that the Bundesbank was prepared to go as far as cutting rates to help protect the franc. But according to Frankfurt stock exchange traders they were mostly foreigners, chasing 'phantoms' and pushing the DAX index up 25 points to 1,556.42 as they went. The declaration was read in Germany as nothing more than an affirmation that verbal and market support would continue. Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said it was now up to the Bundesbank to reduce rates, a move which would also help the domestic economy. But the bank was in a dilemma: it could make cuts with a clear conscience only when the government made a credible effort to reduce Germany's steadily rising budget deficit, he said. Interest rate policy will not be eased until Chancellor Helmut Kohl delivers his solidarity package of pledges from government, opposition, employers and unions on pay and public spending restraints. Talks are currently deadlocked over Mr Kohl's insistence that social and welfare budgets must be squeezed. Other substantial obstacles include inflation, stuck at almost 4 per cent. While the Bundesbank wants to see the rate of price increases heading down towards 2 per cent, it is expected to surge this month to above 4 per cent. Rate-watchers believe the impending bout of pay negotiations with the public service unions will provide a key indicator. If negotiators can deliver a quick and modest settlement, the more hopes will rise for the solidarity pact, for lower inflation and, in turn, monetary easing from the Bundesbank. Rapid money supply growth, another source of inflation according to the Bundesbank, also stands in the way of rapid action on rates. But here observers see some grounds for optimism. While recent rates of expansion in the key M3 measure have been around 9 per cent and wildly out of line with Bundesbank targets, economists calculate that growth rates could fall sharply this month, even down to the 6.5 per cent upper target range set for this year. They argue that the economy is now slowing so dramatically that demand for credit will collapse. In that case, and if the other hurdles are overcome, the way will be clear for timely rate cuts. Timely not for France or other EC neighbours, but for the German economy itself, which in March is expected to complete its fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth.</p>

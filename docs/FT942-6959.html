			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Storehouse High profile management changes at Storehouse have done no service to the company's share price. This year it has merely level-pegged the sector, despite the group's evident recovery prospects. The new management needs a period of stability to deliver the growth of which BHS in particular ought to be capable. Yesterday's annual results provide a reasonable starting point even if a lower rental charge flattered BHS's profits by about Pounds 6m. Group profit before exceptional items was up by 48 per cent. Mothercare is recovering nicely, though there is still plenty of room for higher margins. While rivals such as Burton are grappling with the consequences of extravagant expansion in the 1980's, Storehouse has the room and the resources to expand the BHS chain. It is both under-represented in British shopping centres compared with Marks &amp; Spencer and generates about half the revenue per square foot. Progress admittedly may be slow. Only three new store openings are planned this year but higher volume should add to the benefit of much needed group-wide purchasing efficiencies. The tricky part lies in developing an image of BHS as a store shoppers visit for more than just casual purchases. That will require marketing flair as well as disciplined management. If Storehouse can achieve that, it would deserve to out-perform.</p>

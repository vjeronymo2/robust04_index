			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND VOTING  </P> <P> German voters went to the polls on Dec. 2 and 78% of 59.9 million eligible  voters (reportedly the lowest turnout since 1949) cast their ballots.  </P> <P> Isn't it about time that we Americans are allowed to vote on a Saturday or  Sunday also? Our low voter turnout is a national disgrace and embarrassment.  </P> <P> And while we are in the mood for a change, let's also have door-to-door voter  registration like they do in Canada. People who are registered are much more  likely to vote.  </P> <P> Expect much opposition and howls of rage from our current power structure,  however, if ordinary Americans try to change the current comfy  vote-on-a-weekday arrangement, which makes it very difficult for long-distance  commuters and working couples to get to the polls.  </P> <P> Our ruling class is quite happy to govern without the consent of a large  percentage of the governed.  </P> <P> MAUREEN MADDEN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

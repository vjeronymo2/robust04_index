			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLI 'SINGER' SAYS ARISTA KNEW ABOUT ALBUM HOAX;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: MILLI VANILLI PERFORMER AND FORMER MANAGER CLAIM THE RECORD COMPANY  WAS AWARE BEFORE THE GRAMMYS THAT DUO DIDN'T SING ON RECORD.  </P> <P> Officials of Arista Records knew that pop duo Milli Vanilli's Rob Pilatus and  Fab Morvan did not sing on their 7 million-selling "Girl You Know It's True"  album before the duo won the 1989 Grammy Award for best new artist of the year,  a group member and a former manager said Friday.  </P> <P> The allegations contradict claims made by a spokesman for the record company  earlier, after record producer Frank Farian and Pilatus admitted the performers  did not sing on the album.  </P> <P> If Arista officials were aware that Pilatus and Morvan didn't sing, then the  company may have purposely misrepresented the album in its marketing and  advertising to the public, as well as to the National Academy of Recording Arts  and Sciences, the recording industry organization that awards the Grammys. The  allegations made Friday also raise questions about the role of Arista President  Clive Davis and leading Hollywood talent manager Sandy Gallin in what has  become the first major challenge to the integrity of the Grammy awards  selection process.  </P> <P> Because Pilatus and Morvan are wrongly listed on the album credits as its  vocalists, the pair could lose their Grammy award, a first in the 33-year  history of the recording industry award. They won their award during a  nationally televised program from the Shrine Auditorium in February.  </P> <P> "We told Clive Davis. We told Sandy Gallin. We told everybody six months before  the Grammy awards," Pilatus told The Times on Friday. Pilatus and Morvan plan  to release written material that Pilatus says substantiates the claim at a news  conference next week.  </P> <P> "Everybody who worked closely with Rob and Fab at Arista knew what was going  on," said Todd Headlee, who represented Milli Vanilli from August, 1989, to  August, 1990. "That's why they always tried so desperately to insulate the guys  from the press. Sandy Gallin and Clive Davis did not even want Rob and Fab to  appear on the Grammy broadcast."  </P> <P> Headlee, who handled the Milli Vanilli account for the management firm Gallin  Morey Associates claims Pilatus and Morvan were pawns in an elaborate corporate  marketing scheme, approved by top officials at Arista, a New York-based label  owned by the European conglomerate Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG).  </P> <P> Farian, the German studio whiz who produced the album and is the owner of the  Milli Vanilli moniker, denied Wednesday that top officials at the labels had  any knowledge of the lip-syncing. Farian said he recorded the album in Munich,  and it was released by Arista in the United States.  </P> <P> Arista president Davis did not return numerous phone calls Thursday and Friday.  Roy Lott, executive vice president of Arista, denied the charges in a phone  interview Thursday.  </P> <P> "There is no way that anyone ever could have known whether they sang or not,"  Lott said. "We are merely a distributor of their records. Rob and Fab and Frank  assured us that they sang on the record."  </P> <P> Efforts to contact Gallin were unsuccessful on Friday.  </P> <P> "I find it very irresponsible that the record companies continue to deny  knowing about all this," Headlee said. "As hard as Rob and Fab worked to meet  their obligations to these corporations which were raking in millions off the  concept. For them to leave them out to dry when the truth hits the fan is  reprehensible."  </P> <P> Pilatus and Morvan released a statement Thursday backing up Headlee's claims.  </P> <P> "We have strongly expressed to Frank Farian and to our record labels, Arista  Records and BMG Records, our reluctance to participate in any kind of  misrepresentation," Pilatus and Morvan said. "Through a variety of coercive  maneuvers, our wishes to creatively participate in our recordings have been  denied."  </P> <P> Headlee claims that the duo was manipulated into participating in the lip-sync  plan because they were promised the opportunity to sing on tour and upcoming  projects, a promise that he said Farian didn't follow through on.  </P> <P> Headlee, who is writing a book about his year with Milli Vanilli, said record  company officials and other associates of the duo were concerned about their  appearance on the Grammy show, where they lip-synced to a recording of one of  their songs.  </P> <P> "Everyone at Arista who worked closely with the group was walking on eggshells  before the Grammy lip-sync performance last February," Headlee said. "When they  walked off the stage clutching the trophy, I remember thinking to myself that  they may not have deserved the Grammy for their performance, but they sure as  hell did deserve an Oscar."  </P></p>

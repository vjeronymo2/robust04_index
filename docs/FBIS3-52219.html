This was  stated by Foreign Secretary Mr. Shaharyar M. Khan while talking  to newsmen at Islamabad Airport after the departure of the  Indian foreign secretary.    [Begin Khan recording] We shall not schedule any talks,  either at the foreign secretary level or at any other level,  until there is a visible improvement of the situation in  Indian-held Kashmir.    Pakistan maintained its principled position that a solution  to the Kashmir issue lay in a plebiscite on the basis of UN  resolutions.    For Pakistan, the people of Kashmir are the central players,  because it is they who must determine their future.    We believe that everyone concerned -- the Security Council,  India, Pakistan, we have all agreed to a method, a format for  ascertaining the wishes of the Kashmiri people and that is in a  plebiscite. [end recording]    Earlier, addressing a joint press conference at the airport  before his departure, the Indian foreign secretary said we have  met after such a long time and have addressed the specific  question of Jammu and Kashmir.    Mr. Shaharyar M. Khan said that it was the first time that  both sides agreed to discuss the question of Kashmir  meaningfully and purposefully. Both the foreign secretaries  agreed that the Kashmiris are central to the problem and they  would be taken into confidence for the resolution of the Kashmir  problem.    In a joint statement issued in Islamabad today at the end of  the two-day talks, Pakistan and India reiterated the need to  engage in a meaningful dialogue with a view of addressing all  the outstanding problems, including Jammu and Kashmir. The  statement said the talks addressed all aspects of Jammu and  Kashmir problem, and both sides recognized that there are basic  divergences. It was agreed that sincere efforts would be made  to resolve the problem. The statement said the two sides will  consult each other on the question of further talks at the  foreign secretary level or any other level.    At the conclusion of the third round of talks between  Pakistan and India, the Indian delegation led by the foreign  secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, called on the foreign minister,  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, at the Foreign Office. Other members of  the Indian delegation also attended the meeting. Foreign  Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan and other members of the Pakistan  delegation were also present during the meeting.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP: U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> HOLTZ MAKES WEST PAY PRICE FOR PENALTIES  </P> <P> Eric Holtz of Simi Valley said it was mere coincidence that, on his birthday,  he scored three times to account for the South's only goals.  </P> <P>  Right.  </P> <P>  The South got four opportunities to score on penalty shots in the last minutes  of its 3-2 victory over the West on Friday in U. S. Olympic Festival field  hockey action at Augsburg College's Nelson Anderson Field.  </P> <P> Guess who attempted them all?  </P> <P> What a coincidence!  </P> <P> The last one, from 10 yards, came with 10 seconds left in the game and eluded  West goalie Robbie Ryan.  </P> <P> With that, the celebration was on. Holtz first was mobbed by teammates, then  presented with a birthday cake.  </P> <P> There was plenty to celebrate.  </P> <P> The South, composed of 15 members of the U. S. national team -- including nine  from the Valley area -- finished round-robin play with a 5-1 record. It will  face the East (4-1-1) in the gold-medal game Sunday.  </P> <P> The West, which is 1-3-2 and will play for a bronze medal, scored its only two  goals in the game's first 13 minutes.  </P> <P> Sammy Hoang of Westlake Village scored 11 minutes into the game and, two  minutes later, younger brother Binh duplicated the feat.  </P> <P> Each of Holtz's goals came off a penalty corner, which is essentially a free  shot on goal from any place more than 10 yards away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TABLE TENNIS  </P> <P> The team of Lan Vuong of Reseda and Scott Butler of Iowa City, Iowa, lost in  the gold-medal match of the mixed doubles competition, falling to Sean O'Neill  of McLean, Va., and Li Ai of Colorado Springs, Colo., 9-21, 21-18, 21-18. But  Vuong and Butler captured the silver medal for their efforts.  </P> <P> Jim Butler of Iowa City and Carol Davidson of North Hollywood fell in the  quarterfinals, losing to Brandon Olson of Hopkins, Minn., and Takako Trenholme  of Minneapolis, 21-17, 21-14.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Gold is the goal for Coley Kyman and Ken Lynch, North team members from Cal  State Northridge.  </P> <P> The North routed the East, 15-5, 15-11, 15-10 at Williams Arena on Friday to  clinch a spot in Sunday's gold-medal game.  </P> <P> Kyman, from Reseda, and Lynch, from Malibu, had nine and three kills,  respectively.  </P> <P> Stanford's Duncan Blackman led the North with 16 kills and a .461 hitting  percentage, same as Kyman's.  </P> <P> The South, led by John Ross of Canoga Park, also advanced to the championship  match with a 9-15, 15-4, 11-15, 15-7, 15-12 win over the West. Ross has 16  kills, eight digs, eight block assists and a .500 attacking percentage.  </P> <P> Gary Reznick of Cal State Northridge had 62 assists and a match-high 12 digs  for the West.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRACK  </P> <P> Percy Knox is best known as a long jumper, but he earned a silver medal as a  sprinter in the 4 X 100-meter relay.  </P> <P> Knox, from Lancaster, teamed with Mark Olivier of Mesa, Ariz., Bryan  Bridgewater of Los Angeles and Jeff Williams of Montrose to place second with a  time of 38.83.  </P> <P> The South team of Henry Neal (Dallas), Lee McNeill (Lumberton, N.C.), Antonio  Smith (Wichita, Kan.) and Kenny Brokenburr (Winterhaven, Fla.) won the race in  38.79.  </P> <P> In women's competition, Victoria Herazo of Newhall was fourth in the  10-kilometer walk with a time of 49 minutes, 26.95 seconds. Debbie Lawrence of  Kenosha, Wis., broke her national record in winning the race in 46:10.26.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TEAM HANDBALL  </P> <P> The West team broke into the win column, 20-16, over the South as Denny Fercho  of Camarillo scored twice.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiza Kowalska: "Walesa Against Orders Issued </F> to Defense Ministry; President's Motion to Constitutional  Tribunal"]    [Text]The president has filed a law suit with the  Constitutional Tribunal regarding part of the budget law. A  controversial provision of the law orders the defense minister  to purchase "Iryda" aircraft from the Mielec Transportation  Equipment Plant [WSK Mielec]. This is the first time that Lech  Walesa has filed a motion to examine the legality of a law that  he had signed before.    Lech Walesa has addressed the Constitutional Tribunal to  examine the legality of Article 36 of the budget law which  orders the defense minister to purchase 3.7 trillion zlotys'  worth of arms equipment produced in Poland, including 300  billion zlotys' worth of "Iryda" aircraft manufactured at WSK  Mielec.    According to the president, in imposing the obligation, the  parliament interfered with the powers of the executive branch  (the government), and it also breached the constitutional  principle of separation of powers.    In addressing the tribunal, Walesa fulfilled a request by  Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk who even prior to the  budget enactment, had made a strongly-worded protest against  Article 36. As far back as April, Kolodziejczyk assured  journalists that the president had promised him to file a suit  over this form of the budget law.    "It is a precedent that is unacceptable for legal reasons  and  for reasons of substance. If the minister is to bear  constitutional responsibility for the Armed Forces' readiness,  then one must not tie his hands with decisions on how he should  spend money," the National Defense Ministry [MON] chief told  ZYCIE WARSZAWY yesterday.    Sejm imposed the purchase of "Iryda's" from the WSK Mielec  on  Kolodziejczyk, on a motion of some Sejm deputies -- mainly from  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] -- who are associated with  the domestic arms industry.    "By devoting the money to buy the `Iryda's,' the parliament  made a decision to defend the Polish arms industry," says SLD's  Stanislaw Janas who is one of the Sejm deputies. "But that does  not mean that we ordered the minister to spend all the money for  domestically- produced equipment. The MON budget amounts to  almost 48 trillion zlotys, so if the minister wants to spend the  remainder of the money abroad, he can do that at any time."    We found out only yesterday about the president's motion to  the Constitutional Tribunal, but it was submitted there on 24  May which is over three weeks ago. Lech Falandysz, deputy chief  of the President's Office, told ZYCIE WARSZAWY: "From a  populist standpoint, the meaning of the motion is unfavorable to  the president as he is taking a chance on being disliked by the  WSK Mielec workforce. We were hesitant for a while on whether  or not to file the motion, but in the end, the president said he  had promised before to file it, so that is what he did."    This was the first time that Lech Walesa addressed the  Constitutional Tribunal to examine the legality of a law already  in force (which means it must have been signed by him). Thus  far, when the president has been very unhappy about a law, he  vetoed it first.</p>

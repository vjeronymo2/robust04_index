			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF / ANDY RIVERA;  </P> <P> STRANGE PLANS A MAJOR EFFORT TO WIN BRITISH OPEN  </P> <P> Curtis Strange, who became the first golfer in nearly four decades to win  consecutive U.S. Open championships, has his sights set on another major -- the  British Open.  </P> <P> "I'm thinking more and more about the British Open," he said of the tournament  that starts Thursday in Scotland. "This year I really want to do well. Last  year I was a little overwhelmed, then shot 79 in the first round.  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to it and the PGA. I have a lot better attitude. I'm more  fired up."  </P> <P> Although Strange has not won any of the other majors -- the British Open, the  Masters, or the PGA Championship -- he does not consider it impossible to win  more than one a year.  </P> <P> "But as far as winning all four majors in a year, I don't think it is possible,  especially when a guy can't dominate our tour," he said. "Sure, if a Jack  Nicklaus came out, it could be possible. It was always possible when he was  playing."  </P> <P> After the British Open, Strange will team with Greg Norman in next month's  $750,000 Fred Meyer Challenge, a charity team tournament in Portland, Ore.,  Aug. 21-22.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, Jerry Pate, Mark Wiebe and Miller Barber are among the confirmed  entrants in the 13th annual Jerry Ford Invitational tournament.  </P> <P> The pro-am tournament will be played July 31-Aug. 1 on two courses -- Vail Golf  Club and the Country Club of the Rockies at Arrowhead.  </P> <P> Among the celebrities assembled by the former President will be Bob Hope, Clint  Eastwood, Dinah Shore, Michael Jordan, Burt Lancaster, Robert Wagner and Julius  Erving.  </P> <P> Other pros who are committed to play include Scott Hoch, defending champion  Gary Hallberg, Andy North, Calvin Peete, Mike Reid, Dale Douglass and J.C.  Snead. PGA commissioner Deane Beman also is scheduled to play.  </P> <P> Frank Thomas, technical director of the U.S. Golf Assn., believes that  long-shafted putters should be banned, according to the August edition of Golf  Digest.  </P> <P> USGA officials would not comment officially, but the legality of the club was  on the agenda of the last USGA executive committee meeting, and could be  resolved at the next meeting in August.  </P> <P> The Fujitsu National Team Championship Series is about to become the largest  amateur golf tournament in the United States.  </P> <P> More than 1,500 golf clubs around the country are holding qualifying rounds for  this two-person, best-ball event. With these numbers, it is probable that more  than 50,000 golfers will make it the largest event in golf history.  </P> <P> Mancil Davis, current world record holder for the most holes-in-one by a  professional, got his 49th ace in the Boy Scouts of America annual golf outing  at Las Colinas, Tex. Davis, who posted the hole-in-one on May 31, had a 2  1/2-year dry spell between aces, his last one coming on September 22,1986. Art  Wall Jr. has 45.  </P> <P> Wilshire Country Club pro Rick Reilly, son of American PGA President Patrick J.  Reilly, and three of his assistants (Laurie Sneddin, Jeff Puchalski, and Ken  White) played 166 holes over a period of 15 hours as part of the PGA's 38th  National Golf Day charity program.  </P> <P> The group collected $24,500, the largest sum raised by a single course in the  history of the program. Pledges are made by country club members based on the  number of holes played and birdies made during the marathon.  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia leads the point standings for the Ryder Cup Team after the  Greater Hartford Open with a score of 742.5, followed by Curtis Strange at  666.25. Others include Chip Beck, 643; Tom Kite, 587.5; Paul Azinger, 512.5;  Fred Couples, 473.542; Ken Green, 465; Payne Stewart, 450; Mark McCumber,  419.167, and Mark O'Meara, 412.5.  </P> <P> Ten of the Ryder Cup Team positions are reserved for the the players with the  most points accumulated through the 1989 PGA championships in August. The 1989  PGA champion, if eligible, is also an automatic team member. Team captain  Raymond Floyd will select the final member, as well as a replacement for the  PGA champion if he is ineligible or among those in the top 10.  </P> <P> A celebrity tournament to benefit the "Adopt-a Senior" home delivery meal  project will be held Friday, Aug. 4 at Griffith Park. The deadline for entry is  July 17, with a fee of $75.  </P> <P> The Optimist Junior World Golf Championship will be held at four locations in  the San Diego area, beginning with opening ceremonies today at 4:30 p.m. Torrey  Pines, Balboa Park, Singing Hills, and Presidio Hills will all play host to the  tournament, which attracts more than 750 entries from 33 countries.  </P> <P> Former Bruin Duffy Waldorf leads the tour in driving distance through the  Greater Hartford Open with an average of 278.1 yards, while Lee Trevino leads  in putting accuracy with an average of 1.714 putts per hole. Other statistical  leaders are Tom Kite, scoring (69.46); Bruce Lietzke, greens in regulation  (.716); Lon Hinkle, eagles (11); Fred Couples, birdies (292); and Calvin Peete,  driving accuracy (.881).  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Kinnock signals readiness to boost public spending LABOUR looks set to target new spending in next Tuesday's 'shadow budget' at a boost in capital expenditure on hospitals and schools, along with steps to encourage private finance for the railways. The hint on how Labour might reallocate the Pounds 1.8bn spent by the Tories in Budget tax cuts came in Mr Neil Kinnock's speech to the Scottish Labour party in Edinburgh yesterday. So far, Labour has kept silent as to what it might do with the Pounds 1.8bn 'windfall' due from its promise to reverse the government's decision to raise the public-sector borrowing requirement for a new 20p tax band. But it has made clear that the money will be spent on new projects leading to fierce speculation as to where the funds might go. The party's published Pounds 4.4bn economic programme is already funded by increases in taxes on the higher paid and the removal of the National Insurance contribution ceiling on upper band taxpayers. This money will go on increased pensions and child benefit and on Labour's Pounds 1.1bn industrial recovery programme. But in his speech Mr Kinnock suggested that the 'windfall' finance arising from the tax cuts has been set aside exclusively for education and health - Labour's 'winning' election issues. Mr Kinnock said: 'We will take a lead by investing in capital works for the health service, the education service and for house building to stimulate the construction and building supply industries.' He went on to add that Labour would also get private finance into public railway projects to provide orders for engineering industries. However, the Labour leader made clear that the number of projects that could benefit from new cash would be limited. 'It is not an exhaustive list,' he said. His comments conform with Labour's commitments to concentrate government spending on capital schemes rather than social security where it can be accused of squandering money on consumer spending. Its central criticism of the Tories' tax cutting budget has centred on the waste of 'borrowing for consumption' rather than investment. Generalised tax cuts will merely increasing imports at a time when efforts should be targetted at employment-intensive sectors such as construction, Labour says. In another key passage in his speech Mr Kinnock steered a careful path in tackling the controversial debate over Scotland's future. Attacking the Nationalists and Tories as 'separatists and centralists', he said that Labour's plans for an elected parliament would fulfil Labour's 'constitutional contract' with Scotland and maintain the union.</p>

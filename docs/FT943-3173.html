			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's slow track President Clinton's troubles are coming in battalions. Now he has had to abandon his request to attach a 'fast-track' authority to the passage of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. This setback is not without advantages. But the disadvantages outweigh them, since the US capacity to enter serious new trade negotiations has probably been crippled. The purpose of a fast-track authority is to ensure that Congress will vote on the results of a negotiation as a whole. In the absence of such an authority, US partners believe negotiations are likely to prove fruitless, since their results are exposed to the death of a thousand amendments. True, the US has entered trade negotiations without such an authority in the past. But the current resurgence of protectionist sentiment makes that course riskier for its partners and less rewarding to itself than during the early years of the Uruguay Round. In any case, nothing much happened in the Uruguay Round either until a fast-track authority was granted. The reason Mr Clinton has been forced to drop the request, which had been attached to the Uruguay Round package, says much about why it was important. His administration and, indeed, most Democrats regard the incorporation of labour and environmental standards in further trade negotiations as essential, while Republicans regard their inclusion as anathema. The result of the conflict was a stalemate not just on fast track, but on passage of the round itself. Rightly, the administration decided that the round was the first priority. Ratification should now proceed apace, which ought to shame laggards elsewhere, not least the European Union. It is also difficult to weep tears for the lack of an obligation to negotiate on labour and environmental standards. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, will still be able to raise these topics in negotiations. But he will, fortunately, be unable to tell his counterparts that they must give the US something in these areas to meet conditions set by Congress. The prior question, however, is whether there will be any negotiations. The Clinton administration's intention to pursue trade negotiations actively within the Americas and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum has been derailed. The president has a summit with the former grouping in Miami in December, and with the latter grouping in Jakarta in November. What can he now bring them? It may, in fact, prove impossible for the administration to impart momentum to any trade negotiations for the balance of its term. But what does not go forward may well go backwards. That is still more likely when many of the new Congressmen are likely to incline towards protectionism. It is good news that the US should soon write finis to the long effort to negotiate the Uruguay Round. But that is the past. The future of trade policy is now shrouded in doubt.</p>

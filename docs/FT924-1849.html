			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Council challenges government on contracting out ONE OF England's smallest local authorities is seeking judicial review of a government order requiring it to put its refuse collection contract out to tender for a second time. After a complaint from a company wishing to bid, the Environment Department instructed Oswestry Council in Shropshire to re-tender. It said, the council had wrongly included a clause in the tender binding contractors to maintain the 17 employees' terms and conditions. Mr Brian Catton, Oswestry's deputy chief executive and solicitor, said: 'I believe we had to do so because of doubt over whether or not the 1981 transfer-of-undertakings regulations apply. If the regulations apply, then any redundancy payments we made would have been ultra vires. 'I've had no end of inquiries from local authorities up and down the country about our position.' The troubles afflicting Oswestry - combined with further difficulties for Dyfed County Council in Wales - highlight the growing confusion over whether employees' terms and conditions must be respected when services are put out to compulsory competitive tendering. Oswestry's decision to challenge the government is based on advice that the 1981 regulations enshrining the European Community's 1977 Acquired Rights Directive in British law may apply to councils. That would make them vulnerable to legal action, particularly from employees made redundant as a result of a contract going outside. Dyfed last month awarded its cleaning contract to Initial Cleaning Services and Office Cleaning Services. The contracts were due to start on New Year's day. When Dyfed issued redundancy notices to its 950 cleaners, Nupe, their union, launched industrial tribunal proceedings on grounds of unfair dismissal. That was based on the council's failure to provide information as required under the 1981 regulations. Acting on counsel's advice, Mr David Irving, the county secretary and solicitor, put the contractors 'on notice' about the Nupe claims. Both companies, acting on their own advice, said they believed the regulations did not apply, but asked the county council to indemnify them in case they did. 'We could not possibly write that kind of blank cheque, so had to withdraw the contract,' Mr Irving said. Dyfed now plans to reinstate the cleaners, and re-tender its contract with a transfer-of-undertakings clause - making it liable to government action similar to that meted out to Oswestry. At least one of the contractors is considering taking Dyfed to court. Ms Libby Glare-Williams, Initial Cleaning Services' company secretary, said yesterday: 'We will have to take decisions on a case-by-case basis in the future. We work on close margins and do not price on the basis of undertakings being transferred. Nobody is quite sure what the position is at the moment.' Mr Roy Williams, assistant secretary at the Association of County Councils, said local-authority associations were seeking a 'clear legal ruling' on the position. 'Our view is that local authorities should be free to take decisions without fear of action as in the case of Oswestry.' The dispute will move to the Commons next month, when MPs will debate clause 26 of the Employment Bill. Companies and council associations say the clause, which removes the exemption of undertakings 'not in the nature of a commercial venture' from the 1981 regulations, will confuse the position further. The government says 'as a general rule' competitive tendering should be unaffected by either clause 26 or recent court cases.</p>

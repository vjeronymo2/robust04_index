			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Hata sets up party to take on LDP MR Tsutomu Hata, Japan's former finance minister, yesterday launched a new political party which will mount the most serious challenge faced by the ruling Liberal Democratic party since it came to power 38 years ago. Mr Hata and 43 fellow renegades from the LDP launched the Shinseito or Rejuvenation party with the aim of forming a coalition with the opposition parties to dislodge the LDP in a general election on July 18. Mr Hata said his party would try to form the core of an anti-LDP coalition which would reform the political system to rid it of corruption and equip Japan to play a more active role in international affairs. He said: 'Our party was born to expedite a new wind, a new voice and a new system.' The main opposition parties were welcoming. Mr Sadao Yamahana, chairman of the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition group, said he wanted 'extensive talks with the Shinseito to seek a unified policy approach'. Mr Koshiro Ishida, chairman of the Komeito clean government party, said there was common ground on which the opposition could collaborate. The LDP will seek to divide the potential coalition partners, but its leadership appears ineffective in the face of the mounting revolt. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the beleaguered prime minister, merely said he doubted whether such a coalition was wise. The opposition groups are expected to open talks soon on an electoral pact to minimise competition among them which could split the opposition vote and benefit the LDP. Mr Hata and Social Democratic party leaders dismissed as irrelevant their differences on foreign and defence policy, particularly Japan's security treaty with the US, which the Socialists are formally opposed to. These differences will complicate the task of constructing a stable coalition. The election was called after the Hata group's rebellion led to the government's defeat last Friday in a no-confidence motion over its failure to enact political reforms. The Hata group resigned from the LDP on Tuesday, the day after the desertion of a separate group of 10 members. Business leaders, who traditionally back the LDP, nevertheless gave Mr Hata's group a guarded welcome, reflecting their belief that political reform is overdue. However a poll of business executives published in the Nikkei financial newspaper found a large majority expected the political turmoil would hinder Japan's recovery from its long economic downturn.</p>

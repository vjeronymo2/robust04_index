			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Dow expects 1993 charge DOW Chemical of the US expects to take a one-time after-tax charge of between Dollars 650m and Dollars 950m in the first quarter of 1993 as a result of changes in accounting standards, Reuter reports. The US Financial Accounting Standards Board mandated a change in the accrual method of accounting for retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits effective after December 15 1992. Dow also said that it expected challenging economic conditions to continue in 1992, but the company should see a resumption in growth from 1991 levels, when Dow Chemical's net earnings fell 32 per cent to Dollars 3.46 a share. Monsanto, another US chemical group, also expects to adopt in 1993 an accounting change covering healthcare and life insurance benefits for retirees, and estimates its liability will be about Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.2bn before tax. It has not yet decided whether to take the expense as a one-time charge against earnings or spread it over a 20-year period.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Grace Jones, the Jamaican singer-actress known for her striking crew-cut hair  and disco-style singing, has been charged in Jamaica with possession of  cocaine, authorities said Monday. Jones, 37, was scheduled to appear in a  magistrates' court in Kingston to answer the charges. A police spokesman said  an undisclosed amount of cocaine was found in Jones' purse, wrapped in Jamaican  two-dollar notes, during a search early Sunday of the home she shares with her  boyfriend, singer-songwriter Chris Stanley. Although known primarily as a  singer, Jones has also acted in such films as "Conan the Barbarian," "Vamp,"  and Roger Moore's last James Bond movie, "A View to a Kill." Claudia Puig  </P></p>

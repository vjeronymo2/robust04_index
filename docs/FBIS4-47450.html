The  approach revolved around a multiple-parameter recording method  that entailed recording seven behavioral indicators and  processing them by using original mathematical programs based on  pattern recognition theory and data analysis theory. The  proposed systems approach to evaluating the effects of  psychotropic agents on the training process called for recording  the following behavioral indicators: number of correct  responses, their latent period, number of responses to pain  stimuli, speed of response to them, number of interstimulus  responses, number of nonpurposive responses, and amount of time  for which the animal was able to maintain itself on the  crossbar. These seven indicators were analyzed in strict  accordance with the animals' two possible states (response to  light and failure to respond). After primary data processing,  the seven series of starting indicators were transformed into 20  derivative indicators associated with the response and failure  to respond to light. Those data were then transformed into a  three-dimensional matrix of indicators. The matrix was analyzed  to develop a set of 8-10 diagnostically significant symptoms  that were then used to characterize the animals' training curve  based on N time points. The proposed systems analysis method was  used to examine the effect of daily injections of  D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [D-9-THC] in a dose of 2 mg/kg on  animals' ability to learn a conditioned response to light. The  behavior of the animals receiving the D-9-THC injections was  compared with that of animals that received daily injections of  a physiological solution. The animals in the first experiments  performed established that daily injections of D-9-THC improved  study animals' ability to execute conditioned responses and  lengthened the latent period of their conditioned response, did  not change their latent period of response to pain stimuli, did  not change the length of time for which the animals were able to  remain on the crossbar, and increased the number of  interstimulus reactions and nonpurposive reactions. The ability  to execute the conditioned response improved gradually in both  groups of animals; however, the behavioral strategies used by  the animals in the two groups differed. The animals that  received the D-9-THC appeared to rely less on information stored  in their long-term memory, and the role of the emotional  component in their decision-making process increased slightly as  compared with that in the control animals.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Describe the potential for electric shock to vehicle occupants and rescue teams as a result of an EV crash or rollover. How could electric shock be incurred by each? What technologies and designs are being incorporated by EV manufacturers to minimize or eliminate such hazard? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. Describe the potential for electric shock to trained service personnel and ``do-it-yourself'' persons while performing EV repair and maintenance. How could electric shock be incurred by each? What technologies, designs, instructions or labeling are being incorporated by EV manufacturers and converters to minimize or eliminate such hazard? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. Provide the minimum levels of electric shock to the human body in terms of current, time, and voltage (up to 600 volts), which can produce injuries and fatalities. Describe the types of injuries that can be incurred, along with the corresponding levels of current, time, and voltage. Can such injuries be related to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for automotive medicine? What levels and time periods can cause fatal injury? Do these vary based on whether the current is AC or DC, or on the age, weight, and general health of the person? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. Describe the potential for an electrical fire as a result of an EV crash or rollover. How could an electrical fire occur? Is it possible for a high power electrical connector or conductor onboard the EV to become short circuited to another object, become overheated, and thereby cause a fire? What is the likelihood of this? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. Describe all incidents of electric shock to occupants or rescue teams as a result of an EV crash or rollover or noncrash event, or to persons performing EV repair or maintenance. Include a description of the circumstances, the vehicles and persons involved, and what type and severity of injury or fatality that occurred due to electric shock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. Discuss the need for federal vehicle regulation to address electric shock hazard as a result of an EV crash or rollover, noncrash event, or during EV repair or maintenance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Possible FMVSS Performance Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA requests comments on possible approaches for addressing the safety hazards of electric shock in a crash or rollover, and during repair and maintenance, for EVs with a GVWR of 4536 kg or less, and all EV school buses regardless of weight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. Would it be appropriate to require EV circuit interrupter performance in a crash or rollover, which would automatically disconnect the propulsion batteries from all other electrical circuits and thereby prevent high voltage and current flow to other parts of the vehicle? Such response would be similar in timing and deceleration level to that of an occupant protection airbag in a crash. Does the technology exist to require such performance of a circuit interrupter for EV propulsion batteries in a crash or rollover? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. What time period, deceleration level, and vehicle attitude should be required for circuit interrupter performance of EV propulsion batteries in a crash or rollover? Should these be related to the minimum injury levels for electric shock discussed earlier, or whether the EV drive system is AC or DC? What types of circuit interrupter device should be required? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. What is an appropriate method of compliance testing circuit interrupter performance of EV propulsion batteries in a crash or rollover? Would an EV crash test (front, side, or rear) and static rollover test, as in FMVSS No. 301, be appropriate, where performance of the circuit interrupter could be measured over time at a certain deceleration or vehicle attitude? Alternatively, could a component test of the circuit interrupter be conducted, which would eliminate the need for a vehicle crash test? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. Would it be appropriate to require that EV batteries, connectors, cables, and wiring be located, routed, and insulated so as to minimize or eliminate electric shock hazard due to a crash or rollover, or during repair and maintenance? Similarly, should there be a requirement for minimum wire size in EV circuits? For example, what should be the minimum wire sizes for AC and DC propulsion drive circuits ranging from 120 to 600 volts? Should there be a requirement that EV propulsion circuits not be grounded to the vehicle chassis (electrically isolated)? What standards and guidelines are being used by current EV manufacturers and converters? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. Would it be appropriate to require EVs to have a means of manually disconnecting the propulsion batteries from other EV circuits for safety during repair or maintenance? Additionally, should circuit interruption performance be required of EV circuits through means such as fuses, circuit breakers, or ground fault interrupters? What types should be required? Are EV controllers typically equipped with capacitors which can remain energized even after the main power circuit has been disconnected? What technologies are available? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32. Would it be appropriate to require EV labeling and written instructions to minimize electric shock hazard as a result of a crash or rollover, or during repair or maintenance? Should an EV be labeled as ``Electric Vehicle,'' along with labels or instructions on the location and method of manually disconnecting the propulsion batteries? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33. Should there be requirements for battery container dielectric strength? If so, what levels should be established and how should this be tested? What standards currently exist? Please discuss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CHARGERS WAIVE COLEMAN TO RE-SIGN USHER  </P> <P> The Chargers waived safety Leonard Coleman Tuesday to resign Darryl Usher, whom  they selected off waivers from Cleveland last week but then cut on Saturday to  make room for defensive end Joe Phillips.  </P> <P> "Usher will return kicks, cover kicks and be a backup receiver," Charger Coach  Dan Henning said. "We took a chance on dropping him down and re-signing him  today."  </P> <P> The Chargers also tried out three punters -- Rick Tuten (Florida State), Glenn  Harper (Washington State) and Pat Thompson (Brigham Young) Tuesday. None of the  three has regular-season NFL experience. The trio tried out for Rudy Feldman,  director of pro personnel, and Joe Madden, special teams coach.  </P> <P> Henning said he did not watch the punters and that the team will have tryouts  on Tuesdays and Fridays throughout the season.  </P> <P> Tuten was cut by Washington after the Chargers traded punter Ralf Mojsiejenko  to the Redskins for a 1990 draft choice. He was also cut from the Chargers'  camp last season. Harper was cut by San Francisco and Thompson by Minnesota  this season. RICK HAZELTINE  </P></p>

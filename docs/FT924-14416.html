			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Missiles row sours CIS summit: Clash over N-weapons puts Commonwealth plans in doubt THE dispute between Russia and Ukraine over strategic nuclear weapons is jeopardising the meeting of leaders of the former Soviet republics on the eve of their Commonwealth summit. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, put a brave face on things when he arrived in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, where today's meetings are to be held, saying 'it is not a tragedy' if all 10 member states do not agree to all proposals. But the increasingly hostile row over the missiles demonstrates that the two-speed Commonwealth proposed by Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, earlier this week, could be a very volatile entity. The argument was sparked by Russia's surprise decision to claim jurisdiction over all the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, which the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, the four nuclear republics, had previously agreed should be collectively controlled through the Commonwealth of Independent States' joint command. However, in an interview with Russia's Nezavisimaya Gazeta, published yesterday, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the joint forces, said that, in agreement with Mr Yeltsin, he was ready to turn over all of the weapons to Russia immediately. 'You cannot leave such terrible weapons under the control of anything other than a specific nation-state,' Marshal Shaposhnikov said. That sparked the ire of Ukraine, which has sought to steer an independent course and opposed efforts to transform the Commonwealth into anything more than 'a court for obtaining a civilised divorce'. 'We like what we've got,' said President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine. 'Ukraine today has the right to block the launch of nuclear weapons from its territory but is not claiming the right to press the button.' Mr Kravchuk said last week that Ukraine, which has repeatedly promised to become nuclear-free by 1997, had the technical ability to prevent the firing of the 176 ICBMs stationed on its territory. Russian officials said that Belarus, which is sticking close to Russia, had agreed to the hand-over, while the position of Kazakhstan, which has repeatedly vacillated in its long-term nuclear intentions, is unclear. Russia is also likely to be attacked today following a threat by Mr Viktor Chernomydrin, energy minister, to switch off oil supplies to republics which do not pay outstanding debts to the Kremlin by Monday. The announcement, the result of an interview with Mr Chernomydrin on Wednesday but widely publicised yesterday, sent a tremor throughout the former Soviet republics, most of which are heavily dependent on oil they buy from Russia at rates well below world prices. Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, said that, in view of the hostilities, documents establishing the parameters of the rouble zone and increasing the authority of the CIS governing bodies were unlikely to be signed.</p>

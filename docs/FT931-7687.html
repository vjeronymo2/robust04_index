			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: FII rides recession with Pounds 3.5m DESPITE 'sustained recessionary pressure' on trading conditions and margins, FII Group, the footwear and scientific equipment company, lifted interim profits from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 3.48m pre-tax. Mr Monty Sumray, chairman, said the group's priority was to 'stem margin erosion'. Measures could involve site changes and some redundancies, exceptional costs of which would occur in the second half. Lower interest rates 'will exacerbate margin pressure and reduce investment income,' he said. The footwear division turned in unchanged profits before interest of Pounds 2.9m on turnover of Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 34.6m). The maintained result masked increased costs of imported materials and components and resistence to higher selling prices, Mr Sumray said. The scientific and technical side returned a profit of Pounds 200,000 on turnover of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.6m). Exports rose 43 per cent to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.1m). Earnings per share emerged at 15.8p (15.7p); the interim dividend is raised from 5.5p to 6p.</p>

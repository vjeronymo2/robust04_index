			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fall in markka helps Outokumpu back to the black THIS year's steep fall in the markka helped Outokumpu, the Finnish state-owned mining and metals group, to a FM133m (Dollars 23m) profit before extraordinary items in the first eight months of the year, a sharp turnround from a loss of FM62m in the same period last year. But Mr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive, warned that metals markets were in worse shape than had been predicted earlier in the year. 'In this market situation, a continued positive development of the result depends on the impact of measures taken to enhance efficiency and on improved competitiveness due to exchange rate movements,' he said. Group sales, at FM10.5bn, were ahead 29 per cent compared with last year's FM8.15bn. Operating profits grew even more strongly, rising to FM706m from FM384m. Profits after extraordinary items were FM391m, against a loss last time of FM62m, due to a FM258m contribution from a debt restructuring in Spain. Sales were up in all four main divisions - base metals, copper, stainless steel and technology products. But the growth in base metals sales from FM2.3bn to FM3.07bn was inflated by the inclusion of OM Group of the US, now 96 per cent owned by Outokumpu, but which it intends to sell. Outokumpu, 57.5 per cent owned by the Finnish government, postponed the planned sale of OM group earlier this year because of poor market conditions. But it said it now intended to complete the sale, by public offering to US investors, by the end of this year. The sale is expected to raise up to Dollars 170m. Despite low prices, particularly for nickel and zinc, and losses in both base metals and copper divisions, Outokumpu said it had begun work on a FM1.8bn programme to modernise and expand its copper smelter and nickel production line at Harjavalta in Finland.</p>

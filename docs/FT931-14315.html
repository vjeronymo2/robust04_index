			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Glaxo lifts investment in BioChem Pharma GLAXO HOLDINGS, through its main Canadian subsidiary, has put a further CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.4m) into BioChem Pharma, a Montreal drug research group, by exercising an option on 3.9m BioChem shares, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Glaxo took the option nearly three years ago when it backed BioChem's 3TC anti-Aids drug with a commitment of CDollars 125m for development. The exercise price was CDollars 7.80 a share, against BioChem's market price of around CDollars 20 a share last Friday. Glaxo now holds 17 per cent of BioChem and has invested a total of CDollars 72m so far in equity and research money. The agreement between both companies covers BioChem compounds for viral diseases.</p>

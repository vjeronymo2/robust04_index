			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn/Magdeburg (DPA) -- Following the  Saxony-Anhalt Landtag elections, the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] intends to form a minority government. The party  presidium in Bonn specifically welcomed the statement of SPD top  candidate Reinhard Hoeppner to run for the office of  minister-president. The SPD federal presidium said the SPD  would now discuss a joint policy program with Alliance 90/Greens  as soon as possible. There would be no coalition talks with the  Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. The Christian Democratic  Union [CDU] was "invited to meet its political responsibility  and support a government formed by Reinhard Hoeppner," the SPD  Presidium said in Bonn. [passage omitted]    Hoeppner said in Bonn he would resume talks with the parties  represented in the Landtag on the support of a government led by  the SPD. Earlier today, he had said: "For me there are only  two government models -- either a grand coalition with the CDU  under the leadership of the SPD, or a red-green minority  government tolerated by the CDU." At the same time, the SPD top  candidate had stressed that he would also let himself be elected  minister-president with the votes of the PDS, which will in the  future be the third strongest force in the Landtag. In the  evening, Hoeppner answered a relevant question [on a coalition  with the PDS] in the negative. [passage omitted]    Chairman Roland Claus of the Saxony-Anhalt PDS said on 27  June that his party would not vote for Hoeppner as  minister-president if he [Hoeppner] intended to form a grand  coalition. However, Claus called upon the SPD to hold talks  with the PDS. It was the PDS' goal to prevent a CDU government,  Claus said.    Alliance 90/Greens intend to support Hoeppner's candidacy.  Heidrun Heidecke, the top candidate of the ecological party,  said that with Hoeppner as minister-president, there were  several conceivable variants of forming a government.</p>

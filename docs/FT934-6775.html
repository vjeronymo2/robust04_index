			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Lebanon to raise Dollars 300m in Eurobond market The Lebanese government plans to raise Dollars 300m, through its first Eurobond offering, to help rebuild Beirut. The proposed issue of three-year Eurobonds is the latest attempt by prime minister Mr Rafik Hariri's government to meet the costs of a Dollars 13bn national reconstruction programme, dubbed Horizon 2000. Foreign aid has been well below the levels needed to finance the 10-year programme. Commitments to date from the EU, the United Nations, the Opec Fund, Arab institutions and others amount to Dollars 1.4bn and are linked to specific projects. The World Bank has pledged Dollars 175m and the Lebanese government hopes a meeting of a Bank-sponsored consultative group, scheduled for December, will result in more aid. However, following the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Lebanon's plans are likely to suffer as the donor community switches its attention and funds to the reconstruction of the occupied territories. Furthermore, until progress is made between Israel and Lebanon in their peace talks, substantial aid is unlikely to be forthcoming. As a result, the Lebanese government has turned to the international capital markets. Earlier this month, Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn property company set up to rebuild the centre of Beirut, launched a Dollars 650m international equity offering, one of the biggest public share issues in the region. Lebanon's bonds are likely to be well received because of its relatively low foreign debt of Dollars 300m and its gold reserves, which stood at Dollars 1.5bn at the end of 1992. Bankers say Lebanon has not defaulted on any international loans since the start of the civil war in 1975. Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, is arranging the offering. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield between 350 and 400 basis points over US treasuries.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Rifkind says fighting jobs safe Cuts in the fighting strength of the armed forces are over, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, promised the conference yesterday. The pledge, which signals that the Ministry of Defence will escape big cuts in this year's public expenditure round, was cheered by delighted constituency representatives.

Mr Rifkind's pledge followed attacks on defence cost cutting by several constituency representatives. Mr Bob Martin, a retired air commodore from Oxford, was applauded as he criticised the 'Whitehall warriors' cutting the forces. 'In the past year or two there have been more axes and knives hacking away at our services by these new-style Whitehall warriors than the forces have ever experienced.'</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Network of cycle routes proposed A call for Millennium Fund money to back the creation of a 5,000-mile network of cycle routes throughout Britain was made yesterday by Sustrans, a charity organisation which builds cycleways. The backbone of the Pounds 250m network would be a 1,000-mile route linking Inverness with Dover plus cycle routes in every county bringing 20m people within 10 minutes of a safe cycle track. Mr John Grimshaw, Sustrans founder, said the aim was to increase cycle use, reduce traffic congestion and pollution and provide greater opportunities for exercise. The recent review of transport policy by the Royal Commission on pollution recommended a quadrupling of cycle journeys within a decade. Fewer than 3 per cent of journeys are made by bicycle in Britain compared with 29 per cent in the Netherlands and 11 per cent in Germany. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said Britain was behind many other European countries in developing attractive cycle routes.</p>

The recently enacted Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 requires that DOT and FAA, in the handling of a complaint by an airline that an airport fee is not reasonable, use certain procedures that are substantially different from the procedures proposed in the NPRM. This notice revises the proposal in the NPRM by withdrawing proposed Subpart J, the special procedures for the handling of airport fee complaints, and extends the comment period for commenting on the remaining proposal. DOT will propose separate procedures to implement the airport fee provisions of the new legislation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period for Notice 94&hyph;18 as revised by this partial withdrawal is extended from September 15, 1994, to December 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed, in triplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Docket No. 27783, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.

A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges,'' (Proposed Policy) listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy on the rates and charges that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. (59 FR 29874). Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements under the airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended, and the Anti-Head Tax Act provisions of the Federal Aviation Act (59 FR 29880). The NPRM provided a comment period extending until August 8, 1994, and was extended until September 15, 1994 (59 FR 41192; August 10, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart J of the proposed rule provided special procedures for complaints by airlines involving the fees charged by an airport proprietor. In brief, Subpart J provided an expedited formal investigation that included an evidentiary investigative hearing presided over by a designated FAA employee. The presiding officer would issue a report of investigation to the Assistant Administrator for Airports generally within 90 days of the complaint. Within 120 days of the complaint, the Assistant Administrator would issue an initial determination of whether the airport fee at issue violated Federal requirements that fees be fair and reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory. An initial determination would be subject to final decision by the Administrator as a result of direct written appeal or, in certain circumstances, of appeal from the initial decision of an FAA hearing officer in an adjudicatory hearing requested by the respondent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August 23, 1994. Section 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act included specific provisions for the resolution of airport-air carrier disputes concerning airport fees. To a substantial degree, those provisions are different from and inconsistent with the Subpart J procedures proposed earlier by the OST and the FAA.

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Norcor set to reduce debt through listing Norcor, the corrugated board maker, is aiming to eliminate a Pounds 19.2m deficit on shareholders' funds with a proposed flotation later this month which will value the Norwich-based group at about Pounds 40m. The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, showed Norcor with net debt of about Pounds 35m - including some Pounds 22m in loan notes. Bank debt of Pounds 9.3m was rescheduled last month to be repayable on flotation. Norcor expects to raise between Pounds 17m and Pounds 20m from the flotation to pay the debt and fund between Pounds 4m and Pounds 8m in working capital. One of its production lines is to be refurbished from the proceeds. A further Pounds 18.5m in shares will be issued to satisfy loan note obligations. The balance of loan note holders - representing Pounds 3.55m in debt - are due to be repaid in 1995. Norcor has faced a number of difficulties since the Pounds 32m management buy-out in 1989. It failed to meet profit targets and was refinanced in 1991, while two of the past three years' accounts were qualified by accountants. The group had been capitalising its goodwill, without any provision for amortisation. Accounting practises have been changed in the run-up to flotation, and the figures for 1993 were unqualified. Earnings per share for 1993, excluding an exceptional insurance gain, fell from 16.7p to 14.6p. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 4m this year, before exceptional items. Last year the group made operating profits before exceptionals of Pounds 3.85m.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: ISS ahead 9% despite sales setback ISS, the international industrial cleaning group, reported a 9 per cent increase in net profits to DKr266m (Dollars 41.49m) in 1992 from DKr244m last time. Pre-tax profits were up by 15 per cent to DKr374m from DKr332m. Sales were down to DKr11.35bn from DKr11.80bn, due to divestments, adverse foreign exchange developments and difficult trading conditions in Sweden and Brazil. Earnings per share increased to DKr61 from DKr56. An unchanged DKr10 per share dividend was proposed. The board also proposed a scrip issue of one new for five old shares and a share split by which shares of DKr100 face value will be split into five shares of DKr20 each. Sales increased in Scandinavia to DKr5.07bn from DKr4.98bn, but operating profits slipped to DKr288m from DKr305m. Sales were down in both the other main divisions, to DKr2.94bn from DKr3.34bn in Europe and Brazil and to DKr3bn from DKr3.21bn in North America. Operating profits in Europe and Brazil were down to DKr159m from DKr177m, and in North America to DKr127m from DKr133m.</p>

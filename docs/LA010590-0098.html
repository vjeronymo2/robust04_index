			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPOINTEES WHO LIE WOULD BE REMOVED UNDER PROPOSED LAW  </P> <P> The chairwoman of the California State University trustees, who has admitted to  claiming a false community college degree, could be removed from her post under  legislation introduced Thursday to make sure governmental appointees tell the  truth about their credentials.  </P> <P> Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), chairman of the Senate Education Committee,  said he wrote the proposed law in response to revelations last month that CSU  Chairwoman Marianthi K. Lansdale incorrectly claimed a 1959 associate of arts  degree from Long Beach City College when selected by Gov. George Deukmejian and  confirmed by the Senate for a spot on the board.  </P> <P> Lansdale publicly apologized for the claim after she acknowledged in a Times  article that she never received the community college degree.  </P> <P> Under Hart's bill -- which would apply retroactively to Lansdale and other  gubernatorial appointees -- anyone chosen for a job that requires Senate  confirmation can be removed if the appointee is found to have "knowingly  (given) false information" during the confirmation hearings. Those hearings  usually are low-keyed meetings that rubber-stamp the governor's selection.  </P> <P> The bill also includes a provision that would require gubernatorial appointees  to submit to the Senate an accurate record of their educational background --  in writing and under penalty of perjury.  </P> <P> Hart said that he believes Lansdale should resign her post if she cannot come  up with a "compelling case" why she falsely claimed the degree. "I think she  should step down or else it sends the wrong message to the students," he said.  </P> <P> Lansdale and her husband, Long Beach developer William (Bit) Lansdale, are  longtime supporters of Deukmejian and gave the governor more than $100,000 in  donations and the use of a corporate airplane during his 1982 campaign, records  show. She could not be reached for comment Thursday.  </P></p>

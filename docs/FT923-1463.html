			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Rouble plunges amid inflation fear THE Russian rouble yesterday plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the Moscow interbank currency exchange opened last year, as fears of galloping inflation gripped businessmen. At the end of trading, it had sunk to 241 against the dollar - a loss of 35.5 roubles on last week's level of Rbs205.5 to the dollar. The volume of dollars traded was also a record, at Dollars 68.8m - a sign of the willingness of Russian enterprises to use Rbs15bn to buy the US currency as a hedge against inflation. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister, confirmed in his speech to the opening session of parliament yesterday that inflation had risen to 4 per cent a week or over 20 per cent a month, after falling to around 10 per cent in August. The government lays the blame for the inflationary surge at the door of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who has pumped billions of roubles of credits into industries, and advanced billions more to other former Soviet republics in the rouble zone over the past three months. Mr Sergei Glaziev, the deputy minister for foreign economic relations, said exporting companies were not flexible enough to react to a fall in the rouble, so he did not expect exports to rise as a result of fall in the rouble. Mr Gerashchenko, who took over as bank chairman in July, said then that he would not waste resources on trying to support the rouble. However, according to the daily Izvestia, the bank did try to intervene in the market yesterday, but could not stop the sharp fall in the rouble. Rumours have been sweeping the markets that the government will return to a fixed exchange rate of the rouble against the dollar - though neither Mr Gaidar nor Mr Glaziev gave any hint of this yesterday. The maintenance of artificially high exchange rates for exporters had cost the government billions of roubles in subsidies - and these are unlikely to be reimposed at a time of further planned budgetary cuts.</p>

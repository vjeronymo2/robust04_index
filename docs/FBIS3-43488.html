Government Major Eduardo Lauchande yesterday said  Renamo forces are supposed to withdraw 10 km northeast or 30 km  south from the area they are occupying. However, Raul Domingos,  Renamo's head of Political Affairs Department, said his  movement's soldiers will not withdraw those distances. Raul  Domingos said the Renamo forces will only withdraw 700 meters  from the boundary the of Salamanga state farm. The government  had earlier announced that Renamo occupied the Salamanga area  after 4 October 1992 and Renamo admitted this after  investigations carried out by a tripartite team.</p>

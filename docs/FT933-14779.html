			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Independence call on school funding THE Association of Teachers and Lecturers yesterday called for the funding of schools to be independent of the Department for Education. Mr Peter Smith, the association's general-secretary, wants the new Funding Agency for Schools to be given a guarantee of independence. He said the plans for a common funding formula would 'represent a serious lack of accountability for the system'. Consultation with members in both grant-maintained and local authority schools had shown that the department was 'already overwhelmed under the present pace and scope of the government reforms'.</p>

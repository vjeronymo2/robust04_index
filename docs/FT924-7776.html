			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Bonn confident of saving Euro-fighter THE German Defence Ministry said yesterday it was confident that a compromise would be found between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain on building a joint fighter aircraft to replace the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). At the same time, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the German partner in the four-nation EFA project, expressed optimism that 'a version' of the aircraft would be built. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary added yesterday that he was considerably more optimistic than a few weeks ago. 'The indications we are getting now are that the Germans wish to remain in the development phase of the project. It is clear that the overwhelming probability is that it is to remain a collaborative project of almost certainly four countries.' The three statements are the most positive indication yet that Germany may agree to go ahead with a cheaper version of the EFA, presenting it as a new, re-designed aircraft. However, the German government may still insist on an extension of the current development period, and a later production date for the new version, in order to delay the full effect on its overstretched budget. British officials believe that Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, who has insisted he will not go ahead with production of the EFA, will no longer carry out his tacit threat to pull out of the development programme, and risk heavy compensation payments. If he can present a much cheaper version of the EFA as a new aircraft, observers believe, then he may yet be prepared to go ahead with it. The Bonn defence ministry said yesterday that all reports of a rapprochement between the EFA partners remained 'pure speculation' until the defence ministers meet to discuss the project in December. They have been told by the EFA consortium that the DM133m cost of the aircraft can be cut by 30 per cent. But they are awaiting a report from the four chiefs of defence staff, expected to be finalised in the coming days, on the changed 'defence requirements' of their respective air forces beyond the year 2000.</p>

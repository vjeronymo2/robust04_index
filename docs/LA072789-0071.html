			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCH CASE DEBATED;  </P> <P> COUNTERSPY EFFORT: GAPS IN THE NET  </P> <P> At the time, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  attracted little notice. A seemingly routine survey of the state of U.S.  counterintelligence programs, it was appended to an appropriations bill earlier  this month and all but lost in the daily deluge of paper that flows from  government printing presses.  </P> <P> "Since its 1986 report on 'Meeting the Espionage Challenge,' the committee has  catalogued numerous cases of espionage and attempted espionage, some of which  had devastating consequences for the United States," the report said.  </P> <P> It added, "We also found that many of the actions set in motion in early years  were faltering as a result of diminishing resources and a lack of continuing  resolve to deal with them effectively."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bloch Case in Spotlight  </P> <P> Within days, the committee's central conclusions were driven home in one of the  most extraordinary developments in the long history of spies and counterspies:  the case of suspected Soviet agent Felix S. Bloch.  </P> <P> And beneath the headlines about Bloch's suspected activities and the bizarre  television film of caravans of FBI agents following him trunk-and-tail across  Washington and New York, the case has ignited a major debate within government  circles about U.S. counterintelligence capabilities and the growing number of  failures to uncover spies, some of whom have gone undetected for more than a  decade.  </P> <P> Indeed, the nation's counterintelligence program appears so overburdened that  former KGB agent Stanislav Levchencko, who defected to the United States in  1979, said this week that he was only surprised that American spies at the  State Department had not been uncovered earlier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lax for Decades'  </P> <P> "It is no secret that the security system at the State Department has been lax  for decades," Levchencko declared. "Professional logic would indicate that  there are at least two or three more spies still operating inside the State  Department who have not yet been found."  </P> <P> If Levchencko is a less than dispassionate judge, even a senior former U.S.  intelligence analyst conceded that "historically, counterintelligence has never  been an American forte."  </P> <P> Current and former intelligence officials say their ability to track down  Americans spying for other governments either in the United States or abroad is  hampered by an inefficient and underfunded system.  </P> <P> Part of the problem is clearly the dispersed nature of responsibility for  counterespionage.  </P> <P> Theoretically, responsibility for tracking down spies inside the United States  rests with the FBI. The CIA is widely considered to be responsible for  counterintelligence operations overseas. The State Department's Diplomatic  Security Office, a relatively new office, is charged with security at  diplomatic installations abroad. The Defense Department has parallel  responsibility for military installations in other countries.  </P> <P> In practice, there are yawning gaps in the net.  </P> <P> The CIA concentrates on watching for penetration of U.S. security by foreign  agents -- the bugging of embassies, for example, and terrorist threats; it  gives less attention to the activities of Americans spying on the United States  overseas. The State Department and Pentagon efforts are similarly defensive:  They concentrate most of their resources on protecting American personnel and  facilities from outside threats.  </P> <P> Even at the basic gate-keeping level of controlling access to sensitive  material, the problems are staggering and the government effort limited,  officials say.  </P> <P> An estimated 4 million Americans have official security clearances and  therefore have access to classified documents of varying degrees of  sensitivity. But the budget for screening those receiving such clearances has  been cut back in recent years.  </P> <P> The screening system itself is antiquated and inconsistent, officials add. The  procedure is so limited, one counterintelligence specialist charged, "that the  average applicant is likely to be more thoroughly checked for a mortgage than  for a security clearance."  </P> <P> The bulk of security checks do not go much beyond verification of background  information, checking references and determining that the subject has no police  record.  </P> <P> Questioning friends or neighbors, or sending agents door to door to investigate  the private life styles or habits of individuals in sensitive positions is  unrealistic and beyond the budget resources of most agencies, said one Justice  Department official.  </P> <P> "Lots of people used to argue that the polygraph (lie detector) was the answer  -- then you would have no need of background checks. But then they found that  the polygraph was not foolproof, so it was not an answer," said Americo R.  Cinquegrana, deputy counsel for intelligence policy at the Justice Department.  </P> <P> "There is still debate over which techniques are the most effective."  </P> <P> The last two executive orders establishing general criteria for employment by  the federal government were issued by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the  1950s, when the Cold War raged and most espionage was linked to ideological  sympathy with communism. Accordingly, security checks tended to concentrate on  a search for links to suspected groups and organizations -- often in earlier  stages of the subject's life.  </P> <P> Today's spies have been linked largely to financial gain or entrapment tied to  sexual activity, but counterespionage programs have not been modified to meet  the changing nature of the threat.  </P> <P> Not only do more than a dozen different agencies now use different criteria and  methods but follow-up investigations also are limited and sporadic.  </P> <P> "Most spies were recruited after they joined government, not before," said one  former intelligence official. "With little follow-up, that means they can go  undetected unless they slip up or someone informs on them."  </P> <P> Indeed, several of the cases uncovered in the 1980s, now referred to as the  "decade of the spy," were due to informants or through accidents. The only  known evidence against Bloch, a videotape of him handing what is believed to be  a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris, was "inadvertent," according to State  Department sources. The Soviet citizen was being watched, not Bloch.  </P> <P> Similarly, the activities of John Walker Jr., a Navy chief warrant officer who  spied for the Soviets for 18 years, were uncovered only after his wife went to  the authorities.  </P> <P> "Our counterintelligence is better than it was in the 1970s, but the U.S. is  showing that it is not up to the task of counterintelligence in the 1990s and  apparently not of the 1980s, especially if we're not able to find a guy after  10 years," said Kenneth E. deGraffenreid, a former senior director of  intelligence at the National Security Council who is now at the National  Strategy Information Center.  </P> <P> Bloch's alleged espionage for the Soviet Union reportedly may date back a  decade or more.  </P> <P> Critics lay blame for counterintelligence failures on the executive branch,  which they charge has virtually ignored every official assessment outlining  weaknesses in the counterspy program since a wave of spies was uncovered in the  mid-1980s.  </P> <P> "For four years, the government has been aware that there is a real problem  with espionage by Americans," said Allen Adler, a former counterintelligence  specialist at the American Civil Liberties Union. "And there has been  sufficient evidence to give advance warning in each of the cases over the past  two decades.  </P> <P> "But the government has not heeded any recommendations that have come out of  Congress or various commissions within the Department of Defense and other  agencies to determine what can be done to prevent these problems," he said.  </P> <P> In 1985, Congress recommended cutting back on both the volume of data  classified and the number of people given clearances. But Adler and other  counterintelligence specialists say both the Reagan and Bush administrations  have failed to adopt the recommendations.  </P> <P> "There are too many people who have access to classified data, but it is a  function of the amount of data classified," said Cinquegrana of the Justice  Department. Both government officials and critics agreed that the United States  classifies far too much information that is not politically or militarily  sensitive.  </P> <P> Explained DeGraffenreid, who worked in the Reagan Administration:  "Counterintelligence has become a backwater of bureaucratic inertia and  lethargy. They're comfortable with the way things have been done in the past,  and they don't want to be told by others how to do it better."  </P> <P> The price of U.S. counterintelligence weaknesses is likely to rise, experts  say, because the Soviet Union is upgrading its already formidable foreign  espionage.  </P> <P> Levchencko said that, contrary to popular conception, the Soviet policy of  glasnost, or openness, has actually led to a greater need for foreign  intelligence than during the Cold War era.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "is more pragmatic. But with the collapse  of industry and the economy, he is also forced to cut large parts of the  budget, even for the military. To compensate, he has to keep up with what the  United States and the West are doing. He relies on intelligence more than ever  so the Soviet Union is not left vulnerable."  </P> <P> Added DeGraffenreid, "The Soviets are showing an ability to penetrate a new  range (of government agencies), from the military to the State Department.  </P> <P> "These are major kinds of spies, not chicken-feed triple agents. It shows that  it's not only the low-level spies who hurt you, like Walker, who gave away  codes. If this (Bloch case) is all true, as it appears to be, then this is a  really big, big deal."  </P> <P> Even if no arrests are made in the current case, the allegations already have  triggered congressional interest in increasing the resources available to U.S.  counterintelligence.  </P> <P> "The fact that the Soviets have had a certain amount of success in buying  traitorous Americans would indicate that we should put more resources into  counterintelligence," Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) said.  </P></p>

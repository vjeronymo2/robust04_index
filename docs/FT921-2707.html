			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lack of incident leaves bourses improved LACK of incident on the global market scene, after Monday's travails in Tokyo, left most bourses tentatively better on the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had no story for the market as a whole to trade upon, and so dealers reverted to stocks which suited a thin day - big names, but less liquid and second line, said Mr Patrick Shields of Nikko Europe. AMB in insurers, AEG in electricals and Asko in retailing all put up useful gains, of DM20 to DM895, DM4.80 to DM220.50 and DM12 to DM745 respectively, but only Asko had a story: in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung its chief executive, Mr Klaus Wiegandt, was quoted as saying that the company would more than triple its operating profit to DM600m in 1995, after DM190m in 1990. In engineering, Linde moved upon performance achieved, rising DM14.50 to DM819.50 on this week's 10 per cent rise in profits. Meanwhile, the FAZ index was 1.57 higher at 702.27 in midsession and the DAX closed 5.27 better at 1,730.07 as German stock market turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.4bn. ZURICH was led higher by Nestle, which rose sharply after Monday's Paris court ruling which appeared to have improved the chances that Nestle and Exor, competing bidders for Perrier, will reach an agreement giving Nestle control of the water group and averting a bidding battle. Nestle bearers rose SFr140 to SFr9,470 and the SPI index by 9.5 to 1,130.5. Brown Boveri bearers rose SFr30 to SFr3,570 ahead of results tomorrow, on speculation that BBC will split its shares, and that it could abolish its certificates. MILAN carried over its recent weakness into the new account. Rumours of forced selling by a local financial services company weighed on the market. The Comit index fell 1.99 to 503.28 in turnover estimated at L70bn-80bn, down from Monday's L108bn. Dealers said that Agnelli shares did not fall as heavily as feared following news on Monday of the group's setback in the takeover battle for the French mineral water company, Perrier. Fiat fell L80 to L4,790 and the holding company Ifi dropped L110 to L12,300. James Capel yesterday issued a sell note on Fiat, saying that there was no short-term solution to its malaise and that its fortunes would not improve until 1993. Other industrials were weak with Montedison down L14 to L1,316, but Pirelli rose for the second day, adding L5 to L1,190, on reports of London buying. PARIS rebounded on reasonable UK buying interest. The CAC-40 index rose 14.37 to 1,943.59 but turnover remained modest at FFr2bn. Recent favourites moved up, with Euro Disney adding FFr2.50 to FFr162.50 and Alcatel adding FFr11 to FFr605. Pechiney investment certificates put on FFr15.50 or 4.9 per cent to FFr333 on UK demand. Perrier bucked the trend, losing FFr42 or 2.6 per cent to FFr1,608, as hopes of a bidding war in the current takeover struggle receded. There was also speculation that Nestle and the Agnelli group might reach a deal behind the scenes. AMSTERDAM rose with strong foreign interest in Heineken. The brewer closed at a record high, up Fl 5.1, or 2.8 per cent, at Fl 182.0. Grolsch, however, was hit by profit-taking and closed down Fl 1.8 at Fl 2.6.0. The CBS Tendency Index gained 0.9 to 125.6 in turnover of Fl 577.6m. Publishers were active, with Wolters Kluwer rising Fl 1.3 to Fl 70.10 and Elsevier, which reports 1991 results on Friday, gaining 2 per cent to close at a record high, up Fl 2.4 at Fl 117.5. Analysts said that Wolters Kluwer's results on Monday, which showed a 24 per cent rise in profits, had had a positive effect on other stocks in the sector. Hunter Douglas continued to move ahead after falling sharply last week following publication of disappointing results: the building materials group closed up Fl 1.3 or 2 per cent at Fl 65.3. STOCKHOLM saw Hennes and Mauritz reach an all-time high of SKr740, up SKr25, on its strong growth potential as the Affarsvarlden general index closed at 988.7, up 2.1, in moderate turnover of SKr500m. COPENHAGEN eased as a leadership contest in the opposition Social Democratic Party had a negative influence on the market, writes Hilary Barnes. The CSE index fell by a further 1.62 to 338.50. ISS, which published a better-than-expected 1991 result, was up DKr11 at DKr880. HELSINKI fell ahead of today's government measures to support Finnish banks, the Hex index closing 7.0 lower at 853.0. ISTANBUL closed lower, the 75-share index finishing down 8.68 at 3,771.10 in turnover of TL195.4bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1147.94  1148.15  1149.18  1150.42  1150.34  1151.31  1152.01  1151.88  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1152.88    Day's Low  1147.93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Mar 16    Mar 13    Mar 12    Mar 11    Mar 10           1145.61   1154.40   1149.99   1161.88   1169.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

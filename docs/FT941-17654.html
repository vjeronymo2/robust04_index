			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Lloyd's plans a future with no Names: The aftermath of the losses suffered by syndicate members My feeling is let them all rot in Hell. I could not have been worse treated by Lloyd's,' says Hugh Taylor, bruised and embittered by his experience as a Name in the London insurance market. He is one of many Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally backed the market - who have been financially crippled by heavy underwriting losses at Lloyd's since the mid-1980s. Taylor, like 21,000 others, must choose over the next month between accepting Lloyd's offer of modest compensation for his losses or pursuing long and uncertain legal action against his agents. The omens are not good for Lloyd's. 'It doesn't seem very brilliant,' says Taylor. 'It is most unlikely I will accept. I consider I've been dealt with dishonestly and dishonourably and I am entitled to an apology and some compensation for the stress I have suffered.' His losses from Gooda Walker syndicates already amount to about Pounds 440,000. The failure of the settlement would mean that more than 30 legal actions involving 17,000 Names will continue. That - and the prospect later this year of another Pounds 1bn loss when 1991's results are reported - is bound to revive speculation about the future of the insurance market. In spite of these gloomy signs, though, there is a surprising air of optimism at Lloyd's. Underwriters say that trading conditions are among the best they have seen, following increases in rates of up to 400 per cent. Impressed by a turnround in the quality of management at Lloyd's and attracted by the promise of bumper profits in 1994, city institutions have invested more than Pounds 850m in a dozen new Lloyd's investment trusts in the past three months. Against expectations, Lloyd's capacity  - which reflects the strength of the market's capital base - will rise to about Pounds 10bn this year, the first time it has risen since 1990. Although 13,000 Names like Hugh Taylor have been forced out of the market since the late 1980s, among the 19,000 who remain the appetite for comfortable profits is overcoming concern about potential loss. As fear recedes, hundreds of Names are increasing their commitments. 'A quiet confidence is returning to the counties - good heavens yes, oh yes, yes, yes,' says Robert Wharton, a Bristol-based solicitor, who organises the Avon and Gloucestershire region of the Association of Lloyd's Members. Wharton says that the number of Names in the county has fallen but that those who remain intend to increase their investment this year. The Wharton family itself - Wharton's wife, Fiona, is the Name - has decided to raise its investment, increasing the 'line' (amount traded) by about Pounds 100,000 in 1994. Even though several of the Whartons' friends have lost heavily at Lloyd's in the past two to three years, little can damp Wharton's optimism. 'There is a tremendous disparity between the popular image and what is actually going on,' says one Name, who intends to increase his commitment from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5m this year. Robert Saunders, 34, who advises Names on their Lloyd's affairs for Smith &amp; Williamson, is equally bullish. 'I've been scraping together anything I can  -shares, tax recoveries - to increase my deposit at Lloyd's,' says Saunders, who wants to increase his 'line' from Pounds 475,000 to Pounds 565,000 this year. Indeed, some Names who had earlier resigned from Lloyd's have decided to rejoin the market. 'I'd just lost confidence in it. I couldn't see them getting out of trouble,' says Daphne Thomson, who lives in the London suburb of Southgate and resigned in 1992, only to rejoin a year later. News of the formation of new Lloyd's investment trusts was an important factor in her decision. 'It gives you a reasonable feeling that the people who know the City are not allergic to Lloyd's' Philip Gwyn, who founded and now chairs the Christie Group, a hotel and valuation business, also reversed an earlier decision to resign, rejoining for 1993 after a four-year absence. A change in the quality of management and clear signs of a turn in the insurance cycle were two of the reasons. Recent losses and litigation should reinforce these trends. While losses and scandal have reduced the social cachet of Lloyd's membership, Names themselves have been forced to take a much more businesslike view of their participation at the market. 'It will be a cold blooded decision taken each year after proper consideration,' says Gwyn. Thomson says the days when Lloyd's membership passed down through families - generation by generation - have gone. 'You don't automatically assume you will always be a Name at Lloyd's any more,' adds Thomson. The influx of corporate investment has lead some senior figures at Lloyd's to speculate publicly about the future of unlimited liability. Robert Hiscox, the deputy chairman of Lloyd's, wants most names to become shareholders in new Lloyd's insurance companies. He says that the market should not have two classes of shareholder and ought to consider whether new unlimited liability Names should be allowed to join the market at all. 'We have got to go towards limited liability. The question is how do we do it.' Unlimited liability 'causes too much grief', says Hiscox. 'Every 30 years or so we have blown Names out of the water. I just don't want anybody in future to have to sell their homes to meet losses.' Ultimately Names will die out anyway. This year only about 50 will undergo the ritual of the 'rota', where new Names are told that all their personal possessions are on the line to meet insurance losses. The average age of Lloyd's Names is now 58. As David James, a Name and leading businessman, said recently: 'There is not going to be a new flood of Names. Anno Domini and our losses mean that we are an eroding asset.'</p>

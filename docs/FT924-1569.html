			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown The 7 per cent rise in Hillsdown's share price yesterday may have been rather a rude way of greeting the news of the proposed departure of the group's founder and guiding spirit, Sir Harry Solomon. Hard-hearted shareholders perhaps viewed the move as little more than a small but favourable step in the food group's rehabilitation process - although Hillsdown's confirmation of its dividend forecast also helped. If Sir Harry's strategy of buying low quality businesses at cheap prices and knocking them into shape proved a highly successful strategy for the 1980s, the recession cruelly exposed its limitations. Fresh strategic thinking will surely be required to chart the company's future course and earnings revival. But in the short term, at least, the new management team is only likely to press ahead, if more purposefully, with the current round of rationalisation and retrenchment. Hillsdown's shares have recently been helped by the hints of general economic recovery and a consequent re-rating of the lower quality food manufacturing stocks. This process may yet have a little way to run. Hillsdown, though, will have to come up with some answers of its own. The worry is that sometimes even good management cannot escape an unfavourable market position.</p>

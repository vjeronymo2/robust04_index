			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Living together, but no love lost: France's next conservative government is unlikely to dislodge President Mitterrand Within the next 10 days France will move from weak government to divided government, an unsettling prospect for those inside and outside the country. There are only two certainties. One is that shortly after the second round of voting for the National Assembly on March 28 - the first round, eliminating weaker candidates, takes place on Sunday - France will have a conservative prime minister and government. What little movement there was in opinion polls during the campaign involved the Greens first gaining, and then falling back, in relation to the enfeebled ruling Socialists. The combined vote of the Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UDF - fighting under the joint banner of the Union pour la France - has not wavered much from the 40 per cent mark. Given the majority voting system, and the diversity of its opponents, the UPF duet seems sure to get a large majority of seats. The other certainty is that, short of cutting off his gas and electricity, the new conservative government will be unable to get President Francois Mitterrand out of the Elysee. There had been opposition talk that he would have to respect the will of the people by packing his bags or calling an early presidential election if the opposition won a landslide victory. Mr Mitterrand has made clear that he regards that as constitutional hogwash. Provided his health does not deteriorate further, Mr Mitterrand will stay until his seven-year term runs out in May 1995. So France is embarking on up to two years of cohabitation, a term that has far stormier connotations for French politicians than it does for unmarried couples. The conservatives' first cohabitation (1986-88) with Mr Mitterrand left lasting bitterness with Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, who felt his spell as prime minister destroyed his 1988 bid for the presidency. This time round 'nothing and no one will stop us from carrying out our policies', Mr Chirac recently warned. Mr Chirac regards holding the premiership as a poisoned chalice. But he has recently sounded unsure about whether he might not put it to his lips - if Mr Mitterrand offered it to him. His rival on the right for the presidency in 1995, ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who leads the UDF, has similar reservations and hesitations. But few opposition leaders can be ruled in, or ruled out, for the top government job. It is in Mr Mitterrand's gift and, savouring this power, the president has given no hint of how he might bestow it, except that it would not be on someone hostile to the European Community. In practice, the president will not be able to ignore the leader of the party with the most seats. So, the not-always-so-friendly rivalry between the RPR and the UDF to get the edge on the other will be important. The election will also determine the shape of the future opposition. The worse the Socialist party does, the more pliable it may be for Mr Michel Rocard, the most likely Socialist presidential challenger in 1995, to recast in his mould. His call for 'a big bang' recomposition of the French centre-left was broadly welcomed within the Socialist party. But Mr Rocard's tactlessness this week in bad-mouthing President Mitterrand as someone with whom the French people had 'personal scores to settle' left many Socialists thinking that the only bang was the sound of a bullet entering Mr Rocard's foot. The overwhelming focus in 10 days will be on the new government, and its attention will be fixed on the economy. Up to yesterday's half-point cut in the Bundesbank discount rate, a frequent description of the French economy's current state has been atonie (lifelessness). National output fell by 0.5 per cent in the last quarter of last year, but has since levelled out, although some sectors such as cars are still seeing a drop in sales. The rate of job losses slowed in January, albeit with unemployment at a painful 10.5 per cent of the workforce. Most French forecasters predict little expansion in the first half of this year and only 0.5-0.7 per cent growth in gross domestic product for the whole year. France, however, is well-poised to grow. Its inflation rate is about 2 per cent. Its trade balance will deteriorate this year (because of neighbouring countries' devaluations), but from a handsome FFr30bn (Pounds 3.8bn) surplus last year. And the finances of its households and companies are sound. Banque Indosuez projects that the savings rate will rise from 12.3 per cent last year to 12.9 per cent this year. The Caisse des Depots, the state savings bank, calculates that company profits rose 10.6 per cent last year and productivity increased 3 per cent, as managers cut investment and staff. Banking on the economy's relative health, France's likely new governors  - whatever their campaign rhetoric of fiscal conservatism - are not going to let themselves be too constrained by the relative sickness of state finances in going for growth. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the RPR party and budget minister in 1986-88, said as much earlier this month. 'You will find that dynamism, audacity, risk-taking will be the thrust of the future government in economic policy,' he said. The bill for the opposition programme of tax breaks for the construction sector, cuts in indirect and direct taxes, and a switch of welfare charges from company payrolls to the state budget will come to an extra FFr110bn over three years, calculates Mr Juppe. More than covering this bill, he claimed, would be public spending cuts, privatisation proceeds and smaller dole payments/higher tax revenue owing to economic expansion. The opposition wants to prove the forecasters pessimists. It does not want to spend the whole of 1993 clawing back the output drop in the last part of 1992. It has seen what poor political reward Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy has had for trying to be fiscally orthodox; even in that, he has failed, because last year's FFr230bn budget deficit rose above 3 per cent of GDP and may hit FFr300bn this year. Most important, France's rival conservative leaders - Mr Chirac and Mr Giscard d'Estaing - now begin another election campaign, to displace Mr Mitterrand in 1995. The new government's principal constraint will be its desire to keep the franc locked to the D-Mark as it tries to follow German interest rates down. Here, the centre-right parties seem to think words will suffice. As long as the new prime minister issues a resounding declaration in favour of the franc fort, keeps any of the RPR/UDF 'soft money' advocates like Mr Philippe Seguin or Mr Alain Madelin out of the finance ministry, and tables an immediate draft law to give the Banque de France autonomy, that will be assurance enough to the foreign exchange markets, claim many in the opposition. But the markets will only be convinced if Germany is. The centre-right parties hope it will be, and have written into their election platform the need for a 'new initiative' with Germany on monetary policy. Their difficulty is that they will also be asking Bonn to join Paris in a more protectionist trade policy. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, has struck fear into France's conservatives by expressing impatience with French obstructionism in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Yet Mr Chirac has not only been denouncing the Gatt negotiations, but also threatening to renege on last summer's reform of EC farm policy. Quite why the RPR leader should risk an EC bust-up on this, when most farmers vote RPR anyway, can only be explained in terms of the 1995 presidential contest. Seeing this coming, it would not be surprising if President Mitterrand were to want a cool head at the top of his government, like Mr Edouard Balladur. This RPR ex-finance minister is the prime ministerial candidate whom most RPR and UDF voters can agree on. For precisely that reason, nominating him to the Hotel Matignon would deny Mr Mitterrand the pleasure of making mischief. But Mr Balladur is calm and polite - qualities which may soon be in shorter supply in French politics than usual.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Volkswagen on the rise Worldwide deliveries of Volkswagen group cars and vans rose 7.8 per cent in the first half of this year, writes Christopher Parkes. The Seat and VW marques were most successful, recording increases of 23 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, the company said yesterday. However, in western Europe, where overall car sales rose about 7 per cent, demand for the group's brands, which include Skoda and Audi, increased 2 per cent. German deliveries fell 3.9 per cent to 508,400 units, while sales elsewhere in the region gained 7.5 per cent to 600,600 vehicles. US sales more than doubled to 57,000, while the Japanese business gained almost 50 per cent. VW group turnover and earnings figures are expected in an interim report next month.</p>

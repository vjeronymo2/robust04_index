			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN PRISON GETS FINAL OK;  </P> <P> CORRECTIONS: STATE ACTION MEANS CONSTRUCTION COULD START IN SUMMER. BUT  OPPONENTS VOW TO BLOCK THE FACILITY WITH A LAWSUIT.  </P> <P> State officials Wednesday gave final approval for construction of a prison on  the edge of downtown Los Angeles, but opponents of the planned medium-security  lockup immediately vowed to go to court to block the project.  </P> <P> Corrections Director James Rowland said construction of the 1,450-bed prison  could begin as early as summer. He promised that the $147-million prison would  be a "good neighbor."  </P> <P> "Residents will be able to take pride in this facility," Rowland said in a  statement. "We look forward to a long and cooperative relationship."  </P> <P> But there were no signs of cooperation Wednesday -- only more of the anger and  distrust that have characterized the five-year fight over the project.  </P> <P> Democratic Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, who represents the southeast  corner of downtown where the 20-acre prison site is located, said Rowland's  action is "not the end" of the controversy. She said opponents would file suit  in Superior Court within 30 days.  </P> <P> "The process has been unfair and illegal," Roybal-Allard said. "The state has  totally ignored the impact that the prison is going to have on the community."  </P> <P> Aurora Castillo, a spokeswoman for Mothers of East L.A., a grass-roots group  that has fought the prison, said state approval of the facility was never in  doubt because state officials "had no intention whatsoever of listening to the  community."  </P> <P> "I think this whole thing is a farce," she said. "We have opposed the prison  with respect and dignity and we will continue to do so. We do not want our  community turned into a penal colony."  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian proposed the prison in 1985, citing the fact that Los  Angeles County accounts for about 40% of state prison inmates but has no  prison. The facility is to be built on an industrial lot near Washington  Boulevard and Santa Fe Avenue.  </P> <P> The fate of the Los Angeles prison is tied to a similar facility planned for  Lancaster. The two projects were linked after Democratic lawmakers from Los  Angeles complained that Republican constituents in rural parts of the county  ought to accept an equal share of the prison burden.  </P> <P> Under a legislative deal worked out, neither prison could be occupied until  construction has begun on the other, said Mike Van Winkle, a spokesman for the  Corrections Department.  </P> <P> Van Winkle said plans for the Lancaster site are moving smoothly and should be  completed soon. He also said the department is confident the Los Angeles prison  plan could withstand a legal challenge.  </P> <P> "We have done everything by the book, everything that has been asked of us by  the Legislature and the special legislation that was passed for this project,"  he said.  </P></p>

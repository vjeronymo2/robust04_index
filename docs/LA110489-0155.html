			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GATEWAY COMMUNICATIONS ADOPTS A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN  </P> <P> Gateway Communications Inc. said Friday that it has adopted a shareholder  rights plan intended to make a hostile takeover of the company more difficult  to complete.  </P> <P> Paul J. Schneider, Gateway's chief financial officer, said the action was taken  because the company believes its stock is priced below its market value, not as  a response to any specific takeover attempt.  </P> <P> "We believe that on a long-term basis our stock is undervalued," Schneider  said.  </P> <P> Gateway stock, which traded as high as $17 per share in 1986, has floundered  around the $2 mark during the past year. On Friday, the stock closed at $2.0625  per share, down 6.25 cents, in over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> Because an undervalued stock makes a company more attractive as an acquisition  target, it is not uncommon for firms to adopt anti-takeover plans when they  believe their stock is bargain-priced.  </P> <P> Although Schneider maintained that Gateway is not responding to an imminent  takeover threat, he did note that a New York-based investment group, Centennial  Associates, recently acquired a 5% stake in the company. But he said the group  has told the company that the purchase was made for investment purposes only.  </P> <P> The rights plan "will give the board the ability to negotiate" with a party  attempting an unfriendly takeover, Schneider said. The plan gives current  shareholders the right to buy additional stock at a set price. It would go into  effect in the event that a party acquired 30% or more of Gateway common stock  or announced a tender offer for at least 30% of the company.  </P> <P> "The board intends for the rights to enable all shareholders to realize the  full long-term value of their shares in the event of an acquisition of the  company," Schneider said.  </P> <P> "The rights do not deter takeover attempts but should encourage any interested  acquirer to negotiate with the board prior to attempting a takeover."  </P> <P> A number of Orange County companies have adopted anti-takeover plans during the  past year, among them Western Digital Corp. and AST Research Inc.  </P> <P> Gateway, whose sales were $16.8 million for 1988, manufactures communication  products known as local area networks that enable personal computers to talk to  each other and to share printers and other peripheral equipment.  </P> <P> For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Gateway earned $755,793 on revenue of $19.7  million, up from earnings of $514,725 on revenue of $11.7 million for the same  period last year.  </P></p>

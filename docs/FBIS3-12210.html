			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 28 Feb (MENA)--Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has described the resolutions  adopted by the emergency meeting of the Arab League Council last  night as all-encompassing and comprehensive, revealing a united  Arab stance that is rallying to condemn last Friday's ugly  massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied West  Bank.    In statements today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Arab League  Council resolutions are a message from the Arab League to Israel  and the international community, clarifying that prevarication,  procrastination, and Israel's nonrespect for the dates agreed  upon have become unacceptable in the Arab world.    He stressed that the Arab countries are seeking to achieve a  comprehensive and just peace to create stability in the Middle  East. He noted that peace is not only an Arab interest, but an  Israeli one too. He said the Arabs want a just peace based on  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories in accordance  with the resolutions of international legitimacy and based on  recognition of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Hebron massacre  again highlighted the Arab stance that demands Israel's  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, stressing that  the Arab countries are not in a weak position, because justice  is on their side.    He noted that the Palestinian intifadah activated the recent  peace process and hastened the Madrid conference and the  Washington peace talks.    The Arab League secretary general also stressed the  importance of the Jerusalem issue. He said it has top priority  in the negotiations and the Palestinian and Arab sides are  determined to retrieve it. [passage omitted]</p>

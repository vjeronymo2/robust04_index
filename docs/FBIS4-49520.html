			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing,  vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, today  expressed the hope that the mutually trusted ties and  cooperation between China and Laos will be developed in a  long-term way.    This will be beneficial to both, said Liu at a meeting with  a  senior delegation from the Laotian Ministry of National Defence  led by its minister Choummali Sai-gnason in the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse here this afternoon.    Their friendly conversation mainly centered on the further  development of Sino-Lao relations and other issues.    Liu said China and Laos have enjoyed a long history of  friendly contacts. At present bilateral ties have grown well  and personnel exchanges between the two countries are increasing.    "It is our hope that such mutually trusted friendly ties  will  develop for a long time, which is beneficial to both," he said.    During the meeting Liu also briefed the visitors on China's  reform and opening to the outside world.    Liu noted China has made great achievements in its reform  and  opening to the outside world over the past 15 years, adding that  China is now in the best period since its founding in 1949.    Facts prove that a series of principles and policies that  China is implementing are really effective, he said.    Of course, he said, since China is a very large country, its  development is unbalanced. This requires us to continuously  explore, take a positive attitude, and overcome difficulties so  as to promote its economic development.    Choummali said the Laotian Government, Army and people will  never forget the help that the Chinese Government, Army and  people have offered to them.    "It is our resolute conviction to further consolidate and  develop ties between the two governments, armed forces and  peoples. The changing world situation will strengthen our  resolve to this conviction," he said.    Choummali said: "We will do our best to promote bilateral  friendly ties and cooperation in depth and in an all-round way."    The delegation arrived here on May 6 for an official  goodwill  visit to China at the invitation of State Councillor and  Minister of National Defence Chi Haotian. Before their arrival  here they visited Chengdu of Sichuan Province.    This morning, Chi hosted a welcoming ceremony on the square  in front of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's  Revolution here for Choummali and his party. Then the two  ministers held talks and exchanged views on the development of  the relations between the two countries and the two armed forces  and international issues of common concern.    This evening, Chi gave a dinner in honor of Choummali and  his  party.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (24): Economy's steam engine trundles on - The past 12 months has seemed to signal an upturn in the mining industry One market analyst muses: 'Like it or not, mining is still the steam engine of the South African economy.' Such a view is amply borne out by statistics: although the industry's contribution to overall output has been declining over the past decade, mining still accounts for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product, and is responsible for more than 60 per cent of South Africa's export earnings. The past 12 months has seemed to signal an upturn in the industry after several years in the doldrums. The commodity cycle is improving steadily and the continued depreciation of the rand has helped boost revenues even further. Gold is recovering from the disaster years of the late 80s and early 90s, coal and diamonds have both picked up from the bottom of their price cycles and the same is true for a wide range of other minerals. But while the commercial position may be looking brighter, there are renewed problems for the industry on the political front. Although the battle over nationalisation appears to have been won by the mining houses, there has been considerable debate in African National Congress quarters over the possibility of the state taking control of the country's mineral rights, which in South Africa, unlike many other countries, are privately owned. The idea, aggressively promoted by Mr Paul Jourdan, an ANC adviser on mining, is premised on the argument that such a move would allow the government to raise new revenue from increased taxes, leases and royalties, while freeing up new deposits for exploitation by small, black-run mining operations. In addition, by allowing the possible entry of foreign mining companies that have long sought a foothold in the South African market, Mr Jourdan argues, the plan should promote competition and efficiency as well. But as Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of the country's largest mining conglomerate, Anglo American, points out, in South Africa any moves made in this direction would 'not be from a standing start.' Local companies have already spent a great deal of time and money investigating the viability of mineral deposits. To alter arbitrarily the system, he argues, would be expensive, unfair and unproductive. So far, despite its pre-election rhetoric, the new government has not taken any action, and the appointment of Mr Pik Botha, former foreign minister, as minister of mineral and energy affairs has helped reassure mining houses that little of substance is likely to change. But the debate is the subject of continued discussions between ANC advisers, the government and the mines. One senior mining executive notes: 'Our talks have had a tone of constructive collaboration, and we are continuing the dialogue.' He predicts that the outcome will probably be a compromise, with mines selling or leasing some of their less valuable claims to new users. Another potential danger area is on the labour front. The industry's recovery is still very fragile and predicated on continued cost containment. But after years of accepting below-inflation wage increases, mineworkers are becoming increasingly restive. Hoping for support from a sympathetic government and demanding a share of the benefits accruing from higher mineral prices, the current round of wage negotiations, due to be completed this month, is going far less smoothly than in previous years. Many leading companies are pushing for productivity bonuses or profit-share schemes that will allow them to embark on much-delayed capital expenditure, but workers are insisting on increased base pay and wild-cat strikes and go-slows have already depressed output for the year. Lingering apartheid legacies, such as the continued lack of proper housing for black mineworkers, are also causing tension. 'Its going to be much tougher this time round,' notes one official involved in the pay talks. 'The unions are being less accommodating than during the recession.' In the longer term, too, other problems are looming. While South Africa still has vast mineral deposits, it is a very mature mining environment and new capital investment has slowed dramatically over the past 10 years. Of the developments which have gone ahead, while the R1.7bn Moab extension to Anglo's Vaal Reefs is on track, Gengold's Oryx development and JCI's Joel expansion have both underperformed, as has the struggling Northam Platinum mine, all of which serves as a discouragement for further new initiatives. As a result, freed from the restrictions of the apartheid years, companies are increasingly focusing their attention on more attractive prospects abroad, particularly in the underexploited African environment. Already, South African mining companies are aggressively investigating new mineral deposits from Mali to Botswana and further development is expected over the next few years. 'Ten years ago, 80 per cent of our exploration was in South Africa and 20 per cent outside; today the situation is reversed.' notes Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold. In the global context, too, new initiatives are under way. Anglo last year shifted most of its international assets to offshore associate Minorco as a prelude to further expansion, while Gencor has been negotiating to purchase Shell's international mineral arm, Billiton. This is not to say that the South African mining industry will be neglected, and some new mines will continue to be developed, but big capital spending within the country is increasingly likely to shift away from mining projects towards beneficiation of minerals for export. The three biggest capital projects presently in progress, the R5.8bn Alusaf aluminium refinery extension, the R3.5bn Columbus stainless steel expansion and the R1.4bn Namakwa Sands project, are all examples of such value-added mineral initiatives that should bear fruit in the future. In the meantime, however, the steam engine will keep puffing away.</p>

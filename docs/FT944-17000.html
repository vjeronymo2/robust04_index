			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Changes to credit data leave City in two minds: CSO moves to smooth data movements The record consumer credit figures for August might have seemed dazzling - but the reaction from many City economists was distinctly ambiguous. As analysts debate the impact of the recent tax rises there is mounting uncertainty about how far the recent credit surge points to any increase in consumer confidence. One reason is that the figures have proved highly volatile in recent months. Net lending fell to Pounds 256m in May before soaring to Pounds 603m in June then falling back to Pounds 349m in July. Levels of new lending have fluctuated, often apparently at odds with official retail sales data. The Central Statistical Office yesterday attempted to smooth out some of the volatility in the new lending series by modifying its system of seasonal adjustment. This takes account of the variation in the number of credit processing days in a month, which can differ as a result of bank holidays and other factors. The move has been welcomed by groups such as the Credit Card Research Group, an industry research body. Mr Peter Welch, head of research at the group, yesterday said that if the CSO had not introduced the new system in August the level of new credit-card lending would have apparently surged 11 per cent, because August had 5 per cent more processing days than usual. Under the new system of adjustment the figures showed credit-card lending up by less than 1 per cent. This move may have removed some of the statisticians' concerns, but has done little to ease economists' broader uncertainty about what the series is indicating. In previous recoveries levels of lending have been regarded as a useful barometer of consumer confidence and spending. Some economists still say that the rise in credit this year is useful as a leading indicator of confidence. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'These figures show us that the consumer is much less worried about borrowing - and much more confident too - than the wider world would have us believe.' Other economists believe that this analysis seems to be at odds with other recent retail sales data and consumer confidence surveys. Some observers suspect that the rise in credit-card borrowing could reflect the fact that households have not been able to pay credit-card bills as easily after the recent tax increases. Similarly, the increase in finance house lending might indicate that consumers are increasingly canny in retail purchases, choosing to buy white goods through cheap finance loans. Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson said: 'You can argue it either way - it can either be an indicator of consumer confidence, or quite the reverse.' Another, more significant, factor that may also be affecting the data is that consumers' use of credit tools appears to be shifting. Mr Welch believes that the recent increase in credit-card lending owes more to the increasing popularity of cards as a payment tool rather than any pick-up in confidence. Ms Lesley Kay, of the Finance and Leasing Association, said that the recent surge in finance house lending might reflect the fact that 'in store' credit is becoming more popular than bank loans or other payment tools. As another example of the way in which finance houses may be increasing their market share, she pointed out that the level of car loans issued through finance houses in August grew much more rapidly than the overall level of new registrations - a trend which is likely to please the finance houses, but do little to help statisticians make sense of the credit numbers.</p>

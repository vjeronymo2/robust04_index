			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: Role of the British Tourist Authority is far from superfluous Sir, I was in Japan on a sales mission when I heard of the resignation of the chairman of the British Tourist Authority and his chief executive ('Tourist authority chief quits', January 27), and I was on a British Airways flight home before I read press comment about the government's support for tourism. The press comment I have seen questions whether or not the commercial sector should undertake the role of overseas promotion themselves and hints that the British Tourist Authority's role may be superfluous. Nothing could be further from reality. Having just led a sales mission to Japan, an important growth market for tourism to this country, I fully appreciate the work of the BTA. Briefing us on arrival, advising how market conditions have changed since our last visit, on what the consumer and the travel trade now expect and what new opportunities have arisen, should not be underestimated. Most companies cannot afford to have an office in Japan and must rely on representation and the government tourist office. This is not an area in which our very able embassy in Tokyo is involved. Without the BTA, how else could we have identified and entertained more than 90 journalists in Osaka and Tokyo, all of whom in the future may write about Britain. We need a strong, articulate body co-ordinating British tourism interests overseas, guiding commercial interests, co-ordinating joint ventures between airlines, hoteliers and other interested parties, such as charge-card companies. The government should not fall into the trap of believing that the industry, which is fragmented and often consists of small businesses, can do it alone. Britain is being seriously challenged by other European countries that are prepared to invest. France, Italy and Spain are all attempting to increase their market share. We need government support and it is time the heritage department recognised the value of the work carried out overseas to support and to underpin the work of the commercial sector.

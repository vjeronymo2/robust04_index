			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Recent remarks by a cabinet  minister denying Japan's wrongdoing before and during World War  II has reopened deep scars in Asia.    When Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano said the 1937 Nanjing  massacre was a "fabrication" and that it was wrong to call  Japan's invasion of Asian neighbors aggression, it also revived  doubts about the way Japan perceives history, particularly its  wartime role.    "The Japanese may often be confused about their history,"  said a passage in an editorial in THE PHILIPPINES DAILY INQUIRER.    Another Manila paper, today, expressed fear of living under  the "spectral threat of a militarily resurgent Japan which  hasn't learned one thing from its shameful history of  aggression."    The South Korean and Chinese Governments also protested  Nagano's remarks as distorting historical facts.    For the Japanese Government, Nagano's blunder occurred at an  "unfortunate" time since the new administration of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata was expected to follow in the footsteps of  his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, regarding Japan's wartime  role and offer formal apologies for Japan's wartime atrocities.    Last summer Hosokawa became the first Japanese prime  minister  to use the words "aggression and colonial rule" in referring to  Japan's actions before and during World War II.    But the 71-year-old Nagano, who had been first lieutenant in  the Japanese Imperial Army and later chief of staff of the  Ground Self- Defense Force, is the latest in a number of  politicians to create an international uproar by the slip of the  tongue regarding Japan's wartime actions.    Nagano resigned after only 10 days in office.    In 1986, then Education Minister Masayuki Fujio was  dismissed  by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for saying Koreans were  partly to blame for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the  Korean peninsula. In 1990, a lower house member, Shintaro  Ishihara, said the story of the Nanjing massacre was made up by  the Chinese.    China estimates that Japanese Imperial Army troops massacred  more than 300,000 civilians following their invasion of then  Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. Japanese  historians cite lower estimates of around 100,000.    "I think people of that generation truly believed what they  said," said Roger Buckley, professor of history at International  Christian University, about politicians who make remarks  downplaying Japan's wartime role.    Buckley, while pointing out that formal apology is  necessary,  said he fears such comments by politicians will influence  Japan's younger generation.    Education authorities have frequently been criticized, both  at home and abroad, for not giving sufficient attention to  teaching that period of history. Textbooks for use at schools  also are subject to government approval.    A senior diplomat said the concept among the Japanese of the  period from around late 1930s to World War II is fuzzy, while  good history books about the era are also unavailable. That,  said the official, is why university entrance exams hardly  include any questions about the country's modern history.    But efforts are being made to ward off criticism about  history teaching.    A foreign ministry-affiliated organization recently  published  "Japan in Modern History," which offers translations of history  textbooks used in Japan's elementary and junior high schools,  the first such attempt in Japan.    The books, published by the International Society for  Educational Information, extracted and translated parts dealing  with Japan's role in the world from the late 19th century  through early 1900s from three textbooks each from elementary  and junior high schools used since 1992 and 1993, respectively.    The three texts each account to about 70 percent of  textbooks  used by primary and junior high students in Japan, according to  the institute.    The "Japan in Modern History" is also available in Chinese  and Korean and the translations of high school textbooks are  also on the way.    "By solely offering translations of the textbooks without  giving any comments or analysis, people interested in Japanese  textbooks can see for themselves how Japan is teaching modern  history at schools," said Fumi Miyamoto, director of an  institute which aims to boost mutual understanding among people  everywhere.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada, in distributing  the English translations to foreign reporters, said the  publication aims to show that, "we're seriously teaching our  schoolchildren."    "I think its quite true... That in the early 1980s  historical  facts were not well reflected in school textbooks," Terada said.  "But gradually the quality of textbooks has improved."    Two of the elementary school texts and all three junior high  texts translated in the "Japan in Modern History" described the  Nanjing massacre.    The institute plans to distribute the books to schools, book  stores, local governments and local education boards in Japan  while the Foreign Ministry will distribute them abroad, the  institute said.</p>

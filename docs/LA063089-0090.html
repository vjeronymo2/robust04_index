			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Circle K Corp.: The Phoenix-based convenience store operator reported that net  income plunged 75% to $15.4 million for fiscal 1989. Revenue totaled $3.5  billion, up 31%. The results include an after-tax gain of about $19.1 million  from the disposition of assets. The company said grocery gross margins  continued to decline during the fourth quarter as a result of industry  pressures and inventory adjustments and that it experienced increases in  operating expenses due to higher interest costs and depreciation related to the  recent acquisitions of more than 1,000 stores and new store construction.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hit by big international bonds sell-off - Market Report The UK equity market took fright at the latest retreat by the all-important US bond market, which impacted across international markets, and retreated to close sharply lower on the session. At the close yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index was 42.7 lower at 3,382.6 and the FT-SE Mid 250 index was 28.8 down at 4,025.5. Over the week the 100 index rose 3.7 while the Mid 250 index fell 4.5. There was a general feeling of deep unease across the markets with UK gilts on the slide again and down over Pounds 1 1/4 at the long end. US bonds were down a full point during London market hours and German bunds down over  3/4 of a point. Wall Street fell sharply also, retreating almost 40 points before embarking on a rally. The market's malaise came directly from the performance of US bonds and Wall Street shares overnight when bonds were sold off heavily just before the close following a warning that US inflation could be about to accelerate. The warning came from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve business outlook for February which said regional prices were moving up. The report fuelled strong speculation that inflation pressures could be building in the US. Adding to the market's discomfort was a persistent rumour that one of the biggest US investment banks had been badly hit by the recent retreat in US bonds and was having to unload bonds and stocks across international markets. There were suggestions two weeks ago that Goldman Sachs had been badly wrong-footed by the markets and suffered exceptionally heavy losses. The investment bank denied the rumours. The equity market was under strong pressure from the outset, with the FT-SE opening down 19.7 points. A mild attempt at a rally followed the January money supply figures which prompted hopes of further cuts in UK interest rates, but it quickly petered out. Led down by the FT-SE future which traded at a substantial discount to the cash market all day, the 100 index fell away to a session low of 3,382.2 shortly before the close. Senior marketmakers, although disturbed by the size of the fall in share prices, emphasised the orderliness of the retreat. 'There was sizeable selling and some aggressive marking down by marketmakers, but it never ever resembled a panic,' said the head of sales at one broking firm. Asked whether the London market would sell-off again on Monday, one leading marketmaker said the FT-SE would probably match any fall in the Dow Jones Average last night 'point for point'. Also affecting sentiment in the market was the expiry of the FT-SE February index options and evidence of at least one and possibly two big sell programmes going through the market during the morning. And one of the market's most aggressive marketmaking houses was said to have taken a view of the market in mid-morning and unloaded heavy blocks of stock across the market. Strategists said the FT-SE could well test its recent support level of 3,350 in the short term and would probably see 3,300 before it gets back to 3,500. Turnover yesterday was a lowly 630.9m shares, giving credence to stories that marketmakers were reluctant to deal in the face of the uncertainties surrounding bond markets. The value of customer business on Thursday dropped to Pounds 1.4bn, the lowest of the week.</p>

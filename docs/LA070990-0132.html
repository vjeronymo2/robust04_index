			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL DRUMMOND; RECEIVED 3 HEARTS  </P> <P> Michael Drummond, who received two artificial hearts and a third from a human,  has died of multiple organ failure at age 30, nearly five years after he became  the youngest person ever to receive the Jarvik-7 artificial device.  </P> <P> Drummond died Saturday night of complications that included a blood infection,  kidney failure and lung problems brought on by a combination of a diseased  gallbladder and obesity, said Dr. Jack G. Copeland of the University of  Arizona's Medical Center.  </P> <P> In 1987, when his first artificial heart, a $15,000 plastic-and-metal  cream-colored pump, was presented to the Smithsonian Institution's National  Museum of American History, Drummond said: "I guess I am sort of a part of  history, but not by choice. It's possible 100 years from now that the  artificial heart will be as routine as a blood transfusion."  </P> <P> Drummond and Copeland set medical history five years ago when Drummond became  the youngest of six Jarvik-7 artificial heart recipients and the first to  undergo an implant pending the availability of a heart from a human donor.  </P> <P> On Aug. 29, 1985, he was given his Jarvik-7 after a viral syndrome had caused  congestive heart failure and Copeland determined he had only 48 hours to live.  </P> <P> After 9 1/2 days on the Jarvik heart, Drummond received the donor heart of a  19-year-old Texas man who died in a motorcycle crash.  </P> <P> Drummond recovered fully, despite a minor stroke while on the Jarvik, and led a  normal life for 4 1/2 years, resuming work at a Phoenix-area grocery.  </P> <P> But Drummond's condition had been deteriorating since Feb. 3 when he underwent  emergency surgery to remove a gangrenous gallbladder. That ailment led to a  blood infection, a blood clot in the lungs and a weakened heart that was  replaced by a second artificial heart, which his body rejected.  </P> <P> Copeland replaced Drummond's transplanted heart with a Symbion J-7-70  artificial heart on May 21. Within two days of the second implant other  complications developed, including fluid retention in the lungs and kidney  impairment.  </P> <P> Drummond, 6-foot-2, weighing 268 pounds with an engaging smile that offset a  quiet, stoic demeanor, "certainly had the fight," said Lisa Slayton, a member  of the university's cardio-thoracic intensive care unit's nursing team.  </P> <P> She said the team had a good cry after his death. "We all took care of Mike  like he was our brother. He was like family."  </P> <P> Drummond's father, Clarence, said: "We're just grateful that the artificial  heart was here for Mike the first time. He wouldn't have had the 4 1/2 years if  he hadn't had (it).  </P> <P> "And even this time, there were still things that Mike wanted to do, and with  the artificial heart he had a shot at it, anyway. It didn't work out, but he  had a shot at it."  </P></p>

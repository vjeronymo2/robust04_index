			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (2): Market becomes more aggressive - Merchant Bank Mergers THE Netherlands' 'newest' merchant bank likes to see itself as continental Europe's first 'Anglo-Saxon' merchant bank. Mees Pierson, created in April out of the merger between two rival merchant banks within the ABN Amro group, has set its sights on following in the traditions of Goldman Sachs, Kleinwort Benson and Schroders while continuing to draw on its roots in the continent of Europe. From the moment they first announced their merger plans in November, former competitors Bank Mees &amp; Hope and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson made clear that they were modeling themselves on the big Anglo-Saxon players, all of whom are active on the bank's open home market. In fact, the Anglo-Saxon banks are probably Mees Pierson's biggest competitors in the Netherlands after its own parent bank, ABN Amro. Mr Johan Kleiterp, chairman, says Mees Pierson has the same expertise as its Anglo-Saxon rivals and it even shares the same culture, reflecting a decade of change to new market conditions and the adoption of a more aggressive market stance - 'our corporate culture is not much different from that of most of our Anglo-Saxon colleague houses,' he says. 'Perhaps we could raise our aggressiveness a bit,' Mr Kleiterp adds, but stresses that the bank's two predecessors had already made great strides forward in the 10 years before the link-up. He notes that Mees Pierson does not have the same financial muscle as Goldman Sachs in security trading, for instance, but adds, 'one of reasons for the merger was to contribute to a substantial strengthening of our financial base.' Mees Pierson, with a balance sheet total of Fl 36bn, may be the newest name in Dutch banking but it traces its history back to the early 1700s. Its predecessor banks, buoyed by the Netherlands' status as a great trading nation, helped finance the construction of Canada's railways, and they were also involved in arranging the 'Louisiana Purchase' which allowed the newly-formed United States to buy a great swath of territory from France. Pierson was taken over by Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank (Amro) in 1975, the same year that Amro's rival ABN purchased Mees &amp; Hope. However, both merchant banks continued to operate independently of their new parents. When Amro and ABN merged in 1990, speculation quickly started that one or other of the merchant banks would be sold off. In the event, the decision was taken late last year to merge them, while retaining the policy of allowing the merged bank to compete head-on with its parent in Mees Pierson's entire range of businesses - corporate finance, primary markets, equity trading, asset management and lending. Abroad, Mr Kleiterp is often called upon to explain how a subsidiary can operate in total independence from its parent. Proof of this separateness and independence, he says, is the fact that the bank has offices in many of the same international financial centres as ABN Amro  - 'we both have offices in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Why shouldn't we both be in New York, Singapore or Hong Kong?' he asks. Mees Pierson's network of 20 offices in 17 foreign countries is largely a legacy of the international ambitions of Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson, rather than of Mees &amp; Hope. This means that there is not much overlap overseas compared with the Netherlands, where 450 out of 2,500 domestic jobs are to go. Mees Pierson employs a total of nearly 4,000 people, including 1,500 overseas, and it expects the foreign-domestic ratio to move closer to 1:1 as the bank grows abroad. However, the number of foreign offices itself is not expected to show significant expansion. Mees and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson each had offices in London, New York, Singapore and Hong Kong, and these will eventually be integrated. There is no urgent need to do so, however, because Mees's emphasis lay more in corporate, trade and commodity finance while Pierson tended to pursue asset management, stockbroking and private banking in these centres. A top priority for this year is to launch equity research and trading in Frankfurt, to be followed by Paris. The strategy is to make equity research and trading more European, and then, in their wake, to win more cross-border business in mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance. Before the merger, Pierson had attempted to boost its European profile in equities through a partnership with Sal. Oppenheim of Germany. But the merger, plus Oppenheim's own revised strategy, put an end to their co-operation. Last year, the partners' jointly-owned venture in Paris, Oppenheim Pierson Melendes, was closed down because of continued losses. In asset management, Mees Pierson already has a large, global operation that spans Europe, the Far East and the US. Among the challenges of the merger is the need to integrate separate automation systems. Credit and treasury systems will be fully integrated by the start of 1994, but merging the two banks' equity systems will take well into next year. On matters of business philosophy, Mr Kleiterp says Mees Pierson has yet to take a stance in principle on how it would respond if a client wanted to launch an unfriendly, Anglo-Saxon-style takeover bid, a phenomenon which is still exceedingly rare in the Netherlands but which is expected to increase. Mr Kleiterp's old bank, Pierson, had been involved in isolated Dutch battles, whereas Mees's former parent ABN had come out squarely against participation in hostile bids. He says Mees Pierson's stance could be - like Pierson's - that it would defend any client that was on the receiving end of a bid and that it would examine on a case-by-case basis the merits of any bid which a client would want to launch - 'I wouldn't automatically say no (to involvement in an unfriendly bid), but I would add that this is something we still need to discuss as a matter of principle in the new combination,' he says.</p>

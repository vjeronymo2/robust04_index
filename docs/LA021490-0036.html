The burglars broke through glass panels in the double doors at Dyansen Gallery,  hot-wired an electronic operated steel security gate and made off with the  artworks in less than five minutes. In addition to the paintings and drawings  by Neiman, the thieves made off with six other paintings and four sculptures.  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hai Chao (3189 6389): "Rapidly Deteriorating </F> Public Security Situation in China--A View of the National  Situation Based on a Study of Conditions in the Largest City,  Shanghai"]    [Text] Reform has promoted economic development, but  it has also intensified social conflicts, so that crimes such as  brutal murders, disfigurement, and kidnapping which never or  rarely happened in the past are now happening in China's largest  city--Shanghai.    Reform and opening up and the development of the socialist  market economy have brought life and vitality to the nation's  growth on the one hand but have also posed a serious challenge  to the nation's public security. This article uses Shanghai as  an example to bring up some national issues.  <H5>  Rising Trend of Serious Crimes </H5>   According to statistics compiled by Shanghai's Public  Security Department, the number of criminal cases had declined  somewhat in 1992 compared to previous years, but the number of  serious crimes had increased. Between January and June of this  year, there were 8,535 criminal cases, a 13.5 percent increase,  but there were 4,303 serious crimes, a 38.4 percent rise  compared to the same period a year ago, which was fairly  substantial. Murder, robbery, rape, fraud, theft, and drug  trafficking and other major crimes also increased by varying  degrees. Crimes such as brutal murders, disfigurement, and  kidnapping which never or rarely happened in the past are  happening today. Serious crimes endanger the lives and  properties of the people, jeopardize economic construction, and  seriously undermine social stability.  <H5>  Crimes Are Mostly Committed by Drifters </H5>   According to the relevant departments, currently Shanghai  has  a mobile population of around 2.5 million people. The  undesirable elements and drifting criminal elements among these  outsiders are posing a serious threat to Shanghai's public  security. From January to July of this year, the municipality  arrested 4,975 criminals who were from outside of the area,  2,526 of them for committing serious crimes. These represent  increases of 75.5 percent and 82.3 percent respectively. Of the  total number of criminals, 53.1 percent were from outside of the  area, and among those responsible for serious crimes, 52.4 were  outsiders. These represent increases of 10.3 percentage points  and 10.5 percentage points respectively compared to the same  period last year. In terms of vicious crimes, the absolute  number of murders, robberies, rapes and other vicious crimes  committed by outsiders has increased 82.1 percent compared to  the same period last year; in terms of crimes committed by  gangs, nearly half were committed by gang members from outsider  the area.    In the course of reform, social contradictions and  instability have become prominent factors. They have become very  serious in some instances.  <H5>  Intensified Social Contradictions Lead To Violations of the </H5> Law and Crimes    1. Contradictions occurring as enterprises change their  operating mechanisms: Statistics compiled by the municipality's  relevant departments show that currently, 5,600 of the  municipality's enterprises have changed their operating  mechanisms. Among the 2.17 million workers in these enterprises  implementing the whole staff labor contract system or the  employment contract system on a trial basis, there are 107,000  laid-off workers and 34,000 workers looking for work; they  account for 5 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, of the  total work force. Reform will continue to deepen this year, and  the number of laid-off and unemployed workers will continue to  increase. Based on the estimated figures of 6 percent laid-off  and 3 percent unemployed workers, out of the municipality's 4.2  million workers, there will be 250,000 laid-off and 120,000  unemployed workers. Because the reform is broad in scope and  massive in impact and the economic system is in the midst of  being restructured, traditional concepts will still have some  impact, and in addition, some enterprises have not been doing a  good ideological work nor handling the relationship between  cadres and the masses properly, nor have they made proper  arrangements for the workers, and so the contradictions caused  by enterprises' changing mechanisms are quite serious. Some  workers left destitute have repeatedly appealed to the higher  authorities for help.    2. Contradictions caused by land leases that forced people  to  move from one place to another: First, group appeals have  increased. Second, the residents are moving en masse, creating  many contradictions in their work, study, and everyday life and  causing dissatisfaction. Third, arguments have erupted within  some families over who got better housing or more properties,  and these in turn have led to family feuds and disputes. Lastly,  in the land leases, some enterprises and institutes are moving  entire plants, but mistakes in hammering out the agreements or  resolving the property rights have resulted in lawsuits and so  on.    3. Negative and corrupt phenomena are a major factor  contributing to social instability.    The negative and corrupt phenomena the masses object to the  most today are the following:    a) The practices of abuse of power for private gains and  trading power for money have made a come-back under the new  conditions. In some law enforcement and supervisory and  administrative departments, there is a serious problem where a  handful of workers have to be bribed to work; some do a  haphazard job even after they are bribed, and some make up all  kinds of excuses to extort payments and so on.    b) Some people eat, take, withhold, and make demands; they  spend public funds on entertainment, gifts, and trips, and they  squander and waste money. Their entertainment and gift-giving  are increasingly more extravagant: their dinners often cost  several thousand yuan and their gifts are expensive, with  increasing "gold content."    c) There is growing resentment among the masses toward  formalism, bureaucracy, and fraud and trickery, but little is  done about them. Enterprises are subjected to a lot of useless  evaluations and examinations, but problems that affect the  masses' immediate welfare just drag on and are never resolved.  Contract management is riddled with fraud and trickery, and the  use of deceptive means to gain profit and fame is commonplace.    d) Problems are emerging in new territories: In the real  estate market, taking advantage of the randomness in who may  lease land and for how much, some people are giving and taking  bribes; malpractices for personal gains are common. Some  government departments have been converted to intermediary  organs after given new functions; everybody must go through them  in order to obtain a license or have a project approved by the  appropriate department. Nothing will get done without paying off  the middle-men. A handful of government employees have joined  the ranks of agents to get into the market, using their official  position and power to recruit business and earn commission and  payoffs. Meanwhile, some people take advantage of the lecture  circuit or news media to broadcast false information and mislead  stock market trends as ways to profit themselves.  <H5>  Economic Crimes Are Getting Increasingly More Serious </H5>   1. Corruption, bribery, misappropriation of public funds,  and  other economic crimes among state workers are common. Ordinary  crimes have declined, but serious crimes have increased.  According to data compiled by the Shanghai Municipal  Procuratorate, between January and May of this year, there were  168 major cases of corruption, bribery, and misappropriation of  public funds. They accounted for 71 percent of all cases filed,  an increase of 30 percentage points compared to last year for  the same period. The biggest corruption case involved more than  5 million yuan, and the biggest case of misappropriation of  public funds involved 3.07 million yuan.    2. Crimes are showig up in the stock and securities  exchanges. The municipal procuratorate's statistics show that  between January and May of this year, there were 16  stock-related criminal cases. Among them were 12 cases where  employees in bank security departments were taking advantage of  their position to engage in stock speculations. As much as 11  million yuan were involved in those crimes.    3. Public security problems are emerging as the stock market  develops: First, it has triggered criminal offenses. Based on  the public security department's incomplete data, between August  1990 and May 1992, there were a total of 70 stock market-related  criminal cases. Second, there are hidden security problems.  Between August 1990 and May 1992, there were 28 public  security-related cases in the vicinities of Shanghai's stock  market. The majority were cases involving fights that broke out  in the black market exchange of stock subscription certificates  and traffic problems and so on. Third, there are new social  conflicts. In particular, there has been an increase in civil  suits and economic disputes related to the buying and selling of  stocks. Data compiled by the court system show that the  municipality's courts handled a total of 102 stock-related  disputes in 1992.    4. Debt-related disputes have continued to increase.  Statistics show that from July 1992 to March of this year, in  excess of 400 million yuan were involved in cases mediated by  the economic dispute mediation center of the municipality's  courts. Most of the disputes involved payments in arrears in  business transactions and loans for trips taken abroad and so on.    5. Trademark infringement cases have multiplied.  Counterfeiting well-known, fine products and trademarks has  become an important way for some enterprises to compete and reap  exorbitant profits. Between January and May of this year, 26  trademark infringement cases were filed, accounting for 10.9  percent of all cases filed, and it was 3.7 times more than the  number filed last year during the same period. Prior to the East  Asian Games, a random check of 1,352 businesses on Fourth Street  showed that 560, or 41.4 percent, were selling counterfeit  products.  <H5>  Failure To Curb Prostitution Despite Bans </H5>   1. For the sake of money, some unscrupulous people are  circulating low-class, crude, lewd, and obscene "spiritual  products," corrupting people's souls. According to the  municipality's music and video control department, in 1992, more  than 40,000 illegal video tapes and more than 30,000 illegal  audio tapes were seized; 184 vendor's stalls were shut down, and  40 people were arrested by the public security department--14 of  them have been sentenced. In examining 8,390 video tapes  (containing 10,285 shows,) 5,981 shows, or 57.8 percent, were  deemed obscene. In May of this year, the municipal public  security bureau together with the industrial and commercial  bureau uncovered a case involving the sale of pornographic  films; a batch of such films were seized.    2. Despite concentrated rectification efforts year after  year, prostitution, although curtailed to some extent, still has  not been swept out, and in some places, is still spreading and  growing. In 1992, more than 3,000 women and more than 800  procurers of prostitutes were rounded up and sent to undergo  reeducation. Between January and June of this year, 792 cases  involving prostitution were investigated and processed; 1,585  people were arrested. Particularly serious are the pornographic  and gambling "services" provided in some public places: Some  dance halls provide closed KTV boxes and have bikini-clad girls  put on shows to attract customers. Despite the municipal party  committee and the municipal government's repeated orders banning  the "three services," many places are still secretly doing this  type of "business."    3. The manufacturing, trafficking, and taking of drugs and  illegal growing of drug-producing plants are still a serious  problem. From January to April of this year, the municipality  investigated and prosecuted 40 such cases; 55 people were  arrested, and 470,000 illegally-grown opium poppy plants were  eradicated.    4. The management and administration guiding ideologies of  some cultural and entertainment centers are flawed. First, some  guest-houses, hotels, and inns are only concerned about their  occupancy rate and profit and are disregarding the issues of  social benefit and clean social environment. They ignore  regulations, fail to register guests, and are remiss in  management. Of the 229 prostitution-related cases in Xuhui  District, 92, or 40 percent, took place in the guest-houses and  hotels. Second, amid the intense market competition, some plant  supervisors and managers have developed unhealthy management  ideas and are providing immoral services as a means to promote  their products and negotiate business and are offering  substantial financial rewards to abet and entice young girls to  sell their looks and even their bodies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Overall labor reform  has been completed by 9,200 enterprises in the northeast China  province of Liaoning.    A total of 2.11 million workers in state-run enterprises  have  been put under a new contract labor system, ending years of  "jobs for life".    This provincial capital cut 90,000 surplus workers from  state-run enterprises last year.    Meanwhile, the port city of Dalian has streamlined its 800  state enterprises to the tune of 32 percent, including 4,000  officials.    All these changes have been taking place smoothly.    In accordance with the labor system reform, a distribution  system reform is also under way. First-line workers and  technical specialists now receive relatively high wages.    To safeguard the reform, the province has taken a big step  forward in building a social security system, which covers most  of the province's enterprises and workers.</p>

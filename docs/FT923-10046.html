			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling Perhaps Mr Brian Pearse of Midland Bank and Sir Denys Henderson of ICI would be better advised to keep their mouths shut about the exchange rate. Their complaints this week about the economic cost of maintaining sterling's level within the ERM elicited no sympathy from the Treasury. But they have contributed to a growing malaise in the currency markets. If that continues, the government may find itself under pressure to raise interest rates, which can scarcely be what the two men intended. Part of the trouble is that the exchange market has begun to doubt the government's resolve following the speed with which it moved to ensure that Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester withdrew its recent mortgage rate rise. That makes the market more inclined to push sterling down towards its absolute D-mark floor of 2.778. To be sure, there are still more than 6 pfennigs to go. But sterling already needed official support against the Portuguese escudo yesterday. Sharply higher Italian interest rates have made it expensive to sell the lira short. That is conspicuously not the case with sterling. Nor does uncertainty over September's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty help. When ERM stability was accepted by the market, currencies at the bottom of the system could only move up. That no longer applies when the system itself is in doubt.</p>

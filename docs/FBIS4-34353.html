			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala could lose some $530 million a year from  textile and clothing exports, if the U.S. Congress fails to  approve President Clinton's bill granting parity to Caribbean  Basin countries with regard to NAFTA.    According to a study conducted by the Secretariat of Central  American Economic Integration [SIECA], the economies of  Guatemala and the rest of the countries in the region would be  severely harmed by their disadvantage with Mexico with regard to  exports to the U.S. market.    Taking this into consideration, President Clinton sent to  the  Congress a bill detailing a "provisional trade proposal for the  Caribbean Basin," until the countries of the region are  completely integrated into NAFTA.    SIECA pointed out that investments are already being  diverted  to Mexico because of the country's preference within NAFTA. If  this trend continues, the region's development would be set  back, considering the fact that the United States is the main  destination of exports in the area.    The proposal for the Caribbean Basin countries to attain  parity with NAFTA was sent to Congress for approval, together  with other bills related to foreign trade. For a country to  participate in the provisional trade program, it must be free of  charges of violations of labor and intellectual property rights  laws. In addition, the country must not be included in the  provisions of line 301 on restrictions on exports to the United  States.    At present, Guatemala faces charges by labor unions and  other  U.S. organizations that the country violates labor rights,  particularly regarding assembly plants, agriculture, and  copyrights.</p>

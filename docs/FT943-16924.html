			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hadleigh advances to Pounds 832,000 - Margins improve in tank container division as volumes rise by 45% Higher operating margins in its tank container division helped Hadleigh Industries, the USM-quoted storage tank and trailer manufacturer, continue the improvement seen at the interim stage. Following its return to the black after six months, pre-tax profits for the year to April 1 were Pounds 832,000, against FRS 3-restated losses of Pounds 329,000. Operating profits surged from Pounds 170,000 to Pounds 1.14m on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.3m). Net interest payable was Pounds 309,000 (Pounds 499,000) as borrowings fell from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 1.51m, reducing gearing from 44 to 26 per cent. Gross margins improved from 15.8 to 17.1 per cent as sales per employee rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 72,058 (Pounds 66,325). Mr Freddie Fane, chairman, said the strategy to focus on the core engineering businesses had proved correct and future development would be centred on these activities. The tank container division, Universal Bulk Handling, which contributed Pounds 14m to turnover, saw volumes rise by 45 per cent. The division finished the year with a Pounds 10m order book and has opened sales offices in Chicago and Singapore. Mr Anthony Cookson, chief executive, said Hadleigh saw the US and east Asia as target growth markets. 'We will be looking for acquisitions to achieve this.' Mr Cookson said production facilities for Cookson and Zin, the storage tank and pressure vessels division, would be expanded to meet increased demand for stainless steel containers. He added that AI International, the maintenance division, and Truckline, the distribution facility, continued to generate profits but Lynton, the lossmaking Manchester-based lightweight trailers manufacturer, would be disposed of. Mr Fane announced he would stand down as chairman at the next annual meeting but remain as a non-executive director. He will be replaced by Mr Don McFarlane, a non-executive director for two years. A proposed final dividend of 1.5p makes a total for the year of 2p (0.5p) from earnings per share of 9p, against losses of 3p.</p>

Russell Patrick Broom, 19, of San Diego, also a passenger,  fled and was later found in a drainage ditch near the freeway, Whitten said. He  was arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen vehicle and possession of  drugs, the officer said.  </P> <P> The other chase started in Los Angeles about 1:15 a.m. when officers attempted  to stop a car that had been reported stolen, a police spokesman said. The chase  continued to the Mexican border, where Mexican authorities apparently shot at  the speeding sedan. The occupants ditched the vehicle and escaped on foot.  </P></p>

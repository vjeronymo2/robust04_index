			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Reflecting the frustration  of German enterprises over Japan's dominance of Asian markets,  the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Tokyo called for  more government backing of efforts to meet the Japanese  challenge in a report released Thursday [3 February].    The "German Asia Concept" report, which was submitted to the  German Government, urges Bonn to set up a semiofficial "German  Asia Center" to "bundle the meager German Asia resources" and  make the German industry competitive in the Asia-Pacific region.    With Bonn shouldering 50 percent of a proposed 1 billion  German mark stock capital, local governments, labor and economic  organizations, as well as academics, should join forces in  setting up the center, the paper suggests.    German Asia strategies can be successful only "if they take  into account the Japanese positioning in the Pacific rim," it  said.    To make inroads in Japan-dominated Asian markets, German  companies must exploit the deficits of Japanese economic  strategy in Asian countries in transition, the paper states.    Japanese business activities block transfer of know-how and  key technologies, fail to provide for participation of local  management and do not foster the establishment of independent  non-Japanese domestic firms, the chamber says in pointing to  areas where German enterprises could jump in.    Germany, in close cooperation with domestic governments,  must  offer "comprehensive packages" linking official development aid,  infrastructure projects, training and know-how transfer to  prevail over competitor Japan, the paper says.    While not excluding cooperation with Japanese networks in  Asia, the paper advocates link-ups with "non-Japanese networks  in Asia, first of all the networks of Overseas Chinese."    The proposals come after the German Government last fall  formulated a new Asia concept aimed at greater economic presence  in the Asia-Pacific area.    In its bid to make up lost ground in Asia, the German  industry ailing under a longstanding recession, high labor costs  and loss of markets in former communist countries, recently set  up an Asia- Pacific Committee.</p>

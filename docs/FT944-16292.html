			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Cardoso's congress challenge: The politics awaiting Brazil's new president Brazil's next president, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, delighted cartoonists by going fishing after he was elected on October 3. It provided an irresistible cartoon theme, since he will be spending the coming months angling for support in Congress. Mr Cardoso, who takes office on January 1, needs to build a majority in a Congress which is still maturing after Brazil's return to democracy 10 years ago. He needs three-fifths support, a more daunting prospect, to make a number of urgent constitutional reforms. Without strong backing to make these changes, his presidency could be undermined by factional disputes and become a weak coalition government, as happened with two of his three predecessors. Mr Cardoso has a number of advantages. What is most important, he was elected with more than 54 per cent of the valid votes. So he does not face the credibility problems of the current president, Mr Itamar Franco, and former president, Mr Jose Sarney, who were both promoted from vice-president rather than being directly elected. He also has the basis for a working majority in Congress. An election alliance between his Social Democracy party (PSDB), the right-wing Liberal Front (PFL) and another smaller party appears to be holding firm. These parties have 209 senators and deputies and should be able to attract enough extra votes to guarantee a congressional majority of 298 votes on many subjects. The PSDB's strong showing in the elections will also lift Mr Cardoso's power inside his coalition. The number of PSDB deputies in the lower house is likely to have increased by half to more than 60, giving it a similar strength to the historically much larger PFL. Despite these advantages, Mr Cardoso faces a number of problems. In the short term, elections for governor for some of the country's most important states were undecided last week and run-offs will be held next month. Allies of Mr Cardoso appear likely to win in three key states, Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul and Bahia. Mr Cardoso needs state governors to support his planned constitutional reforms in areas such as tax collection and state spending cuts. If his allies do win in the second round, Mr Cardoso will have the support of about half of the 27 state governors. The main obstacle to building congressional alliances is that most politicians are loyal to individual leaders or local interests rather than parties or national issues. For example, the PFL is controlled by Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes whose support helped elect 22 deputies for his home state of Bahia. Mr Magalhaes is backing Mr Cardoso for the moment. But he or other conservative PFL leaders may not support some of Mr Cardoso's more adventurous social policies, for example on resettling landless farmers. A further complicating factor is that about half the new Congress members were elected for the first time, making it difficult to predict how they will act. 'It's going to take (Mr Cardoso) time to build a majority and it won't be unconditional; it will be on a case-by-case basis,' says Mr Alexandre Barros, a political consultant. On some subjects, Mr Cardoso will look for support from the Democratic Movement party (PMDB), the country's largest. Its candidate, Mr Orestes Quercia, polled less than 5 per cent of votes in the presidential election and is likely to want the party to oppose Mr Cardoso. But, says Mr Luiz Pedone, a political scientist, there are four different factions in the PMDB, and Mr Quercia's appears on the decline. Mr Sarney, now a PMDB senator, may back Mr Cardoso and take several PMDB deputies with him. The party's supporters in Rio Grande do Sul also favour supporting Mr Cardoso rather than Mr Quercia, and may even risk splitting the party. Even if Mr Cardoso wins over a majority of the PMDB, he may not have the three-fifths support of Congress needed for constitutional changes. Most analysts agree the tax and social security systems need to be completed quickly so as to protect the government's budget. Some proposals, for example increasing the central government's tax take or lifting the retirement age, can only be approved via constitutional amendments and are likely to be unpopular. The left-wing Workers' party (PT), which will form the nucleus of opposition, did well in the congressional elections on October 3, increasing its number of senators from one to five and that of its deputies from 36 to 50. With other left-wing parties, the PT has about half the 156 votes needed to block any constitutional amendments. Mr Cardoso is therefore likely to be forced to make a series of shifting alliances to win support from the right to pass reforms in areas such as tax reform, and from the left on social issues. Juggling these interests will be difficult, although Mr Cardoso has proved a skilled negotiator. The danger is that with the private sector urging him to act quickly to capitalise on enthusiasm about his election, it will take time to negotiate these alliances and proposals will be watered down. There is little chance of constitutional changes being proposed to Congress this year, and negotiations may not begin until after the Carnival festival next February. Mr Francisco Weffort, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo, says Mr Cardoso will be able to carry off the juggling act if he guarantees to opponents and allies that certain sensitive parts of the constitution will not be changed. As an example, he suggests Mr Cardoso may push for the lifting of the state's oil monopoly and allow foreign competition by agreeing not to privatise Petrobras, the state-owned oil company, which many politicians still see as a strategic national asset. 'He will need to reach some sort of understanding on what can and cannot be touched for constitutional changes to go ahead,' Mr Weffort says.</p>

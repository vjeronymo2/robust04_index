			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prompted by the statements of  the Bulgarian foreign minister and the increasing presence of  articles in certain media in Bulgaria, the Federal Government  reviewed the position of the Bulgarian minority in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. It was concluded that an official  document of the FRY Government should be prepared and submitted  to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It was stressed at  the session that 25,000 Bulgarians, mainly living in  Dimitrovgrad and Bosilegrad, enjoy all the individual and  collective rights that are stipulated by our Constitution and  the highest international standards. The only children's  magazine that is published in the language of an ethnic minority  and that is financed by the federal state is a magazine in the  Bulgarian language. Two-thirds of the deputies in the  Dimitrovgrad communal assembly are Bulgarian. This is how Prime  Minister Kontic assessed the broaching of the issue of the  Bulgarian minority in the FRY:    [Begin Kontic recording] Turning attention away from the  problem, that is, [words indistinct] both individual and  collective rights of ethnic minorities in Bulgaria -- which is a  well-known problem in Bulgaria -- and focusing it on the rights  of the Bulgarian minority in neighboring countries. This is a  well- known method of drawing the attention of one's public to  some other issue. Secondly, we believe that this is actually  part of a scenario drawn up by certain outside factors, and part  of an additional and planned pressure on the FRY aimed at  achieving the greatest possible destabilization before the  decisive negotiations regarding the Srpska republic and the  republic of Serbian Krajina, so that optimal results are  achieved for the other side.

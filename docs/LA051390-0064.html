			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ FORCED TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AGAIN  </P> <P> As the Utah Jazz players cleaned out their lockers and split their playoff  money, team owner Larry H. Miller puzzled over their failure to make it past  the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year.  </P> <P> The Jazz, leading 95-86 with 6:55 to play in the fifth and deciding game of the  Western Conference quarterfinal Sunday, went cold down the stretch and lost  104-102 when Phoenix Suns' guard Kevin Johnson scored with eight-tenths of a  second to play.  </P> <P> "This is a very difficult one to accept," Miller said Monday. "I feel a lot of  frustration and anger right now."  </P> <P> The millionaire car dealer said he remained "unequivocally" committed to Coach  Jerry Sloan, who led Utah to a record 55 wins in the regular season. But the  Jazz roster will get a hard look, Miller said, though "not until we have time  to allow emotions to drain off."  </P> <P> "If I'd made the decisions yesterday, I'd probably have changed all 12 of  them," he added with disgust.  </P> <P> Sloan and Scott Layden, director of player personnel, indicated wholesale  changes in the roster were not likely.  </P> <P> The players autographed souvenirs, distributed their summer phone numbers and  divided their $69,375 playoff money into 13 shares.  </P> <P> "No one thought it would be over this quick," Karl Malone said. "It's one of  those things; you can't do anything about it now. But we wanted to play on.  Just winning the Midwest Division (in 1989) and 55 games isn't enough any  more."  </P> <P> John Stockton, a red welt on his neck from Sunday's action, said the playoff  loss didn't take anything away from the Jazz' best season ever.  </P> <P> "It's disappointing, but you can't cash in your whole future for it," he said.  "We'll just have to get started again, to improve both individually and as a  team."  </P> <P> Miller said there was no doubt that losing a crucial playoff game at home --  where the Jazz were 36-5 this season -- was worse than the Golden State  Warriors' lopsided sweep last year.  </P> <P> "This is a lot more frustrating. To get that close and not get the job done,"  he said.  </P> <P> Miller would discuss little of his intentions regarding player personnel, but  offered, "I think we've got to do some things next year.  </P> <P> "We clearly need to get some outside shooting to take pressure off Karl  (Malone)," he said, noting that opponents were able to "double, triple, even  quadruple cover" the All-Star forward this season.  </P> <P> While denying any trades are in the works, Miller said he had expected more  from off-guard Bobby Hansen, a seventh-year pro who averaged 7.6 points a game,  and second-year backup center Eric Leckner, averaging 4.3 points.  </P> <P> "Bobby has played well in streaks," he said. "This year, he's been in a Jekyll  and Hyde syndrome. (But) today, I'm not aware of any urgent need to do anything  there."  </P> <P> He said Sloan and Layden feel Leckner has a lot of talent. "I hope that  sometime soon with him we see more of that come through. He gets so many fouls  early," he said.  </P> <P> The Jazz did not pick up the contract of Darrell Griffith and he will become an  unrestricted free agent on July 1.  </P> <P> "I would like to come back.... My No.1 choice would be to come back here," said  Griffith, 31, Utah's No.1 draft pick in 1980 and the team's all-time leader in  games played at 670. "If it doesn't wor out here, hopefully it will somewhere  else."  </P> <P> Layden said he could not comment on whether Giffith will be with the Jazz next  year.  </P> <P> As for major roster changes, Layden sad, "We don't want to screw up what we  have. . . . Collectively, counting all 12 guys, this is a unique group."  </P> <P> "At the end of the season, unless you win a championship, everybody assumes you  have to make changes because you lost," Sloan said. "Of course we want to make  ourselves better. But we're not going to make drastic changes because of  outside pressure."  </P> <P> If Johnson's last shot and missed and the Jazz had moved into the second round,  "the last question that anybody's going to ask is, 'What changes are you going  to make?"' Layden said. "Because of that, we don't want to do anything rash or  out of character for this franchise."  </P></p>

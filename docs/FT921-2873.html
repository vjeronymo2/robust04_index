			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Arts: The forgotten expressionist - Otto Dix at the Tate and in Edinburgh With the full retrospective study of the German painter, Otto Dix, which has come to the Tate Gallery from Stuttgart (where it was organised) and Berlin, and the coincidental exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, of his works on paper in the collection of the Dresden Print Room, again covering his full career, we may at last see clearly the life's work of this important artist. It is not so much that Otto Dix alone, but that a whole generation of German artists was all but forgotten, except for its work of the brief, hectic period of the Weimar Republic. The social and satirical expressionism of George Grosz and Max Beckmann, and of Dix himself, was known well, but of what else they and their contemporaries achieved over full working lives we knew little and saw less. Yet Grosz and Beckmann lived on until 1959; Schlicter until 1955; Hubbuch and Schad well into the 1980s; and Dix himself until 1969. Not until quite recently, through such revisionist shows as the Arts Council's Neue Sachlichkeit of 1979, Les Realismes at the Centre Pompidou in 1982 and similar exercises, did it become apparent that the story was somewhat more rich and complicated. Was such critical myopia more convenient than real? Many of those artists had gone into exile after the rise of Hitler to power; and quite as many remained at home. Only by luck did no artist of manifest distinction emerge from the Nazi period. Even so, the Royal Academy's survey of German art in the 20th century left a large hole that the 1930s and '40s should have filled. Political correctness is new only in name. Dix was one who remained in Nazi Germany, an internal emigrant, taking his family to the country, eventually settling at Hemmenhofen near Lake Constance. He was called up at the age of 53 to serve through the last desperate months of the War, and in April 1945 was taken prisoner. On his release he returned home to what was now East Germany and to life under communism. While to him, with his bleakly misanthropic cast of mind, it would seem all one, to the world at large such resignation might well seem acceptance of more positive a sort. As an active artist Dix all but disappears from view, except in his own country. There the influence of his coded symbolism of the Hitler years has proved itself potent still, and unmistakeable. Dix's own post-war work is disappointing, a competent and painterly figurative expressionism after the manner of the Parisian mainstream: shades of Picasso, Clave, Braque, underscored with a dour symbolism. But it is the mark of the true artist that even his bad work remains interesting, and Dix was nothing if not inconsistent, never afraid to over-reach himself. If in these late works we see him withdrawn and self-contained, the contrast with the large symbolic machines of the Nazi middle years, 'The Triumph of Death' or 'The Temptation of Saint Anthony', is only the stronger. Such paintings as these, with their conscious reversion to the German and Flemish tradition of the late Renaissance, are overblown, uneven, extravagant in ambition, in a sense wonderfully bad, yet wonderful is a proper compliment. The several small landscapes, after Breughel and Altdorfer, by which he made a living, are exquisite, the realist self-portrait of 1942 magnificent. There was nothing inconsistent in the looking back, for that was where Dix began as a student in Dresden before 1914, looking quite as much at Cranach, Durer and Van Eyck as at anything of cubism, futurism or any other modernism. While such current examples would preoccupy him in their turn, especially during the earlier part of his career, it was with that larger, older, encompassing realist tradition that he would always identify himself. Dix volunteered in 1914 and served throughout the Great War. What work he found time to do pointed no moral on the horror and futility of it all. His remarkable drawings of the trench landscape, shown to advantage in Edinburgh, are objective and topographical, almost pastoral, exactly comparable to the working drawings of Nash and Lewis and their British war-artist colleagues. Only some time afterwards is a more searching and despairing response expressed, in the suite of 50 etchings, Der Krieg, of 1924, with their eroded, visually erosive images of death and mutilation. A direct comparison is with Goya's 'Disasters of War', some of which are shown in Edinburgh in a pendant display along with woodcuts and engravings of Cranach, Durer, Baldung and others. For Dix the suite marks not so much the turn to a particular kind of imagery so much as a change of heart. He had been painting mutilated ex-servicemen and low-life imagery in general, whores and pimps and the like, for a year or two. But what was lively and robust, almost jolly in a black sort of way, was now to become bleak and, if not unforgiving, at least unblinking in its view of the human condition. The work becomes more straightforward, less directly engaged with the formal devices of the current avant-garde. Dix was well capable of the direct and unaffected approach, and had already painted a notably ravishing portrait of his wife in a red hat. But the years after 1924, especially after his move from Dusseldorf to Berlin in 1925, and on to Dresden in 1927, were to see his finest work, finest of all the portraits and the nudes. With them Dix truly returns to the old northern humanist tradition, with its clearer drawing, thin paint and thinner glazes. His subjects are treated not satirically, but all too truthfully, their figures set at just the right exaggerated curve, their features pointed with just too wicked an emphasis, their every vanity and frailty exposed. The professional model shrinks away, covering herself, as who would not before that baleful gaze. The Otto Dix exhibitions continue at the Tate until May 17, sponsored by Beck's Bier and The Independent; and until May 10 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the German government.</p>

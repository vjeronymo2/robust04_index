			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGSLEY'S ENGLISH  </P> <P> The career of Kingsley Amis stands on its own and needs no defense from me. But  it would be a great loss if readers unfamiliar with it were so put off by  Rubin's casual (and totally unsupported) dismissal of his life's work in her  review of "The Folks" that they missed out on such recent delights as "The Old  Devils," which won the Booker Prize as Britain's best novel of 1986.  </P> <P> DICK ADLER  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA  </P></p>

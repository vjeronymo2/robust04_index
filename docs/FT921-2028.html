			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Teleglobe monopoly extended CANADA'S federal govern-ment has extended Teleglobe Canada's monopoly on overseas telecommunications for another five years. Any other course of action would allow international competitors to fragment Canada's small telecommunications market and hamper its global development, said Mr Perrin Beatty, federal communications minister. 'Canadian telecommunications players must be able to compete internationally,' he added. He said the five-year extension would allow Teleglobe to plan ahead, and after 1997 the 'exclusive mandate' would be reviewed again. Control of Teleglobe management has shifted recently to Bell Canada, the eastern Canada telecommunications utility, and its parent BCE has taken over leadership of the whole trans-Canada public telecommunications system. Both the government and BCE believe a single public system, including Teleglobe and its international gateways, is needed to enable Canadian rates to compete effectively with AT&amp;T of the US. They fear more and more Canadian voice and data traffic from overseas could be routed through the US. BCE and the trans-Canada system, now called Stentor, have taken the first steps in cementing global links.</p>

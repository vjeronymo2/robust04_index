			<p>BFN     [Text] In a special session with the Speaker and members  of the House of Representatives in the Pictures Hall at the  parliament building today, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali reviewed a number of national and foreign issues. Dr.  al-Majali also spoke about where the government stood on  regional developments.    House Speaker Tahir al-Masri, told journalists after the  meeting that one of the topics that figured prominently at the  session was the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. The prime  minister, said al-Masri, underscored the importance of these  ties and Jordan's keenness to maintain coordination that  advances, first, the Palestinian cause and the new Palestinian  situation and, second, the interests of the two countries.    The prime minister said the present level of coordination  fell short of expectations and has not been as effective as we  would have liked. The prime minister, added al-Masri, stressed  that Jordan was committed to a role of support for the  Palestinian cause, no matter what the obstacles, and free from  any ambitions or any attempt to dominate.    The prime minister, according to al-Masri, had paid tribute  to Jordanian-Egyptian relations. He emphasized that the  meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee had helped  solidify these ties. Relations with Syria also have a special  significance, given that the two countries' stands were similar  and complementary on the negotiations and the potential for  bilateral and regional cooperation.    The prime minister also said at the session that Jordan  stood  for a halt to fighting in brotherly Yemen and a hands-off  policy. Jordan was against taking sides and for legitimacy and  unity. Al- Masri further noted that the prime minister had  vigorously denied 'Ali Salim al-Bid's contention that Jordan was  extending assistance to the Yemeni Government in Sanaa. He  regretted that such an unjust charge should have been made by  al-Bid against Jordan, which had given his majesty the king a  mandate to take whatever measures he deemed would advance  Yemen's unity. All that Jordan did was to airlift Jordanian and  other nationals from Yemen on purely humanitarian grounds to  spare them the risks involved in a war situation, explained the  house speaker.    The prime minister, went on al-Masri, reported to the  deputies on the state of the negotiations between Jordan and  Israel and the agenda of the meeting to be held in Washington  tomorrow. He stressed that Jordan adheres to its declared  constants. There will not be a separate deal on the Jordanian  front, the prime minister was quoted as emphasizing by the house  speaker.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Mixed trend as doubts arise over jobless data Wall Street US SHARE prices ended with no clear trend in moderate trading yesterday, after an unexpectedly poor set of jobless claims data had raised worries that today's March employment report would reveal renewed weakness in the labour market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.33 at 3,439.44. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.37 down at 450.30, while the American SE composite ended 0.66 easier at 422.77 and the Nasdaq composite 3.49 off at 686.64. New York SE volume came to 234.5m shares. There was no follow-through from Wednesday's late declines, primarily because the selling was attributed to institutional investors unwinding options positions in listed and over-the-counter stocks. The market, in fact, was resilient, brushing off the morning's employment news, which showed a much larger than expected 33,000 rise in weekly jobless claims. Normally, the figures might have frightened investors, because they suggested that the labour market continues to struggle in spite of recent improvements in economic growth. Investors, however, chose to wait for today's more important and revealing March employment report. Analysts are expecting it to show a rise of between 75,000 and 100,000 in non-farm payrolls. If the figure comes in well below that range, then the sell-off that might have followed yesterday's jobless claims release could be triggered. The day's other main piece of economic news - a small decline in the National Association of Purchasing Management's March index of business activity - had little discernible impact on market sentiment, although the figures added to other recent data which suggest that economic growth in the first quarter may have slowed from the strong rates seen at the end of 1992. Drug shares featured again. After posting gains early on Wednesday on reports that the Clinton administration may not, after all, consider imposing controls on pharmaceuticals prices, many of the leading issues have run into concerted selling. Among the biggest stocks, Pfizer fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 , Merck slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 34 3/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson receded Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 and Schering-Plough lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 59. Cable television stocks tumbled after the Fed Communications Commission voted to set a benchmark for prices charged by the industry. Cablevision fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 , Time Warner Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33, Comcast Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 and TCI Dollars 2 to Dollars 20 1/2 . Merrill Lynch advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 in busy trading on figures which showed that it had retained its position in the first quarter as the biggest underwriter of stock and bonds in the US. On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were mixed. Microsoft gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 93 and Apple Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 51 3/4 , but Intel lost Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 111 1/2 . Canada TORONTO posted a modest gain after active trading. The TSE 300 index finished 12.1 higher at 3,614.5 and advances led declines by 395 to 292 after volume of 66.8m shares. Talisman Energy said a venture with Amoco Canada Petroleum reported a major wildcat gas discovery in the Sukunka in British Columbia. The stock rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 20 1/4 .</p>

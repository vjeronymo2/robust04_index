The braking of the economic ties that have taken shape, the  obsolete technical and technological base, the exhaustion of  natural resources, and other circumstances -- very important as  they are -- are now retreating to second place after mutual  nonpayments based on their impact on the decline in industrial  production, business activity, hidden and obvious unemployment,  delays in paying wages, and, as a consequence, the increase of  social tension in society.    The mutual indebtedness of economic agents in a market  economy is a normal phenomenon caused by the expansion of credit  and monetary relationships and one that insures the  uninterrupted operation of the economic mechanism; however, the  failure of economic agents to fulfill the financial obligations  assumed by them automatically leads to their bankruptcy.    Under our conditions with the absence of an effective  bankruptcy mechanism, the overdue indebtedness of the main  economic agents has acquired a mass nature. Whereas the total  creditor indebtedness of industrial, construction, transport,  and agricultural enterprises and organizations was 48 trillion  rubles at the end of 1993, overdue liabilities were 17 trillion  rubles, that is, more than 35 percent. Correspondingly, the  incurred debt on 1 January 1994 was equal to 47 trillion rubles,  including an overdue indebtedness of 18 trillion rubles, i.e.,  more than 38 percent.    Of the total amount of overdue creditor and incurred  liabilities, 77 and 79 percent, respectively, fall to industry's  share.    Of all the incurred and creditor indebtedness items,  "Indebtedness of Buyers" and "Indebtedness to Suppliers," which  compose approximately 70 percent of the incurred and creditor  indebtedness, respectively, have paramount importance for  industrial production.    Late payment for products received leads not only to a  worsening of the enterprises' financial condition but also  disrupts the production process and, in a number of cases, leads  to its stoppage. Moreover, these types of obligations are  transmitted from one enterprise to another over the existing  cooperation ties, causing a chain reaction of nonpayments. The  state itself is aggravating the situation that has taken shape  by delaying payments to enterprises for the products produced in  accordance with its orders.    The overdue indebtedness of industrial enterprises to their  suppliers is less than the indebtedness of buyers to these  enterprises by more than 3 trillion rubles.    In other words, industry is emerging to a certain degree as  a  creditor for the other branches of the national economy and the  budget. Almost all industrial branches, except for non-ferrous  metallurgy and the flour, cereal and animal feed industries,  have a positive balance in their mutual debts but the  nonpayments of electrical energy buyers exceed this branch's  debt to suppliers by more than twofold.    The branch structure of overdue indebtedness in industry is  described by the following data (without considering debts for  deliveries within the framework of intergovernmental agreements).

Correspondingly, its debts to  suppliers form the largest percentage in the debts of all  industry -- 27 percent. In this regard, the percentage of the  branch's overdue indebtedness in the overall indebtedness of  industry significantly exceeds its percentage in the total  production volume, that is, the burden of mutual nonpayments is  felt most sharply in the fuel industry.    The amount of overdue debt -- both that of buyers and that  to  suppliers -- in industry during 1993 fell somewhat considering  inflation. Thus, the total overdue debt to suppliers increased  eightfold and prices grew 9-10-fold during this period.    However, the nonpayment burden did not become lighter  because  of this since the decline in production continued and,  correspondingly, the potential capabilities of the enterprises  to fulfill their financial obligations narrowed.    An analysis of the dynamics of industrial production volume  and of the overdue indebtedness growth during 1993 shows that  the intensiveness (burden) of mutual nonpayments in industrial  enterprises grew.    Thus, according to the center's calculations, the ratio of  quarterly increases in overdue liabilities to production volume  increased more than twofold during the year.

It is in these branches and also in the chemical and  petrochemical industry that the "burden" of mutual indebtedness  is the highest.    The worsening of the enterprises' financial condition owing  to the increase in the burden of mutual nonpayments is also  confirmed by an analysis of the enterprises' ability to pay.    According to the results of the first half of the year, the  monetary assets, which enterprises had available, exceeded  overdue indebtedness to the suppliers 1.24-fold but these assets  covered the mentioned indebtedness by only 57.4 percent by the  end of the year.    Whereas within the structure of all industry, the power  industry, fuel industry, machine building and metal working, and  the glass, china and pottery industry had an excess of monetary  assets over the overdue indebtedness to suppliers at the end of  the first half of 1993, the debts significantly exceeded all  existing enterprise financial assets by the end of last year in  all branches of industry. This is described by the following  data:                      Monetary assets as a percentage   Profitability of                    of overdue indebtedness to        production[.sup]*[/], %                    suppliers                     1 January   1 July    1 January                    1993        1993      1994   Industry          79.9        124.6     57.4        37.2   Power industry    154.3       119.9     34.1        24.7   Fuel industry     132.7       225.4     83.3        25.6   Ferrous           31.1        72.1      21.2        64.1  metallurgy   Non-ferrous       57.7        71.0      82.9        47.2  metallurgy   Chemical and      38.7        54.3      17.1        44.7  petrochemical   Machine           69.5        119.3     52.1        48.4  building and  metal working   Wood,             57.2        70.5      32.1        28.4  woodworking,  wood-pulp and  paper industry   Construction      33.0        55.3      20.8        34.0  materials  industry   Light industry    68.7        86.5      48.3        38.6   Food industry     281.1       98.9      62.7        26.2   Flour, cereals    69.3        29.5      19.1        11.3  and animal feed  industry   [.sup]*[/]Profit related to the cost of commodity products, during the  first nine months of 1993.      The enterprises of ferrous metallurgy, the chemical and  petrochemical industry, the construction materials industry, and  the flour, cereal and animal fodder industry are in a critical  condition based on their ability to pay.    It is typical that the low ability of industrial enterprises  to pay is frequently accompanied by a high or super-high  production profitability in a number of branches.    Thus, production profitability in ferrous metallurgy was 64  percent and 45-48 percent in the chemical and petrochemical  industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and machine building and metal  working.    The liberalization of prices led to substantial pressure on  the effective demand for products of a production and technical  nature and consumer goods. Enterprises tried to compensate for  the reduction in the sales volume of products and the amounts of  earned monetary assets, which followed this, not by reducing  costs and increasing the quality of products but by an  additional increase in prices. As a result, the market is  narrowing even more, the demand for products is decreasing,  their sales and receipts are again falling, and the way out is  seen to be a new price increase.    The high degree of monopolization in our domestic industry  is  exerting a definite influence on the level of prices.    The Russian Federation's Government has outlined a series of  measures to solve the nonpayments problem, in particular,  repaying federal budget debts for 1993, legalizing overdue  indebtedness by promissory notes, checking on the condition of  inefficient production facilities, increasing the responsibility  of banks for timely settlement, launching a mechanism for  sanctions and the carrying out of bankruptcies, and other  measures.    Only the integrated use of these measures and the very  active  participation of regional management structures, commercial  banks and enterprises themselves based on agreements with  subcontractors and the consumers of their products will permit  the problem of mutual nonpayments to be solved.    The implementation of the listed measures will not suffer  delays: During January 1994 alone, the total overdue creditor  indebtedness in the national economy increased another 3  trillion rubles. The overdue incurred debt increased just as  much.    Solving the nonpayments problem will contribute to ending  the  crisis phase and stopping the production decline.    At the same time, one cannot permit the elimination of  enterprises producing vitally necessary products, whose closing  would inflict harm on the country's defense and economic  security. However, the state must also consider the interests of  the creditors when solving this question and, possibly, itself  assuming the repayment of these enterprises' debts.</p>

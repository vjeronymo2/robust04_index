			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET NEWSLETTER ;  </P> <P> THE LATIN DEBT QUAGMIRE: UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY NO. 8  </P> <P> The Latin American debt "crisis" is approaching its eighth anniversary, with  most of the region's debtor countries no closer to resolving their grim  economic and financial problems.  </P> <P> Although borrowing by Latin American debtors has slowed to a near-halt, they  are not receiving enough money from other sources to finance the broad  restructuring of their economies that is necessary to lay the foundation for  growth.  </P> <P> In the absence of new sources of cash, a growing number of Latin American  countries have been solving their debt problems by default -- that is, by  refusing to pay the interest on their outstanding loans from commercial banks.  The Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based monitoring group set  up by commercial banks, says the amount of interest payments in arrears from  eight key Latin American countries has surged from just over $1 billion in 1985  to $16.9 billion in 1989.  </P> <P> Barry F. Sullivan, chairman of the First National Bank of Chicago and head of  the Institute's board of directors, calls the increase "alarming." Unless some  action is taken soon, Sullivan warns, "more serious difficulties lie ahead for  these countries."  </P> <P> Bankers and many other critics blame the Brady Plan, the sweeping Third World  debt reduction scheme proffered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.  The plan, launched in March, 1989, has been adopted by creditor countries as  the new global debt strategy. Arguing that new loans only exacerbate the  problem, the Brady Plan seeks to slash debt burdens by enabling banks to get  rid of problem loans by selling them -- at a discount -- to the debtor  countries, which finance them through World Bank-backed bonds. So far, Mexico,  Costa Rica, the Philippines, Morocco and, soon, Venezuela have been the major  beneficiaries of the plan. Brady has declared it a first-year success, as have  finance ministers of the other major industrial nations that have embraced the  scheme.  </P> <P> But critics argue that the scheme has provided little real benefit to the  participating countries -- and may well have been a factor in cutting off the  new bank loans that Latin governments need to finance their badly needed  economic reforms. Although bank lending to Third World countries was tapering  off rapidly before the Brady Plan was put into effect, it has now all but dried  up. "You can't ask banks to take a hit by discounting their loans and then prod  them to make new ones on top of that," one critic says. At the same time,  analysts say the plan's emphasis on debt-reduction is misguided. Ordinarily, if  a country receives $1 in new loans, it has 90 cents to spend -- what is left  over after interest. But if its debt burden is cut instead, it gains only the  interest saved -- about a dime.  </P> <P> Although Brady doesn't seem ready to scrap his initiative, the plan is being  transformed -- by the marketplace. Despite the Treasury's emphasis on  debt-reduction, the new package being negotiated by Venezuela has a large  new-lending component. Others may follow suit. A close look at recent "Brady  Plan" packages shows that the rubric is now being applied to virtually any deal  that the debtors and creditors can hammer out. The debt-reduction package put  together for the Philippines leans heavily on bank lending.  </P> <P> Officials of the large industrial countries may formally encourage such a  liberal interpretation at the annual seven-nation economic summit, to be held  in Houston in July. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund already have  laid the groundwork for such a switch.  </P> <P> The scarcity of new financing is forcing some countries to look inward and to  begin making badly needed economic reforms on their own. Partly because of the  dearth of available money elsewhere, Mexico has engineered sweeping changes  that would have been politically unthinkable even three years ago -- selling  off inefficient state-owned industries, liberalizing trade and welcoming  foreign investment.  </P> <P> Brazil's newly elected president, Fernando Collor de Mello, also has moved  swiftly to embrace free-market economic programs. Venezuela is beginning to  move. Even Peru, which has been the region's bad boy on debt issues since 1985,  is expected to return to the fold soon.  </P> <P> Some of the shift stems from fears by the Latin governments that they had  better move quickly before available money is diverted to Eastern Europe.  Several of the region's top economic policy makers already have issued pleas  urging creditor governments not to flee. The worry was a prime topic of  corridor conversation among finance ministers of developing countries at the  meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank earlier this month.  </P> <P> Many Third World officials are bitter over Eastern Europe, which they consider  a newcomer and far better able to attract capital than their own countries. But  industrial countries have seemed unfazed by the appeals. Put your houses in  order, they are telling the Third World countries.  </P> <P> For now, the economic situation in Latin America ranges from tolerable to  plainly grim. Mexico, Venezuela and Costa Rica are experiencing modest economic  growth, with diminishing inflation. And Chile, Uruguay and Colombia are  essentially under control. But Brazil and Argentina are going through traumatic  periods now, with substantial uncertainty about how well they will fare. And  the region's smaller countries -- such as Ecuador, Honduras, Jamaica, Peru, and  Nicaragua -- are in terrible shape.  </P> <P> New figures show that per-capita income in Latin America fell 1% over the  region as a whole in 1989 for the second year in a row. By contrast, it grew  steadily during the mid-1980s. At the same time, inflation across the region is  more virulent than ever.  </P> <P> Much of the fate of the region's economies will depend on the strength of the  world economy over the next few years, analysts here say. If the industrial  nations can maintain moderate growth and keep their markets open, Latin America  will eke by. If not, a slump is certain.  </P> <P> The region's biggest problem remains inflation, which is exacerbating the Latin  countries' own internal debt -- the borrowing that governments must do at home  to help finance their budget deficits. The internal debt crisis has become a  far bigger strain on their resources than foreign debt. Brazil, for example,  consistently has run a trade surplus of $16 billion to $19 billion for the past  several years -- the world's third-largest, after Japan's and West Germany's --  but has been unable to pay its foreign creditors easily, in large part because  of its own debt crisis.  </P> <P> As a result, some experts believe that the real battleground over the next few  months will be an effort by debtor countries to persuade governments -- and  international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank -- to write off large  portions of their Latin American loans, much as commercial banks already have.  </P> <P> Peter Hakim, staff director of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based  research group, says the Brady Plan, which deals solely with debt owed to  commercial banks, "has no meaning for" countries such as Jamaica, which have  borrowed almost entirely from governments.  </P> <P> Hakim believes that the debt problem, which seems relatively quiet now, could  re-emerge early next year, particularly if the U.S. economy begins to soften.  "Right now, it's off the front pages," he says. "But it could be back again --  soon."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latin Debtor Nations: A Sampling: How far eight countries have fallen behind on  their debt, compared with the figure for each one five years ago.  </P> <P> Source: The Institute of International Finance, Inc.  </P></p>

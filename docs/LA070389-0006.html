			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX PENALTY  </P> <P> For the second time in three years, I received my property tax bill with a  penalty. Each time this unwelcomed surprise has occurred, I had just bought a  new property.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County tax assessor's office is supposed to send out the bills  in October, but if it fails to do so, that's too bad, according to both my  escrow office and the Long Beach office for tax information. The property owner  has to pay the tax plus penalty -- this year it amounted to $178 over and above  the basic rate.  </P> <P> When I contacted an attorney to see if I had any rights, the secretary chuckled  and said, "I don't know if we can help you." At that point, I decided to pay  the penalty. Why pay a lawyer's fee if nothing can be done?  </P> <P> This situation is a rip-off. Yet, I feel helpless and wonder how many others  are being duped by our county tax structure.  </P> <P> More importantly, who is pocketing all the excess in collected revenue?  </P> <P> GERALD P. LUNDERVILLE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Greece gears up for telecoms flotation - International offerings The long-awaited flotation of OTE, the Greek state telecoms monopoly, is finally taking shape, with the government hoping to raise more than Dr320bn (Dollars 1.3bn) from selling 25 per cent of the company to domestic and overseas investors at the end of November. As some 18 per cent of the company's equity will be placed with institutions abroad, OTE's management is gearing up for road-shows around Europe, the US and Japan. CS First Boston and Schroders, global co-ordinators for the issue, are managing an underwriting syndicate of 10 investment banks that includes Lehman Brothers, S. G. Warburg and Yamaichi of Japan. To boost investors' confidence in the offering, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister and architect of Greece's revised privatisation programme, will be on hand for OTE's presentations in London and New York. Doubts remain to be dispelled after last year's attempt to dispose of 49 per cent of OTE, plus management rights, fell through as a result of political wrangling and fierce opposition from the company's trade union. This time, the government is treading more carefully, pledging that OTE will remain under state management, but as one official put it: 'It's going to operate like any private Greek corporation.' New legislation due to be approved by parliament in the next two weeks provides for substantive price rises for local calls so that OTE's domestic network can break even by 1997. The company's pension obligations, another drain on earnings, are to be capped at Dr11bn a year and it will stop subsidising ELTA, the loss-making Greek postal service, at the end of 1994. Last year, OTE reported pre-tax profits of Dr129bn on turnover of Dr389bn. Earnings forecasts for 1994 are buoyant, thanks to the expansion of card phones, which are bringing in over Dr10bn a month in new revenue. However, analysts agree the question of management will affect the price of the offering, to be determined by a three-week book-building exercise among overseas investors. Mr Victor Pisante of Telesis Capital says: 'The commitment to state management is likely to have a negative effect on pricing. To protect its future, OTE needs to make a strategic alliance, like other European telecoms operators are doing.' OTE officials are reluctant to give details of their business plan before the new law goes through. But they are already hiring foreign executives to handle marketing and new product development. OTE also plans to enter Greece's fast-growing mobile telephony market, preferably by acquiring a stake in one of the country's two GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) operators, Telestet, controlled by Stet of Italy, and Panafon, in which Vodafone of the UK has a sizeable holding. The issue's domestic tranche will require careful handling, given the limits on liquidity at the Athens bourse. After some Dr15bn of the offering is stripped out for sale at a discount to OTE employees and pensioners, shares worth about Dr75bn will be offered to domestic investors. However, this would still be triple the amount raised in Greece's largest public offering to date. To ensure as wide a share distribution as possible, National Bank of Greece, which is managing the domestic tranche, is expected to include almost all the country's 20 banks in its underwriting syndicate. The government will also be trying to ensure the success of the flotation by launching an advertising campaign aimed at attracting small investors.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Restructured Burnfield turns in Pounds 1.41m BURNFIELD, a manufacturer of electric surface heating systems, returned profits of Pounds 1.41m pre-tax and exceptional items for the 11 months to end-December. For the previous 12 months the group, which has been restructured and now operates under a new management team, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.06m. Turnover for the period under review totalled Pounds 15.31m (Pounds 17.03m). Exceptional items accounted for Pounds 701,000 (nil) and tax for Pounds 542,000 (Pounds 868,000). Extraordinary provisions of Pounds 3.06m reflected reorganisation costs and a deferred tax write-off. Excluding exceptional items, earnings per share emerged at 7.5p (10.8p) basic or at 7p (9.5p) fully diluted. An unchanged final dividend of 3.85p makes a same-again 5.5p total.</p>

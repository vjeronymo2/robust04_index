			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Muslim clergyman said on Iranian television that he had spied for the United  States, supplying information about factional divisions among his country's  ruling clerics. Heshmatollah Maqsoodi, 58, said that on a trip to the United  States last year, he also had a 30-minute meeting with Reza Pahlavi, son of the  late Shah of Iran who was toppled by the Islamic revolution 10 years ago.  Maqsoodi, who is also an attorney, said he made his first contact with the CIA  last year when he applied for a visa at a U.S. consulate in West Germany. The  arrest of Maqsoodi and others accused of working for the CIA was announced in  April.  </P></p>

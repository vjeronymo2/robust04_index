			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 26 (AFP) -- The GATT deal to remove  trade barriers will prompt Arab farmers to upgrade production to  face competition, but it will also raise the region's already  large food import bill, Arab officials and experts said on  Sunday [26 June].    Although they form less than five percent of the world  population, the Arab League's 22 members account for nearly 12  percent of total world farm imports, according to official Arab  figures.    The agricultural imports averaged 23 billion dollars a year  over the past decade, while exports did not exceed five billion  dollars, said Ma'mun Hasan, director of the Kuwait-based Arab  Corporation for Investment Guarantee (ACIG).    "When subsidies on farm output are removed, in line with the  recent accord by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  world food prices will naturally rise," he told the United Arab  Emirates daily AL-FAJR.    "This will have two effects. It will force Arab states to  pay more for food while it will also encourage farmers to  upgrade output to face competition and get higher prices for  their products."    Several Arab states are now members of the Geneva-based  GATT,  which has turned into a new group called the World Trade  Organisation.    The deal signed in Morocco two months ago called for  removing  trade barriers among its nearly 120 members and lifting  subsidies on national products.    Experts said Saudi Arabia would suffer more than other Arab  states from the agreement, as it spends billions of dollars on  agricultural subsidies, mainly for wheat.    Other Gulf states also subsidise vegetable and fruit in a  bid  to achieve self-sufficiency.    Outside the Gulf, political instability, lack of investment  and poor infrastructure are blamed for the deterioration of the  agricultural sector in Arab countries.    "Development of the farming sector in Sudan could solve the  Arab food problems, as it has vast arable areas," a Gulf-based  expert said.    "But Sudan has no funds, its infrastructure is primitive and  the country is threatened with disintegration because of the  civil war. Only a crazy investor will put his funds into the  farming sector now."    The situation in other fertile Arab countries is not much  better.    Iraq is facing international sanctions and an uncertain  political situation, and Algeria is hit by Moslem militant  unrest.    Somalia, also a member of the Arab League, is torn by civil  war.    The four countries account for more than 70 percent of the  total arable area in the Arab world, estimated at 198 million  hectares.    So far only 27 percent of the land has been exploited due to  lack of investment.    The rapid growth in Arab population has combined with such  problems to aggravate the region's food gap, the difference  between farm imports and exports.    According to the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund [AMF],  the cumulative Arab food import bill totalled around 210 billion  dollars between 1980 and 1990, while exports stood at only 40  billion dollars.    A breakdown showed the growth in imports covered all farm  products except fruit and vegetables, though they are still  imported by some members.    From around 18.6 million tonnes in 1980, Arab cereal imports  surged to 34.3 million tonnes in 1992.    Wheat imports jumped from 12.4 million tonnes to 21.1  million  tonnes, the AMF said in a study.    Dairy products also soared, from nearly one million tonnes  to  9.1 million tonnes, while tea, coffee and tobacco rose from  461,000 tonnes to 530,000 tonnes and meat from 666,000 tonnes to  794,000 tonnes.    Investment in the Arab farm sector did not exceed 7.5  percent  of the Gross Domestic Product annually over the past decade,  while loans extended to agriculture stood at only 3.8 billion  dollars between 1973 and 1992.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cookson in Pounds 72m engineering disposals Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, yesterday completed the latest phase of its strategic restructuring, with the Pounds 72m sale of 25 engineering subsidiaries, through a management buy-in. Cookson will record a book loss of about Pounds 6m from the transaction, but Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said he felt Cookson had achieved a good price for businesses which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.3m in 1993. 'In March 1993, we talked about divesting businesses that didn't fit into our core strategy for the future', said Mr Oster. 'This concludes the short-term divestiture programme; now we have to focus on building up these core businesses.' The proceeds will help fund expansion in its strategic core, electronic materials, ceramics, precious metal fabrication and plastics. Analysts believe this will include small bolt-on acquisitions. The companies sold by Cookson employ 1,800 people and are involved in industrial materials, precision castings and aluminium. They are being purchased by a management team put together by Mr Jim Cooper, former business development director of John Wood. It will be renamed Calder Group. Morgan Grenfell and its development capital arm, have underwritten the deal which involves Pounds 84.5m of funding to cover the acquisition cost and to build up of working capital. The management will have a 17.5 per cent stake, with a performance-related option for a further 2.5 per cent. Cookson has been paid Pounds 69.4m in cash and will receive a further Pounds 0.3m in September. The Calder Group companies have also repaid Pounds 7.3m of inter-group loans from Cookson and have taken on Pounds 2.2m in external debt. Cookson could receive as much as Pounds 10m, if Calder is sold or floated within a five year period. The size of payment depends on the value of the transaction.</p>

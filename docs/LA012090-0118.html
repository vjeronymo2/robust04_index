			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HOWELL, GRIFFIN GET INFLATION LESSON  </P> <P> The Dodgers took an unusual step in the battle against baseball inflation  Friday by exercising contract options for the 1991 season on relief pitcher Jay  Howell and shortstop Alfredo Griffin.  </P> <P> They also whittled their number of arbitration-eligible players to three by  signing catcher Rick Dempsey to a one-year contract. Still eligible are Kal  Daniels, Ray Searage and Franklin Stubbs, all of whom exchanged figures with  the Dodgers Friday.  </P> <P> Daniels, who made $325,000 last year, is seeking $700,000, and the Dodgers are  offering $550,000. Stubbs, who made $345,000, is seeking $495,000 against  $400,000. Searage, who made $140,000, is seeking $395,000 and being offered  $300,000. If the players and club can't reach agreement before an upcoming  hearing date, an arbitrator will decide between the player's figure and the  club's figure.  </P> <P> The Dodgers made certain there would be no financial indecision next year with  Howell and Griffin. By exercising those options a year in advance, the Dodgers  will be getting Howell for $1.05 million in 1991. They will be getting Griffin  for $900,000. Both players signed these deals in the winter of 1988-89, before  baseball's recent salary boom, which has left some agents questioning the  Dodgers' good faith.  </P> <P> Steve Comte, Howell's agent, was being careful with his words.  </P> <P> "You can't file a grievance -- it's a signed contract," Comte said. "But  clearly some issues here are left to be discussed. We clearly know what is  right. We clearly know what we want, and we have to handle that through  appropriate means. This is a very fragile thing right now."  </P> <P> Claire admitted that the early renewals were uncommon. He also admitted they  were based on current economic conditions.  </P> <P> "Are we affected by current events?" Claire said. "Most certainly. We always  have been, and always will be. As the game undergoes changes, we have to react  to those changes. This is, perhaps, unusual. But this is also a reflection of  the confidence we have in these players."  </P> <P> Howell set a club record with 28 saves along with a 1.58 earned-run average in  56 appearances in 1989. Griffin, bothered by both hand and shoulder problems,  batted .247 but was once again spectacular in the field, finishing tied for  third in fielding percentage among National League shortstops with just 14  errors in 555 chances (.975).  </P> <P> Citing frustration over his lack of choices, Tim Belcher said that walking out  of spring training "is an option" if he and management don't reach agreement on  a contract Belcher hopes will be worth close to $1 million.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying I will walk out. I'm only saying that when you don't have  arbitration, you don't have leverage," he said. "So walking out of camp becomes  your leverage."  </P> <P> Belcher has just two full years of experience, thus does not qualify for  arbitration.  </P> <P> If there is no agreement by early March, the Dodgers can simply fill in a  salary figure that Belcher will have to accept. That happened last season, when  he was renewed at $225,000, less than he had had in mind but still the highest  salary for a second-year player in baseball.  </P> <P> Belcher is hoping to at least quadruple that figure. The Dodgers will probably  offer closer to the $500,000. Belcher was 15-12 with a 2.82 earned run average  in 1989. He had seven consecutive victories and was 5-0 in September with a  1.51 ERA. He led the major leagues with eight shutouts, was tied for first in  the National League with 10 complete games, and finished second in strikeouts  with 200.  </P></p>

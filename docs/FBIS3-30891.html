			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tihomir Vinkovic from Geneva] </F>   [Excerpt] In his talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic and Austrian Foreign Minister Mock in  Geneva today, Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs, presented the Croatian standpoint  on the possible future of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    A union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina would consist of  three republics in which one of the three constituent nations  would be in the majority. Minority rights in each of the  republics in the union would be guaranteed and supervised by the  international community. In areas where they make up a compact  body, the minorities could be organized in areas with a certain  degree of autonomy. In case the union of republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina disintegrates, each republic would have to  guarantee the same minority rights as is envisaged for the union.    The Croatian view is identical to the EU proposal, known as  the Kinkel-Juppe plan. Croatia again reiterated its proposal  that the international community should supervise the border  between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and carry out inspection  of military formations. Of course, all hostilities must first  cease. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tarija, 10 Jun -- Just as everything seemed to  indicate that Edgar Martinez, the candidate of the Trade Union  Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers, would be the next COB  [Bolivian Labor Federation] executive secretary, there has been  a turnabout: At the very last minute the miners withdrew their  candidate because they realized that he would not get enough  votes. Thus Oscar Salas was reelected by landslide.    The alliance between the ruling party and the ASD  [Democratic  Socialist Alternative] was sealed at the lengthy plenary meeting  of the 10th COB Congress, which started at 1600 on 9 June and  ended at 0815 the next day. The workers call this alliance  "unsavory."    Before the voting started, Fred Nunez, one of the workers'  leaders, claimed "the ruling party had prepared" a list of  candidates that they circulated among workers. This "ticket"  comprises ASD, MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], and UCS  [Solidarity Civic Union] members. The reading of this ticket  did not elicit any comments, and the congress elected the new  COB executive board. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Foreign tidal wave hits eastern markets: FT writers report on the western plunge into emergent exchanges of Budapest, Prague and Warsaw A tidal wave of foreign money is moving into the stock exchanges of the former communist countries of eastern and central Europe. Yesterday's news of the launch of a Dollars 200m (Pounds 133.3m) investment fund underlines strong western interest in shares quoted in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. Heavy buying has accompanied signs of an end to the long post-1989 period of economic downturn in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Western institutional purchases have had a particularly sharp effect during the last few weeks on the Budapest stock exchange, which rose 58 per cent in January. But several analysts warn that - after heady stock market rises last year particularly in Warsaw, up 11-fold in zloty terms - the stock exchanges may be heading for a fall. One expert pointing to pitfalls is Mr Reginald Duquesnoy, adviser to Prometheus, a small Dollars 10m Dublin-listed fund specialising in eastern Europe, launched by the London-based Cresvale asset management company. He said yesterday foreign investment could push valuations to extreme levels. 'I was amongst the first to land in Poland, and the sort of process I would have expected to take 10 years happened in nine months. It went from incredible value to the most rampant over-valuation I have seen in a long time. The greatest destroyers of value are the foreigners.' Mr William Lynne, of specialist London-based investment trust brokers Olliff &amp; Partners, says it is still early for mainstream UK investors to look at eastern Europe. 'This is true emerging markets stuff. UK institutional investors tend to be dominated by pension fund managers, who do not think they can justify that kind of high-risk, high-return investment.' CS First Boston, the investment bank launching the Dollars 200m fund, counters the idea that it will be adding to an unstainable 'wall of money' moving into eastern Europe. Mr Charles Harman, a managing director of CS First Boston responsible for central Europe, says the fund's size is relatively small compared with the estimated Dollars 10bn worth of new stock issues expected in the three centres during the next 12 months. These include both privatisation issues and additional capital launches by companies already quoted on the three exchanges. The CS First Boston Fund, expected to be spent during the next two to three months, is to be targeted above all at Prague, where another round of privatisations later this year could bring to 1,700 the number of quoted stocks - dwarfing the much smaller Budapest and Warsaw markets. According to Mr Richard Salzmann, chairman of the Komercni Bank, a leading Prague bank, foreign purchases of Czech bonds and equities have surged since last autumn on optimism about the economic and political outlook. Up to Dollars 400m in foreign portfolio investment is thought to have flowed to Prague since the stock market was opened in June. Private investment funds have yet to make an impact in Poland, although foreign buying makes up about 10 per cent of turnover on the Warsaw stock exchange. Foreign investors are thought to own 25 per cent of stock market capitalisation. Investment activity in Warsaw has generally been through western government-sponsored funds such as the Dollars 300m Polish American Enterprise Fund (PAEF). The PAEF has channelled loans and equity to medium and small businesses, and last year contributed Dollars 50m towards the Dollars 150m Polish Private Equity Fund (PPEF) for equity investment, some of which has been in companies preparing for eventual stock market flotation. Budapest, with the smallest capitalisation of the three exchanges, has lately seen a particular speculative flurry. Last week General Electric's pension fund and two other US investors paid Dollars 23.6m for the 29 per cent of hotel and spa chain Danubius being privatised by the State Property Agency. The shares more than doubled on the first day of trading. Investors have been trying to follow the example of the Quantum Fund, controlled by Mr George Soros. Quantum invested Dollars 3m in Hungarian retail company, Fotex, in 1992 and the shares have since more than doubled. The question is: can this be repeated?

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reduction in world wool output forecast THE WORLD wool clip is expected to be 5 per cent lower in the 1993-94 crop year (ending June 30) at 1.6m tonnes, according to the latest Wool Statistics report by the International Wool Textile Organisation. This represents a 20 per cent fall from the record set in 1989-1990 as growers have turned away from wool to other crops in the face of depressed world demand. World producers' stocks remain high and total supplies are expected to amount to 2.2m tonnes - 4 per cent below last year, but still excessive by historical levels. The wool organisation is looking for a pick-up in world demand as the recession ends and points out that stocks are low in some consuming countries, including the US. But with overall economic growth proceeding at a slow rate it expects the scope for increased demand this year to be limited. China, which has been the world's largest wool consumer since 1991, could be slowing its growth in demand. In the first half of 1993, China's raw wool imports increased by 16 per cent to 95,908 tonnes but its output of wool fabrics was 8 per cent lower than the same 1992 period, indicating that part of its imports are being held as stock.</p>

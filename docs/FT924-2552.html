			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Tussle on futures DETAILS of yesterday's hungrily awaited Bundesbank meeting were closely scrutinised by the money markets but failed to provide strong signals on future interest rates. The 'firm rates' camp latched on to hard-line comments by Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger who said he saw no room for a cut. Those pinning their hopes on a reduction gleaned comfort from the rise in the German bank's M3 money growth range to between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent for 1993. They suggested it was an increase from a figure already artificially boosted by heavy intervention and consequently a signal that lower rates were on the agenda. Short sterling's performance reflected the two opinions. The March contract, which is often seen as the market's view on the way base rates are going, opened at 93.47 and was bought up to 93.55 on optimism surrounding the M3 growth figure. Mere hope was not enough however and March fell back to end the day 4 basis points off at 93.43 with nearly 20,000 contracts traded by the official close. Following volatility last week, March has stabilised around the 93.50 level, signalling a further base rate cut of half a percentage point within the next few months. The contract for December delivery, which is now driven purely by technical factors, opened at 92.85 and closed little changed at 92.86. Meanwhile, Bank of England operations flowed slightly more easily following the tight money of recent days. The central bank offered an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of about Pounds 800m. Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of treasury bills and paper maturing in official hands, expected to drain Pounds 602m, bankers' balances below target which would remove Pounds 140m, and a rise in note circulation siphoning a further Pounds 190m. Partly offsetting these were exchequer transactions adding Pounds 155m to the market. Most of the offer was taken up and the Bank provided the money market with Pounds 559m of early assistance, buying Pounds 125m of band one bank bills at 6 7/8 per cent and Pounds 434m of bills for resale to the market on January 5 at 6 15/16 per cent. The Bank did not provide any assistance at midday or in the afternoon but it later revised its liquidity shortage forecast down to Pounds 750m and then to Pounds 550m.</p>

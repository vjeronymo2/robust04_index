			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Deutsche forms mortgage bank Deutsche Bank is putting its mortgage bank activities together to form a new organisation which will be the biggest source of mortgage finance in Germany. By merging Frankfurter Hypothekenbank and Deutsche Centralbodenkredit, it will create a new bank with a balance sheet total of some DM72bn (Dollars 46.5bn). The merged bank will be called Frankfurter Hypothekenbank Centralboden. Deutsche Bank owns more than 90 per cent of both banks. Another group bank, Lubecker Hypothekenbank, with a balance sheet total of DM12bn, will also be included in the mortgage grouping through a management contract. Mr Bernt Rohrer, who will be chief executive of the merged concern, said yesterday that this concentration of Deutsche Bank's mortgage activities would make it more competitive in a tough market and enable it to offer bigger individual property loans. The biggest mortgage bank in Germany is the Wiesbaden-based Deutsche Pfandbrief- und Hypothekenbank, but Mr Rohrer said the amalgamated Deutsche Bank subsidiary would be the biggest granter of mortgage loans in Germany, covering 45 per cent of commercial property business and 55 per cent of residential.</p>

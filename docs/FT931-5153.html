			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Brussels throws weight behind air-drops THE European Commission is trying to push member states into active support for US air-drops of humanitarian aid to besieged Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible for external political relations, told the Financial Times that support could extend to making available EC supplies of food and medicine for delivery by the US. The proposal is expected to be discussed today at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels, along with the question of whether to tighten sanctions on Serbia. When the US canvassed Nato allies at the end of last month for support for the air-drop, EC states expressed lukewarm support for Washington's initiative and withheld practical contributions, preferring instead to continue with their efforts to deliver aid through land convoys under UN auspices. The EC has been stung by criticism that it has not done enough to relieve suffering in the former Yugoslavia, and that its role as the largest supplier of humanitarian aid has been overshadowed by the high-profile US air-drops. Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner in charge of humanitarian aid, unveiled last week a new Ecu60m (Pounds 49.6m) package for the former Yugoslavia - one quarter of the total aid the Community expects it will have to provide this year. The EC has already delivered Ecu290m in aid since the onset of the crisis. Mr Van den Broek's call for a closer association with the US air-drops is based on the conviction that the EC must co-ordinate its efforts with the US  -and Russia - if more permanent solutions to the conflict are to be found. Mr Van den Broek said that, in the event of a peace plan being agreed, the EC, the US and Russia should be involved in making such a political settlement stick 'with all accompanying military elements'. Senior EC diplomats said last week that if the peace plan drawn up by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance under EC/UN auspices collapsed, there would be a progressive tightening of sanctions against Serbia. But if a deal is struck, the focus will move rapidly to the issue of enforcement. The diplomats make clear there is a growing likelihood that Nato will take the leading role in policing a deal. One ambassador said: 'The idea of involvement by the alliance in policing (any agreement) is rising steeply up.' The same diplomat also noted that France was playing an active role in Nato's defence planning committee for former Yugoslavia, 'a very striking change which is extremely encouraging'.

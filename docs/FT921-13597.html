			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Observer: Malvinas mania Hold on to your fast forward buttons, Brits, and prepare for a surfeit of Falklands war memorabilia - particularly from the BBC. Hard on the heels of Channel 4's kamikaze dive into the history of the Anglo-Argentine war in 1982, comes the promise of no fewer than three different bites at the same cherry by the Beeb. 'War Stories', produced by Peter Grimsdale, is a five-part series largely filmed inside Argentina and looking at the events of 10 years ago from a grunts-eye view. Brian Lapping Associates, in true Lapping-fashion, opts for the Olympian style, digging into Washington's arcane corridors of power. Touch Productions took Simon Weston and two other ex-combatants on a tour through Argentina - where they met some of their erstwhile enemies. If that weren't enough, TVS (part of the commercial network) is also producing a series called In Time of War. Observer detects a slight air of one-upmanship among the respective programme-makers, who all make warm remarks about each other's programmes. Lapping is proud of having obtained an interview with former brigadier Lami Dozo, the air force representative of the three-man Argentine junta which launched the invasion. But no one has yet managed to wring an interview from the tight-lipped and frequently tired and emotional ex-general, Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri.</p>

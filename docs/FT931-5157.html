			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Italy agrees jobs package ITALY'S government is to spend over L7,000bn (Pounds 3.2bn) on additional measures for job creation, unemployment benefit and development grants to try to cushion the worsening recession. The measures will put further strain on public-sector finances, which are already rising above target this year. However, they should go some way towards meeting union demands for extra help for the unemployed and industries in crisis. About 40,000 women marched through the streets of Rome at the weekend to protest against the effects of recession, in a demonstration organised by the country's three trade union federations. The package should pave the way to a new round of meetings between ministers, unions and employers' representatives to take up proposals on reforms to labour laws outlined in last summer's accord to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. The economic package approved by ministers foresees the creation of a L1,650bn national employment fund to stimulate job creation over the next three years. About L3,500bn will go on re-industrialisation projects.</p>

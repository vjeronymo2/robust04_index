			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / GrandMet sets store by its spirits shelf: Pounds 140m of a charge to reshape drinks arm While getting out of the US pet food market was seen in the City yesterday as a smart move for Grand Metropolitan, the announcement of further restructuring costs at the UK food and drinks group was not so welcome. The Pounds 280m exceptional operating charge, to be taken this year, follows last year's Pounds 175m charge for reorganising the North American food operations. When Lord Sheppard became chairman in 1986 GrandMet was running around 30 disparate businesses. He identified food and drink as the two sectors on which the group should concentrate its efforts. Yesterday he said: 'Over recent years GrandMet has moved from a multifaceted conglomerate to a highly focused branded international food and drinks business.' Half of the latest charge will be devoted to International Distillers and Vintners, the world's biggest spirits producer. IDV is the jewel in GrandMet's crown, accounting for half the profits, but tough conditions in some of its main markets, such as the US and Germany, have led to what the group called yesterday 'uneven trading'. At the time of the interim results in May, GrandMet said that destocking in the US drinks market was likely to cost it Pounds 40m this year. Yesterday it warned that IDV's profits are expected to be lower when the full-year results are announced on December 1. Last year's restructuring produced annualised cost savings of Pounds 70m, and helped the group to increase its marketing spend by Pounds 50m over last year's Pounds 879m. The latest programme is expected to bring in a further reduction of Pounds 90m a year over the next two years. Mr George Bull, who became chief executive last December, said the in-depth review of the group's businesses over the last 18 months had been aimed at improving long-term growth in earnings and cash flow. 'The benefit of these programmes will be an overall reduction in our cost base which will allow increased investment in our brands,' he said. The Pounds 140m allocated to IDV, which has 13 of the world's top 100 brands and operates in 50 countries, will be spent on 200 different projects, concentrating on plant rationalisation, office closures and redundancies. The group has been encouraged by the success of the North American programme  -mainly at Pillsbury - to take a hard look at IDV's cost base. With limited room for growth in Europe and the US, and not much room for price increases, GrandMet is excited by potential markets in Asia and eastern Europe, both for drinks and food. Restructuring the European food businesses - mainly Brossard, the cake maker and Haagen-Dazs Europe, the ice-cream maker - will soak up Pounds 55m. European food contributed Pounds 735m to turnover but only Pounds 15m of operating profits last year. Again, the group would be looking to streamline production and improve efficiency in order to get a satisfactory return. A further Pounds 32m will be spent on a restructuring programme already in progress at Burger King, the hamburger chain, and Pounds 20m on cutting corporate costs. Charges of Pounds 28m relate to a further reduction in the group's property portfolio. The properties - put up for sale in June - include the former Truman Brewery in London's Brick Lane. They are expected to generate more than Pounds 60m of cash, helping to keep the net cash cost of the whole restructuring package to less than Pounds 100m. GrandMet said yesterday that before exceptionals, restructuring and tax, profits for the year to end this month would 'show improvement over last year', when it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 630m after Pounds 286m of charges. Free cashflow - Pounds 549m last time - had 'remained strong'. The exceptional Pounds 200m profit from the sale of the Alpo petfood business to Nestle will be recorded in the 1994-95 accounts. Alpo, which has net assets estimated at Dollars 150m (Pounds 95m), is expected to make a trading profit of Dollars 47m for the year ending this month on sales of Dollars 430m. Nestle, the world's biggest food group, is paying Dollars 510m for Alpo, the seventh largest operator in the competitive US petfood market. The deal, which could make Nestle market leader in US dogfood, is subject to review by the US Federal Trade Commission. Editorial Comment, Page 21; Lex, Page 22; Observer, Page 21</p>

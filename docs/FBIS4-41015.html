			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General V.S. Chechevatov, commander </F> of the Far East Military District, by Valeriy Usoltsev under  "Military Commander Takes the Floor" rubric; place and date not  given: "They Will Not Be `Toy Soldiers'"]    [Text] Col. Gen. Viktor Stepanovich Chechevatov, commander  of the Far East Military District, is a man of indisputable  authority for the region's Cossacks. They consider him "one of  their own." And it is perhaps now understandable why the Cossack  hetmans of Russia's remote regions elected him unanimously as  their appointed hetman.    [Usoltsev] Viktor Stepanovich, many politicians of the most  diverse caliber and rank are today wooing the Cossacks and  seeking to win their favor, that is to say, to attain the sort  of position in which you now find yourself, enjoying their love,  esteem, and respect.... What do you think is moving these  politicians toward the Cossacks?    [Chechevatov] Well, you have come up with a whole "bunch" of  questions. So, am I to analyze, on the basis of my own  experience, the goals of people who, I suppose, are using the  Cossacks simply to attain their own interests, for their own  political advantage? My experience is not suitable. I am with  the Cossacks with all my soul, with all my heart. They are such  radiant people, just what our Fatherland needs today! They are  a force. That is why these people are trying to get attached to  them. They represent the special spiritual world order of our  excellent national "mix." And to "toy" with the Cossacks today,  to "woo" them, is to destroy -- to deliberately destroy, I  believe -- the green shoots of our national recovery. These  people want to use them -- but for destructive purposes. But  the Cossacks.... They are an open people, they frequently trust  those who by no means take them where they need to go, where our  Russia itself needs to go....    So much "dirt," so much "trash" has swamped the Cossacks  today; there are so many "masqueraders" in their midst.  "Masqueraders" not only on the outside but on the inside too,  people whose very thoughts are pernicious....    But there is virtually no opposition to all these deceitful,  false, alien elements among the Cossacks, it seems to me. I  often say this to the Cossacks at meetings. After all, this  compromises the entire movement and provokes distrust in it on  the part of outsiders. At best, that is -- if such an  expression is appropriate. At worst, it provokes caustic  mockery and downright insults.    But I believe that, nevertheless, the Cossacks will not let  anyone else get their grubby hands on their banners, their  martial glory.    The other day I returned from an official trip along the  Amur  and the Ussuri. I visited the Cossack villages. Traditions are  alive and well. And traditions are like the roots of a tree.  If there are roots, they will "pump in" the strength of the  earth, and therefore, everything else will be there too.    Hereditary Cossacks have appeared here once again.  Kalmykovs, Nazarovs, Poluyanovs, Byankins. They know how to  teach good sense to the Cossack "young," how to kindle love for  the Motherland in their hearts, how to develop in them a sense  of Duty, Honor, and military self-sacrifice in the name of the  land in which they were born.    And the Cossack villages themselves? It is like finding  yourself in another world. Take Mogilevka, for example. The  Cossacks, able in mind and body, live and create there. Their  homes are beautiful to look at; there is always a good harvest;  there is no despondency, and people believe in tomorrow.  Therefore they actually prepare this tomorrow themselves,  without relying on anyone else to do it for them. You know,  after a meeting with such a people you feel a real spiritual  uplift, the world seems a brighter place.    Anyway, it seems that the district commander has started to  gush. And this is contraindicated for us military people, as  one of Aleksandr Kuprin's heroes remarked. Well? Time to talk  about Cossack soldiers?    [Usoltsev] You mean the creation of Cossack subunits in the  district?    [Chechevatov] There you have just used the term "subunit."  Some Cossacks and hetmans are offended if we use this word, and  not "combined formation," say, or "unit," at a pinch. They say  that it is humiliating. We, they say, are ready today to put  forward corps and armies. You are not ready, I reply. Why  start to compromise a good thing? And again, what kind of new  game of "gigantomania" is this? Your first steps do not have to  be painful strides; just stretching your foot forward will do.  And who needs cripples? Not all of them understand jokes, they  take offense.... As a rule, it is not those who think about the  task in hand itself who think in terms of "corps," but those who  think about themselves in that task. About being on show, being  a prominent figure. In general, of course, many people have  appeared today who wish to take command of "corps," to shine in  generals' shoulder boards; for some Cossacks, as I notice, have  a pretty simple attitude toward ranks: If it's what you like,  it's yours by right, so help yourself.    However, all this has been said before.    My opinion is that the time has come to begin serious work  on  a program of military training for young Cossacks "at local  level," in their native villages. After all, what happened in  the past? The Cossack came into the services already with a  sufficient degree of professional training.    We have already started to do one or two things in this  area.  In a number of Cossack villages classes in military science are  being given under the leadership of hetmans, with the aid of  retired officers and sergeants. The district command is making  available its own training grounds and firing ranges and  allocating weapons and ammunition for these purposes. Many  serving officers are also involved with young Cossacks and are  training replenishments for themselves. As a rule this takes  place on nonworking days, in off-duty periods -- in their  personal time, as we say. This is truly selfless devotion. It  turns out that, despite everything, real officers have not died  out in our country.    Today Cossacks living along the border already know where  they have to go in the event of a deterioration of the situation  or the emergence of a threat to Russia, where to get their arms,  and at what gun emplacement to perform their combat task.    We have started to use Cossacks to guard military stores and  other Army facilities. By the way, the security and defense of  Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy Ostrov has already been entrusted to  Cossacks. A Cossack company has been formed there, and young  Cossacks are serving creditably.    As district commander I would like to mention the best men  by  name. They are all "hereditary villagers": Privates Aleksandr  Chernyshov, Konstantin Mamontov, Vladimir Ivanov, Sergey  Petaltsev.    The district command sees the Cossacks as a real military  force, as their reliable reserve. And of course, we will not  leave them to confront problems alone.    [Usoltsev] Cossacks complain of the lack of uniforms and  equipment. All this costs a lot of money these days. And where  are horses to be had? Can the district help here?    [Chechevatov] We will help the Cossacks with uniforms and  equipment. Rest assured that we are taking this question off  the agenda.    As for horses, the reviving villages have begun to raise  them  themselves. In the aforementioned Mogilevka. Back when he was  a sovkhoz director the current hetman, Vladimir Torkhov, founded  a stud farm on his own land and built a hippodrome, attracting  dozens of young men and women to equestrian sports. It was from  here that for the first time in the region, and perhaps in the  old Soviet Union as a whole, young men began to come to serve in  the Border Troops with their own horses. Yes, all problems are  being resolved. If, of course, there is a desire to resolve  them. If there are people who dream of making Russia great, of  training for it a new generation of true sons and reliable  defenders of their native borders.    These will not be "toy soldiers." These troops will be the  pride of our Armed Forces.    This is my belief.</p>

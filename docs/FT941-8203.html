			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe unwilling to decouple from US - Capital &amp; Credit Europe's government bond markets are in the most extraordinary state of turmoil, ruled more - it would seem - by gut feelings than by anything resembling cool, calm economic analysis. Last Thursday, the Bundesbank surprised the world financial markets with a half-point cut in the German discount rate, lowering it from 5.75 per cent to 5.25 per cent. The European bond markets, which have a tendency to hang on to every word, twitch of the eyebrow or other signal from the Bundesbank, have been obsessed with the question of 'will they, won't they cut rates?' for weeks. And no sooner had the Bundesbank cut its discount rate, than nearly every other European central bank was free to follow suit. Belgium, Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands announced their moves on Thursday, while Spain, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden waited until Friday, leaving France as the obstinate 'odd man out'. The Bank of France could well move as early as this week given the French franc/D-Mark exchange rate, or else could wait until Germany lowers its repo rate. However, while the European bond markets rejoiced at first in the long-awaited news of a German easing, there was a pretty smart turnround by late Thursday afternoon, followed by a sharp fall in European government bond prices on Friday afternoon. What on earth was going on, most people wondered as they watched gilts, bunds, OATs and a host of other European bonds tumble in largely futures-driven trading. For a start, world bond markets have clearly been rattled by the revival of concern about inflation in the US and the decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates on February 4. Of course, bond markets hate the thought of rising inflation: the fact that the Fed's move was intended to be a pre-emptive strike - rather than a strong dose of medicine to cure an existing ill - was largely ignored. The fact that the Bank of England snipped a quarter point off the base lending rate, taking it down to 5.25 per cent, only a few days later on February 8 should have reminded the markets that interest rates on this side of the Atlantic are still following a downward path. In addition, of course, the Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate last Thursday, sparking off a round of similar easings in Europe, again should have confirmed that the future direction for European interest rates is down, rather than up. However, the markets still remain jittery and almost determined to focus on the very worst news on the inflation front. Witness what happened in the US last Thursday: the announcement that US consumer prices last month were unchanged on the previous month and ahead by only 2.5 per cent in the year to January should have been good for US Treasury bonds. Instead, the Treasury market chose to concentrate on a report on regional economic conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which showed a sharp rise in the bank's index of manufactured goods prices. The US inflation worries have clearly spooked the European markets. On top of this, though, rumours of substantial trading losses by certain proprietary trading desks and reports of extremely heavy selling by US hedge funds have swept the European bond markets. 'The market psychology right now is very very negative,' said one European bond dealer. Some dealers point out that the very volatile market conditions have made trading difficult. 'It's been so choppy, some days you lose a lot but then other days you can make it all back up again,' said one dealer at a US bond house. But while traders are, not surprisingly, loath to discuss how much money they have lost, they confirm that much of the selling pressure has come out of the US, particularly from US hedge funds. These are private pools of funds which are managed very aggressively: they are highly leveraged and were one of the driving forces behind the surge in European government bond prices last year. 'It's been a frightening experience to see such a massive liquidation of bonds,' said one analyst last week. 'There's been a tide of selling, and people have got stuck with positions they don't want to be in, and have had to offload. Nor is it possible to say with any conviction that the selling has come to an end.' The problem, points out Mr George Magnus, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, is that a sensible valuation or economic analysis of the European bond markets simply does not enter into the picture at all. 'Even if you point out that European yields will fall back to the levels where they were at the end of 1993, the words just fall on deaf ears,' he says. For the moment, at least, the European bond markets appear unwilling to decouple from the moves in the US.</p>

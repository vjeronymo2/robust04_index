			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Observer: Centre of attention If the users of 'Tecs' were not confused enough by the anonymous acronym for the new Training and Enterprise Councils, it seems that two of the new institutions are shaping up for a battle royal over the right to use the same meaningless name. Central England Training and Enterprise Council, based in Redditch, and Central London Tec, both want to call themselves 'Centec'. So far the exchanges have been polite, if cool. But it is already causing considerable confusion with confidential papers from government destined for the respective Tecs ending up on the wrong desks. 'All their budget papers have been circulated to me by mistake,' says Gwynneth Flower, chief executive of the London-based Tec. 'I don't know if they have ours.' The Redditch-based Tec claims it started using the name first. When it was set-up two years ago it was aware there was a company called Centec and so it registered itself as the Central England Tec, but quickly became known as Centec. For its part, the new Tec in London says that it spotted that the original Centec had gone into liquidation and registered itself as Centec. At present, there seems little room for negotiation. Flower, a determined woman who used to work for GKN, says with some irritation: 'Centec is the registered name of this Tec and any other company using it is doing so illegally.' Both sides admit that it would be a waste of public money, and bad for the image of the struggling Tecs, to end up in the courts. But neither seems ready to stand down. 'We have taken legal advice,' says Flower ominously. However, Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of the other Centec, and an ex-Army officer is not going to be pushed around. 'On a point of law it doesn't matter who registered the name, it is public usage that matters and we had that first.' Sounds like time for a government referee to step in before this dispute gets too silly.</p>

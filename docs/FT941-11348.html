			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: RJB Mining pays Pounds 4.7m for ICI arm RJB Mining yesterday pleased the market by announcing the Pounds 4.7m acquisition of a coke and chemical company from Imperial Chemical Industries. It also forecast pre-tax profits for 1993 of Pounds 12.2m, ahead of analysts' expectations. The shares rose 15p to 390p. RJB is placing and offering 4.1m shares, representing 10 per cent of the existing total, at 340p to finance the acquisition and raise Pounds 9.3m. BZW has placed 2.09m shares firm with investors and the balance is placed on a conditional basis, subject to clawback from shareholders under the open offer on a 1-for-10 basis. Some Pounds 3m of the proceeds will be used to develop the Clipstone colliery in Nottinghamshire, recently leased from British Coal. The remainder will be used to provide working capital and reduce gearing to about 40 per cent, against 65 per cent at December 31 1993. Separately, British Coal announced that it expected to reach lease and licence arrangements with RJB for the Rossington pit in Yorkshire. It indicated that Coal Investments was the preferred candidate for Markham Main pit, another colliery which RJB had hoped to mine. The acquisition of Monckton Coke and Chemical provides RJB with a market for Clipstone and its other pits. Monckton processes 300,000 tonnes of coal a year, mainly to manufacture coke and smokeless fuel for industrial and household markets. RJB expects Clipstone to produce 300,000 tonnes this year and up to 500,000 annually thereafter. Monckton is based near Barnsley, Yorkshire, and employs 190 people. The core management team will be retained. It made trading profits of about Pounds 423,000 last year, on turnover of about Pounds 17.5m. Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, said yesterday he was confident that profit levels of more than Pounds 1m could be achieved at Monckton. Production inefficiencies would be reduced through the supply of coal from Clipstone. RJB's estimate for 1993 pre-tax profits is 10 per cent up on the previous year's Pounds 11m. Pro forma earnings per share are expected to be 22.7p, with a final dividend of 7p, making 12p for the full year. ICI's disposal was prompted by the company's restructuring. ICI Chemicals and Polymers previously made significant purchases from Monckton for its soda ash operations, but these were divested in 1991.</p>

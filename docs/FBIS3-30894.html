Bosnian Serb and Muslim military representatives on  Wednesday  reached a ceasefire agreement through the mediation of U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael Rose. The  ceasefire agreement is to go into effect at noon on Thursday.  The two sides also agreed to place their artillery weapons  under UNPROFOR control while the ceasefire agreement is in force.    Lord Owen said the NATO ultimatum for Serbs to pull back  their artillery to lines 20 kilometers from the centre of  Sarajevo or else air strikes against them would be launched had  had a strong impact on the Serbs.    Owen said in a statement to BBC Radio he hoped that, at the  next round of the peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, opening on  Thursday afternoon, the parties would reach agreement to appoint  a U.N. administrator-designate for Sarajevo in preparation for  the city's demilitarization.</p>

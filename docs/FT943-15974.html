			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Weinstock to keep job at GEC for another two years GEC, the British defence and electronics group, yesterday said Lord Weinstock, its long-serving managing director who will shortly turn 70, would stay in that job for another two years. But the company appointed the managing directors of its three central businesses to the board to help secure the succession to Lord Weinstock, who has dominated the company for more than three decades. Lord Weinstock, managing director since 1963, said he expected GEC's management would become more collegiate and that he had been taking less of a leading role for some time. GEC yesterday also announced profits of Pounds 866m for the year to March 31, only Pounds 3m higher than in the previous year and below City expectations. GEC's shares fell by more than 8 per cent, closing 24p lower at 270p. The new directors are Mr Roy Gardner, 48, managing director of GEC-Marconi, the electronics and defence subsidiary; Mr James Cronin, 56, managing director of GEC Alsthom, the power engineering joint venture; and Mr Peter Gershon, 47, managing director of GPT, the telecommunications operation. Lord Weinstock's eventual successor is likely to be chosen from an inside group comprising the three new board members, Mr David Newlands, 47, GEC's finance director, and Mr Simon Weinstock, 42, Lord Weinstock's son, who is commercial director. Some City observers favour Mr Gershon at this stage because of his successful handling of GPT. Lord Weinstock said his role with GEC would be determined by his ability to continue doing his job. He hinted that when the new management team was up and running he would give it significant latitude, restricting himself to pointing up opportunities and warning of the dangers of certain courses of action. Announcing the results, he said: 'We ought to have made some more money this year, but the markets are still very tough. In many areas recession has not yet gone away.' GEC now has Pounds 1.35bn in cash within the company, as well as a further Pounds 1.47bn in joint ventures. It sees opportunities for linking power station construction contracts in Asia to equity stakes in the operating companies involved. Add-on acquisitions in electronics and defence are also being considered. GEC, however, has not found a large acquisition which would meet its requirements and has ruled out an aggressive bid for British Aerospace. It said it had been interested in putting both companies' defence interests into a joint venture, but that BAe had cooled on the idea. Lex, Page 22; GEC results, Page 25; London stocks, Page 48</p>

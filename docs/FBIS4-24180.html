			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Ministry of Information and  Culture has categorically denied a report broadcast last night  by the BBC saying the fighting in Mogadishu was sparked off by  the Somali Salvation Alliance [SSA] attack on the Somali  National Alliance [SNA]. The spokesman described the BBC report  as baseless and devoid of truth. He said the BBC had made it a  habit to broadcast nonexistent stories in order to confuse  international opinion.    The spokesman for the Ministry of Information and Culture  once again made it clear to the international community and  peace-loving people that the SNA was responsible for the ongoing  fighting in some parts of Mogadishu city, namely Makka and  Madina districts. In conclusion, the spokesman said relief  operations in the city had not been jeopardized by the fighting  as claimed by the BBC. He said the BBC had selfish interests to  fulfill by spreading such a story.</p>

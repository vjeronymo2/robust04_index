			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports from the vernacular press published on 16 February  pertaining to U.S. Defense Department's long-range plan to  reduce U.S. Forces in the ROK.    The moderate daily KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean carries a  600-word report by Washington-based correspondent Kim Hak-sun  under the headline, "50 Percent of U.S. Ground Forces in the ROK  Are To Be Reduced Under Long-Range Plan--Research and  Development Expenses for F-16 Included in U.S. Defense Budget."    The report writes that in an annual defense report to  Congress, the U.S. Defense Department revealed that the U.S.  ground forces in the ROK consisting of two brigades will be  reduced to one brigade. However, the Defense Department is also  reviewing "a possibility of deploying more military equipment in  the ROK in order to promote capabilities of coping with a U.S.  crisis."    The report stresses that "the research and development  expenses" for F-16 fighters, which the ROK decided to introduce  as "the next-generation fighters" will be increased every year  until fiscal year 1996. The report then gives details of the  amounts of these expenses to be increased each year.    The leftist-leaning daily HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean  publishes  on page 3 a 500-word article by Washington-based correspondent  Chong Yon-chu, with the headline "Additional Deployment of  Weapons Reviewed--the U.S. Defense Report."    Noting that the United States is planning to reduce the  scale  of U.S. ground forces in the ROK from two brigades to one  brigade on a long-range basis, the article says that the U.S.  Defense Department pointed out in its annual report to the  President and the Congress that "because of North Korea's  continued threat, the United States has frozen the withdrawal of  U.S. Forces from the ROK, and is modernizing military power of  the ROK and U.S. Forces in the ROK." The report also reveals  that "the U.S. Defense Department is reviewing a possibility of  deploying more military equipment in the ROK in a bid to enhance  its capabilities of dealing with the crisis situation."    The article says that according to the report, the budget  for  purchase of F-16 fighters will be "reduced" each year except  1996 but the "budget for modernization of fighters will be  somewhat increased beginning in 1994." The article then gives a  detailed amount of the budget for the purchase of F-16 fighters  and for their modernization each year.</p>

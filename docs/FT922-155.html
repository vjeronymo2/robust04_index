			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UPS buys Carryfast to expand in Europe UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, one of the biggest US parcel delivery companies yesterday bought Carryfast, the UK's largest privately-owned express parcels service. This is the fourth and largest of UPS's acquisitions in Europe in the last year. It adds about 8m packages a year to UPS's European total of 120m. The long-awaited deal, which completes UPS's European network, affirms the Atlanta-based company's confidence in Europe. UPS has spent Dollars 1bn (Pounds 524.5m) on European acquisitions since 1987, building up a comprehensive network, although it would not say how much it paid for Carryfast. UPS's commitment to Europe is in marked contrast to the recent retrenchment by Federal Express, the Memphis-based express delivery company and a fierce domestic rival. FedEx, which accounts for about half the overnight package market in the US, pulled out of intra-European deliveries in March, laying off thousands of employees. It blamed the withdrawal on tough competition and slower-than-expected growth in demand, which in turn caused heavy losses, although industry observers also cited integration problems. FedEx is now subcontracting these services. UPS is also losing money on its international operations, but the company maintains that its strong finances and private ownership - shares are held largely by employees - mean that it can ride out the situation. 'We are on target to achieve profitability in Europe in 1994,' said UPS. With solid domestic earnings, the US company made Dollars 700.2m in 1991. Carryfast said it needed an international owner because an increasing number of its customers wanted to send packages between the UK and the continent. The company, a management buy-out from Unilever in 1984, has almost all its business within the UK. 'The single European market is getting closer and we only had an ad hoc agreement with one continental company,' said Mr Tony McClellan, marketing director. UPS set up its UK base in January 1989 after acquiring IML Air Service Group. Before its acquisition of Carryfast, UPS had bought 15 European companies including Prost Transports, the French carrier, last July, and Beemsterboer in Holland and Star Air Parcels of Austria this year. Carryfast made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 35m for the year to December 31.</p>

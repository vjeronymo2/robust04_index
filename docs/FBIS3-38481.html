Shlyamin stated these critical comments before  the Finnish and Russian friendship organization leaders meeting  in Petrozavodsk on Friday [21 January]. According to Shlyamin,  U.S., German, and Austrian firms are about to take over the  market in Karelia because of Finnish firms. In his view the  Finns have not replied to Karelian proposals, and cooperation  has not advanced over the past 18 months. Shlyamin sees one  reason for this in that project initiatives of Finland and the  Area Development Fund (KERA) have been inadequate.    The Finnish-Russian Friendship Society's chairman, Kaj  Barlund, and its general secretary, Merja Hannus, visited  Petrozavodsk on Friday. Barlund and the chairman of the Friends  of Finland Society in Karelia, Aleksey Mironov, signed a  protocol on cooperation. Barlund met on Friday also with  Karelian Republic President Viktor Stepanov.</p>

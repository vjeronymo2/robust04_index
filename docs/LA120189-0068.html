			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 GROUP OFFERS ITS OWN PRICING PLAN;  </P> <P> AUTO INSURANCE: A COALITION OF GROUPS WOULD NARROW PRICE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN  CITIES AND SUBURBS. BUT WHOSE RATES WOULD BE AFFECTED WAS NOT MADE CLEAR.  </P> <P> With Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie scheduled to announce next Tuesday  her decision on how to alter the pricing of auto insurance in accord with  Proposition 103, the measure's author and a coalition of 20 minority, consumer  and low-income groups joined Thursday in proposing their own pricing plan.  </P> <P> In rough terms, the plan endorsed by Voter Revolt's Harvey Rosenfield would  tend to narrow price distinctions that now exist between central cities and  suburban areas. But how much, and whose rates would go up and whose would go  down, were not precisely disclosed.  </P> <P> The plan was largely drafted by State Board of Equalization member Conway  Collis, Rosenfield's candidate to replace Gillespie as commissioner in next  year's election. It would, in a literal interpretation of Proposition 103, set  a driver's safety record, annual miles driven and years of driving experience  as the most influential factors in pricing.  </P> <P> To the extent that a driver's home address could continue to be used to  determine prices, the plan would end use of individual zip codes, as is now  often the case, and use 21 "standard metropolitan statistical areas" designated  within California by the Bureau of Census. A flat geographically based rate  component would be applied to drivers in each of these areas.  </P> <P> For instance, if territory is used to make up 25% of a person's rate, that  factor would be applied uniformly to all drivers either living in or commuting  into a statistical area. (The commuter's destination would be introduced as a  pricing factor for the first time).  </P> <P> Los Angeles County as a whole and areas based on Orange, San Diego and Kern  counties form four of the 21 statistical zones. In the plan proposed Thursday,  the geographical-based price would be the highest in Los Angeles, but Orange  County drivers commuting into Los Angeles would pay the Los Angeles rate.  </P> <P> Rosenfield and Collis said they do not have statistics yet that would allow  them to say what their plan would mean in terms of precise upward or downward  adjustments of individual rates in various places.  </P> <P> But Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP, who was also  at the news conference, said that in general it would mean that auto insurance  rates in the suburbs would go up, while those in the central cities would go  down. He said this was the intent of the voters when they passed Proposition  103 last year.  </P> <P> However, by defining the rates according to the Census Bureau's statistical  areas, the geographically based adjustments would be limited to a certain  extent. Drivers in Northern California counties such as Humboldt or Sacramento  would not be paying higher rates so that Los Angeles drivers could pay lower  ones, as would be the case with an unqualified end to neighborhood-based  pricing.  </P> <P> Collis said the biggest increases would fall on bad drivers -- those with two  or more traffic violations or with at-fault accidents -- no matter where they  live. Gillespie has vowed to avoid most sharp adjustments of individual rates  in her pricing plan next week. Unlike the plan proposed Thursday, hers will  have the force of law.  </P> <P> Among those joining in support of the plan were the California Council of Urban  Leagues; the Latino Issues Forum; the League of United Latin American Citizens;  the Mexican American Political Assn.; the American G.I. Forum; the Rainbow  Coalition; the Filipino-American Political Assn.; the Chinese for Affirmative  Action; the Center for Public Interest Law and the Consumers Union.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Annually demonstrate proficiency in conducting Class 1 and Class 2 tests on the type of freight equipment in the trains to which the crew member is assigned. ``Demonstrating proficiency'' means that each year the crew member must pass a substantially different written test conducted by the railroad on how to perform these brake system tests. Also, the crew member must perform each type of test to the satisfaction of a qualified train brake system supervisor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.213.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains the requirements for maintaining personnel qualification records and for the notification of personnel of their qualification status. FRA proposes to require that railroads keep personnel qualification records for all personnel responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of train brake systems. This section also specifically requires that railroads maintain these types of records for all contract personnel who perform brake system inspections, tests, or maintenance. Most railroads already keep records of this type. These records may be used by FRA to assess the adequacy of a railroad's qualification program determining whether properly qualified personnel are performing the necessary inspections, tests, and maintenance of train brake systems. As a means of ensuring that only properly qualified individuals are performing only those tasks for which they are qualified, FRA proposes to require railroads to promptly notify personnel of changes in their qualification status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.215.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section proposes requirements regarding which individuals may perform the various required tests, inspections, and maintenance. FRA intends to provide strong incentives to railroads and to set down clear restrictions on which individuals may perform which tasks in order to ensure that only qualified individuals perform brake system work and to ensure that only high-quality tests, inspections, and maintenance of train brake systems are performed. FRA has attempted to limit the use of train crew members in the performance of brake system inspections and tests. FRA proposes to require that train crew members meeting the qualification requirements stated in &sect;232.211 be allowed to perform Class 1 and Class 2 train brake system tests only on conventional freight trains restricted to 500 miles between train brake system tests. All other Class 1 tests and all maintenance would be performed by mechanical and/or electronic inspectors meeting the requirements of &sect;&sect;232.207 or 232.209. FRA also proposes to require that spot checks of train brake system work be performed only by supervisors that meet the qualification requirements of &sect;232.205. FRA thinks that the largest improvement railroads can make in safe train operation is ensuring that properly supervised and trained personnel perform all safety-critical train brake system work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed subpart provides inspection and test standards for conventional freight train brake systems. The standards contained in this subpart are applicable to all conventional freight locomotives and trains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.303.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section proposes the inspection and test standards for conventional freight locomotives. As stated previously, FRA wishes to consolidate all brake-related regulations into Part 232. Consequently, the requirements regarding periodic, annual, biennial, main reservoir, and leakage tests on locomotive brake components contained in &sect;&sect;229.25 through 229.31 and &sect;229.59 would be removed from Part 229 and incorporated into this section with minor editorial changes. It should be noted that the requirements concerning aluminum main reservoirs contained in &sect;229.31(d) would be eliminated since they applied only to a specific reservoirs which are no longer in service. Transducer-driven air gauge displays would be added to the requirements for testing air gauges since they are considered equal to air gauges and must be tested at the same frequency. The chart in paragraph (f) of this proposed section displays the intervals at which various types of equipment are to be cleaned, repaired, and tested. Type 26&hyph;L brake equipment devices are required to be cleaned, repaired, and tested at least every 1,104 days. This requirement applies only to 26&hyph;L brake equipment devices that were tested under H&hyph;80&hyph;7 or derivatives of such valves. The following specific devices are included: 26&hyph;C brake valve, 30&hyph;CDW brake valve, MU&hyph;2A valve, SA&hyph;26 Ind brake valve, 26&hyph;D and 26&hyph;F control valve, F&hyph;1 selector valve, J-type relay valve, A&hyph;1 charging cutoff pilot valve, No. 8 or KM vent valve, BP strainer, MR safety valve, foot valves, MR check valve, double check valves, magnet valves, H-type relay air valves, reducing valves, and P&hyph;2&hyph;A brake application valve. FRA recognizes that the test methods described in this section represent old technology. FRA proposes that the new regulations encourage the development of new non-destructive test methods as alternatives to the methods described in this section to ensure brake system components will safely function as designed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.305.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains general requirements regarding the development of written procedures for conventional freight train brake system tests. FRA believes that the foundation of any good test and inspection plan is the written procedures that provide detailed guidance on how to properly conduct the various required tests and inspections. FRA feels that the thinking process involved in developing written procedures requires a railroad to consider all aspects of the inspection and testing process, which should result in more efficient and thorough inspections. FRA agrees with many of the commenters that it would be far too intrusive and practically impossible for FRA to mandate specific methods for performing the various required inspections on various equipment. FRA feels that each railroad is in the best position to determine the method of inspection that best fits its operating conditions and equipment. However, the method of inspection developed by the railroad should ensure that all equipment is properly inspected and functioning in accordance with these regulations. A railroad is required to develop written procedures that are tailored to the types of trains and equipment operated by that railroad. The procedures should contain step-by-step instructions for performing the various train brake system tests required by this proposed rule, which include: Class 1, Class 2, transfer train, and running tests. Written procedures will also be required for the testing and inspecting of equipment that incorporates new brake system technology. Furthermore, written procedures will be required that explain the method and means for maintaining records of brake system tests aboard the train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

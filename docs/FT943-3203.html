			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): Good news for Belfast planners - Property market The announcement last week by Hilton International of its plans to build a Pounds 17m (Dollars 26.35m) 187-room luxury hotel alongside the Lagan river in Belfast, could not have come at a better moment for the city's development planners. Coinciding as it does with the IRA ceasefire and growing hopes that an end to the 25 years of troubles in the province may have finally arrived, the property market in Northern Ireland, may soon be facing a boom of the economic rather than the Semtex variety. The Belfast Hilton will help anchor a planned Pounds 130m investment scheme in the Laganbank development site just 500 metres from the City Hall and main shopping centre. This will include a Pounds 29m 2,250-seat concert hall and conference centre and some 450,000 sq ft of new office space, as well as commercial premises for pubs and restaurants. The Laganbank site itself is part of a much larger redevelopment scheme taking place alongside the entire tidal reach of the Lagan river, which divides Belfast in two. The completion in March this year of the Lagan weir, close to the Hilton site, has turned the Lagan river - formerly a somewhat ugly and smelly tidal estuary - into an attractive lake amenity to which waterfowl, windsurfers, and wayfarers have already begun to gravitate. Mr Mike Smith, the director of development at Laganside Corporation, the body responsible for developing the various sites along the river, said he is expecting the announcement of the first phase of the office development at the Laganbank site to be made shortly. The Pounds 10m sale earlier this year of the Abercorn Centre, a 65,000 sq ft office block, to First Trust Bank, has meant that 'there is no longer any modern office space unlet in Belfast,' he said. Moreover, areas around Queen's university, hitherto favoured by professional firms of lawyers, accountants and consultants, are becoming congested and are extremely short of car parking space. Laganside Corporation is therefore hoping to attract some of these firms to the Clarendon Dock site which is being refurbished with Pounds 4m in EU funds. Mr Barry Gilligan, the chief executive of Ewart plc, the Belfast-based property development company which is jointly building the new hotel with the Hilton group, says that office rents are in the region of Pounds 8-9 per sq ft, equivalent to some provincial cities on the mainland - 'around Pounds 9 is break-even for any new office development, and given that there is now no new office space in the city, we should be able to see a new development shortly,' he says. Figures from the valuation and lands agency show that 1.6m of the 5.6m sq ft total of office space in Belfast is of top quality and built to modern, high specifications, but that there is nothing available in units in excess of 50,000 sq ft and very few units from 20,000-50,000 sq ft. The first phase of the anticipated Laganbank development will involve the construction of 150,000 sq ft of office space. There is a market take-up of space of 200,000 sq ft per year, according to Ewart, down considerably from some 750,000 sq ft per year in the late 1980s when government offices were taking the bulk of that through relocation schemes. But this should be sufficient to make the ongoing development of the site feasible - 'with the concert hall, the hotel and the first phase of the office development the site will be viable' says Mr Gilligan. Other key sites along the Lagan are the 26-acre former gasworks, upriver of the weir, and the even-larger Abercorn basin just below the weir on the east side of the river and adjoining the docks. Mr Smith says that the first developments at the gasworks are expected to be announced later this autumn and will include public space, performance areas, and business and commercial premises. Adjoining both Catholic and Protestant housing estates which have been rocked by sectarian atrocities in recent years, it is hoped that the development will help build a bridge between the two communities, especially if a new peaceful era lies ahead. Developments at the Abercorn Basin are to await the completion next year of the Pounds 65m crossharbour road and rail bridges which skirt the site. When complete, together with a motorway link-up to the east which is due for completion in 1998, the Abercorn Basin is to be marketed as a site for light industrial developments, having first-class access not only to the city centre, but to the ferry port and the Belfast city airport and to the road and rail network throughout Ireland. The only sector of the Belfast property market not likely to see any big developments for the next three to four years is in retailing. The Castlecourt shopping complex in the city centre, together with several developments on the outskirts which are being slowly expanded, has left the city with a small surplus of retail space. The valuation and lands agency notes, however, that despite a static market in rents for the past two years, recent survey data point to only 2 per cent of retail space being unlet, while in prime pitches 'there remains a potential shortage of space'. Prime rents in these locations at around Pounds 140 per sq ft 'stand comparison with almost all good retail locations outside central London,' the agency says. Already well-served with modern retail developments and extensive pedestrianised areas, having first class access by road, rail, sea and air, and on the verge of seeing a series of new office, commercial and light industrial developments alongside the river Lagan, Belfast is potentially one of the fastest developing cities in the UK - and if peace does come, one of the most attractive destinations for relocation.</p>

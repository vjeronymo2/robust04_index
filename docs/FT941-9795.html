			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Havas profits tumble 14% to FFr705m Havas saw consolidated net profits fall by an estimated 14 per cent to FFr705m (Dollars 118.5m) last year, from FFr823m in 1992. The group, which has extensive interests in advertising, travel, and the media, blamed the fall in profits on the 'persistently difficult economic environment' and on high exceptional losses. Havas, whose investments include a stake in the the Canal Plus television company, mustered a 23.2 per cent rise in turnover, to FFr34.71bn during the year, from FFr28.18bn in 1992. However, the increase was mainly fuelled by the contribution of additions to the group. The real rate of sales growth on existing businesses and on constant exchange rates was just 2.8 per cent. The only area of its established activities to show growth last year was advertising and free newspapers, where Havas saw sales rise by 9 per cent to FFr19.03bn from FFr17.45bn. Havas saw sales fall elsewhere. The outdoor advertising division suffered a reduction in turnover of 13.2 per cent, to FFr3.08bn from FFr3.55bn the previous year. Sales from tourism slipped by 1 per cent to FFr6.92bn from FFr6.99bn over the same period. The crux of the group's problems last year was the depressed state of the French economy. However, its trading difficulties in France were aggravated by exceptional losses of FFr115m during 1993, which negated the year's exceptional profits of FFr100m. Despite its problems, Havas pressed ahead with expansion plans, and made FFr2.3bn of consolidated investments during 1993. This year, it plans to pursue its long-term strategy of developing its audio-visual interests.</p>

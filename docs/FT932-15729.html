			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff urges Aberdeen shareholders to accept bid PITTENCRIEFF, the acquisitive natural resources and communications company stalking USM concern Aberdeen Petroleum, is urging its target's shareholders to 'participate in success' with its Pounds 7.7m all-paper bid. Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, drew attention to Pittencrieff's track record in the offer document published on Thursday. 'It has increased cash flow, earnings and net assets per share in each year between 1988 and 1991 and dividends per share since payments began in 1990,' the document read. Aberdeen, on the other hand, had an erratic earnings record and had paid no dividends since its introduction to the USM in 1988. Pittencrieff is offering two of its shares for every 49 of Aberdeen's. This values shares at Aberdeen at 15p, against a close on Thursday of 15 3/4 p. Pittencrieff closed steady at 368p.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDATORY PRO BONO WORK IS NOT THE ROUTE TO JUSTICE FOR INDIGENTS IN CIVIL  CASES  </P> <P> The unmet need for volunteers to represent indigent clients in civil cases is  growing at a faster rate than the glut of lawyers graduating from American law  schools. Is the solution then to compel lawyers to accept court-appointed  clients without compensation? The U.S. Supreme Court will tackle this question  today when a young Iowa lawyer argues his first case before the high court.  </P> <P> John E. Mallard practices business law in Fairfield, Iowa. In June of 1987, he  was appointed by the U.S. District Court to represent three inmates at the Iowa  State Penitentiary who had filed a civil rights suit against prison  administrators. The suit claims that the prison officials endangered the  inmates by exposing their role as informants. Mallard, citing his lack of  litigation experience, asked to withdraw from the case. The court refused to  let him off the hook, and Mallard ultimately petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court  to review the pro bono, or no fee, appointment. When a hearing was granted, bar  associations lined up on both sides of the case to file "friend of the court"  briefs. Bar groups that support mandatory pro bono requirements for lawyers,  such as the Bar of the City of New York, are opposing Mallard. The State Bar of  California is supporting him.  </P> <P> The most difficult issue in Mallard's case is posed by the claim that federal  courts have "inherent authority" to order lawyers to accept cases. This claim  is supported by historical precedent for criminal cases. For many years, before  public defender offices were established, courts would simply appoint whatever  lawyer happened to be in the courtroom that day to represent an indigent  defendant. Often forgotten, however, is the sordid doubled standard of justice  that prevailed under this system. Appointed lawyers frequently sought the  earliest opportunity to plead their clients guilty. Also overlooked is the fact  that a century ago, most lawyers went to court, and the burden of taking  appointed cases could be spread among the entire bar.  </P> <P> Today, the vast majority of lawyers seldom see the inside of a courtroom.  Limiting appointments to those who are litigators means that the burden of pro  bono representation falls on relatively few shoulders.  </P> <P> Ironically, the assertion of judicial authority to mandate acceptance of  court-appointed clients may undermine the voluntary programs now in place. The  thousands of lawyers who participate as volunteers maintain control over their  caseloads. As long as they are free to reject a case that may be too burdensome  or costly, or demand competence in unfamiliar terrain, they remain willing to  accept their fair share. Once the courts begin mandating the acceptance of pro  bono clients, then few lawyers will volunteer to take cases not meeting that  mandatory obligation. A process of displacement could occur, in which only the  needs of indigents whose claim for counsel has been recognized by the courts  would be met. Others equally deserving would be left unserved.  </P> <P> No one seriously suggests that the health needs of indigents should be met by  compelling doctors to accept indigent patients. Providing a minimal level of  health care is perceived as a public responsibility, not just a responsibility  of the medical profession. Yet, for eight years, funding for legal services for  indigents has been mercilessly cut, and the clients turned away are left to  seek handouts from volunteers.  </P> <P> Giving courts the power to compel acceptance of clients in civil cases is  likely to accelerate the process of public funding cutbacks and  institutionalize a double standard of justice. One class of justice would be  reserved for paying clients, while appointed clients would receive the kind of  justice that indigent, criminal defendants received a century ago.  </P> <P> As Meyer Goldman, a founder of the public defender movement, put it: "Too  frequently, the services (of appointed lawyers), if rewarded by small fees, are  half-hearted or openly negligible . . . The client pays the penalty, perhaps  not for the crime charged, but often for his poverty." The public defender  system has worked well in providing competent representation for indigent  defendants in criminal cases. Publicly funded legal-aid clinics come closer to  our ideal of "equal justice for all" than a system of judicially mandated  charity.  </P> <P> Clearly, some lawyers are shirkers. A recent poll commissioned by the American  Bar Assn. reported that only one out of five American lawyers volunteer to  handle pro bono civil cases. But today's level of specialization simply means  that many lack the competence to handle the kinds of cases where indigents need  representation. Many such lawyers contribute to their communities in other  ways. In arguing his own case before the Supreme Court, Mallard faces a  paradox. The more brilliant his advocacy, the less compelling will be his claim  that he lacks competence in litigation skills. But more than the personal  competence of John E. Mallard is at issue in the case of Mallard vs. U.S.  District Court.  </P></p>

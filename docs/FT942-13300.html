			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / BBC to raise regional output by Pounds 75m a year The BBC is to embark on the largest transfer of programming outside London in its history. By 1997 the BBC hopes to have increased the amount of network television and radio programmes produced outside London from a fifth to a third. This will increase programme spending in the regions by Pounds 75m a year. Mr John Birt, director-general of the BBC, said the regional strategy was a response to the widespread view that the corporation inadequately reflected the art, culture and perspectives of the rest of the UK. Only about 100 employees will have to move from London and much of the change will be accounted for by increased commissions to independent producers based in the regions. The new regional policy follows a study by Mr David Hatch, adviser to Mr Birt, who yesterday said a move to one-third regional production was 'a feel-right figure'. However, Mr Hatch rejected a proposal that Radio 2 should move to Birmingham, although 'through the night' programming will transfer there. Mr Ron Neil, managing director of regional broadcasting, said yesterday that an 'indefensibly low' number of programmes had been made outside London'. He added: 'The licence money comes from every home and street in the land and our network production patterns will now reflect that more faithfully.' Categories such as acquired programmes, repeats, sports and daily news are excluded from the calculations. The plans call for the setting up of an English regional arts centre and a new weekly current affairs production base in Manchester. A new children's production centre is to be set up in Glasgow by the middle of next year and a centre of excellence for music production created in Cardiff. Mr Hatch made it clear yesterday that the BBC was setting targets, not quotas, and 'the money would follow the ideas'.</p>

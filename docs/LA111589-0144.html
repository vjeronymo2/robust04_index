			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1,000 STUDENTS PROTEST BAN ON SAVANNA TEAM  </P> <P> About 1,000 students of Savanna High School walked out of classes for two hours  this morning to protest a decision banning the football team from playoffs this  weekend for using an ineligible player.  </P> <P> Students walked out of classes at 8 a.m. and rallied on the school's front  lawn, waving banners and placards and chanting slogans in support of the  Savanna Rebels, who forfeited a berth in the Southern Section Division VI  playoffs, six victories and a tie for using a player who was in his fifth year  of high school.  </P> <P> The Rebels had secured their first championship of the Orange League in the  school's nine-year history. That was also nullified by league principals who  voted Tuesday on behalf of the California Interscholastic Federation.  </P> <P> Members of the Savanna High Football Boosters Club said today that they had  retained a lawyer to try to overturn the principals' decision in court, just as  the boosters club for Huntington Beach High School's Oilers successfully did  Tuesday. Gloria George, a Savanna Boosters leader, said a suit was to be filed  in Orange County Superior Court today.  </P> <P> "We're going to stay here until we get it (the title) back," Denise Gaiye, a  15-year-old sophomore wearing a Rebels jersey and a Rebels bandanna, said  defiantly in a crowd of cheering students. "What we desire is what we're after.  Because you know what, it was not Savanna's fault."  </P> <P> A school administrator Tuesday acknowledged that he did not check closely  enough on the transcript records of transfer student Ray Leuta, a reserve  lineman who Savanna officials thought was playing in his fourth year. The  school was notified by an administrator at one of Leuta's previous schools this  week that the youth was actually in his fifth year.  </P> <P> Savanna Principal William Wong said about three-quarters of the school's 1,460  students participated in the walkout and rally.  </P></p>

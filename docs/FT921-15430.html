The brewer is to transfer one of its two high-speed canning lines from the Fountain brewery, Edinburgh, to its Royal brewery, Manchester, where it will be better placed to supply the take-home drinks trade. A new Pounds 7.5m bottling line will be installed on the vacated site in Edinburgh to cope with demand for the company's bottled beers.</p>

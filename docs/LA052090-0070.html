			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO CANCELS WAR GAMES TO SHIFT SCENARIOS  </P> <P> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, responding to sweeping changes in the  former East Bloc, has canceled its biennial nuclear war games until it can  devise more realistic -- and politically acceptable -- scenarios for the  exercises, U.S. and NATO officials said.  </P> <P> The decision to cancel the controversial games came after alliance officials  tried unsuccessfully to find an alternative simulation that would not offend  the 14 NATO countries that normally participate in the exercises.  </P> <P> The canceled Wintex-Cimex games -- short for Warning and Intelligence Exercise  and Civil-Military Exercise -- involve a group of lower-level national security  officials from the participating nations.  </P> <P> The nuclear war games have sparked particular controversy in West Germany. Bonn  abruptly called for early termination of the last such exercises in March,  1989, because the participants authorized simulated nuclear strikes on East  Germany and a second round of strikes that involved use of nuclear weapons on  West German soil. At the time, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the  scenario "completely unacceptable" to Germans.  </P> <P> Officials said that West German political sensitivities were a key factor in  the alliance's recent decision to cancel future games.  </P> <P> In addition, military and political officials acknowledged that the traditional  Wintex-Cimex scenario has become increasingly anachronistic and implausible.  </P> <P> "There's no point in doing something that might prove to be irrelevant, or if  (some of the allies) have reservations that are reasonable," said one  knowledgeable U.S. official. "It's time to re-evaluate. We are in a time of  transition."  </P> <P> The cancellation of Wintex-Cimex comes as NATO is reassessing its entire  spectrum of war games and military simulations. The alliance is attempting to  devise more cost-effective training and to adjust its responses to changing  circumstances, particularly the rapid dissolution of the Warsaw Pact as a  military entity.  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Blood, sweat and Euro-tears A FLICKER of a smirk may well have passed across the the face of even the most ardent Germanophile and committed European during the past week. Seeing the political establishment of much admired and increasingly imitated Germany face large-scale public sector strikes reminds one of Britain in the 1970s or France in the late 1960s. But any morbid satisfaction at this apparent humbling of an economic giant is misplaced. A weakened and strife-ridden Germany spells danger for the stability and prosperity of the entire continent. It would be hard to imagine a more difficult and risky time for the European Community to integrate the entire European continent. But that is what it is attempting to do, by widening the scope of its activities and possibly membership to include eastern Europe and the rest of western Europe and simultaneously by strengthening ties between its current members. Western Europe could not, of course, choose the timing of the disintegration of the communist bloc. To complain about it, or simply to have ignored it, would have been both churlish and foolhardy. The opportunity to tie eastern Europe into the west had to be taken when it arose, a fact that Germany was quickest to grasp. The failure of the German political elite was not to move too fast to reunify Germany, but to conceal from the west German public the scale of the necessary sacrifices. When speeches stressing blood, sweat and tears were needed, Mr Helmut Kohl offered only blithe optimism. The subsequent east German economic collapse has been cushioned by massive west German transfers financed by higher taxes and downward pressure on real wages in the west: hence the strikes. Harsh apprenticeship Ironically, it is precisely when the weaknesses of Germany's inflexible system are being exposed that the rest of Europe has decided to embrace certain aspects of it on a pan-European scale. The momentum behind transforming a quasi-Germanic monetary system, the European exchange rate mechanism, into Germany writ large, European monetary union, remains too strong to resist. But no one, certainly neither France nor Italy, could have appreciated at the outset quite how harsh their apprenticeship would turn out to be, largely because a period of tight German monetary policy has exported slow growth and high unemployment across Europe. Yet having come this far, Europe has little option but to persevere. Accelerating the move to monetary union is politically impossible, however much France would like to get its hands on the monetary levers. Germany in its current state is not going to cede control over the D-Mark. The lurking suspicion that Germany will never be happy to do so, whether or not it ratifies the Maastricht treaty, must haunt the dreams of French finance ministers, past and present. Nor is any government able to advocate a retreat from the Maastricht timetable; and an ERM realignment, however desirable two years ago, would not deliver lower European interest rates. The more likely route to lower rates would be for the ERM to crumble following further rises in German interest rates. Gritted teeth More likely, Europe will grit its teeth and bear the pain. Germany will suffer angry complaints from its partners until it puts its fiscal house in order. But the prospect for sharply lower German interest rates this year or even next is still poor. The 'blood, sweat and tears' option is not without grave risks. Slow growth and rising unemployment are nurturing far right parties in both France and Germany; and Italy looks more precariously placed than at any time in its recent history. The task it faces in bringing its fiscal deficit under control to meet the Emu convergence criteria would be daunting enough for the most stable of governments. But with no president, no government and no growth, Italy could be heading for a financial disaster. The UK appears to offer an oasis of political stability; and, unlike France, it has room for a modest interest rate cut. But the recovery has yet to materialise; and the combination of high real interest rates and heavy household debts means it may well be sluggish when it does. Sadly, an economically depressed and strife-torn Europe is unlikely to be able to rise to the political challenges it faces in the east. The miserly and protectionist association agreements with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia do not bode well for eastern Europe's future. The EC, instead, risks retreating further from the liberal and progressive goals it claims to hold dear. The result of last week's machinations over support for Europe's troubled car industry suggests that the EC may be shuffling towards an 'industrial policy' of shoring up lame ducks. Continued slow growth will mean a plethora of limping candidates. Many political obituaries of Mrs Edith Cresson labelled her a product of a past age. Keeping her ghost in check may yet turn out to be a substantial task.</p>

The workers from radio stations CMKS, "Radio Trinchera  Anti-Imperialista," and (CMDX, "La Voz del Toa"), in the  important area city of Baracoa, will spend several days doing  work in support of the food program in order to contribute to  furthering the planting plan of some 25 caballerias of tomatoes.    Prior to this, the jury for the event reflected upon and  analyzed more than 50 works of various kinds. The best programs,  documentaries, news reports, reportages, and other works from  among these will win prizes.    Assembly brigades are working quickly to install equipment  in  the radio studios of the chief municipal towns of Imias and San  Antonio del Sur. These studios will be inaugurated at the end of  this month.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Yeltsin's perilous balancing act: Russia's economic reforms face near-certain failure if the west refuses to provide massive financial support Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has spent three days in his ravaged country between returning from a visit to the US, Canada and the UK on Sunday and leaving for a state visit to France today. This is not a jaunt: he has the most urgent need to convince the Group of Seven leading industrial countries that he must get financial support, and very soon, if his government's economic reform is not to fail. It is close to it. Already, a month after the price liberalisation which was the dramatic overture to reform, it is being written off by parliament, industrial barons, distinguished economists and, of course, a suffering people whom polls show to be losing faith in the success of any change. The 'patriotic', or hard-line nationalist, forces are having a convention in Moscow this weekend to drum up reaction - and are likely to be addressed by Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president. Neo-communists plan a march on the White House, the Russian parliament, on Sunday: democrats plan a counter-march. It is reminiscent of the scenes a year ago, when the streets of Moscow were the arena for the competing partisans of the Soviet and the Russian governments: now, it is the Russian government on the defensive. Can the government keep reform going? More, can the states of the former Soviet Union both institute radical change and find their way to a new nationhood - without so increasing tensions that they are driven to find a release for them in violent disputes, even wars? All are now faced with what has emerged as the post-communist dilemma: that of making long-overdue, but unpopular, shifts in the pattern of their economies while seeking to retain a democratic legitimacy which distinguishes them most sharply from their communist predecessors. In a speech in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Lech Walesa, the Polish president, told the west it had given him insufficient help and Polish democracy was now in danger: the former Soviet Union faces the west, now, with a much more urgent plea. This is only in part because these states are more numerous, impoverished and ruined even than Poland was. More seriously, it is because there are two crises intersecting here: the economic collapse from which all the states are suffering: and the national crises in which they are all struggling to assert individuality and consciousness within the shattered framework of a common economic space from which they all want to escape but which they are still doomed to share. The resources for reform are almost completely lacking. All the republics are running deficit budgets, and none has hard currency in any significant quantities - while that which there is, is held by enterprises, often abroad, to keep it out of the voracious hands of the desperate states. The Russian Bank for Foreign Affairs, for example, appropriated all its Soviet customers' hard currency to pay back debts - a striking example of the authorities' reflex belief that there is no such thing as private property. Apart from oil, gas, timber, diamonds and gold, they produce little that anyone else wants. Production and productivity are both falling fast - the former by 20 per cent over the year, and continuing. Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, has cut the budget allocation for military hardware to 15 per cent of its last year's level, which saves billions. But the budget gives only Rbs10bn to military conversion which, as Mr Vitaly Vitebsky, a Russian parliamentary deputy and member of the commission on the budget, said, 'is not enough to pay off those made redundant by the closure of defence plants'. Ominously, this will mean that these plants are now scavenging abroad for military orders - from anywhere, for anything. The other republics fare no better: most will do worse, even if their food situation is presently easier. The poorer republics, with a primitive financial infrastructure, will have as many difficulties in collecting budget and hard currency revenues as Russia has. No enterprise which can avoid them pays taxes, nor sells the obligatory 40 per cent of hard currency earnings to the state for half the normal rate (at 110 roubles to the dollar, itself now well below the market rate). Everyone who can asks for hard currency payment to be made into foreign bank accounts (illegal, but quite openly practised). There are no, or very few, resources: there may also be insufficient will. To be sure, almost every leader, every budding entrepreneur, every re-painted communist, now talks of the need for radical, pro-market, pro-democratic reform, and of his commitment to it. But much of this is rhetoric: the expression of a desire for a better life without the determination to achieve it by leaving the familiar, if threadbare, folds of the old. Among the constellation of top Russian leaders - Mr Yeltsin, Mr Rutskoi, and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the parliament - not one is other than, on his own account, passionately committed to the most radical reform. Yet in the past few days, both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Khasbulatov have called not just for an immediate cessation of the present version of reform but for a return to some elements of the state system. In this they have been joined by a legion of economists - Dr Nikolai Petrakov, Mr Abel Aganbegyan, Mr Pavel Bunich and others - who have gravely criticised the Russian team of 'young (read: naive) economists'. These men have all in the past formulated reform plans, for the then Soviet government, none of which were carried out: they now see a Russian government carry out reform without any plan and are calling a halt. But the problem of political will lies deeper. Reform engages only one element of the overall political project of Russia and the other states, and often the less important one. The more important element is the building of the nation. It is this which engages the real passion and energies: this which is the force which fires up the pulse of the politicians and makes their otherwise terrible job attractive. Nationalism is already firing up the Caucasus, where the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians struggle over Nagorno Karabakh and the Georgians have taken only a temporary lull in fighting with the minorities on their territories. Nationalism is setting Russians and other minorities against the Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians in the Baltics, and is even driving the Russian autonomous republics - Chechen-Ingushetia, Tatarstan and Yakutia - towards declarations of an independence quite impossible to contemplate if Russia is to be the unified state Mr Yeltsin has said it will be. At a recent session of the Russian Constitutional Commission, charged with producing Russia's first democratic constitution, Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, its secretary, said there was now a 'spiral of confrontation in the form of a war of constitutions' between Russia and some of its subordinate units. But the most serious issue is that between the Ukraine and Russia, the two great Slav states which were the fulcrum of the Soviet Union and before that, of the Tsarist empire. By tomorrow, the Russian parliament should decide whether or not to endorse the view of its Committee on International Affairs of January 14, that the assignment of the Crimea from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction in 1954 was illegal, and is thus void: it if does so, it ratchets up the developing quarrel between the two states to critical levels. Last month, Mr Vladimir Lukin, just now appointed the Russian ambassador to the US and then chairman of the International Affairs Committee, suggested in a memo to Mr Yeltsin that if the Ukraine did not agree to Russian control of the disputed Black Sea fleet (whose bases are in the Crimea), then Russia should use the expected parliamentary decision against the legality of the Crimean transfer as a stick with which to beat the Ukrainians into line, and to 'activate a Crimean independence movement' among the majority Russian population there. In short, Mr Lukin, a noted liberal reformer, was proposing the time-honoured and dangerous option of one state using 'its' minority in another's territory to force it to submission. Mr Lukin made clear that his aim was to guard the administration's flanks against ultra-nationalists: he wrote that 'a submissive (to the Ukraine) stand will play into the hands of the right-wing nationalist group in Russia, whereas a firm one will raise a broad wave of support for the Russian administration'. This is no chimera. The ultra-nationalists gather this weekend, with Mr Rutskoi in attendance: the streets of Moscow may become a battleground. If even figures like Mr Lukin see the need to harden the democratic stance against the nationalist threat, then reform is indeed in danger. On one side, the Russian and the other states' economies face a collapse from hyperinflation snd lack of support: on the other, the nations inside and outside of Russia lock themselves into hostilities in which no compromise is possible. Even an analysis done by economists friendly to the government, from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, concludes that the most likely outcome is that 'macroeconomic stablisation will fail in the coming months': a pessimistic outcome, though more likely than the optimistic variant, sees the republics at war. The rapidly developing and intersecting economic and national crises (added to them the subsidiary but potentially more frightening matters of control of civil and military nuclear resources) - leave foreign states, and especially the Group of Seven, with a harsh set of options. One is, in brief, to note what is happening, pray that the worsening flow of events will not continue in the direction logic appears to dictate, and hope that the IMF can stop collapse. The other is to be drawn, ineluctably, further and deeper into the Former Soviet Mess - an unattractive position for most foreign governments, but one now being urged upon them by advisers, policy thinkers and at least some within the IMF and the World Bank. The model, often mentioned, is the Marshall Plan of 1947, under which US aid was channelled to the shattered states of western Europe: but the model is only partly useful, since these states were all market economies, all had experienced (in the market and democracy) elites and a good deal of serviceable infrastructure. Given the monetary tools, the Europeans could get on with the job of reconstruction. This does not appear to be so for the former Soviet Union - where, with the partial exception of Moscow, the layer of expertise, of understanding and of efficiency at government and enterprise level is as thin as tissue and as easily broken. The issue is now, squarely, before the western states. The demand articulated by Mr Yeltsin and his government is for immediate support: a fund to stabilise the rouble, of about Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn: a further amount, of about the same, to provide for imports of badly needed food and medicine. And this to be provided in the next month or at most two - long before the application Russia is now making to join the IMF will have been processed. Beyond Russia's demands are those of the other states, smaller but no less needy. It is the Demand - some would say the Hold-Up - of the Century: the plea for huge sums, or the consequences will be disintegration, conflict, a huge Yugoslavia. Mr Yeltsin flies off again today to discover if the west will pay up.</p>

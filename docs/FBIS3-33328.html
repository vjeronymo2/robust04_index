			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro; from the "Acir Radio News" </F> newscast--live]    [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] Jorge Madrazo, National  Human Rights Commission [CNDH] president, has called a press  conference to present a preliminary report on the results of 52  days of investigations on the respect for human rights in  Chiapas, specifically in the area of the armed conflict. We now  go to Oscar Navarro with the details.    [Navarro] Just as you said, Jorge Madrazo, after presenting  his preliminary report on the events of Altos de Chiapas, has  said the CNDH has stated it has received and begun to  investigate 218 complaints involving 727 individuals. Of these,  20 are due to acts perpetrated by the Zapatista National  Liberation Army [EZLN]; seventy-six are against members of the  Mexican Army; four are against personnel from the Attorney  General's Office; three are against employees and state  government officials, and one is against the municipal  presidents of Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Tenejapa.    In a lengthy communique, Ombudsman Jorge Madrazo has stated  the CNDH has 218 case files regarding, among others, 56 murders,  30 cases of aggression, 427 kidnappings and disappearances, 25  cases of torture, 80 for illegal arrest, four for illegal  property confiscation, two for intimidation, two for robbery,  and four for air strikes. I believe we should hear what Jorge  Madrazo had to say about the air strikes.    [Begin Madrazo recording] It has been initially determined  the projectiles used where the CNDH conducted its investigation  are known as rockets. Their destructive capability, given the  expansive range and effects of fragmentation, is less than that  caused by what is commonly known as a bomb. [end recording]    [Navarro] Madrazo added 404 cases of missing people have  been  solved; twenty-three are still pending. He also highlighted the  fact that 20,000 people have fled from their homes in the areas  where the EZLN is operating. There have also been reports of  abuse against Indians. Let's listen to the report on deaths in  the before mentioned municipalities.    [Begin Madrazo recording] There were a total of 40 deaths;  of  these, 20 were identified as civilians; six were government  troops, and 14 were unidentified individuals who have not yet  been claimed and who could very well be EZLN members. This has  not been confirmed. The total number of deaths reported at the  CNDH is 145, including 14 members of the Mexican Army and 38  public security personnel. [end recording]    [Navarro] The ombudsman explained CNDH intervention will not  cease when the investigations conclude. The commission has  agreed to establish a permanent program for Altos de Chiapas and  the surrounding jungles, which will be to attend to the  consequences in which the conflict will surely result.    Madrazo concluded the CNDH has determined that several  Indian  chiefs, who in addition to demanding that the commission leave  the Chiapas region, could jeopardize the peace process, just to  defend their selfish interests.</p>

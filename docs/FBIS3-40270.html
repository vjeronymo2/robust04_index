			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Steel Exporter Slovakia"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava -- The deficit in the foreign trade  balance of the Slovak Republic increased to 16.2 billion korunas  [Sk] by the end of November 1993. The deficit for the first 10  months of last year stood at only Sk10.2 billion.    According to an analysis carried out by the Slovak  Statistical Office, the greatest deficit -- Sk23.129 billion --  is in the Slovak Republic's trade with the former CEMA [Council  for Mutual Economic Assistance] countries, excluding the states  of the Visegrad Four, that is, the CEFTA [Central European Free  Trade Association] countries. The Slovak Republic's foreign  trade balance with CEFTA countries shows a surplus of Sk7.449  billion, Sk2.858 of which is accounted for by the Czech  Republic. In the first 11 months of the year, the Slovak  Republic also had a surplus, amounting to Sk1.72 billion, in its  trade with the states of the European Union. Trade with the  states of the European Free Trade Association shows the opposite  trend. In the first 11 months of 1993, the Slovak Republic  recorded an Sk6.012 billion deficit in trade with these  countries. On the other hand, the Slovak Republic had a surplus  in its trade with Asian countries and with the states of the  African continent. An Sk2.235 billion deficit was recorded in  the Slovak Republic's trade with the United States and an Sk118  million deficit in trade with Australia.    According to the Slovak Statistical Office analysis, the  Slovak Republic primarily imports raw materials, fuels, mineral  oil, bitumen, and wax. The number one item among Slovak exports  are iron and steel. Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and  appliances and their components are in second place, and motor  vehicles, tractors, and motorcycles in third.    [Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 28 January on  page 2 carries a 300-word "ba"-attributed report on Slovak  Statistical Office data on foreign trade in the first 11 months  of 1993, which adds that the Czech Republic accounted for 36.7  percent of Slovak imports and for 42.2 percent of Slovak exports  in this period.]</p>

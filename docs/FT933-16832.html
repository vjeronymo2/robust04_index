			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reform brings fresh hope to Ghana's cocoa farmers - Prospects for the industry following the demise of the state buying monopoly GHANA'S long-suffering cocoa farmers are looking forward to better prices and prompt payment as private traders begin competing for their crops this month, ending the Ghana Cocoa Board's monopoly of the cocoa trade. Although Cocobod, as the board is known, will remain in charge of cocoa exports, three trading companies have been licensed to buy the crop at the farm gate. Competition is expected to be fierce, as Cocobod will pay a takeover fee of 54,000 cedis (Dollars 90) a tonne on cocoa delivered to port. The government last week set the new producer price for the 1993-94 season at C308,000 a tonne, a 19.4 per cent increase over the previous season. This is expected to function as a floor price, as competition between traders may bid up the amount offered to farmers. Traders are also promising to reimburse farmers quickly. Under the old regime, producers often waited for months for Cocobod to pay up. The reforms have revived the moribund co-operative movement in Ghana. More than 200,000 farmers have combined to form the Ghana Co-operative Marketing Association - one of the three companies to have won a trading licence from the government. Co-operative's members are both nervous and excited at the challenges that lie ahead. They have been busy obtaining bank loans to finance their start-up costs - fleets of trucks, weighing scales and tarpaulins to shelter their purchases. They have also approached aid agencies for help. 'We will only know how good the business is after the first season,' says Mr Kojo Danso-Mensah at the co-op's ramshackle offices above a chicken farming outlet in the heart of Accra. 'But we are promising our members a bonus depending on how much profit we make. Producers will get their money as fast as we can deliver the cocoa to port.' The traders insist that competition will not be at the expense of quality, as Cocobod will still oversee quality control at buying points. Mr Osae Annoh, the co-op's treasurer, says farmers have also benefitted from the privatisation of Cocobod's unprofitable farms. He and three colleagues bought a 200-hectare (495-acre) estate from the government last year. 'If you can prove your knowledge and interest in cocoa farming, you can buy these farms at one-tenth of their real value,' he says. With more state farms up for sale, Mr Annoh predicts that 'the co-operative movement will get a new lease of life with the government's privatisation programme'. He planted 20,000 cocoa seedlings at the farm last year. The new season, which began in mid-June, looks promising. The timely rains that fell between March and May have led the government to forecast production during 1993-94 at 285,000 tonnes, up from 275,000 tonnes in 1992-93. Nevertheless, export revenues in 1993 are projected to fall to Dollars 280m from Dollars 303m last year and over Dollars 500m in 1986, when cocoa prices were at their peak. Mr KJ Adjei-Maafo, head of the cocoa policy unit at the 'Castle', the government seat in Accra, says his main objective at a time of plummeting cocoa prices is to maintain farmers' incomes, as 60 per cent of the rural population depend on this cash crop. It has not been an easy task. The Cocobod's bloated bureaucracy has been slashed from 100,000 employees to 46,000 and another 20,000 jobs are to go within the next five years. 'The lay-offs have not made me a popular man, but they were necessary to stave off the collapse of the industry,' Mr Adjei-Maafo says. To trim costs further, Cocobod's farms and chocolate factories have been privatised, and internal marketing opened to private sector competition. In spite of these measures, farmers are being paid only about half of the international market price for their crop. Cocobod's marketing, processing and agricultural extension services consume the remaining income. The government's target is to put at least 60 per cent of cocoa's market value into farmers' pockets. And he believes farmers are already responding to higher prices with better crop management. The average yield last season increased by 44 per cent to 405 kg a hectare. This, however, is still only half the level achieved in the neighbouring Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. There are more worries for Mr Adjei-Maafo. Ghana's efforts to give its farmers a better deal have led to a great deal of smuggling from the Ivory Coast, where the government has slashed its cocoa purchasing prices to remain competitive. The 'contamination' of Ghana's premium quality cocoa with its neighbour's inferior stuff is viewed with understandable apprehension. Smugglers who are caught are being charged with 'economic sabotage', a crime punished by life imprisonment. Mr Adjei-Maafo is also bitter about growing competition from Asian producers such as Malaysia, which has overtaken Ghana as the third largest exporter after the Ivory Coast and Brazil. 'Processing factories are learning to blend Asian beans with our premium produce, driving down prices and quality,' he explains. The outlook, he says, is grim. He does not see any improvement in cocoa prices over the next decade. And the government of Ghana, while not discouraging cocoa farmers, is not encouraging them to expand their farms either. The government hopes some farmers may be persuaded to switch to more promising export crops, such as pineapples. But the overriding importance of cocoa to the Ghanaian economy means that it will continue to depend on the world's taste for chocolate.</p>

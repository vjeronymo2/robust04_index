			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Checks Go to Farmers: More than $18 million was mailed to 6,860 farmers in 10  states who settled a legal dispute with Chubb Corp. over crop insurance  applications rejected during the 1988 drought. Lawrence Kane Jr., a Cincinnati  lawyer who was appointed by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin last fall to oversee  the payments, said the farmers should be mailed the remaining 50% of their  settlement payments by late April. Kane said he and his staff are still trying  to resolve objections by about 930 farmers who oppose the $36.6-million  settlement with Chubb Corp., based in Warren, N.J., and its insurance  subsidiaries. The class-action case involves 7,484 farmers in Illinois, Iowa,  Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri and  Wisconsin.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. M. Danishevskiy, V. Latinis, O. I. Konkov, E. </F> I. Terukov, M. M. Mezdrogina, M. S. Chusovitin; UDC 621.315.592]    [Abstract]The surface properties and pulse luminescence  spectra of relatively thick a-Si : H films  (approximately 1 micrometer) are researched. It is shown that  the porous structure on the surface of the films leads to the  appearance of a wide band of shortwave luminescence and a drop  in shortwave photoconductivity. It is shown that there is no  strip of luminescence in homogenous films (without columns)  which have ultraviolent photoconductivity. 3 graphs and 5  references.</p>

Publication of the Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 16, 1993, the Department published in the above Docket, at 58 FR 48556, a proposed rule entitled ``Appraisals and Property Valuation''. The proposal, among other things, would promulgate a new part 267 to title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations containing minimum standards for HUD real estate appraisals and criteria for the selection of appraisers by mortgagees. The preamble to the proposed rule describes, in greater detail than below, the legislative background for this rulemaking and set the rulemaking in the context of certain administrative changes that the Department had been considering on its own initiative. The preamble also explains the significant provisions of proposed part 267 as well as certain conforming amendments to other parts of HUD regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

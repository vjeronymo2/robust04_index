			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> GARAMENDI ACCEPTS FUNDS FROM WIVES OF INSURERS  </P> <P> Democratic Insurance Commissioner candidate John Garamendi has said for months  he will not take campaign contributions from insurance companies or their  executives. But, Garamendi said Thursday, the rule does not extend to donations  from the wives of insurance executives.  </P> <P> Garamendi acknowledged that following an Oct. 16 fund-raising event in Orange  County, some wives of executives of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. had  sent him checks for $500 or $1,000. Unlike checks from avowed employees of  various insurers, these checks would not be returned, Garamendi said.  </P> <P> As far as he knows, the wives were acting on their own behalf and had their own  interests, not linked to the insurance company for which their husbands worked,  Garamendi said.  </P> <P> Dale Debber, an aide to the Republican candidate for insurance commissioner,  Wes Bannister, said, however, that he has been told by people who attended the  fund-raiser at the Pacific Club in Newport Beach that both Garamendi and a  staff member had suggested that the wives give as a way of getting around his  no-insurer rule. Bannister has openly stated that he would take whatever  insurer contributions his campaign can get.  </P> <P> Garamendi flatly denied he had made such a suggestion and refused to say where  the staff member could be reached.  </P> <P> The Democratic candidate's comments came after an insurance industry  representative who studied the contribution reports and is familiar with  executives at Pacific Mutual told The Times that in the three days after the  fund-raiser as many as 26 wives of Pacific Mutual employees gave Garamendi $500  to $1,000.  </P> <P> Garamendi and a spokesman for Pacific Mutual denied in separate interviews that  the contributions came from 26 women. Both said they could not give a precise  number.  </P> <P> Among those listed as giving on Garamendi's contribution report were Marilyn  Phyllis Sutton, wife of Pacific Mutual Chairman Thomas Sutton; Darlene A.  Gerken, wife of Pacific Mutual President Walter Gerken, and Burdel Bubb, wife  of retired Pacific Mutual Chairman Harry Bubb. Each of the three gave $1,000,  the report shows.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Pacific Mutual, Bob Haskell, quoted Thomas Sutton as saying he  saw only four other Pacific Mutual people at Garamendi's fund-raiser. Haskell  said it was unfair "to lump in husbands with wives" in assessing such  contributions, because "the implication is that these wives are not individuals  in their own right." Garamendi agreed. He said the wives had "made their own  decisions" and it was not a violation of the spirit of his personal rule  against accepting insurers' contributions to accept their checks.  </P></p>

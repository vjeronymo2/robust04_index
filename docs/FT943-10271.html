			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Air Liquide acquires Italian energy producer Air Liquide, the French industrial gases group, yesterday announced that it has acquired Energheia, the Italian electrical energy company. The French group did not state the value of the transaction, but it is estimated at about FFr300m (Dollars 55.6m). Energheia, which is based near Milan, has annual sales of more than FFr100m. The company produces 270GW of electrical energy a year and 570,000 tonnes of vapour. Such dual production, known as cogeneration, is a growing business area for Air Liquide, which has similar operations in the US, and one in the Netherlands which is due to start production soon. Air Liquide said the acquisition, done through its Italian subsidiary, would make it an important partner of CESA, the Italian electricity group which supplies ENEL, the national electricity distri-butor. Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank, yesterday announced it is to sell its Belgian leasing operation to Locabel, a subsidiary of Banque Bruxelles Lambert. The size of the transaction was not disclosed, but BNP Lease, the company being sold, has assets estimated at BFr1.2bn (Dollars 36.9m). BNP said the operation will allow it to consolidate its Belgian activities while providing its clients with expanded leasing services. Under the terms of the agreement, Locabel will supply BNP's Belgian clients with leasing and rental services.</p>

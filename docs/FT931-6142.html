			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Scots factory set to win IBM support INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is expected to underwrite a project by one of its subcontractors to build a large factory for assembling its personal computers close to its plant at Greenock in western Scotland. The 400,000 sq ft plant would be built and operated by Mimtec, an electronics manufacturer owned by Murray International Holdings, which is 88 per cent owned by Mr David Murray, one of Scotland's leading entrepreneurs and chairman of Glasgow Rangers football club. The move partly reflects the increased demand for IBM's personal computers since it introduced a new range last autumn. Mimtec is one of several subcontractors assembling PCs for IBM, using a 75,000 sq ft plant at Livingston, West Lothian. Mimtec's new plant is likely to be at Gourock, a few miles from IBM's Greenock complex. It could open in about a year and employ about 400 people compared with the 2,200 at Greenock. The new plant would be built in the Inverclyde enterprise zone, created in 1989 after the rundown of the shipbuilding industry. Projects in enterprise zones enjoy exemption from business rates and development land tax, and 100 per cent tax allowances against buildings. Some Pounds 9m of the cost of the plant is likely to be met by an enterprise zone trust financed by investors, with the rest coming from grants. IBM would make up any shortfall on the trust and take over the ownership of the plant when the trust was paid back in a few years. The IBM plant at Greenock, which supplies Europe, the Middle East and Africa, allocates much assembly work to subcontractors while keeping its own workforce stable in order to hold down overheads. In this way subcontractors carry the burden of rapidly expanding and if necessary reducing their labour forces.</p>

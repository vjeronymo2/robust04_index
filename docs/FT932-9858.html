			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / MPs and OFT to attack CD prices THE MUSIC industry will today suffer the first of two expected attacks when the Commons national heritage committee publishes a report criticising the high price of compact discs. The committee report, out this morning, is expected to be followed within a few days by a recommendation from the Office of Fair Trading that the industry's pricing policies be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both the committee and the OFT are expected to concentrate on restrictions on 'parallel imports'. The restrictions, set out in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988, permit copyright holders to control the import of works. The committee and the OFT have asked why CDs are cheaper in the US than the UK and whether freer trade might result in lower prices for British consumers. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, told the committee last month that he had decided to examine CD prices in spite of the finding by Sir Gordon Borrie, his predecessor, that there were no grounds for an MMC inquiry. Sir Bryan told the committee: 'There is enough information there to make me concerned about the situation.' Music companies are resigned to a monopoly reference. They believe, however, that they will be able to persuade the commission that parallel import restrictions are essential to the health of UK music. They say cheap CD imports would undermine the UK industry and deprive it of the profits necessary for investment in new talent.</p>

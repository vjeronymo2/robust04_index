			<p>BFN     [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren  yesterday attended a forum held by the provincial party  committee core theory study group.    At the conclusion of the forum, entitled "Emancipate the  Mind, Brace Up, Carry Out Down-to-Earth Work, and Speed Up  Development," Secretary Liu Fangren delivered a speech in which  he emphatically stated: We should strive to integrate  ideological emancipation with down-to-earth work aimed at  opening up new vistas. To this end, we should persistently and  unswervingly carry out ideological emancipation and concentrate  our efforts on removing the following four ideological obstacles:    1. The remaining ultra-Left ideological influence that can  still be found in some areas, units, and comrades across the  province. Some areas, units, and comrades are still arguing  about the definition of socialism and capitalism;    2. The old concepts from which some comrades have yet to  ideologically free themselves. Some comrades still find  themselves more comfortable with the planned economic structure;    3. The lack of initiative, enthusiasm, morale, and a strong  sense of discipline on the part of some comrades. Some areas  and units are still plagued by slow growth and poor efficiency;    4. The habit among some comrades of giving empty talks and  refusing to do down-to-earth work. Some comrades have even  adopted an irresponsible attitude toward the party cause.    Secretary Liu Fangren noted: We should strive to integrate  ideological emancipation with down-to-earth work aimed at  opening up new vistas. To achieve this, we should redouble our  efforts to push ahead with ideological emancipation in the  following six areas:    1. To firmly bear in mind that "development is the last  word" and more expeditiously push ahead with overall economic  growth;    2. To further expand opening up to the outside world and try  to invite more foreign investment;    3. To make redoubled efforts to readjust the operational  mechanism and improve large and medium state-owned enterprises;    4. To strive to push forward growth in the non-state-owned  economic sector;    5. To bravely and creatively push forward pioneering work in  light of actual local conditions;    6. To further ideological emancipation in selecting,  promoting, and appointing more competent cadres and building  stronger leading bodies.    In conclusion, Secretary Liu Fangren stressed: In the months  ahead, we should devote more energy to the following three work  areas:    1. To closely combine the ongoing general theoretical  discussion with all sorts of current tasks, and gear the ongoing  general theoretical discussion to improving all sorts of tasks  and opening up new vistas;    2. To strive to speed up overall growth and mobilize all  comrades to correctly understand the current provincial  situation, brace up, strengthen confidence, clearly define a new  train of thought for the province's overall growth, and put  forward more proposals aimed at rejuvenating Guizhou and making  the Guizhou people more prosperous;    3. To strive to make flawless work arrangements aimed at  avoiding unbalanced, superficial, and false growth, and set and  follow strict work requirements.</p>

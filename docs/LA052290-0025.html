			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP PLAYOFF FINAL;  </P> <P> BRUINS SHADOW EDMONTON'S MESSIER, WHO IS AMONG THE MISSING  </P> <P> This was to have been his coronation, the spotlight he needed to be dubbed the  new Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> If Gretzky was the Great One in Edmonton, then surely Mark Messier was the Next  One.  </P> <P> In this, his 11th season with the Oilers, Messier had 45 goals in the regular  season and career highs in assists, 84, and total points, 129.  </P> <P> With two goals and two assists, he led his team to victory in the crucial  fourth game of the conference finals against the Chicago Blackhawks.  </P> <P> He is considered the favorite to win the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the  NHL's most valuable player.  </P> <P> But beyond the numbers and the accolades, Messier seemed to have finally  assumed the leadership role left vacant by Gretzky's departure to the Kings two  years ago.  </P> <P> If the Oilers were truly heading back to the top, Messier was the point man.  </P> <P> All that remained were the Stanley Cup finals.  </P> <P> Edmonton is right there, leading the Boston Bruins, 2-1, in the best-of-seven  series with Game 4 tonight at the Northlands Coliseum.  </P> <P> But where is Messier?  </P> <P> The question began as a murmur but has become a roar, seemingly asked by an  entire city.  </P> <P> What started as a curiosity has turned into a crisis.  </P> <P> Messier came into the finals with a 10-game point streak.  </P> <P> In Game 1, the triple-overtime victory over Boston, he had one assist but also  blew a chance to win the game by missing a wide-open shot in front of the net.  </P> <P> Although Edmonton scored seven goals in Game 2, Messier was held pointless. And  he was pointless again Sunday when the Oilers lost, 2-1.  </P> <P> Is he just in a slump, or is it more serious?  </P> <P> According to one rumor, Messier has a cracked rib.  </P> <P> Asked about that Monday, he said only, "I have no comment," then added "I feel  fine."  </P> <P> Boston Coach Mike Milbury seemed to lend credence to the rumor when talking  about his use of Bob Carpenter to shadow Messier.  </P> <P> "When (Messier) is not 100%, it's probably not fair to put somebody on him,"  Milbury said, grinning.  </P> <P> What makes you think he's not 100%? Milbury was asked.  </P> <P> "I just heard it," the coach answered enigmatically.  </P> <P> Whatever the problem, the Oilers know their chances of winning the Stanley Cup  may hinge on finding a solution.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I have to play better," Messier said. "No question about it.  </P> <P> "I'm just going to have to . . . find a way to break through the checking they  are giving me. That's to be expected this time of the year."  </P> <P> Most of what has occurred in this series, though, has been unexpected. The  Bruins were supposed to be a tight-checking, defensive-minded team, using the  smaller Boston Garden rink to their advantage, against the wide-open,  free-skating Oilers, who would excel on the larger Edmonton ice.  </P> <P> So what happened? The Oilers won both games in Boston, their offense breaking  open Game 2. And the Bruins won a defensive struggle in Game 3 in Edmonton.  </P> <P> Hard to figure. But no more so than Messier's disappearing act.  </P> <P> "I think I had more open ice in Boston," he said. "(Sunday) night, they played  more man-to-man. Their idea, I guess, is to deny me the puck."  </P> <P> He admitted that Carpenter's shadowing has thrown him.  </P> <P> "I never had a shadow before," Messier said. "I guess there were more important  people than me to shadow in the past."  </P> <P> But now, having stepped out of the Great One's shadow, Messier must find a way  to deal with a shadow of his own.  </P></p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Four banks withdraw from BT share sale AT least four European banks excluded from the global syndicate to market the UK government's remaining BT share stake have withdrawn their support as regional managers to the Pounds 5.5bn issue. The banks, which include Kleinwort Benson the UK merchant bank, Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez of France and Enskilda of Sweden, are understood to be unhappy at being prohibited from marketing to the 500 global institutions most likely to be interested in the issue. Under the rules set by the SG Warburg, adviser to BT and global co-ordinator for the sale of the 21.9 per cent stake, 11 global syndicate banks have been given exclusive access to these institutions. This structure moves away from previous practice. Advisers hope the new structure will increase competition among the co-ordinating banks - who will now compete with each other across national boundaries - and maximise the return to the UK treasury. While the 11 global syndicate banks will have exclusive access to these top institutions, they will also be allowed to market to smaller investors. Warburg has named as co-ordinating banks: Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Cazenove, Daiwa Securities, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, NatWest Securities, Paribas Capital Markets, NM Rothschild and UBS Limited. Warburg will be co-ordinating the global book-building exercise.</p>

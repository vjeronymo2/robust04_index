			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Recession hits Walt Disney WALT Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a 29 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, with lower operating income from all of its main businesses, writes Karen Zagor. Disney, which blamed the recession for its disappointing results, had net income of Dollars 126.6m, or 95 cents a share, against Dollars 178.5m, or Dollars 1.29, a year earlier. Revenues grew 11 per cent to Dollars 1.44bn from Dollars 1.3bn. Operating income in the 1991 quarter fell 26 per cent to Dollars 231.9m from Dollars 311.5m a year earlier. For the first half of fiscal 1991, Disney's net income fell 16 per cent to Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars 2.23 a share, from Dollars 352.9m, or Dollars 2.55, a year ago. Revenues advanced 13 per cent to Dollars 2.93bn from Dollars 2.59bn. Operating income in the first six months fell 13 per cent to Dollars 539.6m. Although analysts have steadily reduced second-quarter earnings estimates for Disney in recent months, the results were at the low end of expectations. During the quarter, operating income from theme parks and resorts plunged 33 per cent to Dollars 130.7m. The decline for the first six months was only 25 per cent to Dollars 269.4m. Operating income from Disney's filmed entertainment business dropped 20 per cent to Dollars 46.2m in the quarter in spite of a 31 per cent jump in revenues to Dollars 613m. The company attributed the decline in income to the poor performances of two of its films - 'Run' and 'Scenes from a Mall'. Operating income from consumer products fell 7 per cent to Dollars 55m on revenues which grew 24 per cent to Dollars 154.9m.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: The prime minister looks for friends in need - Political Notebook THE government has time on its side. Mr John Major does not. That thought should guide the prime minister's response to last week's electoral catastrophe. If it does not, his friends fear he will be in trouble. The contradiction is more apparent than real. The government has at least three, at a pinch nearly four, years before it must face the electorate. The catalogue of errors during the past 12 months has come conveniently early in the parliament. The economic cycle is on the government's side. It is that perception which has informed the stance of those in his cabinet  -let us call them the sanguine tendency - who have been urging Mr Major to sit tight. He can brush off the Newbury and county council election defeats as early-term blues, the argument runs. If he sticks to his agenda, economic recovery (and the mediocrity of the Labour opposition) will rescue him. But the view from No 10 is decidely different. Mr Major is operating on a shorter timescale. Before he can face the voters in another general election the prime minister must satisfy another electorate - the Conservative MPs at Westminster - that he has a fair chance of winning it. Mr Kenneth Clarke's brutally frank assessment that the Conservatives are in a 'dreadful hole' was not merely a reflection of his likeable honesty. It was an inadvertent admission of real shock at the depths of the electorate's disenchantment. His judgment is much closer to the prevailing mood on the backbenches than that of his colleagues in the sanguine tendency. In a party where panic has replaced unity as the most powerful reflex there is little inclination to trust in the healing balm of time. The lesson being drawn by his friends is that Mr Major has 12 months - until next year's European elections - to restore his authority. If his party's fortunes have not improved by then the prime minister will be under serious threat. The concern is reinforced by the corrosive influence of another Conservative tendency - the Militant opponents of the Maastricht treaty. Operating, like their leftwing antecedents on the Labour benches, as a party-within-a-party, the 25 to 30 irreconcilable opponents of all things European have now set as their objective the destruction of Mr Major. The new Militant has no credible candidate to replace him. But, egged on by those in the patrician tendency who swear allegiance still to Lady Thatcher, it will seize on any chance to precipitate a challenge to the prime minister. It is this sense of urgency that explains the concern of those around Mr Major that he should move quickly to replace Mr Norman Lamont. The prime minister's close political associates believe that Mr Lamont should be replaced as chancellor by September at the latest. Some would like Mr Major to make the change as soon as the Whitsun recess at the end of this month. They are briefing semi-openly against Mr Lamont not out of malice but in an attempt both to buttress Mr Major's resolve and to persuade the chancellor not to make a fuss. The prime minister's friends are under no illusion that a new face in No 11 will solve his problems. They are convinced that without one there is little prospect that he will be able to confront the government's most dangerous weakness: the perception, as prevalent among its supporters as among its enemies, that it is incompetent. Mr Major is said to be conscious of the need to restore coherence and, above all, consistency to the government's agenda. It cannot afford to pick fights  -as with the miners and teaching unions - it has no chance of winning. It must choose its ground more carefully. The government's critics are not alone in wondering why it seems hellbent on privatisation of British Rail, or why deregulation of London buses is such a priority. Some of his friends are reminding the prime minister that practical and pragmatic policies are not by definition an admission of weakness: witness the relative tranquillity in Scotland secured by a post-Thatcherite policy of rule by consent. Mr Major is being urged to devote less attention to the ideological leftovers of the 1980s and more to policies which emphasise the break with the past. A credible industrial strategy and high-class public services must be near the top of his list. The government cannot avoid harsh decisions in the summer public spending round. But an enthusiastic assault on the welfare state will not win the prime minister friends on the Tory backbenches or in the country. And Mr Major needs friends.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Barroux and Eric Chol: "Opening to </F> the East: Europe No Longer Has a Choice"]    [Text] Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians are knocking at the  door of the European Union [EU]. The Twelve in principle favor  expansion to the east, but the Union's difficulties are forcing  them to delay its implementation, even if this means  accumulating risks and resentments.    Politics? It is the object of Jirina Hinnerova's ridicule.  Like all Slovakian youth, she retains an exalted memory of the  events of the autumn of 1989. "We were all in the street  demanding that the government resign," she says. The Berlin Wall  was coming down, and the Iron Curtain was parting all the way  from Budapest and Bucharest to Prague and Warsaw. "We did not  know much about Europe and the West, but we thought everything  would go forward rapidly," the young Slovakian woman recalls  today. Five years later, Jirina has succumbed to skepticism.  "Nothing has really changed where the economy is concerned," she  says. "We will have to wait another two or three years to join  the European Union." That may be a self-gratifying illusion,  inasmuch as the member states--which following the Copenhagen  summit in June 1993 embraced the principle of a greater  Europe--expect that it will be at least another 10 years before  the countries of Central and East Europe join the EU. Although  Germany is seeking to accelerate the process, the consensus is  to proceed slowly. This cautiousness, however, could prove to be  disastrous, because the opening to the East is an urgent  necessity for the continent as a whole.    It goes without saying that the opening to the East is an  urgent necessity for the countries involved. Weakened by the  transition that is taking place in their respective economies,  they are also worried about the resurgence of Russian  imperialism and about the problems of ethnic minorities inside  their own borders, given that the end of the Cold War has  revealed many wounds that have not completely healed. They view  an accelerated rapprochement with the EU as a means to obtain  the guarantees they need. "Why add partners who are so different  from us, when we already have difficulty managing a 12-nation  Union?" the EU "realists" counter--but they are forgetting three  things. First of all, EU membership for the countries of the  East--from Lithuania to Romania--is the concept cited at the  very beginning of the preamble to the Treaty of Rome. Second,  Europe encouraged these countries to rid themselves of Soviet  tutelage and therefore can hardly play the role of a Pontius  Pilate today. "In 1989 we aroused a feeling of euphoria in these  countries," notes Pierre Lellouche, diplomatic adviser to  Jacques Chirac and a fervent advocate of the rapid integration  of the countries of East Europe. "We no longer have the time to  play legal games," he explains. Lastly, the EU's opening to the  East represents an insurance policy for Europe itself--provided  it is not delayed, because the opportunity that arose in 1989  with the collapse of the Berlin Wall could one day be lost,  inasmuch as Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, and Balts perceive the  Russian threat to be much greater than we do. Moreover, the  threat of an economic recession would inevitably exasperate the  problems of minorities and therefore provoke a demographic  afflux to the West that is in fact just over the horizon. "In  any event, we shall either integrate the East politically or  integrate it demographically," says Patrick Devedjian, RPR  [Rally for the Republic] deputy and mayor of Antony, who is one  of the most active parliamentary supporters of the concept of  Greater Europe.    The opening to the East is also a factor for stability, in  that it represents an economic opportunity for the Union--a  market of 70 million to 100 million consumers to satisfy; a  market for the rebuilding of factories; and a geographically  proximate area whose capacity for imports is growing more  rapidly than its ability to export. "In less than one  generation," Patrick Devedjian concludes, "the problems relating  to adaptation will be solved and these countries will become new  markets. We have the opportunity to open our doors to new  markets that we can win and that are culturally close to us. Let  us aid these markets."    There remains the question of how to aid them. The obstacles  encountered during the negotiations for expanding the Union to  include the Scandinavian countries and Austria--which are  prosperous and democratic nations--bear witness to the  resistance to be overcome. "Europe must be prepared to cease  being a club [preceding word in English] of rich people," Pierre  Lellouche warns. Quite frankly, a Europe consisting of 20 or  more countries will be unable to function on the model conceived  by the signatories of the Treaty of Rome. Not just the economic,  institutional, and political aspects but the entire complex of  Community mechanisms is in danger of flying into pieces, thereby  putting an end to a very French concept of European integration.  Conscious of the sacrifices to be made and the disputes to be  resolved, Europe is moving forward hesitantly. Are its fears  justified?    In the economic area, it is doubtful that these fears are  justified. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the countries of the  East would probably not be the only beneficiaries of a  free-trade zone. As exporters these countries are lightweights,  inasmuch as they account for less than 4 percent of Community  imports. For the immediate future, no tidal wave of exports from  the region is expected to occur, because the EU is already  taking between 50 and 75 percent of its exports, which--for a  broad range of products--still come into conflict with Western  quality standards.    Although the East's sales to the West jumped 56 percent  between 1988 and 1992, trade in the other direction registered  an even sharper rise of almost 90 percent. The EU--which in 1990  recorded a trade deficit of 957 million ecus with the  East--posted a surplus of more than 4 billion ecus for the first  three quarters of 1993. In the case of France, the trade balance  went from a deficit of 245 million ecus in 1989 to a surplus of  650 million in 1992. This imbalance, however, was nothing  extraordinary: deprived of Western products ever since 1945, the  consumers and manufacturers of the East are making up for lost  time. "The balance is so heavily in our favor that it is  becoming almost awkward," a European official acknowledges.    At Bercy [Finance Ministry], the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign  Ministry], and Brussels it is emphasized that the association  agreements have already brought progress. Signed between 1991  and 1993, they have made it possible to ease trade restrictions  with a view to creating a free-trade zone five to 10 years from  now. Unfortunately, these agreements do not cover certain  sectors that are vital for the countries of Central Europe but  that are "sensitive" sectors for the West--the agricultural  sector (which is totally excluded except for a few concessions)  and the textile, clothing, and steel sectors, for which  additional time is allowed for implementation--and fail to  include clauses that would provide safeguards and antidumping  restrictions. These sectors are indeed vital for the countries  of the East, inasmuch as they account for 40 percent of the  East's exports to the West. Indignant at being accused of  practicing a form of "disguised protectionism," the Commission  counters that Europe has made efforts that are unmatched by the  other developed countries. In private, however, the opening is  acknowledged in Brussels to have been a modest one. In  1991--when the association agreements were being prepared--the  commissioner then in charge of the dossier, Frans Andriessen,  tried unsuccessfully to obtain a more generous mandate.  <H5>  The Opening Would Require an Additional 45 Billion Ecus for </H5> the Structural Funds    This is a sensitive issue among the various national  constituencies, especially in France. First of all, the  countries of the East frighten European farmers. "Even though  they do not compete with us today, they are potential rivals in  markets that are saturated," explains former Agriculture  Minister Francois Guillaume. However, was not the end of French  agriculture predicted when the negotiations for Spain's  admission to the Community were taking place, whereas Spain has  actually become a market for--and net importer of--agricultural  products?    Employment has become another cause for concern, because of  the relocations to the East that are feared by Senator Jean  Arthuis. It has not been proved conclusively, however, that the  balance in respect to employment is unfavorable for the West. A  study made by the economist Claude Vimont concludes that trade  relations with the countries of East Europe translate into a  positive balance in terms of jobs. While acknowledging the  effort at adaptation that is necessary, UDF [French Democratic  Union] Deputy Willy Dimeglio argued in a recent report that  these relocations will not lead to a loss of jobs in France,  because the companies that are currently involved in relocation  are maintaining and developing activities in France which have a  high added value.    The financial and institutional questions are considerably  more sensitive. If the EU opens up to the countries of the East,  it will have to revise its operations and its policies from top  to bottom. The structural funds--which are dedicated to the  development of disadvantaged regions--would require a trifling  45 billion additional ecus per year. That would break the  European budget, which has already reached 73.5 billion ecus in  1994. All in all, the European Commission believes that the  budget for the structural funds and for the Common Agricultural  Policy would have to be doubled if the countries of the East  were to be allowed the same criteria for aid as those granted to  the countries of southern Europe. Are the member states prepared  to make such a financial outlay? Although the Germans are the  ones most agreeable to the opening, they complain that they are  putting too much into Europe's common pot at a time when the  rebuilding of their new laender has not yet been completed. The  solution--which would entail the exclusion of the newest members  from the aid provisions--is politically unfeasible. The  expansion accordingly involves a proportional reduction in the  amounts of the structural fund packages, in order to make room  for the newcomers without overloading the boat. Spain, Portugal,  and Greece--which are major beneficiaries of the Community's  ecus--remain to be convinced.    The threat of a paralysis of the European institutions may  be  even more difficult to avert. "Already, with 16 member states,  just going around the table will take at least 3 hours," an  adviser to Edouard Balladur emphasizes. In order to work with 20  states, the Europeans will be unable to limit themselves to  remedies that are merely cosmetic. The entire complex of  decision-making mechanisms will have to be revised, but the  expansion now under way has already given rise to disputes over  the respective powers of the large and the small countries.  Strengthening the authority of the European Commission would  inevitably complicate the problem.    Aware of the difficulties, the Twelve would rather push back  the deadlines. To be sure, initiatives designed to prepare for  the rapprochement are being presented. The Commission has given  the former Socialist minister of agriculture, Henri Nallet, the  task of preparing a report on the Common Agricultural Policy  vis-a-vis the countries of the East. The Phare aid program  should undergo a lifting [preceding word in English] and be  endowed with a mechanism for investment and training. It is also  a matter of associating--in the near future--the countries of  the East with certain common policies on energy, communications,  transportation, and the environment. The real difficulties,  however, will not be attacked until 1996, the date of the  intergovernmental conference that is on the Maastricht calendar.  Preoccupied with the applications of the Scandinavian countries  and Austria, the Twelve are--for the present--satisfied to take  temporary expedients.    The final difficulty is the security problem. Desirous of  joining NATO, the countries of East Europe have had to be  patient and accept the concept of Partnership for Peace, for  want of anything better. Disappointed, these countries are  turning toward Europe in the hope of obtaining a place within  the Western European Union (WEU), the future military wing of  West Europe. "No responsible government is ready to accept their  total admission to the WEU," is the off-the-record comment at  the Quai d'Orsay. Explanation: the WEU provides for automatic  intervention in the event of aggression against one of its  members. Are the French or the Italians ready to die for Riga?  By way of a response, the Twelve are suggesting to the countries  of the East that they accept the status of WEU "associates." It  is a symbolic decision that imposes no obligation. Still another  European initiative is the conference on stability that will be  held in Paris from 26 to 27 May. It will bring together the  foreign ministers from East Europe and the Baltic states, with  the intention of promoting good-neighborly relations among them.  According to one of Edouard Balladur's advisers, the conference  should be the occasion for a strong political signal, provided  it is followed by negotiations. In the final analysis, however,  West Europe's responses with respect to security do not meet the  East's expectations.    "We will of course participate in all the initiatives that  the Union sends our way," a Polish diplomat comments, "but what  we want are guarantees." In other words, what they want are the  rules of the game, and a timetable.    West Europe coolly calculates that the negotiations for WEU  membership cannot begin before the end of the century. "We  backed into the East European case," says Jean Pisani-Ferry,  director of the Center for International Public Opinion and  Information Research (CEPII). "There is a lack of imagination  and a lack of political will," adds the East Europe expert  Jacques Rupnik, who is disturbed at the wave of disillusion  currently sweeping over these countries.    The proposal that the Community has made to the countries of  East Europe to the effect that they strengthen their mutual ties  within a framework of regional cooperation cannot satisfy them;  they are afraid not only of forming a new CEMA [Council for  Mutual Economic Assistance] but also of creating a purgatory  that would indefinitely delay their entry into the EU. Given  these commercial, financial, and political constraints, could  Europe move any more rapidly? No, its leaders reply, for they  seem to believe they have all the time in the world to take  action. By burying their heads in the sand, however, the Twelve  risk being overtaken by history and forced to make agonizing  reappraisals without having had time to prepare for them.  <H5>  [Box, p 65] </H5> <H5>  Reciprocal Trade in Textiles </H5>   East Europe's share of the West European clothing market  rose  to 13.3 percent in 1992 from 8.8 percent in 1989. France's trade  balance with the East in the clothing sector continues to show a  large deficit (of more than 1.5 billion francs [Fr] in 1992),  but this deficit is partially compensated by our favorable trade  balance of more than Fr500 million in the sector of textile  products that are used in the manufacture of clothing.    This phenomenon is the same in all of the countries of West  Europe, because in order to profit from the reduced customs  duties the East European manufacturers must in practice use EU  textiles.    Georges Jolles, president of the Union of Textile  Industries,  is also not overly worried. "In our view," he says, "it is a  less serious threat than that posed by the Asian countries. We  will suffer if these [East European] countries do not genuinely  open their markets, but if they do, the relocations will be a  positive factor and will enable us to sell more products that  have a high added value."  <H5>  [Box, p 66] </H5> <H5>  Brussels Redoubles Its Vigilance With Respect to Steel </H5>   The customs barriers against the steel products of the East  European countries will come down in 1996. The entry of these  new suppliers into a market that is increasingly open disturbs  those Community steel producers who are fully involved in  restructuring. Trade in steel has benefited the East European  countries, inasmuch as their trade surplus rose from 382 million  ecus in 1988 to 817 million in 1992.    The competitive prices of these countries are frightening.  "How can they justify steel prices that are 30 percent below  those of the market?" asks Francis Mer, the PDG [CEO] of  Usinor-Sacilor. Mer says the real costs of production  (transportation, energy, and raw materials) are not factored  into the price of their steel.    Brussels has not remained insensitive to the calls for help  from its steelmakers, and penalties were assessed in 1992  against steel from Czechoslovakia. For even though customs  duties are being lowered, the Community has recourse to clauses  that provide safeguards--and antidumping clauses--with which to  defend itself. Above all, however, it is the volumes of trade  involved that should reassure the steel producers, for only 4  percent of all steel imported by the Twelve comes from the East  European countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Angola is still characterized by an atmosphere of  war. At dawn today, government forces neutralized attempts by  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA]  rebels to attack the city of Malanje. Unable to achieve their  objective, Jonas Savimbi's men dynamited three abandoned houses,  while fleeing in disarray.</p>

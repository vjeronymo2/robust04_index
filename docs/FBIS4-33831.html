			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Clandestine Indian </F> Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army on 10 June; "from the mountains of the  southeast, Chiapas, Mexico"]    [Text]Everything for everyone. Nothing for us. The  San Cristobal talks. Period, paragraph.    To the people of Mexico; to the peoples and governments of  the world; to the nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]; to the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas; to the  national commissioner for mediation; to the local and  international media:    The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General  Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation  Army] hereby addresses itself to you to report and state the  following:    1. As reported in due time, the EZLN's CCRI-CG has completed  a consultation in all of the villages that comprise and support  it, the committee. Through the assemblies of communities and  regions, we have learned about the feelings in our people's  hearts.    2. The EZLN's CCRI-CG has counted the votes on the Federal  Government's peace proposals presented during the talks in San  Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas.    3. Here are the results of the free democratic voting: 2.11  percent voted for signing the government peace proposal; 97.88  percent voted against signing the government proposal.    4. In terms of the proposals on what to do if it was decided  not to sign the government's proposals, this is the result: for  resuming hostilities, 3.26 percent; for resisting and calling  for a new national dialogue with all honest and independent  forces, 96.74 percent.    5. Consequently, and by an agreement of the Zapatist  majority, the EZLN's CCRI-CG hereby announces: The federal  government's proposal for a peace agreement is hereby rejected.  The San Cristobal dialogue is declared terminated.    The people of Mexico are hereby called to a national  dialogue  with the country's progressive forces. The central subjects of  this dialogue will be democracy, freedom, and justice for all  Mexicans.    In order not to back down in the search for a political  solution to the conflict, and in order not to interfere with the  upcoming August's electoral process, the EZLN's CCRI-CG has  ordered all regular and irregular forces throughout national  territory and abroad to extend the cease-fire, refrain from  attacking the Armed Forces, and permit the upcoming elections.    The EZLN guarantees that no offensive actions will be  conducted against the Federal Army if the EZLN is not attacked.    The EZLN will not hinder the upcoming elections in the  territories under its control and will permit the installation  of electoral sites under the surveillance of the NGO's and the  International Red Cross Committee.    The EZLN will accept absolutely no assistance from the  federal, state, or municipal governments and will resist the  siege solely with its own means and the Mexican people's help.    6. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, for his  true efforts in the search for a political solution to the  conflict. Unfortunately, the government's historical blindness  keeps it from understanding that its refusal to yield to the  impetus of democratization will lead the country into a painful  confrontation whose consequences are unpredictable.    7. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia,  national commissioner for mediation, and his team for their  efforts and sacrifice in mediating between the conflicting  sides. We thank the team for their strength in resisting  pressure and threats, as well as their willingness to listen.  We hope that in the new stage of dialogue we are hereby calling  for the team can join with its honest participation in the  search for a political solution for the national demand for  democracy, freedom, and justice.    8. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks the honest and independent  media  for their efforts in learning the truth and disseminating it to  the Mexican people regardless of threats, pressure, or  blackmail. We hereby apologize if, through our unschooled media  policy, we angered them or mistrusted them. We expect them to  understand that we had never before fought a revolution, and  that we are undergoing a learning process. We hereby reiterate  that, thanks to the press, the military stage of the war was  stopped. We sincerely hope they will understand our difficult  situation and the unfair selection and the elimination of those  media that had access to us. We hope they continue along the  path of truth.    9. The EZLN's CCRI-CG particularly thanks the NGO's, the  vanguard of civilian society. The NGO's play an objective role  in attaining the peace with justice and freedom that our people  desire. The government's stubbornness has prevented any  agreement so far. We remain open to dialogue and are willing to  walk on the road that you marked for us: the political path that  leads to democracy.    10. The EZLN's CCRI-CG greets all men, women, children,  elderly people, and the faceless people throughout the country  and abroad, who have expressed their solidarity and support for  our cause. Our struggle is for you, our brothers. Our death is  for you, also. We will not rest until all Mexicans, Indians,  peasants, workers, employees, students, housewives, neighbors,  honest artists and intellectuals, the retired people, the  unemployed, the outcasts, and all of the voiceless and faceless  men and women can have everything necessary for a worthy and  true life. Everything for everyone. Nothing for us.    As long as the national flag does not fly over Mexican  territory in democracy, freedom, and justice, we, the tender  fury, wlll continue to fight. Democracy! Freedom! Justice!    [Signed] Respectfully, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN    [Issued] From the mountains of the southeast, Chiapas,  Mexico, June 1994</p>

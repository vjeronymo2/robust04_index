			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Caesars World Inc.: The casino hotel company said first-quarter earnings fell  23% to $17.5 million. Revenue totaled $225.7 million, down 2% from the same  period a year ago. The Los Angeles-based company said gambling volume increased  in all three of its hotel casinos. But those gains were more than offset by  lower overall win percentages, disruptions from expansion programs in Las  Vegas, higher marketing and payroll costs and a rise in bad debt provisions.  </P></p>

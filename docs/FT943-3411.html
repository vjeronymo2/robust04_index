			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / British Steel raises Avesta stake British Steel yesterday announced its biggest investment since before the recession by paying Pounds 85m to raise its stake in Avesta Sheffield, the big Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, from 40 to 49.9 per cent. The purchase follows the sale by NCC, the big Swedish construction company, of its 22.5 per cent stake in Avesta Sheffield, announced in Stockholm earlier in the day. Barclays de Zoete Wedd paid about SKr2.2bn (Pounds 188m) for NCC's 35.66m shares. It sold 15.64m on to British Steel and organised a worldwide placing of the remainder. The cash deal, financed by British Steel's resources, underlines its bolder approach to investment since the end of the recession, during which it restricted itself to small projects or those with short payback times. A decision is also pending on a Dollars 150m (Pounds 97m) investment by the UK company in Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary, to create a steel plate mini-mill. Observers believe the scheme will almost certainly go ahead. Avesta Sheffield was formed in November 1992 through the merger of Sweden's Avesta with British Steel's stainless steel activities. Until the termination of a shareholders' agreement last month, British Steel would have been obliged to make a general offer for the remaining Avesta Sheffield shares if its stake had risen above 45 per cent. British Steel said it welcomed the opportunity to increase its shareholding. Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said the merger had gone 'extremely well.' But the UK company stressed it had no intention of making an offer for the rest of Avesta Sheffield, which last month reported first half profits of SKr431m after financial items, compared with a SKr21m loss a year earlier. The sale of NCC's stake significantly tips the balance of ownership in Avesta Sheffield away from Sweden. BZW, assisted by Cazenove and Svenska Handelsbanken, placed the shares not bought by British Steel with institutions mainly in the UK, Scandinavia and Europe. Foreign interests now hold over half the company, with the biggest single Swedish shareholder, the gas group Aga, holds just 7.2 per cent. Mr Per Molin, the Swedish chief executive of Avesta Sheffield, said he did not anticipate any change in the company's present set-up as it is registered and headquartered in Sweden. British Steel and the other investors paid SKr64 for each share, a small discount on Monday's SKr66 closing price. The UK company's own share price fell 3 1/2p to 148 1/2p yesterday. NCC said it was selling its stake as part of a strategy to concentrate on its core operations in building, building materials and property. NCC has been struggling against a collapse in the Swedish construction market which began in 1991, the SKr1.2bn capital gain from the sale will lift its balance sheet.</p>

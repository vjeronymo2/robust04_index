			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Accord on HK airport 'soon' An agreement on funding Hong Kong's new airport seems within reach. Mr Guo Fengmin, China's representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group overseeing the 1997 handover of the territory, said yesterday he hoped consensus could be reached by early November, when he retires. Negotiators came near clinching the package in June, but fell at the last hurdle. This time, an agreed minute, detailing that the airport and connected railway project be funded by HKDollars 60.3bn (Pounds 5.06bn) of equity and HKDollars 23bn of debt, is expected to be signed before Mr Guo leaves Hong Kong. Signing of the Financial Support Agreements (FSAs), contracts proving to bankers the project is viable, is expected to follow.</p>

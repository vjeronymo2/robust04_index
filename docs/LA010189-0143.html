			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: 1988: IT WAS VINTAGE YEAR FOR LOSERS  </P> <P> Hello 1989, I thought you'd never get here.  </P> <P> 1988? I thought you'd never leave.  </P> <P> In a way, it was the Year of the Loser. In order, they were:  </P> <P> 1. Ben Johnson -- Oh, rare, Ben Johnson. How can anyone lose more devastatingly  than at the very hour of achieving his life's ambition? When it all falls to  ashes just after all one's dreams are realized, when the world is at his feet,  when what you have worked for, strived for, dreamed of all your life has just  come true -- and someone comes in and tells you it's all been a mistake. Ben  had just won the Olympic gold medal, set the world record and identified  himself as the greatest sprinter of all time when suddenly a man in a white lab  coat turns it to nightmare. When they stripped Jim Thorpe of his medals, he  became an object of pity. Ben Johnson became an object of scorn. He lost more  than a medal. He lost respect. Ben makes loser-of-the-year unanimously.  </P> <P> 2. Dave Stieb -- Would you classify as a loser a pitcher who lost a no-hitter  with two-out in the bottom on the ninth to a bad-hop single through the  infield? OK, how about a pitcher who lost two no-hitters in a row that way?  That, my friends, is major-league losing. Just a twist here and you're looking  at the second guy in major-league history to pitch back-to-back no- hitters.  You are looking at Johnny Vander Meer II. You are looking at a guy who will  become the answer to a trivia question through 2000 A.D. Alas! The ball hopped.  </P> <P> 3. Pat Dye -- How do you become a loser-of-the-year when you have the ball on  your opponents' 13-yard line, 3 points behind, with 4 seconds left to play?  Right! You kick a field goal. A losers' play. You go for the tie. You strike  your colors, fold your hand, cry uncle. It's what Auburn coach Pat Dye did in  last year's Sugar Bowl against Syracuse. Whatever happened to "Winning isn't  everything, it's the only thing?" Whatever became of Fight, fight, fight?  Stonewall Jackson would never understand. Neither would George Gipp. Woody  Hayes would hit somebody.  </P> <P> 4. Davey Johnson -- How would you like to be in Game 7 of the playoff series  for the National League pennant and have a pitcher on your staff who is known  as "Dr.K," who has struck out more than 1,000 batters, won 18 games in the  season and is only 23 years old. He is on the bench with 3 days rest. The  opposition is starting its best pitcher who has had only 3 days rest and has  already pitched 3 times in the series. Nevertheless, Manager Davey Johnson  doesn't start Dwight Gooden in the most important game of the season. The Mets  manager starts Ron Darling with predictable results. He doesn't save Gooden  anyway. Dwight gets in the game with the score 6-0 and the pennant gone. In the  other dugout, Manager Tom Lasorda plays the ace -- Orel Hershiser. Davey  Johnson makes loser-of-the-year by acclamation, the pinup boy for every  second-guesser east of the Tehachapis.  </P> <P> 5. Dennis Eckersley -- How would you like to be the best relief pitcher in the  American League with a league-leading 45 saves, an ERA of 2.35, a record of  having only walked 11 batsmen all year and a record of having finished 53 of  the 60 games you appeared -- and in the ninth inning of the first World Series  game, you are breezing along with a 4-3 lead and have just retired the first  two batters to face you, one by strikeout, the other by weak grounder. You need  an out to, maybe, just clinch the whole World Series when up comes this batter  who has hit just .196 all year with no great reputation for power (he has hit 2  home runs and has 17 runs-batted-in). He strikes out a lot (once every 4 1/2  times at-bat).  </P> <P> This is not Babe Ruth but you, you, unaccountably, begin to pitch to him as if  he were. The next thing you know, you have just walked Mike Davis and put the  tying run on first base. But, never mind. Get a load of the guy who's coming up  to pinch-hit. He looks like a guy leaving a train wreck. He can hardly walk. He  winces just lifting the bat. He's only going to tap the ball into play some  place and hope for a big break. This is the only at-bat he'll get in the whole  Series and he doesn't look as if he can handle even this. You get two quick  strikes on this refugee from the disabled list and this looks like a mismatch.  The chances are good he couldn't get around on a medium-good fastball if you  sent it up there with stamps on it. So, for some reasons best known to the  gremlins of baseball, you decide to try what you call a "backdoor slider" on  him. Now, the slider is the pitch the late Fresco Thompson used to say was  going to put * lot of .270 hitters in the Hall of Fame. It was, he said, the  pitch that let Maris break Babe Ruth's home-run record.  </P> <P> It has been variously described as the "nickel curve," the "downtown pitch,"  and, when it doesn't work, as "the slop slider." This one you let go of is all  three. At the bat, Kirk Gibson can't believe his good luck. His eyes get big,  his groin doesn't hurt any more. He dreams of pitches like this. As Joe  Garagiola would say, "you couldn't order a better one from room service."  Gibson swings. Not hard, just about like a guy lofting a 9-iron to a trapped  green. It is out of the lot the minute it leaves the bat. It is one of the  historic home runs of baseball history. It wins, to all intents and purposes,  the World Series. It is a pitch Dennis Eckersley probably wanted to run after  and retrieve the minute he let go of it. To call time. Pray for an earthquake.  Anything to get that ball back in his glove before it goes into the right-field  seats.  </P> <P> That pitch is one of the great losers of 1988. It is a game-loser and a  Series-loser. They don't get any worse than that.  </P> <P> John McEnroe-Who?  </P></p>

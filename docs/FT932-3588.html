			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Egyptian extremist hanged A Moslem extremist convicted of terrorist attacks and trying to overthrow the Egyptian government was hanged yesterday, the first execution among 22 militants sentenced to death by military courts, AP reports from Cairo. An Egyptian convicted of spying for Israel was also hanged, said a military official who declined to be further identified. Last year, President Hosni Mubarak started referring Moslem extremists to military courts to ensure speedy trials. The government has been involved in a violent confrontation with the radicals who want to turn Egypt into an Iranian-type theocracy. Over 150 people have been killed since 1992.</p>

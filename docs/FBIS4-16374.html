			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikolay Geronin and Anatoliy </F> Krasnov]    [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Talks between Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his South Korean counterpart  Han Sung-chu began in Moscow today.    The first item of the agenda is the preparation of a visit  of  President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam to Russia, which  is scheduled for early June, Kozyrev said before the beginning  of the talks. Speaking about the nuclear problem at the Korean  Peninsula, Kozyrev pointed out that "unfortunately, bilateral  efforts did not bring the desired results, and, I think, we  should expand the range of consultations and consider some other  approaches in order to get the problem out of a deadlock by  joint efforts."    Han Sung-chu said in his turn that it was the fifth meeting  of the Russian and South Korean foreign ministers, which is an  indication of good relations between the two countries.    Han Sung-chu will tell Kozyrev about Kim Yong-sam's meetings  with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and China's  leader Jiang Zemin during his recent visits to those countries,  Kim Sok-kyu, South Korea's ambassador to Russia, told ITAR-TASS.  The Republic of Korea would like to establish close contacts  with Russia on the nuclear problem of North Korea, the South  Korean ambassador said.    According to Kim Sok-kyu, the ministers will discuss  Moscow's  proposals on holding an international conference on ensuring the  security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula.  The South Korean Government is highly appreciating the proposal  and regarding it as a friendly step of Russia, aimed at settling  problems of the Korean Peninsula. How, he continued, the issue  is being examined by the U.N. Security Council, and it is  worthwhile to wait and see how those problems will be settled  within the U.N. framework.</p>

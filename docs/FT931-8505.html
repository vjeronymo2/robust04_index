			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Tax rises likely as jobless total rises above 3m THE PROSPECT of tax increases in next month's Budget appeared to harden yesterday after an hour-long cabinet discussion of the economic outlook was accompanied by news that headline unemployment last month pushed above 3m for the first time in six years. With little hope in Whitehall of any falls in unemployment until the mid-1990s, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, left ministerial colleagues in no doubt that tax increases to cut the government's deficit were a real possibility in the March 16 Budget. The suggestion that the government should 'bite the bullet' on raising taxes sooner rather than later also appeared to be winning support among Tory MPs. The extension of value added tax to domestic fuel and heating as part of a number of 'green' taxes is considered a front-runner. Hopes of economic recovery received only a modest boost from news that seasonally adjusted bank and building society lending increased by an unexpectedly strong Pounds 4.1bn in January after falling by Pounds 74m in December. The Bank of England and the British Bankers' Association suggested that January's lending figure could have been inflated by companies borrowing to pay corporation tax bills. The headline figure of people unemployed and claiming benefit in January rose to 3.06m, while on a seasonally adjusted basis the figure was lower at 2.99m. The seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment between December and January was a lower-than-expected 22,100, the smallest monthly increase since June. But Downing Street officials acknowledged there was little prospect that the figure would turn down for two or three years. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, indicated that a new package of measures to take tens of thousands off the unemployment register would be ready by Budget day. The jobless figures brought fierce clashes in a rowdy House of Commons. With Mr John Major appearing distinctly unsettled at the despatch box, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, accused the prime minister of creating a 'social tragedy' and 'economic madness'. He was joined by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who accused Mr Major of having 'nothing to say' about unemployment. A welcome development for the government was that average earnings across the economy rose in the 12 months to December by 4.75 per cent, the smallest annual rise for 25 years. The depressed level of wage rises may help the Treasury attain its target of keeping underlying inflation at 4 per cent or less. Since the low point for seasonally-adjusted unemployment in April 1990, the number of people without jobs and claiming benefit has risen by 1.4m from 1.6m.

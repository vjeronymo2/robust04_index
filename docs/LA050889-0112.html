Final  </P> <P> BORDEN PULLS MILK FROM STORES IN 2 STATES, CITES FEED  </P> <P> Borden Inc., the world's largest dairy company, said it pulled its products  from the shelves in two Southern states today after finding milk with traces of  a toxic substance from contaminated feed.  </P> <P> Borden spokeswoman Chris Tilton said it was not known if any of the  contaminated products had been purchased, adding, "There should be no ill  effects if the products have already been consumed."  </P> <P> Borden pulled ice cream, milk, and other liquid dairy products from stores  throughout Mississippi and in the northern two-thirds of Louisiana, she said.  </P> <P> Cattle feed contaminated with barium carbonate apparently was used at 32  dairies in the two-state area; the dairies' products were distributed in those  two regions, she said.  </P></p>

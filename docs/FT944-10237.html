			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sotheby's back in the black after nine months Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of Sotheby's, the New York-based auction, finance and real estate operation, returned to the black at the nine-month stage, reflecting a broad-based improvement across the art market. For the nine months to the end of September, income was Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.52m) against a loss of Dollars 1.3m. Net income per share was 4 cents (losses of 2 cents). Auction sales grew from Dollars 719.9m to Dollars 797.2m in the nine months, and from Dollars 84.7m to Dollars 105.2m in the third quarter, traditionally a slow period in the art market. The improvement followed the UK Old Master Paintings auction in July and several single-owner sales, including the country house sale of Crossrigg Hall. The group reduced its third quarter loss from Dollars 12.7m (23 cents per share) to Dollars 11.5m (21 cents per share). Ms Diana Brooks, president and chief executive, said combined sales in all collecting categories except Impressionist and Modern Art and Jewellery were up 22 per cent. Sales of Impressionist and Modern Art and Jewellery were ahead of the 1992 low, but still below last year's levels. 'We anticipate, therefore, that the decline in the performance of these two categories, coupled with several strong non-recurring sales held in 1993, will result in lower fourth quarter auction sales,' she said.</p>

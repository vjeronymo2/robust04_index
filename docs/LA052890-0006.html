			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> SEIZED FISHING BOAT WILL BE SEARCHED  </P> <P> Crews worked to unload fuel tanks on a 90-foot fishing boat seized in a drug  raid off the coast in the Bay Area so the boat could be searched for hidden  compartments, the Coast Guard said. No contraband was immediately found on the  boat, which was seized off Half Moon Bay and towed to San Francisco after San  Mateo County sheriff's deputies spotted a suspected drug-smuggling operation  along the coast, the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> Twelve men -- seven on shore and five aboard the vessel -- were arrested, and  federal and state officials combed a 20-mile stretch of coastline for drugs  they suspect were dumped from the trawler. Five pounds of marijuana was seized  on shore near Pescadero, about 30 miles south of San Francisco, deputies said.  The arrests and seizure came after deputies spotted several people on  California 1 throwing something from a bridge, authorities said.  </P></p>

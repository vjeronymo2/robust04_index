			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: European volumes continue to slip European volumes continued to slip back as the summer began to take hold last month. According to Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, who compiled the data, turnover in Europe declined by 8.6 per cent in May compared to April, having already fallen by 12 per cent in April from March. 'Once again, it was the fall in US Treasury bond prices that was the main bearish influence on European markets, which failed to benefit from an unexpected cut in German official rates on May 11,' he says. International investors also lifted their sales, with turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London, as a proportion of business in Continental domestic markets, rising to 16.3 per cent in May from 15.8 per cent in April. France saw the biggest rise in May's activity - in spite of a 6 per cent fall in the index, turnover was up nearly 21 per cent; but, reports Mr Cornish, it was still down 13.6 per cent on the average of the previous three months, 'suggesting a resumption of selling pressure under the threat of rights issues and the UAP privatisation'. Italian volumes declined by 6.4 per cent in May after April's record high, with the market itself dropping 8.5 per cent as profits were taken following the victory of Mr Berlusconi in the general election.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                   EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER             Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse             Feb       Mar       Apr       May       US                   1994      1994      1994      1994   Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium          95.76     83.75     69.93     73.08       2.16 France          244.62    218.68    145.17    175.15      31.16 Germany         176.59    214.73    188.00    151.07      91.89 Italy           79,109    80,380   105,964    99,228      62.34 Netherlands      32.00     33.10     25.20     21.80      11.82 Spain         1,400.80  1,491.24  1,160.49  1,340.00       9.89 Switzerland      33.90     32.02     23.93     26.12      18.63 UK               59.80     61.14     48.57     44.27      66.99  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

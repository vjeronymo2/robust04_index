			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Measures which obscured the extent of joblessness NOVEMBER 1981: New rate of supplementary benefit introduced for men over 60 who had been on supplementary benefit for more than a year. No longer required to sign on as available for work in order to receive the benefit. Estimated to have removed 37,000 men from the claimant count over the ensuing year. October 1982: Registration at Jobcentres becomes voluntary. Count at Jobcentres no longer provided a meaningful measure of unemployment so basis of unemployment statistics switched to count of claimants at unemployment benefit offices. This cut the count by 190,000 as a result of more up-to-date record-keeping (-78,000), the exclusion of registrants not claiming benefit (-135,000), and inclusion of the severely disabled (+23,000). Budget 1983: About 162,000 men, mainly over 60, allowed to receive national insurance credits or the higher long-term rate of supplementary benefit without needing to attend an unemployment benefit office. September 1988: The Social Security Act changed the benefit entitlements of under-18s, removing an estimated 90,000 from the headline total. July 1989: Redundant Mineworkers Payment Scheme changed so that people covered by the scheme no longer need to sign on as unemployed and available for work in order to receive scheme benefits - 15,500 estimated to have left the count as a result. October 1989: Social Security Act makes receipt of benefit conditional on claimants proving they are actively seeking work. It also provided that after a permitted period the level of remuneration will not be good cause for claimants turning down or failing to take advantage of an employment opportunity. Unemployment Unit calculates this led to a fall of 50,000 on the monthly count. December 1989: Changes in the way earnings affect unemployment benefit. Part-time or casual workers earning enough to pay national insurance contributions in any week denied unemployment benefit for the week. Unemployment Unit estimates this led to fall of 30,000 in count. Source: Department of Employment and Unemployment Unit</p>

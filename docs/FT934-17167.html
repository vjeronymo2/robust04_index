			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / PIA sets capital base requirement THE BOARD of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services, has adopted a controversial rule on capital adequacy that is opposed by many independent financial advisers. All advisers who join the PIA will be required to maintain a minimum capital base of Pounds 10,000. Advisers will be able to certify themselves and include personal assets. The rule will apply to members transferring from Fimbra, the existing self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, as well as to new entrants to the industry. The board is considering higher capital requirements for larger organisations. Minimum capital requirements were laid out by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, as a prerequisite for the authority's establishment. The authority's staff recommended approval of the measure, but the board has been reluctant. Last week Sir Gordon Downey, PIA chairman, resigned abruptly and was replaced by Mr Joe Palmer, formerly an SIB board member.</p>

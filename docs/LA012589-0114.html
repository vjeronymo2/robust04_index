			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: KANSAS CITY NAMES SCHOTTENHEIMER AS COACH  </P> <P> Marty Schottenheimer, who had resigned as coach of the Cleveland Browns at the  end of the season in a dispute with owner Art Modell, was named coach of the  Kansas City Chiefs Tuesday.  </P> <P> Schottenheimer, 45, took the Browns to the playoffs in each of his 4 full  seasons as coach. His 32-15 regular-season record the last 3 years is unmatched  in the AFC and ranks behind only Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears and Bill Walsh  of the San Francisco 49ers among National Football League coaches.  </P> <P> His resignation from the Browns was triggered by his refusal to hire an  offensive coordinator, a role he was filling.  </P> <P> Asked if he would hire an offensive coordinator with the Chiefs, Schottenheimer  broke into a grin.  </P> <P> "We will have an individual to fill that role," he said. "Rest easy. Marty  Schottenheimer is not going to call the plays. Someone will have that role, if  not the title."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> NACK RAISES $10,698  </P> <P> According to semiannual campaign reports filed at the end of last month, only  Pasadena City Director Kathryn Nack reported any substantial campaign  activities during the last half of 1989.  </P> <P> The 6th District director held a mid-September fund-raiser and collected  $10,698 in cash contributions.  </P> <P> Of that, $4,503 was spent to mail newsletters bearing her picture to all  households in her district. Nack said newsletter restrictions under state  Proposition 73 made the fund-raiser necessary. According to her campaign  report, she has $6,349 on hand that she said she will use for future mailers.  </P> <P> Other directors reported no fund raising and merely carried over existing  campaign funds. Amounts reported by the other city directors were $87 for Rick  Cole, $1,208 for Chris Holden, $3,501 for Jess Hughston, $288 for William  Paparian and $3,700 for Mayor William Thomson. John Crowley filed no campaign  papers because he said he had no contributions, expenditures or campaign funds.  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Tudjman hails bridge reopening as victory CROATIAN President Franjo Tudjman yesterday formally re-opened the strategic Maslenica bridge, which joins northern Croatia with its southern Dalmatian coast, after a delay earlier in the day when Serb forces shelled the area. Frustrated with Serbian opposition to the opening of the bridge and in spite of warnings from United Nations officials that it could re-ignite the Serbo-Croat conflict, Croatia went ahead and installed the temporary pontoon structure. Mr Tudjman called the opening a 'great victory for Croatian politics' and a 'big step' for Croatia in re-establishing control over its territory. Speaking in front of the ruins of the old bridge, destroyed in the 1991 war, Mr Tudjman called on the Serbs of Knin, the centre of the self-styled Serb state of Krajina which cuts Croatia in half, to 'get rid of their extremists' and work with Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the reopening of electricity, traffic, and transport lines. The new bridge could help bolster Mr Tudjman's sagging popularity, especially in Dalmatia. The inhabitants of Adriatic cities are hostage to Serb rebels within artillery range from the hinterland and are forced to lived with daily power cuts.</p>

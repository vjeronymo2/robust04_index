			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CANADIENS SLOW CAPITALS' RUN  </P> <P> The Montreal Canadiens have faltered on the road this season and find  themselves in third place in the Adams Division.  </P> <P> But there are nights when the Canadiens' chief offensive threat, Stephane  Richer, makes himself at home anywhere.  </P> <P> Such was the case Friday night at Landover, Md. Richer scored two goals to lead  the Canadiens to a 4-2 victory over the Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> The Capitals, trying to clinch a playoff spot in the Patrick Division, missed a  chance to pull into second place in the division.  </P> <P> In the Patrick, only the New York Rangers have clinched a playoff spot. The  other five teams are all in contention for the other three berths.  </P> <P> Richer, a 50-goal scorer in 1987-88, has 48 goals.  </P> <P> Canadien goalie Patrick Roy, in winning his 30th game, faced 20 shots and only  four in the first period.  </P> <P> The Capitals might have to win three of their last five games to be assured of  postseason play.  </P> <P> Vancouver 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Craig Coxe scored the tiebreaking goal with 3:14  left to lead the Canucks at Winnipeg.  </P> <P> A victory would have put the Jets two points out of second place in the Smythe  Division. The Edmonton Oilers have 85 points and the Jets have 81. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (8): Crackdown on illegal loggers - Indonesia has the largest rain forest in the world after Brazil When the Indonesian forestry ministry recently announced that it had banned a large timber company from listing shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, the move caused a stir. For the ministry imposed the ban because of its suspicion that the company was involved in illegal logging. It would certainly not surprise timber industry afficionados if the allegation were true. What created the interest was that after many years of complaint about lack of resources and information, the ministry was now taking steps to enforce the law. Indonesia has the largest rain forest in the world after Brazil. It totals 144m hectares and covers 70 per cent of its land area. The country has long been aware of the value of its forestry resources and the need to conserve them. Government policy concentrates on control of illegal logging and the introduction of higher value added products, a reduction in shifting cultivation by forest dwellers and the provision of new employment, and the establishment of renewable timber plantations to support a fast-growing pulp and paper industry. Log exports were banned in 1985, and low interest loans offered to companies establishing plywood factories. As a result, exports of plywood have jumped from USDollars 991m that year to USDollars 3.2bn in 1992. Total exports of processed wood products, including furniture, reached USDollars 4.2bn in 1992, the third largest export earner after oil and textiles. Principal markets are Japan and South Korea. At the same time, the pulp and paper industry has also shown remarkable growth. The industry has been privatised and capacity is expected to grow from 1.5m tonnes of pulp and 3.2m tonnes of paper to 14.6m tonnes of pulp and 7.2m tonnes of paper over the next 10 years. With pulp production costs of USDollars 250 a tonne, significantly lower than European and North American producers, Indonesia is expected to become a significant producer. Exports of pulp and paper have already risen from 188,000 tonnes in 1987 to 660,000 tonnes in 1992. The timber industry is dominated by the giant Barito Pacific Timer, the largest listed company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the holder of 5m hectares of forestry concessions, an area larger than Switzerland. Barito is controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a young ethnic Chinese Indonesian businessman with close links to Indonesian President Suharto and his family. It exports 95 per cent of its annual production of 1.3m cubic metres of wood products and 90,000 tonnes of adhesives. Barito had sales of USDollars 459m last year and net profit of USDollars 145m, a rise of almost 100 per cent on the previous year. The company is benefiting from a rise in plywood prices from around USDollars 300 a cubic metre in late 1992 to more than USDollars 500 a cubic metre now. The company made an initial public offering of shares last year, raising USDollars 292m. It has plans to expand into the pulp industry and has purchased a total of 660,000 hectares of forestry land, some of which is already replanted. Barito last month signed a preliminary agreement with Marubeni and Nippon Pulp and Paper of Japan to establish a USDollars 1bn pulp plant with a capacity of 500,000 tons. This is expected to come on stream in 1997. It is also acquiring timber assets in Malaysia. Another large ethnic Chinese-owned business group, the third largest in Indonesia, is the principal participant in the existing pulp and paper industry. The Sinar Mas group, a long established business with interests in banking, property, food and agribusiness, controls the two principal listed companies, Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia. Indah Kiat, with timber plantations and mills in Sumatra, has production capacity of 790,000 tonnes of pulp, of which 410,000 tonnes has just come on stream, and 344,000 tonnes of paper, backed up by a timber concession of 300,000 hectares. The company had turnover of USDollars 305m in 1993, up 53 per cent on the previous year but earnings were hit by lower world pulp prices and fell from USDollars 57m to USDollars 42m. Brokers W. I. Carr expect a recovery this year as the new pulp output pushes forecast sales to USDollars 483m and improved export pulp prices and domestic paper prices increase net profit to USDollars 76m. Sinar Mas's other big producer, Tjiwi Kimia, has a production capacity of 21,600 tonnes of pulp and 394,000 tonnes of paper. It supplies 35 per cent of the domestic paper market and 50 per cent of the local stationery market and exports 40 per cent of its production. Its expansion plans involve upgrading to high quality papers such as non-carbon required paper and cast coating paper and installing new machinery. The company's turnover last year was up 25 per cent to USDollars 289m and is forecast to rise by a similar amount this year. Net profit was USDollars 37m, up 19 per cent. A surge in the domestic price of paper to USDollars 900 per tonne, compared with USDollars 600 per tonne internationally will push up profits this year. But the government is expected to move to reduce tariffs and surcharge against imports, currently at 40 per cent, to reduce prices. Nevertheless, Tjiwi Kimia is expected to increase net profits for 1994 by 39 per cent to USDollars 51m. Rapid growth in environmental action groups has accompanied the rise of the timber industry in Indonesia and companies have been regularly hit by complaints. Indorayon, a large pulp and rayon producer which had earlier been accused of polluting water supplies, suffered a serious chlorine leak at its North Sumatra plant last year and was forced to cease operations for a time. Indorayon produces long and short fibre pulp with a capacity of 260,000 tonnes backed up by 269,000ha of tropical forest and 86,000ha of pine forest. Its rayon plant has a capacity of 60,000 tonnes. Forestry and environment officials have been quick to investigate listed companies' pollution controls and have enforced requirements to install expensive waste treatment facilities. Indah Kiat was fined last year for allegedly acquiring timber from improper sources. But environmentalists believe there is still much to be done, especially in the monitoring of illegal logging. They point out that, according to Indonesia's own rules on sustainable forest management, the maximum amount of timber that can be cut is 31.4m cubic metres a year. But actual demand is 44m cubic metres, almost 40 per cent higher. More effective monitoring of resources, plus better tax collection from timber corporations are the main recommendations from action groups for the future control on one of the country's most valuable resources.</p>

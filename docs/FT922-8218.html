			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: British Inv Trust net assets up BRITISH Investment Trust, which has total assets of Pounds 590m, saw its net asset value rise to 821p per share over the 12 months to March 31. That represented a 3.1 per cent increase over the 796p at March 31 1991, and compared with falls of 1.8 per cent in the FT-A All-Share Index and 2.5 per cent in the MSCI World Index, said Sir Colin Barker, chairman. The trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, has 65 per cent (67 per cent) of its portfolio in the UK, 13 per cent (12 per cent) in Europe, and an unchanged 9 per cent in the US. Net revenue attributable to ordinary holders came to Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 16.4m) after tax, minorities and a Pounds 1.37m exceptional charge on revaluation of property. Earnings per share were 21.5p (26.3p) and the dividend for the year is held at 22.5p with an unchanged final of 13p. A subdivision of shares - from 25p to 5p - is proposed to improve marketability.</p>

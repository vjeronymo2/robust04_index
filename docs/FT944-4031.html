			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / US to cut weapons funding by Dollars 7.7bn Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, yesterday announced substantial cuts in several big weapons systems under development in the US. The move will save Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 4.9bn) over five years, although Mr Perry said the cuts would have been Dollars 20bn if President Bill Clinton had not recently increased overall military funding by Dollars 25bn. The most significant casualty is the Tri-Service Stand-Off Attack Missile which has been cancelled. TSSAM was being developed by Northrop Grumman and was to have produced the next generation of ground-hugging cruise missiles which incorporate radar-avoiding stealth technology. The Boeing Bell Comanche scout helicopter for the US army also took a direct hit. Two prototypes of the Comanche will be built, but there are no funds in the budget for its production. Other programmes were also affected. The number of Aegis cruiser ship radar systems will be cut from 18 to 16, the third New Generation hunter-killer attack submarine is being put back by a year, and funding for the F-22 stealth fighter programme is being trimmed slightly in 1996. However, these cuts do not threaten any of the projects and represent only a small setback for the companies involved. The air force and Lockheed had seen securing funding for the Dollars 71bn F-22 programme as a priority. Several programmes were unaffected by the cuts. The V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor - a cross between a helicopter and a turbo-prop aircraft - will continue. The Osprey had won strong congressional backing and was the most important new system wanted for transporting marine corps troops to battle zones. A new army battlefield artillery system and the Joint-Service Primary Aircraft Trainer system (JPATs) also emerged unscathed. The cuts follow a leaked memo from Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary, earlier this year which questioned the cost of the 10 most expensive equipment development programmes. The Pentagon has decided to put more resources into keeping its current forces at a high state of readiness, rather than spending on modernisation. Only the increased funding provided by Mr Clinton prevented several more high-profile programmes being axed, provoking suggestions that the administration was unwilling to see defence industry cuts on the scale which would have been required.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INNOCENT PLEA IN MOLESTATION CASE  </P> <P> A part-time Harbor College karate instructor pleaded not guilty Wednesday to  charges that he molested two preteen students after taking the girls from a  classroom on the pretext of filming a defense movie for children.  </P> <P> Lewis Calliham, 31, of Wilmington faces five counts of committing lewd acts on  a child, said Detective Michael Jacobellis of the Los Angeles Police  Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit.  </P> <P> Calliham was arrested Friday and released Wednesday on $25,000 bail. He faces a  preliminary hearing June 18.  </P> <P> Jacobellis said police began investigating Calliham's actions after the mother  of one of the students, an 11-year-old girl who lives on the Palos Verdes  Peninsula, complained to Harbor College officials about him.  </P> <P> The mother said that Calliham had asked her daughter to join a group of  students at a Redondo Beach karate studio for the filming of a movie but that  the girl said she was the only student present.  </P> <P> College officials relayed the complaint to a Harbor Division detective, who  remembered that Calliham had been the subject of a similar complaint two years  ago involving a 7-year-old Wilmington girl. No charges were filed in that case.  </P> <P> Investigators questioned the 11-year-old, who said Calliham had forced her to  masturbate him. Police then talked to other students in Calliham's classes,  including a 10-year-old Wilmington girl who reported a similar incident.  </P></p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Failure of one component blamed for SE breakdown The failure of a year-old component in the London Stock Exchange's Seaq automated price display system was largely responsible for a four-hour breakdown on Friday, the longest such glitch in the exchange's history. The stock exchange has declined to explain publicly the cause of the failure, saying it was a matter between itself and its clients. But yesterday, marketmakers and information providers, which carry stock exchange prices, expressed frustration at the lack of an explanation. Former stock exchange officials, familiar with the workings of the ageing Seaq system, said the failure of a chipcom hub in the exchange's ethernet network was to blame. The network, an ingredient in most integrated computer systems, helps parts to communicate with each other. 'The ethernet is like a plumbing system,' said one former employee. 'It's what connects the parts to each other. In order to work they all have to talk to each other and in the right sequence.' The chipcom hub helps the sequencing of information. When the component failed, it was left to Andersen Consulting, who are responsible for servicing the Seaq network, to straighten out the problem. The former officials said that because Andersen Consulting is relatively new to the system - it was appointed in April 1992 and is advising the exchange on how to replace it - it was not able to correct the fault quickly. Andersen was not available for comment yesterday. Since Seaq was installed in 1986, most of the technical staff responsible for its creation have left the exchange. However, despite its age and difficulties in coping with very active trading, it has proved resilient and marketmakers have had few complaints about its effectiveness. However, they expressed concern about last week's breakdown. 'It has a terrible effect on our business because clients have become used to identifying bargains on a screen,' said the head of marketmaking at one firm. He estimated the firm's business fell by a third on Friday. Previous breaks in service at other leading exchanges around the world have been the result of either an external disaster - such as a water main break in Chicago - or the exchange's inability to cope with volatile or highly active markets.</p>

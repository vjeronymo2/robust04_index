			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: Scientists struck by lightning - Worth watching Scientific breakthroughs are frequently represented by a flash of lightning. Now researchers at Nasa, the US national Aeronautics and Space Administration, in Washington DC, has discovered flashes of lightning which are in themselves a scientific breakthrough. They have recorded for the first time huge flashes of light - some 25 miles long - in the upper atmosphere above a severe thunderstorm. The flashes are as yet unexplained, but could be an electrical discharge, in which case they could present potential problems for high-altitude aeroplanes. Nasa: US, 202 358 0883.</p>

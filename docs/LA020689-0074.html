			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Cooper Cos. said it has completed the previously announced sale of its Cooper  Surgical ophthalmic surgical products business to Alcon Laboratories Inc. for  $325 million in cash. The sale to Alcon, a subsidiary of Nestle SA, is a major  step in Palo Alto-based Cooper's plan to sell all of its businesses. Cooper's  board has rapidly dismantled the medical products company in the past year and  has sold or agreed to sell all but one of its businesses.  </P></p>

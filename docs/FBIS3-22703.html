			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Zhang Hailin [1728 3189 </F> 2651], Zhang Yunzhi [1728 0061 2535], and Mi Zhuqing [4717 4554  7230] of the Yunnan Provincial Institute of Epidemic Diseases  Control and Research, Dali]    [Text] Aedes albopictus and Ae.  aegypti mosquitoes were tested for their ability for  transovarial transmission of chikungunya (CHIK) virus. The  strains of CHIK virus employed for B8635, M81 and Ross isolated  from Yunnan, China or Africa. Studies showed that these two  species of mosquitoes were capable of transmitting CHIK virus by  bite to susceptible hosts. Parental females of Ae.  albopictus and Ae. aegypti were infected orally  with CHIK virus, and 3070 first generation progeny from infected  mothers were pooled into 55 pools and examined for the virus.  Positive rate of pools from Ae. albopictus were 46.15  percent (6/13) for larvae, 33.33 percent (4/12) for adult  females and 62.50 percent (5/8) for adult males. Positive rate  of pools from Ae. aegypti were 18.18 percent (2/11)  for larvae and 22.22 percent (2/9) for adult females. In another  experiment, CHIK viruses were detected in second and third  generations progeny obtained from individual infected Ae.  albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Based on these  studies, infected females were capable of transmitting the virus  vertically to their offspring. There was no apparent difference  in transovarial transmission capabilities of these two species  in orally infected mosquitoes. These results indicate that  Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti have the  potential to play a role in the maintenance of CHIK virus in  nature.</p>

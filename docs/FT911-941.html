			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Magnum pays NZDollars 48.8m for control of Wilson Neill MAGNUM of New Zealand is paying NZDollars 48.8m (USDollars 28.8m) to gain a controlling shareholding in Wilson Neill, the diversified group. Magnum, the Auckland-based liquor and grocery group, is to buy 61m shares from Mr Colin Herbert, Wilson Neill managing director, which will increase its holding to 49.4 per cent from 31.4 per cent. Mr Herbert has also signed a put option to sell Magnum a further 14m shares in July, which will increase Magnum's stake to 53.5 per cent. All the shares are being sold at 65 cents, compared with yesterday's market price of 58 cents. A former publican, Mr Herbert has taken Wilson Neill from a small, diversified company, which he gained control of in 1984, to 15th in size on the New Zealand stock market. Wilson Neill has recently disposed of most of its fishing interests, taken control of Tasmania's Cascade Brewery, and acquired a 50 per cent stake in Australian Pubco, a joint venture with Carlton United Breweries of Australia. Magnum has recently bought interests in another chain of 70 hotels in an Australian tourist hotel group and other wine and spirit interests in Australia. Magnum is 54.4 per cent owned by a joint venture between Asia Pacific Breweries of Singapore, which is a joint venture with Heineken, and Magnum's former majority owner, Brierley Investments.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: ITT chairman checks out Ciga - US group poised to launch second bid Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, the US conglomerate, may be able to reward himself with a weekend at the famous Gritti Palace hotel in Venice this autumn. But he has probably not yet made his reservation. Seven months attempting to gain control of Ciga, the Italian hotels group which owns the Gritti, have taught Mr Araskog that when it comes to Italian takeover bids - even those agreed by the target company - it is best not to plan too far ahead. Under the control of Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company, Ciga accumulated borrowings of about L1,000bn (Dollars 628m) by the end of 1992, and at the beginning of last year asked Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, to study plans to cut its borrowings. Forte of the UK stepped in with a rescue plan last autumn, before Host Marriott of the US and ITT, which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, tabled rival bids. In February, ITT appeared to have outbid Forte for the right to buy Ciga. Since then, however, a combination of bad judgment and bad luck has forced ITT to abandon its original plan and start again, laboriously building a stake in Ciga to the point at which it is now poised to launch a second formal bid for the loss-making company. This being an Italian bid, nothing is official. From its New York base, ITT will say only that it is complying with Italian takeover regulations and will make a statement when appropriate. Consob, the Italian stock exchange authority and takeover watchdog, has issued no official communique. A terse statement in July, welcoming the appointment of ITT/Sheraton directors to the Ciga board, is the nearest Mr Araskog himself has come to acknowledging that hotels like the Gritti, the Meurice in Paris and the Principe di Savoia in Milan are within his grasp. However, sources confirm that ITT plans to launch a formal bid for 35.25 per cent of Ciga, at a price of about L1,100 a share. The offer will probably have to be made by September 16, the start of the next Milan stock exchange trading account. Under Italian stock exchange rules, ITT must bid at least the average price it paid for Ciga shares accumulated on the market. If successful, the bid will double the US company's stake in Ciga to just over 70 per cent, and cost ITT a further L400bn on top of the L400bn or so the company has already spent buying its existing 35 per cent holding. The offer price is nearly 50 per cent higher than ITT's original unsuccessful bid, but it is not enough for a hard core of the company's vociferous minority shareholders. Some have already said they are unhappy with the small premium to the current market price of about L1,080 and will reject such an offer. Their continued presence on the Ciga shareholder register would be a mixed blessing for ITT. Although the US group only needs 51 per cent of the company, it has already seen how determined Italian investors can upset carefully laid plans. In April, ITT was forced to abandon its original hope of acquiring Ciga through a complex financial manoeuvre masterminded by Mediobanca. A deliberately overpriced rights issue was supposed to fail, delivering Ciga into the hands of its creditor banks and thence to ITT for the equivalent of L740 a share. In preparation for takeover, a team of ITT/Sheraton executives came to Italy to start examining the real state of Ciga's assets. Unfortunately for ITT and Mediobanca, investors snapped up the issue of shares. An angry and embarrassed ITT withdrew its management team, claiming that more than L300bn of capital investment was needed to bring the Ciga hotels up to a satisfactory standard. ITT continued to buy shares in the company, however, although the tactics this time were much less aggressive. At a stormy shareholder meeting in early July, the Aga Khan's management of the company was fiercely criticised. It was agreed by the seven-strong board that three directors would step down to be replaced by ITT-Sheraton nominees. As a result, Consob decided the US group effectively controlled Ciga, even though it directly owned less than 20 per cent of the group. Italian investment funds which took stakes in Ciga during or just after the capital increase are happy that the hotels group will be managed by ITT-Sheraton, but some are upset about the way in which ITT has gone about the takeover. Although the funds claim they are long-term investors, they see the Italian group, now it is recapitalised, as a valuable play on real estate values, worth more than L1,200 a share. 'For an international company coming into the Italian market for the first time, they could be a bit more generous,' says one fund manager. In addition, some investors were irritated by the way in which ITT brought its stake up to 35 per cent in August, sweeping up shares on the market while there was still uncertainty about the terms of a future bid. ITT is now said to have lodged its formal offer with Consob, making further purchases illegal, but the US company's earlier forays into the market were within Italian rules. In any case, in spite of bid speculation, the Ciga share price rarely exceeded L1,100 during August. In ITT's defence, Mr Araskog could point out that only a foolish traveller offers to pay more than the advertised rate for a suite at the Gritti Palace.</p>

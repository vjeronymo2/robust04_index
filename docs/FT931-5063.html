			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Etonbrook meeting called Mr Andrew Perloff, the rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting of the property development company, in another attempt to join the board and remove all of its existing directors. Mr Perloff and the three companies acting with him own 20 per cent of Etonbrook. He has twice failed to win a seat on the board but thwarted a proposed capital restructuring at an EGM in September. In January the former BES company blamed a drop in its interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 74,000 on costs incurred in fighting a tender offer from Mr Berloff, which would have increased his stake to just under 30 per cent.</p>

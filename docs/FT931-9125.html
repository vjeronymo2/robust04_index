			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Explanations on exchange rate needed Sir, Would it not be timely for the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England to explain what they meant when they made the following statements? At the Mansion House (October 29 1992) the chancellor said the government would not ignore sterling exchange rates in judging policy following departure from the ERM. At the Conservative party conference (October 8) Mr Lamont stated that the exchange rate measured by its index against a basket of currencies would remain a significant factor in making decisions on interest rates. Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton stated on September 29 1992: 'If we are to achieve our domestic counter-inflationary goals we cannot afford to ignore the exchange rate.' Taking the Pounds index as shown elsewhere in your paper, is the exchange rate being ignored? The chancellor should explain - as should the other authorities - that the Treasury will give reasons for interest rate changes after they are made. J Ellinson, 58 Princes Park Avenue, London NW11</p>

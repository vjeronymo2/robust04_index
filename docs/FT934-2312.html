			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Britain and Ireland agree Ulster peace accord An Anglo-Irish declaration aimed at ending 25 years of IRA violence and paving the way for a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland will be unveiled in London today by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the British and Irish prime ministers, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released after a Downing Street meeting between the two leaders this morning. With only a few minor differences remaining to be settled, Mr Major expects to spell out the accord in the House of Commons a few hours later. He was last night also considering the possibility of a prime ministerial broadcast to outline the details to the people of Northern Ireland. The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the province's unionist majority with the aspirations of Irish nationalists will be hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to terrorism. Mr Reynolds and the Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, briefed a specially convened cabinet meeting late last night on the joint declaration. The cabinet fully endorsed the document in its final draft form. The Whitehall officials said that the document would underline the 'irrelevance' of the military campaign being waged by the IRA to secure a united Ireland. British intelligence reports suggest the leaders of the IRA and Sinn Fein, its political wing, are already embroiled in a fierce argument over whether to end the campaign. The statement will also provide the springboard for the relaunch of talks among the constitutional parties aimed at restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland. But even as Mr Major and Mr Reynolds were clearing the remaining obstacles, some leading unionist politicians were questioning if the declaration would bring lasting peace. The statement will include a firm guarantee to the Protestant majority in the province that its status as part of the UK could only be changed with their consent. It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the Republic's constitutional claim to the north in the event of a permanent political settlement. But in return Mr Major has agreed to language in the declaration which goes further than hitherto in acknowledging the aspirations of those seeking a united Ireland. He has accepted wording affirming the right of 'self-determination' for 'the people of Ireland, north and south'. The statement will also underline that the British government has no 'selfish or strategic interest' in keeping Northern Ireland within the UK if a majority of its people were to vote for unity with the Republic. Despite the strong affirmation of the veto on any constitutional change wielded by the majority, such phrases could provoke an angry reaction among unionists. Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, also appears to have won agreement on the establishment of a new Irish convention. Mr Major will stress that the convention, designed to provide an early opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks, will not have any real authority. He appears to have succeeded in removing from the communique a call for parallel referendums in the north and south. But the precise phrases in this section of the communique will be critical in determining the impact of the declaration. If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the terrorist campaign being waged by Protestant paramilitaries. Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if the statement would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign. One British minister said it might mark the 'beginning, not the end' of the search for peace. An important figure in the moderate Ulster Unionist party, whose support will be essential, was less sanguine. He predicted the declaration would be a 'mish-mash with one bit of it contradicting the other'. Mr Spring was optimistic about the prospects for peace. He said: 'I believe peace is possible in a very short period of time . . . the intention (of the joint declaration) is to lead to a cessation of violence and with that our hopes go.'

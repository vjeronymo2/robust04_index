			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Dual approach to electricity sell-offs SOUTH-EAST Asian nations are moving towards a dual approach to privatisation and restructuring of their electricity supply industries, the Financial Times Asian Electricity Conference was told yesterday. The pattern evolving among key members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines - was for independent, private power generators in competition for electricity sales with the state utilities, and for the longer-term restructuring of the state companies aimed at selling their shares on the region's stock exchanges. The pace is being set by Malaysia's state utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad, 23 per cent of whose shares were recently sold by subscription to institutions and individual investors in the country's biggest state-sector share flotation. Trading in the shares on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange is imminent. Mr S. Samy Vellu, the Malaysian energy minister, said the flotation had been substantially oversubscribed and more shares could go on the market soon if a strong price was established. Other Asean nations have their own privatisation programmes, but their approach tends to be to invite independent power generators to set up alongside national utilities. Restructuring of the state companies would come later, and a cautious approach would be taken to any sell-off of state assets, the conference was told. Mr Artono Arismunandar, Indonesia's director-general of electricity, said his country already had a lot of private-sector power operating alongside the PLN, the state utility, but most was for own-use in industrial estates and company towns. The country aimed to boost sale of surplus private power to the national grid and to invite new private power generators to share in new projects. Mr Danilo Cantiller, economics department manager for the National Power Corporation of the Philippines (NPC), said his country had an open-door policy to private-sector power generating companies to supplement the output of the NPC. Enabling legislation declaring that the PLN was no longer a natural monopoly was passed in 1987. A study of the possible break-up and privatisation of the NPC was being undertaken. Mr Piyasvasti Amranand of Thailand's National Energy Policy Office said the abolition of trade unions at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand several years ago had made it possible for the authority to consider some form of privatisation.</p>

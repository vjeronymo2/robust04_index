The meeting urged localities to actively raise  funds, effectively run state-owned enterprises, and accelerate  the province's economic development. Present at the meeting were  Governor Jie Zhijie, Vice Governors Li Daqiang, Wang Shentie,  Meng Qingping, Chen Shuiwen, and Su Xiaoyun, administrative  commissioners and heads of all prefectures and autonomous  prefectures, and mayors, and persons in charge of relevant  departments directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial  government.    The meeting held: Our province's current situation is very  fine. 1.) Enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for  production has run unprecedentedly high; the area of land sown  to grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops has expanded; and  breakthrough advances have been made in the development of a  diversified economy and township and town enterprises. The area  of land sown to grain crops for the entire year is expected to  amount to 72 million mu or so; that of land sown to cotton, 7.4  million mu; and that of land sown to oil-bearing crops, about 15  mullion mu, relatively big increases over the previous year.  Currently, it is a forgone conclusion that we will have a  bumper crop summer harvest. Early rice and cotton are coming  alone fine. Supplies of agricultural means of production are  relatively ample. 2.) There has been a big turn for the better  in industrial development. By the end of April, an accumulated  industrial output value of 50.284 billion yuan had been  registered, an 18 percent increase over the same period last  year, surpassing the nation's average level for the first time  since 1985. Especially in April, the output value of the  province's industrial enterprises at the county level and above  amounted to 15.85 billion yuan, the highest monthly output value  since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world  was carried out. In April, state-owned enterprises created  9.293 billion yuan in output value, a rise of 12.2 percent over  the corresponding period last year or an increase of 14 and 4.4  percentage points respectively over the February and March  growth rates, and an increase of 5 percentage point over the  nation's state-owned enterprise growth level in the same period.  3.) Urban and rural markets are prospering, commodity supplies  are ample, and transactions are brisk. By the end of April,  social consumer commodity retail sales volume totaled 19.279  billion yuan, an increase of 19.9 percent over the same period  last year. 4.) Various reforms have continued to deepen, and  the province has opened wider to the outside world, thus  vigorously promoting economic development.    The meeting pointed out: In the fine situation there do  exist some difficulties and problems hampering development and  stability, which should not be overlooked, such as that  state-owned enterprises had strained circulating funds and  difficult operations and an increase in the number of  enterprises suspending production or operating under capacity  and of loss-making enterprise. [passage omitted]    Continuing to regenerate enterprises which have suspended  operation or are operating under capacity and loss-making  enterprises and to invigorate state-owned enterprises is the key  to the province's current economic work. Governments at all  levels and various departments should pay close attention to  managing state-owned enterprises well, which serve as a dragon's  head in the province's development, and proceed to promote the  development of the economy based on nonpublic ownership and  township and town enterprises and maintain the sustained, rapid,  and healthy development of Hubei's economy.    In a view of the current contradiction of fund strains, the  meeting urged trying every possible means to raise funds, paying  a great deal of attention to encouragement of saving deposits,  utilizing foreign capital, and developing of projects covered by  the state plan. [passage omitted]    The meeting maintained: We should simultaneously grasp fund  revenue collection and its flexible use. At present, fund  shortages are a problem. However, what is more important is the  market problem. We should guide enterprises in gearing their  production to market demands and help some enterprises reduce  production and inventories and promote sales. [passage omitted]    Jie Zhijie, Li Daqiang, Meng Qingping, and Chen Shuiwen  spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Jia Zhijie particularly  stressed: Fundamental to run state-owned enterprises well being  is to deepen reform. The goal of state-owned enterprise reform  is to establish a modern enterprise system in accordance with  the demands of the market economy so that enterprises will  become genuine economic entities and main competition-oriented  market players able to operate independently, assume full  responsibility for their own profits and losses, and restrain  and develop themselves. He said: Currently we should intensify  reform, unswervingly implement the enterprise law and  regulations, actively support the jointly decided selected  projects, pay attention to organizational structural  readjustment of state-owned enterprises, take the path of  specialization and formation of groups, and enhance the quality  of enterprises as a whole. [passage omitted]    Jia Zhijie urged governments at all levels and competent  departments to effectively improve their work style, go down to  enterprises to conduct investigation and study, give specific  guidance, strive to improve the external environment of  enterprises, and make vigorous efforts to implement policies and  run state-owned enterprises well.</p>

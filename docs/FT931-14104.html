			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hearing begins over proposed Costain sale A COURT hearing began yesterday in St Louis, Missouri, over the proposed Dollars 245m (Pounds 161m) sale of Australian coal mining assets by Costain, the British construction company, to Altus Finance, part of the French Credit Lyonnais group. The transaction is being opposed by Hanson, the UK-based conglomerate, whose Peabody subsidiary had originally agreed to purchase the Costain coal-mining assets for Dollars 200m. Costain intends to use the sale proceeds to reduce borrowings of more than Pounds 340m, including off-balance sheet finance, which compares with shareholders funds of Pounds 276m at the end of 1991. Peabody filed a suit against Costain in November, alleging that the seller had given the Hanson subsidiary exclusive negotiating rights to the assets. On December 31, Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in St Louis, granted a preliminary injunction against Costain, prohibiting it from proceeding with the sale to Altus. The trial for a permanent injunction commenced yesterday.</p>

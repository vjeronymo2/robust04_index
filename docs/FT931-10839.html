			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Speedy scanner cuts paperwork One of the biggest problems for companies wanting to store their documents electronically has been the time and manpower needed to scan paper records into the computer. Bell &amp; Howell believes it has overcome many of these problems with a machine that scans up to 84 pages a minute at a consistent quality. The Copiscan II scanner uses a technique called adaptive contrast enhancement, which analyses each document as it is fed in for colour and dirtiness and adjusts the image accordingly. It can also scan in both sides of a document at once. Bell &amp; Howell: UK, 0784 51234.</p>

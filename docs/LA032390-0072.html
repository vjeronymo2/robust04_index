			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 8-DAY ABORTION FILIBUSTER NEARS END  </P> <P> A tentative agreement was reached Thursday to end the 8-day-old filibuster of  an bill that would allow virtually unrestricted access to abortions in  Maryland, the president of the state Senate said.  </P> <P> The agreement would place both an abortion rights and an anti-abortion proposal  before voters this fall, said Senate President Mike Miller.  </P> <P> If the Senate approves the agreement, it would still have to win approval in  the House of Delegates.  </P> <P> At stake in the battle was a measure that would allow unrestricted access to  abortions until the point in a pregnancy when a fetus is able to survive  outside the womb. After fetal viability, abortions could be performed to save  the life of the mother or to protect her health.  </P> <P> The bill would also require doctors to notify parents when unmarried teen-age  daughters seek an abortion.  </P></p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Dominican Republic to delay poll The Dominican Republic's National Assembly voted yesterday to delay new presidential elections intended to end the country's three-month leadership crisis, Reuter reports from Santo Domingo. The assembly voted to hold elections on May 16 1996, rejecting a pact agreed last Wednesday between the Dominican president and the opposition leader to hold the poll on November 16 1995. Dominican politics have been locked in a crisis since allegations of fraud surfaced during May's presidential elections. Incumbent President Mr Joaquin Balaguer beat his closest competitor, Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), by about 1 per cent, or 22,000, of votes cast. Mr Pena Gomez has charged that thousands of PRD members were illicitly denied the ballot. His charges have been echoed by international election observers who said there was evidence of voting fraud. Dominican authorities agreed, but said they could not determine which party benefited.</p>

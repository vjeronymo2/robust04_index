			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK group wins contract to value Peruvian mining giant A BRITISH-based firm, International Mining Consultants, has won the contract for valuation of Peru's giant state-owned mining and refining company, Centromin. Valuation, scheduled to take four months, is due to start 'in the first days of February', according to a Centromin spokesman. Peruvian mines minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama confirmed earlier this week that privatisation in his sector will be under way by August. The seven Centromin production units and the huge smelter and refinery complex at La Oroya should have a price tag by early June. To win the international tender, IMC has formed an association with a small, but well -established local engineering consultancy, Gerenpro (Gerencia de Proyectos). The contract was signed on 31 December for 'a sum in excess of Dollars 600,000', according to Centromin. Only a handful of financing documents and the arrival of key personnel are delaying the start of the valuation. International Mining Consultants is jointly owned by British Coal and Intercontinental Fuels. It was set up three years ago as a holding company for a group of nine consultancy companies in various parts of the world, mainly concerned with mining, metals and energy. Mr Robert Yates, IMC's director of finance and economics, said the group was among 10 international consultancies considered by the Peruvian government. IMC also hopes to be invited to bid for the valuation of Minero Peru if the government decides to press ahead with privatisation of that company. President Alberto Fujimori this week denied that there had been undue delay in beginning the privatisation process. 'We've been in office for only 18 months,' he said, 'and we started from way below zero, with companies that were in no shape to be privatised.' President Fujimori is calling 1992 'privatisation year' and Centromin is likely to lead the way. 'The plan is to subdivide the company and sell off the separate production units as quickly as possible,' he said. 'This is vital as Centromin is on the verge of collapse.' Privatisation is now being pushed ahead by a specially formed commission , headed by Mr Yoshiyama. President Fujimori, in an apparent reversal of his earlier position, does not now rule out debt-for-equity swaps as a privatisation mechanism. 'In certain cases, debt-swaps could be a possibility,' he said. 'The door is open.'</p>

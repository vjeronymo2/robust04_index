			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Lead Found on Solution to the </F> `Cellular Phone War' Issue"]    [Text] On 18 February, three days had passed since the  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative decided that Japan is  unfair in the cellular phone (portable and car phones) sector.  On the United States' position that it will not hesitate to  impose sanctions against Japan, Posts and Telecommunications  Minister Takenori Kanzaki, at a news conference the same day,  said, "We would like to negotiate so that that may not take  place. We still have time," but then added, "This question  should be dealt with at the private-sector level; it is  difficult to say how much the government can do." Apparently,  not even a lead has been found yet on how to resolve the  "cellular phone war" between Japan and the United States.    Japan IDO Tsushin [Mobile Communication] Company (IDO) has  accepted almost all of Motorola Company's demands including  those which can be said to be even irrational. What the company  can do has reached the limit. Tateo Tsukada, president of the  company, poured out his anger, "Motorola in documents on  negotiations used the word must. That is no word for a supplier  to use in dealing with a client." The confrontation between the  two companies has driven them into a state of being emotional.  Not much can be hoped for from the private-sector negotiations  the government wants to rely on.    President Tsukada has many reasons to be angry, and one of  them is the final compromise plan offered by Motorola. Motorola  in it suggested IDO "buy 225,000 sets of Motorola-made phones."  What it means is that since IDO plans to provide service to a  maximum of 450,000 subscribers by making investments in the  future, Motorola suggests IDO use Motorla phones in half of them.    Under the current cellular phone service system, the phones  are rented to customers by telecommunications companies like NTT  Docomo and IDO, but after April, all phones are set to be sold  freely, thus enabling sales agents of these companies, as well  as other big stores, to sell them.    Consequently, the two companies are now in the process of  getting ready for the change -- NTT Docomo abolishing its  practice of taking guarantee money of 100,000 yen effective  October next year and IDO lowering its price of phones, while  both of them trying to get rid of all the phones on hand. For  instance, if a set costs 50,000 yen, the total will come to 10  billion yen. Regardless of how competitive Motorola's phones  may be, 225,000 sets is a large number. It can be a matter of  life or death for IDO to add this number of phones to its stock.    At present, IDO is using phones made by NEC Corporation,  Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and Nippondenso Company, while  the cellular phone companies affiliated with Danini Denden  Company, which use the Motorola system, are using phones made by  Motorola, Sony Corporation, Kyocera Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd.,  Toshiba Corporation, and Oki Electric Industry Company.  Besides, there are moves by other companies joining the group  of manufacturers after April, and according to an electric  machinery manufacturer, "it is evident that Japanese electric  home appliance manufacturers will eventually win" [in the  competition for the cellular phone market]. Apparently,  Motorola's demands which can be interpreted as being "aimed at  cleaning up Motorola's inventories" are making the resolution of  the issue difficult.</p>

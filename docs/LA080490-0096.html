			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORAL SIGNS CASH DEAL TO ACQUIRE FORD AEROSPACE  </P> <P> Loral Corp., a New York-based defense electronics company, said Friday that it  signed a definitive agreement to buy Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp.  for $715 million in cash.  </P> <P> The purchase price is lower than industry analysts expected when Ford Motor Co.  put the defense and communications subsidiary up for sale in January.  </P> <P> But industry sources said Loral's actual cost could be nearly $900 million if  debt and other liabilities are included.  </P> <P> Ford announced July 23 that it had selected Loral as the winning bidder for its  Ford Aerospace unit. Loral, in a joint venture with Shearson Lehman Hutton  Inc., beat out competing offers from groups led by Hughes Aircraft Co. and  Westinghouse Electric Corp.  </P> <P> The deal, which is subject to government approval, is expected to close within  three months.  </P> <P> Bernard L. Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said Loral, as part  of the deal, will assume $20 million in short-term debt and commit about $160  million in employee benefit obligations. But he said those liabilities will be  balanced out by other assets, which include an overfunded pension plan for Ford  Aerospace's 17,000 employees.  </P> <P> Ford reportedly had sought cash bids of $1.2 billion when it put the defense  unit up for sale in January. But the bids came in much lower as prospects for  the defense industry grew bleaker with the melting of Cold War tensions.  </P> <P> Ford said the deal was not subject to any financing conditions.  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Trinidad strike planned in bid to save state jobs TRADE UNIONS in Trinidad and Tobago are hoping a planned general strike will force the embattled government to cancel the sacking of thousands of workers from three state-owned utilities. The strike will compound the problems of Mr Patrick Manning, the prime minister, in keeping the struggling oil-based economy from foundering. The date for the strike is being kept secret by the unions, apparently in the hope that continuing negotiations with the government will produce an acceptable agreement. 'We are not going to indicate any date,' said Mr Errol McLeod, president of the National Trade Union Centre, an umbrella for organised labour. 'We wish only to announce that a general strike is very much in the offing if there is no softening of the government's position and if there is no adjustment to their economic programme, some of the effects of which we have already begun to witness.' Thousands of government workers protested in the streets last month after Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, said extensive retrenchment in the public sector was inevitable. About 3,000 workers are to be sacked. Mr Mottley said the cuts at the Public Transport Corporation, the Port Authority and the Water and Sewerage Authority were unavoidable because of their huge payrolls, falling international oil prices which were affecting the domestic economy, and a heavy foreign debt obligations. The government has indicated that it cannot continue financing the deficits of the three companies while meeting overdue payments to government employees and servicing the country's foreign debt. Mr Mottley said the cumulative loss by the three companies last year was TTDollars 342m (Dollars 80m). The government is also under pressure to pay TTDollars 3bn in arrears to its workers. The country's domestic debt has increased by 62 per cent in the last five years to TTDollars 5.2bn, while the country's foreign debt is TTDollars 5.8bn. The government has to pay TTDollars 2.8bn this year in servicing its foreign debt.</p>

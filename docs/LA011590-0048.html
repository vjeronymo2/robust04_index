			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> TRADING EAST: With the Iron Curtain down, Western companies want to figure out  how to trade profitably with the East Bloc (D4). . . . The key question, says  Jim Harrell of Intertrade in Laguna Niguel: "What does a country do that does  not have currency, but needs things that take hard currency to buy?" . . .  Harrell has negotiated complex deals involving Poland, Romania, the Soviet  Union, China and Cambodia. . . . In one, U.S. medical gear was sent to the  Soviet Union for raw cotton, which was milled in Mexico and sent to China,  where it was turned into K mart sweat shirts. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

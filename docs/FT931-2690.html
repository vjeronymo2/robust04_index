			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Greece forecasts growth of 2% THE Greek economy ministry forecasts that growth this year will be stimulated by a sharp rise in investment, with gross domestic product increasing by 2 per cent. According to the ministry's economic overview for 1993, overall investment will increase by 7.2 per cent, led by a 10.9 per cent rise in the public sector, which will benefit from generous European Community transfers for infrastructure spending. Private investment is expected to go up by 5.7 per cent, against a 0.6 increase in 1992 and a 6 per cent decline the previous year. The ministry said its forecast reflected 'a positive business climate, with the prospect of lower interest rates as inflation comes down and more opportunities for investment as state enterprises are privatised.' Private sector analysts have forecast lower GDP growth, close to last year's l5 per cent, mainly because of a decline in agricultural output. However, the ministry predicts that the effects of a winter drought will be outweighed by higher growth in manufacturing. Nonetheless, private consumption will rise by only 1.3 per cent, as a result of a continuing public sector wage squeeze. Unemployment will rise to 390,000, equivalent to 9.9 per cent of the workforce. Exports are forecast to rise by 15.3 per cent this year, after increasing by 14.5 per cent in 1992. The year-on-year inflation rate, unchanged for the past three months at 14.5 per cent, is expected to decline in the second half of the year, falling below 10 per cent by December.</p>

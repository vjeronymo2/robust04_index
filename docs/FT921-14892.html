			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Andrew Strong - Town &amp; Country You could tell it was a hot ticket by the persistence of the touts - they had infiltrated Kentish Town tube station offering to buy and sell. And the audience, too, was older and smarter than the usual T &amp; C crowd. It was indeed an occasion and a very odd one. The star was no cult hero but an unknown with pitifully little experience of live performance. A year ago Strong was a Bunterish school boy, familiar in County Kildare through his size and pigtail. Now he has a six album contract and the trappings of a Sunset Boulevard career. When director Alan Parker trawled Ireland seeking unknowns for his movie The Commitments he hired Strong to give weight to the role as the singer in the band. It has since proved a surprise international hit and the fictional Commitments have moved from being just another failing Dublin blues band to a hot commercial property. It is very bizarre. Throw a stone and you will hit a pub band belting out the sixties soul classics of Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding. Its harmless nostalgia, as far away from the music business as Sunday morning soccer from the World Cup. But the movie has popularised both the performers and the songs. There was, after all, an audience for 'Mustang Sally' and 'Try a Little Tenderness', and Strong, a Roy of the Rovers come to life, is the unlikely vehicle for the craze. He is the hyperactive kiddie on the school treat, lumbering around the stage fingering an imaginary guitar just like the teenager in the bathroom. This is how it should be. Strong is just 18. He might look like a 48-year-old truck driver, Meat Loaf on a quiet day, but there is no way he can lay on a sophisticated performance. It is a sweet parody of soul - 'How's you all doing now', he drawls in a tentative charade of a southern singer working the cabaret circuit. After that his chat consists of spotting friends in the audience and wondering at the strange twist of fate which has made him this week bigger than big. Of course there is some sense in it all. Strong has a remarkably solid 'black' voice. Close your eyes and he is the soul singer of your dreams. Strong is already trying to move on, slipping in his own songs, which seem like a pastiche of the real thing. And he has a raunchy band with a six-strong brass section and girl singers who strut. It is just possible that the voice will keep him touring medium-sized venues in the US after the movie has moved on. But I can't imagine he will be such a hot ticket in Kentish Town again.</p>

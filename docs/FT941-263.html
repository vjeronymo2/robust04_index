			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (11): It's a tough world - Engineering Products Indian exporters of engineering goods have been shocked by the ending of a federal government scheme which enables them to buy Indian-made steel at lower international prices, writes Kunal Bose. The International Price Reimbursement Scheme (IPRS) for iron and steel is to be ended because the government no longer believes it justified. Launched in 1981, the scheme was financed out of a levy on the steel industry's entire bulk production. The government, however, had never been entirely happy with the IPRS which was naturally deeply unpopular with steel producers. It was also sensitive to criticisms by other countries that it was a central government subsidy to the engineering sector. This is rejected by the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), which says that the ending of the scheme came as a total surprise. The EEPC claims that it recently received a promise from Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce minister, that the IPRS would remain in force until March 1995. Exporters had therefore taken many orders which they would now find difficult to fulfil. Indian engineering products will certainly be less competitive if manufacturers can no longer obtain iron and steel at world prices. Mr Moosa Raza, steel secretary, rejects the criticism, saying that the exporters of steel-based goods could import duty free steel. The EEPC says, however, that 'since the engineering exporters need various kinds of steel in small quantities, it is not easy for them to organise import. Mind you, there are special steels which are about 30 per cent cheaper in the world market.' To help ease the situation, MSTC, a government trading organisation, has offered to import steel for the engineering sector by amalgamating their requirements. The government does not deny that the IPRS has helped to raise the value of Indian engineering exports from Rs8.8bn in 1981 to around Rs90bn in 1993-94. Nearly two-thirds of exports are thought to have benefited. Mr Bijon Nag, managing director of IFB Industries, a leading exporter of high value components and domestic appliances, believes that the government and the industry together will be able to organise the import of steel, though it would not be easy. 'The government will be able to win the industry's confidence provided it clears quickly the huge backlog of Rs3.2bn in IPRS payment,' he says. Because of their volume and high added value, engineering exports, according to Mr Nag, have taken an important position in India's foreign trade. In spite of the break-up of the Soviet Union, the industry's single largest market, and the recession in other parts of the world, Indian exports grew by an average 37 per cent a year in the last five years. The composition of exports also changed. Mr JS Bhasin, chairman of EEPC, says that whereas in the 1970s and the early 1980s India primarily exported low value added steel and iron based products, today nearly 60 per cent of its exports consisted of capital goods and consumer durables.' The commerce minister had offered to help make the engineering industry 'a significant player in the global market through value added exports'. Unlike the localised nature of many other countries' engineering industries, India's engineering industry is based in many parts of the country, giving geographical advantages to its hauliers and shippers. India is becoming an increasingly important supplier of automotive components to the US, Europe and Japan. It began in the low margin spare parts market. But some manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, apparently hope to buy higher quality components from India at attractive prices. Indian exports of auto components grew from Dollars 120m in 1990-91 to Dollars 190m in 1992-93. EEPC expects the figures to reach Dollars 335m by 1996-97. Engineering exports are likely to be boosted further by the decision of some international engineering groups to manufacture semi-finished and finished articles in India either for their own markets or for delivery to third countries. Bosch will buy washing machines from IFB for export to third countries, while Siemens is to buy small electric motors from a Bangalore engineering company. In the past decade, the biggest growth in engineering exports has come from the small and medium sectors. According to one estimate, these sectors account for more than 60 per cent of engineering exports.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALL ENROLLMENT SLIGHTLY BELOW PREDICTED LEVEL;  </P> <P> GLENDALE: DISTRICT SCHOOLS HAVE 25,343 STUDENTS INSTEAD OF 25,539. MORE ARE  EXPECTED TO ARRIVE.  </P> <P> The Glendale Unified School District's fall enrollment of 25,343 is slightly  lower than district projections, but more students are expected to arrive  throughout the school year, officials reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> Administrators had predicted that enrollment would increase from about 24,100  students last year to 25,539.  </P> <P> As of Monday, after one week of school, there were 13,441 students at 19  elementary schools, 5,346 at four junior high schools and 6,214 at three high  schools and one continuation school. An additional 342 students were enrolled  in special-education classes.  </P> <P> The figures were presented to the Board of Education on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's harder today to be right on because we continue to get people moving into  the community all year long," said Vic Pallos, a district spokesman.  </P> <P> Even though more than 210 students are being bused this year from crowded  schools to less crowded ones, enrollments at the crowded schools were lower  than expected. Six of the most crowded schools are scheduled to go year-round  in 1991 because of overcrowding.  </P> <P> In addition, at least 50 seventh-graders are being transported from Toll Junior  High School to Rosemont Junior High School because of crowding, Pallos said.  </P> <P> One area in which officials had under-projected new enrollment was at the  district's Welcome Center, which serves students who speak little or no  English. As of Monday, 1,100 students had come to the center during the summer,  400 more than had been anticipated.  </P></p>

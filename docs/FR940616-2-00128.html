			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> North Africa, Near East and South Asia (NEA) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Priority will be given to projects which promote democratization, economic reform, free markets, tolerance and pluralism, conflict resolution, and Israeli and Palestinian understanding. The Office of Citizen Exchanges strongly encourages the coordination of activities with respected universities, professional associations, and major cultural institutions in the U.S. and abroad, but particularly in the U.S. Projects should be intellectual and cultural, not technical. Vocational training (an occupation other than one requiring a baccalaureate or higher academic degree; i.e., clerical work, auto maintenance, etc. and other occupations requiring less than two years of higher education) and technical training (special and practical knowledge of a mechanical or a scientific subject which enhances mechanical, narrowly scientific, or semi-skilled capabilities) are ineligible for support. In addition, scholarship programs are ineligible for support. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars (i.e., one to fourteen-day programs with plenary sessions, main speakers, panels, and a passive audience). It will support conferences only insofar as they are part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition. USIA-supported projects may include internships; study tours; short-term, non-technical training; and extended, intensive workshops taking place in the United States or overseas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The themes addressed in exchange programs must be of long-term importance rather than focused exclusively on current events or short-term issues. In every case, a substantial rationale must be presented as part of the proposal, one that clearly indicates the distinctive and important contribution of the overall project, including where applicable the expected yield of any associated conference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No funding is available exclusively to send U.S. citizens to conferences or conference-type seminars overseas; neither is funding available for bringing foreign nationals to conferences or to routine professional association meetings in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects that duplicate what is routinely carried out by private sector and/or public sector operations will not be considered. The Office of Citizen Exchanges strongly recommends that applicants consult with host country USIS post, prior to submitting proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section of Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All grant proposals should clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process by which participants will be selected. It is recommended that programs in support of U.S. internships include letters tentatively committing host institutions to support the internships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the selection of foreign participants, USIA and USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants and to accept or deny participants recommended by grantee institutions. However, grantee institutions are often asked by USIA to suggest names of potential participants. The grantee institution will also provide the names of American participants and brief (two pages) biographical data on each American participant to the Office of Citizen Exchanges for information purposes. Priority will be given to foreign participants who have not previously travelled to the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

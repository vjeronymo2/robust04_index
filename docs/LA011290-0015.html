			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV-RADIO: HE'S NOT A GENIUS, BUT HIS GRADES ARE UP  </P> <P> Bill Walsh may have a future in broadcasting after all. At least he's  improving.  </P> <P> Walsh, who will team with Dick Enberg on NBC's coverage of Sunday's AFC  championship game between Cleveland and Denver, admits his first season has  been tough.  </P> <P> "Early in the season I was having quite a few bad games," he said. "I'd have a  good game, then a bad game.  </P> <P> "But I think I've reduced the number of those games and been more effective the  last five games."  </P> <P> That's a pretty accurate evaluation.  </P> <P> Walsh had his best game last Sunday, when he was particularly candid and  opinionated during Denver's one-point win over Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> About Walsh's troubles, partner Dick Enberg said: "He's had a heavy load to  carry. Commentators have to do a lot more than just provide commentary.  </P> <P> "It used to be story-telling was the responsibility of the play-by-play man,  but now it's a role for the commentator.  </P> <P> "He's also had to learn to work the telestrator, and I think he's now doing it  as well as anybody."  </P> <P> Said Walsh: "I think I've learned that you'd better just be yourself in this  role. There's only one John Madden, and only one Dan Dierdorf.  </P> <P> "I have to be myself and let the viewers decide whether I have a sense of humor  and if I can be interesting."  </P> <P> As for his attempts at humor, Walsh said: "Sometimes Dick forces me to  rehearse. But what I hope comes across is that Dick and I really enjoy each  other's company."  </P> <P> It seemed at times during last Sunday's Ram-Giant game that CBS announcers Pat  Summerall and John Madden were Giant announcers.  </P> <P> It was not that they openly rooted for New York, but too often they were  telling viewers what the Giants were doing right or what the Giants were doing  wrong.  </P> <P> They may have been affected by CBS executives, most of whom live in New York  and cheer for the Giants, although Bob Stenner, the producer of the telecast,  is from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Madden, in particular, irked Ram fans by saying the pass interference call in  overtime that set up the winning touchdown shouldn't have been called.  </P> <P> "What I'm against is such a marginal call being made at that point of the  game," Madden said this week after arriving back at his home in the Bay Area.  "It doesn't matter who it's on."  </P> <P> Summerall and Madden remain the best announcing team in pro football, and  besides working Sunday's NFC title game between the Rams and San Francisco,  they will also work the Super Bowl on Jan. 28.  </P> <P> A reminder: With both conference championship games being played in the West,  the AFC game doesn't start until 10:30 a.m., PST, and the NFC game starts at 2  p.m.  </P> <P> The Super Bowl in New Orleans will also start at 2 p.m., PST.  </P> <P> Madden, who travels from game to game by bus, said he still enjoys it.  </P> <P> "If I was always on the bus, it might get to me," he said. "But I can make it  across the country in two days. We left the Meadowlands at 5 p.m. Eastern time  on Sunday, and I was home by 5 p.m. our time Tuesday."  </P> <P> Greyhound not only provides Madden with his bus but also with two drivers who  alternate shifts. So the bus is going almost the whole time.  </P> <P> Going in, Monday night's pay-per-view fight between George Foreman and Gerry  Cooney seems to be the most-ridiculed bout in recent memory.  </P> <P> But CBS boxing commentator Gil Clancy, who, in his younger days, trained world  champions Emile Griffith and Ken Buchanan, thinks the criticism is unfair.  </P> <P> Clancy, who took some time off from CBS to train Cooney, said: "I know Gerry is  taking this fight seriously. He's in the best shape of his life."  </P> <P> Clancy, 67, who once trained Foreman, said he agreed to handle Cooney after a  meeting with the 33-year-old fighter who has had only two bouts since 1984 and  none in 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> "I went to see him work out and could tell he was dead serious," Clancy said  from Atlantic City, N.J., the site of the fight. "I liked what I saw and I  liked what he said.  </P> <P> "I liked his potential when he was a 17-year-old kid, but he was never handled  by the right people."  </P> <P> Clancy, who was a commentator on the pay-per-view telecast of the recent Sugar  Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran fight, goes back to work for CBS on Jan. 27, when  Lindell Holmes and Frank Tate square off in New Orleans as a part of Super Bowl  week.  </P> <P> Monday night's undercard begins at 6 p.m., the main event about 7:30.  Highlighting the undercard is a scheduled 12-round middleweight bout between  Doug DeWitt and Matthew Hilton, a substitute for injured Iran Barkley but a  hard puncher.  </P> <P> The main event is scheduled for 10 rounds but doesn't figure to go that long.  </P> <P> Most cable companies are charging $20 for the telecast.  </P> <P> Awards show: The Ace Awards, cable television's Emmy Awards, will be presented  Sunday night, during a show televised from 5 to 7:30 p.m., at the Wiltern  Theater.  </P> <P> A dozen cable networks, including TBS, TNT and SportsChannel America, will  televise the show.  </P> <P> Individual nominees in sports categories include Chris Berman, Mike Patrick and  Dick Vitale of ESPN, Roy Firestone for "Sportslook," Jim Lampley for HBO boxing  and Marv Albert for Knicks basketball on the Madison Square Garden network.  </P> <P> Joe Namath and Dinah Shore are among the hosts. Mike Tyson and Don King are  among the presenters.  </P> <P> TV-Radio Notes  </P> <P> ABC's "Wide World of Sports" begins its 30th year Saturday, spotlighting the  Harlem Globetrotters.

The segment is dedicated to the people of St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, the  game's original site, which was devasted by Hurricane Hugo. . . .

Robin Roberts, 29, a former Southeastern  Louisiana women's basketball star who most recently was working as a sports  anchor in Atlanta, has been hired by ESPN as a late-night anchor for  "SportsCenter." She begins Monday.  </P> <P> KFI's Joe McDonnell says he will break a new twist to how the Raiders may be  kept in Los Angeles on his talk show Sunday night. McDonnell said he will have  guests on during the 9 o'clock hour who have a plan for keeping the Raiders in  Los Angeles County but not necessarily at the Coliseum. . . . KMPC has gotten a  jump on the Angel season. The radio station is already carrying "Angel Update,"  a weekly call-in show on Wednesday nights, with Al Conin and Ken Brett.  </P> <P> Channel 13's Vic (the Brick) Jacobs was among the guests on HBO's "First and  Ten" Wednesday night. He played himself. Other guests included Lawrence Taylor,  Jim Everett, Roger Craig and Herschel Walker. Guess what. They played football  players. . . .

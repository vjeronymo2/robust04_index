			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / The impossibility of being president: America At the economic summit in Naples the world's press, once again, is likely to be impressed by President Bill Clinton's youth, energy, intelligence, warmth and persuasive rhetoric. Set against his elderly and cautious Group of Seven peers, he cuts a rather impressive figure. Being an American he at least possesses a modicum of optimism: unlike his world-weary colleagues he believes that severe social problems - such as high global unemployment - are soluble. Yet in spite of these virtues and some solid legislative achievements, Mr Clinton's approval ratings at home are depressingly low. The boost that he hoped to get from robust economic growth has been largely offset by continuing doubts about his character - doubts fuelled by the Whitewater affair and Paula Jones's sexual harassment charges. At the same time he is condemned as indecisive in foreign affairs and criticised for running an ill-disciplined White House - a charge that prompted another reshuffling of top aides last week and the appointment of Mr Leon Panetta, the affable former budget director, as the new chief of staff. While not denying that Mr Clinton has made many mistakes, I believe much of the criticism of his presidency is misplaced. The US media are like a pack of wolves: happy only when dismembering their prey. They would find grievous faults in any occupant of the Oval Office because the job of an American president is now beyond the ability of any mortal. This is largely the consequence of an 18th century constitution designed by Virginia landowners whose main objective was to limit the powers of a central government. The goal of minimal government was admirable; but the ensuing legislative arrangements create enormous tensions in an era when the American people (and the wider world) expect an administration to solve countless problems. In the US system, cabinet officers, as unelected appointees, have much less authority than in parliamentary regimes. All important decisions on foreign and domestic policy are thus funnelled into the White House for the attention of the chief executive. Mr Clinton is engaged in formulating policy in spheres such as macroeconomics, healthcare, crime and welfare at a level of detail that in Britain would be left to the relevant secretaries of state - if not senior civil servants. Former President George Bush tried to solve the 'overload' problem by ignoring domestic policy. But this led ultimately to electoral defeat. Mr Clinton has set himself important goals in the domestic arena. He cannot afford to delegate domestic policy because nobody but the president has the clout to influence the other main power brokers in the US system, the men who run the key congressional committees - such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the unpredictable chairman of the Senate finance committee. Such barons have limited respect for presidents, even from their own parties, because they do not select them: Congress has to work with a president independently chosen by the American people. But for Mr Clinton's personal involvement, for example, Congress would never have voted in favour of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The task could not have been entrusted to cabinet officials such as the trade representative and treasury secretary. Healthcare reform may be stymied despite Mr Clinton's passionate involvement; without a presidential push, defeat would be virtually certain. Mr Clinton thus has no choice but to try to keep on top of every aspect of policy, from Bosnia to handguns; inevitably he drops some balls. Other facets of the Washington system conspire to undermine him. One key to understanding Mr Clinton is to remember that, unlike his recent predecessors, he is comfortable with ideas. He is the product of a superior liberal education - of a tradition that abhors dogmatism and stresses the virtue of critical analysis from various points of view. The result is a 'seminar' presidency: a chief executive who mulls the arguments for and against policies and makes decisions slowly. Having an open, inquiring mind is not normally a sin; yet as president, Mr Clinton pays a heavy penalty. Since nothing is secret in the American political system, every step in his tortuous decision-making process is relayed to a confused public at home and abroad. Policy-in-formation is endlessly 'analysed' in superficial news reports. Yet the 'soundbite' style of presentation militates against true understanding. A thoughtful president who quite often gets it right - think for example of his two Supreme Court nominations - ends up looking indecisive and muddled. The system would treat a dictatorial leader with a closed mind far more kindly. Yet this is hardly what the US wants. Would Americans, in fact, even favour a retreat to the Bush era: to a president who rarely uttered a coherent sentence and was ignorant of the detail of domestic policy? I am not trying to imply that all of Mr Clinton's problems reflect the inherent difficulties of being president. In many areas of policy, his mistakes reflect an intellectual map that is seriously outdated: like many products of elite US colleges Mr Clinton has an exaggerated faith in the competence of government and a poor understanding of the efficiency of free markets. This explains last year's unhelpful 'soak the rich' budget and his continuing appetite for managed trade and other interventions. But since Mr Clinton is one of the brightest US presidents in memory it is safe to predict that many of his difficulties reflect the job. His successors are not going to be popular either.</p>

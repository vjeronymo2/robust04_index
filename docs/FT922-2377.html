			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Widespread support for Soweto Day protest Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, marches with Cyril Ramaphosa (left), ANC secretary general, and Joe Slovo, ANC adviser, in Soweto yesterday. The ANC had a successful start to its mass action campaign yesterday, with most black workers observing Soweto Day by not going to work, and no reports of intimidation or violence related to the stayaway, Philip Gawith reports from Johannesburg. All the main cities reported large stayaway figures. The Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry said 89 per cent of city employees stayed away from work. June 16, the day the Soweto riots began in 1976, is traditionally observed as a public holiday by the black community, so it was difficult to gauge the response to the ANC's call for mass action. Many companies have negotiated June 16 as a paid holiday for their workers. The streets of Johannesburg were devoid of the normal bustle of hawkers, black-run taxis and pedestrians. Soweto, by contrast, was a hive of activity, much of it centred on the Orlando stadium for the main rally of 70 the ANC organised around the country yesterday. A capacity crowd heard Mr Mandela say mass action would continue so long as there was no progress at Codesa, the forum for constitutional negotiations which have become deadlocked. Later, unknown gunmen opened fire on pedestrians and motorists in townships around Johannesburg, killing 12 people. Speaking yesterday in Ulundi, capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland', President F W de Klerk said the government was anxious to move to power sharing in the shortest possible time, but would not be bulldozed into an unsuitable constitution.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: DR. J HAD THE STYLE, BUT JORDAN HAS THE INTENSITY, KERR SAYS  </P> <P> As the general manager of the Virginia Squires, John (Red) Kerr signed Julius  Erving out of the University of Massachusetts. As an announcer for the Chicago  Bulls, he has watched Michael Jordan ever since Jordan left North Carolina.  </P> <P> "There's no comparison," Kerr told Steve Jacobson of Newsday. "Michael is a  vicious offensive player. Doc was never a vicious player. He was a finesse  player.  </P> <P> "Doc didn't establish the outside shot. Michael scores from the outside. He's  even displayed a three-point weapon."  </P> <P> As for Jordan's artistry, Kerr said, "Elgin Baylor could do things in the air.  Dave Bing could also do a little. Connie Hawkins could. Michael does even more.  I've seen all his games in the league, and he still does things that bring me  out of my seat."  </P> <P> Keystone kings: Said Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan, when asked to rate  the best at his position: "Bill Mazeroski was the best I ever saw. Jose Lind  has more range than anyone I've seen, and I guess that Ryne Sandberg is the  steadiest."  </P> <P> Add keystoners: Said the Oakland Athletics' Mike Gallego after Willie Randolph  came to the A's from the Dodgers: "It's going to be tougher for me to get a  table at a nice restaurant now, saying, 'I'm Mike Gallego, extra infielder.' "  </P> <P> Add A's: ESPN's Norm Hitzges, on the Oakland Coliseum: "You could graze 300  sheep in foul territory of this ballpark, and they would never go hungry."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Bob Klapisch, baseball reporter for the New York Daily News, is  the answer to what trivia question?  </P> <P> Dying to play: Lee Trevino told Dave Anderson of the New York Times the one  about the duffer who slashed his wrists after a horrendous round.  </P> <P> Trevino: "The guy's sitting there, bleeding, when a friend walks in and says,  'Why did you slash your wrists?' The guy says, 'I hate this game.' The friend  says, 'That's too bad, I was going to ask you to play tomorrow.' And the guy  looks up and says, 'What time?' "  </P> <P> Raiders respond: Steve Ortmayer of the Raiders, on Tuesday's item from the St.  Paul Pioneer Press, which reported the rumor that the Raiders mistakenly  drafted defensive end Anthony Smith instead of Arizona teammate Chris  Singleton: "That's so silly it defies description. We went all the way back  with Smith and Singleton to when they were 4 years old. I assure you, we  checked out everything thoroughly. And the player we wanted was Smith."  </P> <P> Culture shock: Cornerback Tim McKyer, on the difference between the facilities  of his new team, the Miami Dolphins, and those of his old team, the San  Francisco 49ers: "I've definitely got something to get used to. I left a  Cadillac and now I'm in a Chevy."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: He was the ghostwriter for New York Met pitcher David Cone, who  stirred up the Dodgers with derogatory remarks about their pitching in the  Daily News during the 1988 National League playoffs.  </P> <P> Quotebook: A's Manager Tony La Russa, after saying of Jose Canseco, "I probably  think he's better than he thinks he is," adds: "And you know he thinks he's  very good, right?"

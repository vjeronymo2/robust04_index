			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   ANC Agreement With COSATU on Strike Moratorium --  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 April in a page-20  editorial says the Congress of South African Trade Unions'  (COSATU) decision to accept a moratorium on strikes until after  the election "is part of a quid pro quo, in which COSATU  assented to a moratorium in return for an undertaking by the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] to address the fears and  grievances of civil servants." The call for a freeze on strikes  was made by "top ANC leaders," in "response to a crippling  series of strikes by civil servants" which have now spread to  "threaten the election process itself." However, if an ANC  government is to fulfill its "ambitious programme of  reconstruction and development, more than a moratorium on  strikes is required. There must be a commitment to general wage  restraint in the upper echelons of the civil service -- soon to  be filled by ANC appointees -- as well as by workers generally.  It will not be enough for the ANC to call on its alliance  partner, COSATU, to urge the workers to tighten their belts.  The ANC's leaders will have to show the way."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   COSATU Sets Itself `Coherent Agenda' -- "Though COSATU faces  difficult times because of the loss of some of its most capable  leadership to politics, it has set itself a coherent agenda,"  notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English on 21 April. "COSATU's agenda is not an unimaginative  one. It will require an alert business (and government) effort  to ensure that some overly adventurous proposals are moderated.  COSATU's primary focus is on strengthening centralised  collective bargaining. This is not, as some argue, an  inherently flawed approach. If we want an era of industrial  governance by consensus, it is probably essential." BUSINESS  DAY also sees "a growing awareness in COSATU of the need to  encourage small business development and, therefore, a  willingness to exempt emerging businesses from the more onerous  conditions of industrial council agreements."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Buthelezi Brinkmanship -- An editorial in the Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 21 April on page 10 looks at "cold facts"  after the "euphoria of the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP]  participation" in the elections. "Why did the country have to go  right up to the brink before State President F W de Klerk, ANC  President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi  stopped and turned back?" Was the IFP "playing chicken," as "it  was pretty obvious to all that the IFP was preparing itself for  the elections" and "were actually able to pull out posters and  election material before the ink on the agreement had dried."  "What does the death of hundreds in Natal and other provinces  mean to the IFP?" "Now that sanity seems to be restored" a  "programme to encourage reconciliation has to be pursued, not  for the sake of the political parties involved, but for that of  the country as a whole."</p>

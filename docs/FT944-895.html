			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Surge in car export production gives record high A further surge in car production for export in November has ensured that total car output this year will be the highest for two decades, John Griffiths writes. Statistics released yesterday coincided with the signing of a potentially export-boosting agreement between Rover Group and Indonesian government authorities for an Indonesian national car project. Under the deal, Rover will lead a project to design, develop and manufacture a small car, the Meleo, for production in Indonesia. Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said yesterday it was intended that 20,000-25,000 cars would be built in the first year after production started in late 1997, rising to 100,000 a year at the end of the decade. The motor industry's contribution to the UK's improving overall exports performance was underlined by the November statistics, which showed a jump of 53.8 per cent - to 79,290 - in production of export-destined cars compared with November last year. This lifted November's total car output to 157,613 - a year-on-year rise of 22.8 per cent. As a result, output for the first 11 months of the year reached 1.36m, a 5.8 per cent rise on last year, figures from the Central Statistical Office and Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. The full-year total is certain to exceed 1.4m, which would be the highest total since the 1.53m achieved in 1974. November's export performance more than compensated for fairly flat production for the domestic market - up 1.9 per cent to 78,233. However, the situation was reversed for commercial vehicle production. Total output in November reached 25,639, a 16.9 per cent year-on-year rise. But export production was down 10.7 per cent while output for the domestic market rose by 51 per cent.</p>

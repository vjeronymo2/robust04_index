			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: CPSA chief calls for minister to go MR BARRY Reamsbottom, general-secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, yesterday called for the resignation of Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the 'market testing' of the Civil Service, and warned that the government faced severe discontent among civil servants over plans to privatise parts of the service. The union said that Pounds 13m of taxpayers' money had already been spent on trying to contract out work from government departments. More than 12 separate selective strikes have been staged and Mr Reamsbottom predicted further industrial action.</p>

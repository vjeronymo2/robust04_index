			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 15 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  has asked the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to  assist in its joint move with Denmark to draw up an  international regulation to curb dumping of toxic chemicals in  developing countries.    Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding  said Tuesday, he made the request to UNEP Under  Secretary-General Elizabeth Dowdeswell since UNEP had been an  active and strong supporter of international chemical safety  programmes.    Dowdeswell was also briefed on the discussion I had with  Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken, Law told reporters  after receiving Dowdeswell, who is on a two-day official visit  here.    Monday, Malaysia and Denmark agreed to work together in  formulating an international regulation to control the  trafficking of banned and restricted chemicals like DDT  [dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane] from industrialised nations  to developing countries.    Law said during their one-hour meeting, they also discussed  a  wide range of subjects, among them, the role of UNEP in the  restructuring of the global environmental facilities, where he  hoped UNEP could play a much bigger role.    He said they also discussed Agenda 21, the world's action  plan to protect the environment.    Malaysia also suggested a possible dialogue among Southeast  Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand on environment  matters.    Dowdeswell, who is on her first visit here, said the UNEP  was  very keen to work with Malaysia and Denmark on enforcing the ban  on toxic chemicals dumping since UNEP had been promoting  chemical safety.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: Fallacy of conditions for Emu Sir, Frequent reference is made to 'Maastricht treaty limits' of 3 per cent of gross domestic product for budget deficits, and 60 per cent of GDP for public debt - which, together with conditions for inflation and interest-rate convergence and exchange-rate stability, are supposed to precede any early move to European monetary union. Although agreed at Maastricht in 1991, these conditions are not written into the treaty. Article 104c refers to 'reference values' for government deficits and debts. The protocol on convergence criteria sets relative target ranges for inflation and long-term interest rates, but leaves it up to the council to define 'excessive deficits'. This definition need not be finalised until January 1 1994. With all but two ERM countries currently breaching the limits, some for good reasons, an opportunity remains to revise them upwards. The treaty is being accused of enshrining rigidities it does not contain. Alan Shipman, 792a Harrow Road, Kensal Green, London NW10 5JX</p>

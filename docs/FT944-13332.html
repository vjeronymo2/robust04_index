			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / EU collective investment scheme laws 'a failure' European Union legislation aimed at spurring a genuine cross-border market in collective investment schemes has largely been a failure, according to a new study. Lipper Analytical Services, the US-based mutual fund research group, has concluded that just over a third of so-called Ucits - 'undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities' such as equities or bonds  -are genuinely marketed across European borders. Roughly 38 per cent of the 5,436 Ucits are marketed outside the country of domicile of their promoters. A significant portion of Ucits are 'round-trippers', Lipper Analytical said. This means they are domiciled in the low-tax centres of Dublin and Luxembourg but marketed exclusively into the country in which their promoter is domiciled, making them effectively low-tax domestic collective investments or 'round trippers'. Of the 937 Ucits which have been notified for marketing in only one country outside their country of domicile, 608 can be identified as 'round-trippers'. Promoters of Ucits have to notify authorities in the countries they wish to sell but do not require their permission. 'If the question is 'has the Ucits Directive succeeded in creating a single market for funds?' then the answer must be 'No', says the report. Despite the common legal framework, each member state retains control over local fiscal and marketing policies. 'Tax efficiency and effective distribution remain the major factors in determining the use made of the directive to market a fund to the investors resident in another state.' The report also found a large number of Ucits - 281 with total net assets of Dollars 13.1bn which are notified for sale in Luxembourg but are not sold in any other European country. Luxembourg has a population of only 375,000 and Lipper Analytical is sceptical that these are intended for domestic consumption. Instead, they are likely sold outside the EU.

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc sees strong gains Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, should achieve a large increase in net profits this year, in spite of a 69 per cent fall in results for the first six months, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, said yesterday. Announcing a decline in net profits, to FFr337m (Dollars 60.2m) for the first six months of this year from FFr1.08bn in the first half of 1993, Mr Fourtou said a strong improvement in the group's operating result and capital gains from asset sales would push full-year results above the FFr962m recorded in 1993. Shares in the company, which have climbed over the past few weeks, rose FFr2.7 to FFr141.5. This compares with a price of FFr135 per share for the public offer through which the privatisation of the company was completed last autumn. Mr Fourtou said the company planned to sell more than Dollars 1bn of assets and capital gains from disposals should offset exceptional charges this year. The chairman declined to give details of the possible sales. Reduced capital gains from asset sales were one factor in the decline in first-half profits. Income from this source fell to FFr57m in the first six months of this year from FFr204m in the first half of 1993. A bigger hit came from restructuring charges. Rhone-Poulenc took about FFr900m of provisions for restructuring costs, mainly at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its US pharmaceuticals subsidiary. At the trading level, Mr Fourtou outlined an encouraging performance in the first six months. Sales rose across the company's principal divisions, prompting a 5.9 per cent rise in turnover to FFr42.38bn. At the operating level, profits before restructuring provisions and non-recurring items increased by 14.6 per cent to FFr4.04bn.</p>

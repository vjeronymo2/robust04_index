			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Men in the News:'Brat pack' at the Bank - Ian Plenderleith and John Townend God and Demi-God is how one mischievous City economist refers to Ian Plenderleith and his sidekick, John Townend, the men in charge of the Bank of England's gilt-edged operations and the most powerful figures in the UK government bond market. Both have good reason to feel pleased. The Bank is well ahead of schedule in issuing gilts to finance the government's hefty borrowing requirement programme for this financial year, confounding those sceptics who thought the task almost impossible because of the huge amount of stock the market would have to digest. But, in the words of one City analyst, gilts have been 'selling like hot cakes' - just four and a half months into the financial year the Bank has covered nearly 60 per cent of this year's likely Pounds 50bn gap between government spending and revenues. The Bank has sold more than Pounds 1.5bn of government bonds to investors such as UK pension funds this week alone. While falling European interest rates and the lowest retail-price inflation in the UK for nearly 30 years have helped boost demand for gilts, Plenderleith and Townend have won plaudits from some in the City for their management of the record volume of gilt issues - though a few economists contend they have been selling the stock too cheaply. They have particularly close contacts with the 19 City groups which are registered gilt marketmakers acting as intermediaries between the Bank and investors. One broker says of the duo: 'They are very thorough, they cover all angles in incredible detail.' Another says they are 'good listeners'. Plenderleith and Townend work a few feet from each other in cramped adjoining offices filled with computer screens overlooking the Bank's inner courtyard. Plenderleith is the Bank's associate director in charge of markets, and Townend is head of its gilt-edged and money-market divisions. Aged 49 and 45, they joined the Bank within three years of each other in the 1960s and have worked together in markets jobs since 1985. Brought up in Birmingham and Liverpool, respectively, they were both educated at grammar schools. A significant element behind the rise of the duo has been the plain-speaking Eddie George, promoted to Bank governor on July 1 from deputy governor. George, the son of a postman in south London, has been at the Bank for 31 years and has retained a close influence over both Plenderleith and Townend. Both are members of the so-called 'Eddie brat pack', the youngish, down-to-earth Bank employees whom George supervised during his time in the Bank's market divisions in the 1980s. The governor is thought likely to promote Plenderleith to one of the four executive-director posts at the Bank when the position becomes vacant next February. Like George, both Plenderleith and Townend were born under the star sign of Virgo and exhibit the common characteristics of lack of garrulousness and addiction to hard work. According to US astrologer Linda Goodman, Virgos have perfectionist, 'tick-tock' minds and worry a lot. The description applies equally to both Plenderleith and Townend, whose jobs involve long periods of monitoring computer screens so they can pick the best market conditions to issue new types of government stock. Their working day starts with a meeting to assess market conditions at 8.30am in Plenderleith's room, which has old banknotes and bond issues framed on its wall. Plenderleith often discusses trading conditions via a special hot line to the Treasury, with which the Bank collaborates over gilt issues. 'He's an utter professional and has a poker player's fascination with trying to spot market trends before they become apparent to others,' says one former senior Bank employee. One broker says of Plenderleith: 'He regards the gilts market as his baby - he wants it to be the best.' Plenderleith - like George, a heavy smoker - rebuts suggestions that other European government bond markets could offer any significant lessons to the Bank. The senior of the two Bank men gives the impression of deliberating before answering questions from outsiders. The less cerebral Townend, a marathon runner, is more likely to give a spontaneous reply in conversation. Someone who has known them both for more than 20 years says: 'Ian speaks in paragraphs and gives it you straight. John talks in sentences and makes things more exciting.' Plenderleith is credited with making serious attempts to make gilts more attractive by, for instance, issuing longer-dated stock to meet the needs of pensions funds and insurance companies. But some critics believe the Bank has taken too long to adapt settlement procedures making it more convenient for international investors to trade gilts. Another suggestion is that the Bank should issue more low-yielding, shorter-dated stock rather than higher-yielding, longer-dated gilts, to reduce the size of the debt burden for future generations. 'It's a minor financial scandal that the Bank is issuing stock that will require very high interest payments in the future when inflation is expected to stay low,' says Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank. Plenderleith and Townend like to give the impression of viewing suggested improvements to the market seriously. But the Bank's cautious and unassuming deities both clearly feel that evolution should proceed at a relatively stately pace, whereas others feel the tempo could be quicker.</p>

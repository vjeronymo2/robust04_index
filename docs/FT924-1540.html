			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Suez to expand capital of two banking subsidiaries THE precarious state of the French property market has forced Suez, the industrial and financial group, to pump FFr2.36bn (Dollars 430m) of new capital into Indoseuz and Credisuez, two banking subsidiaries. Suez, which has extensive holdings across the French property sector, has already made provisions of FFr1.9bn on property losses. It is expected to make additional provisions for the second half, in addition to the recapitalisation which will inject FFr800m into Indosuez and FFr1.56bn into Credisuez. The announcement of Suez's refinancing comes when France's banks and insurers are awaiting the announcement of government proposals to support the property industry. The property market has experienced difficult problems for the past three years, particularly in Paris where average rentals have fallen by 20 per cent. The Paris market has not fared as badly as that of London or New York, but French financial groups have still suffered sharp falls in the value of their property holdings. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, recently estimated that the French banks' outstanding property loans were between FFr400bn and FFr500bn. Suez saw its interim net profits fall to FFr500m for the first half of 1992 from FFr1.8bn in the same period last year, mainly due to the large rise in property provisions. Indosuez alone raised its interim loan loss provisions to FFr1.39bn from FFr517m, triggering a slide in net profits to FFr82m from FFr517m. Banque La Henin, which is linked to Credisuez, barely broke even in the first half because of property problems. La Henin has already been restructured and will receive FFr560m of the capital Suez is injecting into Credisuez. The announcement of the recapitalisation comes when Suez is under pressure from Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurer, which is one of its largest shareholders, to cede control of Colonia, a German insurer. Suez recently broke off negotiations with UAP over Colonia. World Stock Markets, Page 35</p>

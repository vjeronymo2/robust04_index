			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Alenia in space project THE European Space Agency (ESA) signed a Ecu446m (Pounds 340m) contract yesterday with Alenia, Italy's state-controlled aerospace group, to head a group of companies to build a telecommunications satellite to be called Artemis, write Robert Graham in Rome and Daniel Green in London. The Italian government is covering 40 per cent of the costs of the project, which will produce a new generation of satellites to handle telecommunications traffic, especially cellular telephones. In return, Italian companies will get 48 per cent of the work. It will be Alenia's first non-Italian prime contractorship, placing it at the head of a group of Europe's best-known aerospace companies including Aerospatiale and Alcatel Espace of France, Fokker of the Netherlands, Matra-Marconi, the Anglo-French joint venture, and Casa of Spain. One of the reasons Alenia won the contract is that Italy was 'owed' some business to balance its Ecu500m contribution to the ESA budget.</p>

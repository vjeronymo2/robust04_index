			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb  presidential spokesman Jovan Zametica said on Saturday [14 May]  that the "Serb side accepts, unconditionally, the proposal for a  general cessation of hostilities contained in the joint  declaration" issued by seven states' foreign ministers in Geneva  on Friday. "This, after all, has been or own proposal for a  long time. But we are in favour of a permanent cessation of  hostilities, not merely for four months," stressed Zametica in a  statement faxed to TANJUG's Belgrade office from the cabinet of  Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic. "The time limit on the  cessation of hostilities envisaged in the joint declaration is  harmful to the peace process," maintains Zametica.    The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, Great  Britain, France and the European Union's "troika" (Belgium,  Greece, Germany) on Friday invited Bosnia's warring Moslems,  Serbs and Croats to agree to a four-month ceasefire, "with  provision for extenscon," in which to negotiate a solution to  their disputes.    The ministers, who coordinated a common strategy in the  efforts to end the Bosnian conflict, invited the warring nations  to make a serious effort, without prior conditions, for reaching  a political settlement of the crisis. The ministers approved  the European Union's formula which envisages for dividing  war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina in a manner which would give  the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the original territory in  which to form their federation, and the Serbs the remaining 49  percent.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / OFT acts against timeshare group: Watchdog has received a 'stream' of complaints THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday revoked the consumer credit licences of six companies associated with Club Riviera, one of the UK's leading timeshare groups. This is the first time the OFT has taken such action against a timeshare company. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said: 'We have received and continue to receive a stream of complaints against some of these companies which suggest that their conduct has been seriously misleading and deceptive.' He added that the complaints included 'allegations that the companies have induced customers to purchase timeshare accommodation by making false or misleading statements'. Club Riviera and the other five companies were told three weeks ago they might lose their licences and were invited to make their case. Sir Bryan said no representations had been made. Three of the companies, Club Riviera (UK), Club Tenerife Sales and Regency Palms Sales, are subsidiaries of the Manchester-based Riviera group. The companies specialise in selling timeshare properties in Spain and the Canary Islands. The Riviera group has management contracts with the three other companies involved in the OFT decision - Ryefix, Canary Islands Holiday Club and Marbella Beach Club - which are registered in the Isle of Man. The effect of the OFT move is to bar the companies from either offering credit themselves (to finance sales) or acting as a broker for other companies to do so. Last September, Club Riviera was convicted by Staffordshire magistrates on charges of making false advertising statements. Mr Simon Clarke, director of Club Riviera, said yesterday that his company had no intention of appealing against the OFT's verdict. 'The action of the OFT today is solely aimed at preventing finance to purchasers,' he said. 'We don't provide finance, we haven't for a long time and we have no intention of providing finance in the future. For those reasons we have decided not to make representations.' He added that 'in no way whatsoever' would it affect his business; he expected to gain about 6,000 more timeshare customers this year. Mr Clarke rejected the idea that the OFT ruling cast a stigma over both his business and the timeshare industry generally. He said: 'We don't see it like that. Being in the timeshare industry alone is as bad as you can get as far as company credibility can go. In terms of public awareness, you don't have good timeshares and bad timeshares, you just have timeshares.' Later this year the Timeshare Act is due to come into force in the UK. It will provide a mandatory 14-day 'cooling-off' period before the final completion of timeshare purchases. The European Commission is also considering a directive on regulation of timeshare. The group has the right to appeal to the trade and industry secretary within 28 days, or the OFT's judgment will stand.</p>

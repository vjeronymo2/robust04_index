			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MCI Tells of 900 Service Rules: The nation's second-largest long-distance  company announced guidelines designed to help protect customers from misleading  or fraudulent services on 900-telephone numbers, which it plans to start  offering nationwide on Jan. 1. The company said the consumer safeguards will  include a $4 cap on each call to child-oriented 900 services; pre-screening of  programs and advertising and a requirement that adult services be placed on a  single prefix, when available, to facilitate blocking requests by customers.  </P></p>

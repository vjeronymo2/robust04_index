The first specialized law to  safeguard state security since the founding of the People's  Republic of China, it provides a strong legal guarantee and a  powerful weapon in the struggle to effectively prevent and check  acts which harm state security, to safeguard state security, to  defend the political power of the people's democratic  dictatorship and the socialist system, and to defend and promote  reform, opening to the outside world, and the socialist  modernization drive. The law marks an important point in the  bid to develop socialist democracy and improve the Chinese legal  system, especially the state security legal system.    In the year since the law was promulgated for  implementation,  state security organs in Tibet, under the leadership of party  committees, people's congresses, and governments at all levels,  and supported and coordinated by procuratorial and judicial  departments, press units, and other departments dealing with  foreigners, have done a great deal of work in studying,  publicizing, and implementing the law, thus achieving some  results. First, attention has been given to organizing study of  the law and adherence to it by state security police. In  accordance with the plan drawn up by the State Security  Department Party Committee, all police officers, on the basis of  studying, discussing, and memorizing the legal provisions  themselves, have sponsored classes over five terms to teach the  "State Security Law." This law has also been incorporated with  other training courses as part of the compulsory curriculum.  Fairly good results have been obtained from providing  rotational training for 90 percent of police officers in Tibet,  and from providing memorization tests for police officers of  departmental organs and prefectural and municipal state security  departments and bureaus. Second, we have seized the opportunity  to publicize and educate cadres of party and government organs,  foreign affairs departments, and various enterprises and  establishments about the "State Security Law." Over the past  year, state security organs in Tibet have distributed more than  2,000 wall charts and more than 20,000 booklets on the law --  some printed in both the Tibetan and Chinese languages -- to  various units, departments, prefectures, cities, counties,  townships, and villages. Meanwhile, departmental leaders and  leading comrades and law officers at all prefectural and  municipal state security organs have sponsored more than 10  lectures on the law for more than 2,000 leading cadres and  professionals working at various foreign affairs units and in  prefectural, municipal, and county organs. Third, the  initiative has been taken to get the support and coordination of  press units, and public opinion has been exploited in vigorously  publicizing the "State Security Law." The regional state  security department, various areas, and city state security  organs have universally used propaganda tools such as radios,  televisions, and newspapers to publicize the law. City leaders  have been invited to make televised speeches and answer  questions by reporters. Television stations have broadcast  serial dramas; articles have been published in local newspapers.  The autonomous regional state security department has published  more than 10 articles in XIZANG RIBAO and XIZANG FAZHI BAO, each  of which has publicized the "State Security Law." XIZANG RIBAO  has also achieved good results through sponsorship of a  competition on knowledge of the law. Fourth, enforce the law  with specific targets in mind and intensify propaganda and  education among specific individuals and units. A few leaders  or functionaries at some units handling external relations have,  instead of providing support and assistance to state security  work, gone so far as to create obstructions. State security  organs have educated them on the provisions of the state  security law and these efforts produced immediate results.    After a year of study, publicity, and implementation of the  "State Security Law," law-enforcement skills among state  security cadres and police has improved to some extent.  Awareness of state security has increased among leaders at all  levels, among cadres and workers of relevant departments, and  among the general population throughout the region. Many people  believe that implementation of the "State Security Law" is not  merely a matter of state security; rather, it involves every  citizen and organization -- "everyone is responsible for the  security of the state." Some units have taken the initiative in  providing support and coordination for law enforcement by state  security departments. We must, however, be soberly aware that  dissemination of the "State Security Law" has not been carried  out evenly throughout the region. In areas that have not  established state security organs, dissemination has been  carried out on only a very limited scale. In particular, many  cadres and people in rural and frontier regions have never heard  of the "State Security Law" or have only just begun to  understand its provisions. State security organs need to  upgrade their law- enforcement skills and cadres and police in  such organs need to enhance their awareness of their exercise of  powers according to law. Supplementary rules and regulations  for the implementation of the "State Security Law" need to be  formulated or amplified. A handful of units and individuals  have continued to disregard provisions of the "State Security  Law." Lacking awareness of state security, they refuse to  provide support or cooperation for state security work and go so  far as to obstruct functionaries of state security organs from  executing their official duties. Some refuse to provide  information and some do not cooperate with state security organs  in investigations, thereby severely impeding state security  work. All these problems need to be solved with further efforts  to study, publicize, and implement the "State Security Law."    The current international situation has provided our region  with a favorable opportunity to promote reform, opening up, and  the modernization drive. Blessed with economic growth,  political stability, national unity, and social progress, Tibet  is a scene of dynamism. We must, however, also be soberly aware  that, in spite of this excellent situation, peace does not reign  throughout the world. Some hostile forces outside have never  ceased activities which jeopardize China's state security. They  seek to obtain China's political, economic, scientific, and  military secrets and they are trying to carry out infiltration,  splittist activities, and sabotage one way or another. A  handful of extremely anti-socialist elements at home have joined  with hostile forces from outside to intensify their efforts to  sabotage the security and interests of the state. Because China  has been at peace for so long, many are not vigilant about these  sabotage efforts that jeopardize state security. Some even turn  a blind eye -- or confuse right with wrong -- when it comes to  sabotage activities carried out by spy agencies and hostile  forces from outside, as well as splittist forces inside and  outside the national boundaries. A handful of people, recruited  by hostile forces from outside, are engaged in criminal  activities to disrupt state security. In order to create a  stable environment for reform, opening up, and economic  construction; to advance state security work in such a way that  it is subject to, and serves more effectively, the party's basic  line and gives full play to its function as part of the people's  democratic dictatorship on the covert front; and in the face of  this acute, complex, and grim struggle, we must make the "State  Security Law" an essential part of the second "five-year plan,"  disseminating knowledge of the law and conducting a region-wide  study, dissemination, and implementation of the "State Security  Law" in a thorough and sustained manner.    Formulating the "State Security Law" was a formidable  undertaking; studying, disseminating, and implementing it will  prove to be more challenging. A precondition for strict  enforcement of the "State Security Law" law is that it be  studied and mastered. This is a mandatory task for specialized  organs at all levels; it is also something every citizen and  organization should do. State security organs, party and  government departments at all levels, mass organizations,  enterprises and establishments in the region must educate and  guide the vast ranks of cadres to study the "State Security Law"  so that they clearly understand what sort of criminal act  jeopardizes state security; they know a citizen's duty and right  to safeguard state security; they keep firmly in mind the idea  that "everyone is responsible for the security of the state";  they learn how to utilize the law as a weapon in fighting  criminal activity that jeopardizes state security; and they  conscientiously safeguard the safety, honor, and interests of  the motherland. State security organs must strictly abide by  the law in their law-enforcement activity. They should protect  the citizens or organizations that have offered support and  assistance to state security work; commend and reward those who  have made major contributions; investigate to determine the  culpability of those who have refused to fulfill their duty or  obstructed state security work; and crack down hard on criminal  activity that harms the security and interests of the state so  that they efficiently ensure that the building of socialism with  Chinese characteristics progresses smoothly in our region.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC ENTERPRISES CHANGES VOTING; CANDIDATE BLOCKED  </P> <P> Shareholders of Pacific Enterprises voted Thursday to change the way they elect  directors, virtually dooming any chance a maverick shareholder and union  representative might have of succeeding in his second run at the board of the  Los Angeles company, which owns Southern California Gas and Thrifty Corp.  </P> <P> At a special shareholders meeting marked by sharp exchanges, nearly 70% of the  company's outstanding common and preferred shares were voted to abolish  cumulative voting, a system under which a small group of stockholders can  gang-vote their shares for one candidate and greatly improve the chances of  electing him or her to the board of directors. Nearly 49.2 million shares, or  89% of the shares that were voted, supported the change.  </P> <P> Union representative Sam Weinstein, who nearly made it to Pacific Enterprises'  board last year with the help of cumulative voting, said he hasn't given up.  </P> <P> As allowed by a new state law, Pacific Enterprises proposed switching to the  more conventional system of majority voting, under which the holder of each  share may vote for one candidate for each of the 15 seats on the board. Under  cumulative voting, a shareholder could cast all 15 votes for one candidate,  which Pacific Enterprises argued could result in the election of a director  representing a special interest group or could make the company more vulnerable  to a hostile takeover.  </P> <P> "What are you afraid of?" one union member asked Pacific Enterprises Chairman  James R. Ukropina during the meeting.  </P> <P> "I have to stop shaking in my boots before I make this comment," Ukropina  replied. "This is not a matter involving one person," he continued. "Our  concern is not about a particular party but a particular principle.  </P> <P> "We are afraid that if you have a person in the board room that represents a  certain group of shareholders," then that person won't represent all  shareholders as required by law, Ukropina said.  </P> <P> Weinstein, who based his 1989 campaign on the contention that Pacific  Enterprises' diversification had caused the company's stock price to drop,  accused the board of "insulating itself from shareholder pressures."  </P> <P> Weinstein, Western regional director of the Utility Workers of America union,  said after Thursday's meeting that he and his supporters are studying ways to  reinstate cumulative voting so that they can elect a union representative to  the board. However, Weinstein said he is not sure whether he will run for the  board again at the company's annual meeting in May.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAIL DOUBLE-BUNK PLAN HAS HITCH: NO GUARDS  </P> <P> Now that Orange County finally has approval from the state to bunk two inmates  instead of one in each cell of a new jail facility in Santa Ana, officials say  they don't have the money for additional guards needed to watch the extra  prisoners.  </P> <P> The situation has created a paradox in which more than 200 jail beds -- ready  to be filled -- will remain empty even though officials say overcrowding  continues to force the release of more than a hundred suspected or convicted  criminals a day who would otherwise be incarcerated.  </P> <P> "We can ask the sheriff to take it out of his hide," Board of Supervisors  Chairman Thomas F. Riley joked out of frustration. "It just does something to  you when you have these people who have been found guilty of crimes and you  can't keep them in jail because you don't have the (guards) the state says you  have to have."  </P> <P> Adding a second bunk to newly constructed jail cells is normally a violation of  state Board of Corrections regulations. But last week the board voted to help  relieve Orange County's serious jail overcrowding problem by not penalizing the  county for so-called "double bunking" in 216 of the 384 cells at the new  Intake-Release Center in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> At the Board of Corrections meeting in Sacramento, Orange County Sheriff's  Department officials said they would need 14 more deputies to guard the extra  prisoners. So the board made the added deputies a condition of its approval.  </P> <P> But now, Associate County Administrative Officer John Sibley said, officials  are studying whether they could safely staff the Intake-Release Center,  double-bunked, with fewer added guards.  </P> <P> Norma Lammers, executive director of the Board of Corrections, said that that  could be a violation of the board's order and that it might expose the county  to sanctions.  </P> <P> But there is an odd aspect to the state's regulations: The Board of Corrections  only has authority to penalize a county while the jail in question is under  construction. Technically, the construction contract for the Intake-Release  Center expires in April, even though it has been open since early last year.  </P> <P> "In actuality, they (county officials) can go ahead and wait until the end of  the contract and our orders go back to being advisory," Lammers said.  </P> <P> Sibley said county officials are considering just that. "I would agree that  that is an option," he said. "I would not call it a strategy."  </P> <P> Assistant Sheriff Jerry Krans, who made the recommendation for 14 new deputies,  said he has not studied whether the Santa Ana facility could be safely staffed  with fewer guards. If the 14 guards are not hired, he said, it is possible that  the Sheriff's Department would only fill some of the extra bunks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Concerns Expressed  </P> <P> "We are not going to do anything that sacrifices safety," he said.  </P> <P> Robert McLeod, general manager of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs,  said he has not heard deputies express any safety concerns about the proposed  double bunking.  </P> <P> But the Board of Corrections has heard a complaint from Dick Herman, a  volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. Herman has  previously sued the county over jail conditions.  </P> <P> "Double bunking 'on the cheap' will necessarily lead to prisoner-to-prisoner  violence which single cells were intended to eliminate," Herman wrote in a  letter to the state board. "The increase in assaults, homosexual rape, death  and disease which stems from double bunking requires significantly more staff  and facilities than a single cell jail."  </P> <P> The county's existing maximum-security jail, next to the new Intake-Release  Center, already has double bunking.  </P> <P> Lammers said the state's requirement for single cells is intended to protect  vulnerable inmates -- such as young or mentally disturbed people -- from the  prison population and to isolate inmates known to be excessively violent.  </P> <P> Orange County has had a seriously overcrowded jail system for more than 10  years. The Board of Corrections has rated its capacity at about 3,000 inmates,  but it now houses more than 4,000 on any given day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Least Dangerous' Released  </P> <P> In addition, Krans said that last year 43,675 suspected or convicted criminals  were either turned away from the jail or given an early release to ease the  overcrowding. Those who were turned away were mostly charged with misdemeanor  crimes, he said. Some who were released before completing their complete  sentences, however, were convicted of felonies.  </P> <P> Krans said the department attempts to release the "least dangerous" criminals.  But he added that some have been arrested for new crimes that they wouldn't  have been able to commit had they remained in jail.  </P> <P> In addition to the 14 requested deputies, sheriff's officials told the Board of  Corrections that they would need 16 more clerical staff workers to process the  additional inmates. The total annual cost for those new positions was estimated  at $1.65 million.  </P> <P> Just last month, however, Orange County was facing a $23-million budget  shortfall that had threatened the jobs of more than 1,200 county employees.  County officials managed to avert the layoffs and balance the budget with  several belt-tightening measures and new funds from the state. But the budget  remains very tight for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends June 30.  </P> <P> Sibley said county officials are checking for money they could use to pay for  additional deputies. But he said no funds have been identified.  </P> <P> "We've got options," he said. "We've just got to figure out what we're going to  do."  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention - Currencies Following last Friday's inconclusive US employment report, the market will this week focus on US inflation, retail sales and industrial production data to get a sense of when the Fed will next raise interest rates. With US three month money trading at about 5.62 per cent, compared to a Fed funds rate presently of 4.75 per cent, the market clearly believes it is a question of when, rather than if, rates next rise. Most observers believe that early Fed action is required to stabilise the US bond market. Without this, there seems little chance of a recovery in the dollar, given the close link between bonds and the dollar in recent months. The outlook against the yen, however, is more encouraging. The dollar finished on Friday above Y100 for the first time in five weeks. It was the beneficiary of the recent US-Japan trade agreement, and renewed tensions surrounding Iraq, which could hurt the yen. Technical analysis suggests the dollar may have broken upwards against the yen, and recent price behaviour confirms that the market may be trying to take the dollar higher. Traders will also be forced this week to don their political hats. Both German national elections and the Finnish referendum on joining the EU take place on Sunday. If Chancellor Kohl is re-elected with a workable coalition, this should support the D-Mark. Anything less, and the D-Mark will be vulnerable, with the Swiss franc, and possibly sterling, likely to benefit. The Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday is not expected to produce a move in rates, though the IG Metall pay claim could hasten the next tightening if it threatens the inflation outlook. A referendum victory in Finland would probably buoy all Nordic currencies, though they remain vulnerable to setbacks until the Swedish and Norwegian EU votes, next month, are also out of the way. Elsewhere, sentiment toward the Italian lira is likely to remain nervous while the standoff between the government and the Milan magistrates persists.</p>

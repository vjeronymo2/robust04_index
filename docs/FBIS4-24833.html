			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>   [Text] Taiwan's Vice-Premier Hsu Li-teh described a recent  British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee's  report as encouraging, saying it was a new development in  British policy towards the island republic.    The report, issued in mid-April, urges the British  government  to strengthen ties with Taipei, Beijing's rival, in a move  described by some observers as playing the Taiwan card.    In a meeting with a visiting delegation of Hong Kong media  executives, Mr Hsu said Taipei's reaction to the British  parliament report was positive. But, according to him, the  Executive Yuan, Taiwan's cabinet, has yet to study the thick  document.    "The report indicated something new in British foreign  policy  towards the Republic of China," Mr Hsu said.    China reacted furiously to the House of Commons 110-page  report on China including Hong Kong and Taiwan, criticising it  as an "infringement" of its internal affairs.    The vice-premier dismissed suggestions that Britain was  playing the Taiwan card to improve its position in dealing with  China over thorny Hong Kong issues.    Mr Hsu said Taiwan was eager to strengthen ties with all the  western nations including Britain but relations between the  island republic and the United Kingdom have not been smooth in  years.    He said one of the major targets of Taiwan's diplomatic  strategy was to fight for larger international space and  increased communications and exchanges with the world community.  However, the vice premier said Taiwan's relations with the  British could be influenced by two crucial factors -- the  relationship between the two rivals across the Taiwan straits  and that between Beijing and London.    He said Taiwan's foreign policy was not hostile towards the  mainland communist regime. Rather, it was aimed at ensuring the  survival and development of the island.    "We have no desire to produce a foreign policy that is  hostile towards the mainland and what we are exploring in the  process of policy-making is to seek survival and development for  the island," he said. The senior ruling Kuomintang party  official said he was optimistic about the prospect of  reunification with mainland China and he himself was ready to  return to and live on the mainland once the dream of  reunification was realised.    "I am very optimistic about the prospect because changes  have  been going on rapidly," he said.    Mr Hsu said he would like to be a mainlander rather than a  Taiwanese.    Among the preconditions for reunification are the narrowing  of living standards, lifestyles, ideology and social systems.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- General George A. Joulwan, NATO  supreme allied commander Europe, backs a diplomatic solution for  solving the Bosnia crisis. In any case, it is up to the United  Nations and not NATO to decide on procedures and actions in the  Balkans, the U.S. four-star general told BERLINER MORGENPOST.    Joulwan rejected the view that NATO is doing too little in  Bosnia. After all, the alliance is monitoring the flight ban  over Bosnia as well as deploying ships to ensure an effective  embargo imposed on rump Yugoslavia. In addition, NATO has  16,000 troops in Bosnia under U.N. command.</p>

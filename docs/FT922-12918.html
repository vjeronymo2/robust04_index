			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The fact that February's data on UK production appeared only yesterday is a vexing reminder of how long the market will have to wait for the official picture of the economy's response to the Budget and the election. But the figures confirm the general impression that recovery was stirring in any case. Manufacturing output in February was up more than 1 per cent on January, while production of consumer goods was actually higher than a year ago. In keeping with that was the fact that the rate of producer price inflation in March crept up slightly from the month before, thus confirming the mildly disappointing figure for retail price inflation last Friday. It may be that headline inflation will rise modestly from this point, as poll tax distortions work their way through. In such circumstances the new government must be seen to pursue a tight monetary policy if it is not to raise the cost of its already formidable borrowing requirement by reviving inflationary fears in the gilt market. With the local elections coming up next month, there may well be a temptation to bring forward a vote-catching cut in base rates. Wider strategy suggests the temptation should be resisted.</p>

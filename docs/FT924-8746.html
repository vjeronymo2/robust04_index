			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Greece spends Pounds 140m on three Dutch frigates THE Greek Defence Ministry yesterday signed a contract to buy three second-hand frigates from the Netherlands navy for a total of Fl 380m (Pounds 140m), with delivery due by 1995. The purchase is part of a Pounds 1bn modernisation programme for the Greek navy, which calls for adding 12 frigates to a fleet currently based on destroyers and fast patrol craft, equipped with missiles. Greece will pay cash for the Kortenaer class frigates, built in the early 1980s. But payment will be spread over eight years, with annual instalments starting at Fl 20m and rising to Fl 90m in 1995. The frigates will be equipped with Sea Sparrow surface-to- air missiles, Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles, anti-submarine systems and a helicopter pad. Mr Ioannis Stathopoulos, the Greek defence under-secretary, said yesterday the deal would help modernise the Greek fleet, which was 'necessary in order to avert war and lay the foundations for peace in the region.' The frigate deal was preceded by the delivery of 170 Leopard tanks, handed over by the Netherlands to Greece under the so-called 'cascade' redistribution of older Nato weaponry from western Europe. Greece has also agreed to buy 177 armoured personnel carriers from the Netherlands, at a reduced price. Greece already has two Kortenaer class frigates, which took part in the Gulf war, patrolling in the Red Sea. Earlier this year, the Greek navy took delivery of two Knox-class frigates from the US, transferred free of charge under a bilateral military aid programme. Another US frigate will be given to Greece in 1993. Meanwhile, Greece has received the first of four Meko-class frigates ordered in 1987 from Germany at a total cost of Pounds 800m. The other three are being built under licence at a state-owned Greek shipyard.</p>

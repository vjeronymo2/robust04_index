			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Place for plastics - A European consortium hopes to overcome the high costs of recycling Amid the mass of pipes and chimneys at British Petroleum's giant refinery at Grangemouth near Edinburgh, the small assembly of silvery tubes standing by the roadside looks insignificant. But the 20ft-high mini-plant could have important repercussions for the petrochemicals industry. The plant is an experiment by several leading European petrochemical companies to address one of the most difficult issues facing their business: plastic recycling. With public and legal pressure building up to re-use more of the plastic that seems to go needlessly to waste, the industry is anxious to be seen to be seeking solutions. But it is not an easy task because, as Michael Buzzacott, chief executive of BP's polymers and olefins division, says: 'Plastic recycling is fundamentally uneconomic.' Waste plastic can be used in several ways. It can be burnt as a fuel for power generation, it can be melted down to make new plastic products (a process known as mechanical recycling), or it can be taken a stage further and reduced to petrochemical feedstock - the raw material for plastic-making. But most of it currently ends up being incinerated or buried in landfill. According to APME, the association of European plastics makers, only a quarter of plastic is recoverable because the rest is too dirty, too small or, like plastic film, too flimsy to be handled. Even this figure creates a false impression because two-thirds of recovered plastics are burnt for power generation - a fate widely considered to be unacceptable - and only one-third (or 7 per cent of total plastic) is recycled into new products. In the UK, the figure is even lower: 5 per cent, according to a new survey by Mintel, the market research organisation. Part of the problem is technical: mechanical recycling is difficult because plastics have to be sorted into their different types, and the plastic that emerges is second rate. The difficulty of collecting, cleaning and sorting plastics also adds vastly to the costs. In Germany, where tough packaging laws have pushed the process furthest in Europe, the cost of recycling plastic is put at DM3,000 (Pounds 1,250) a tonne, or twice the cost of virgin plastic. 'If we have to pay such a high fee for plastics, then the competitiveness of this product is in danger,' says Johannes Brandrup of VKE, the German plastics trade group. A proposed EU directive would require the industry to recycle 15 per cent of plastic, or twice the current amount. APME estimates that mechanical recycling will only be able to contribute half of this, so other means, notably feedstock recycling, will have to be developed to handle the rest. The Germans are currently leaders in this technology. Both VEBA and BASF have substantial plants capable of recycling 55,000 tonnes a year. But chemical companies in other countries are concerned about German dominance, and five of them linked up to sponsor the Grangemouth feedstock recycling experiment in order to promote an alternative. They are BP, DSM of the Netherlands, Elf Atochem of France, Enichem of Italy and Fina of Belgium. Their Pounds 4m project was launched last year and is due to bear fruit at the end of this year with the completion of the 750-tonne a year pilot project. The plant accepts mixed plastics ground into pieces a maximum of 2cm across and passes them over hot sand which converts them into a gas. This is distilled back into plastic feedstock and comes out in two forms, one looking like wax and the other like olive oil. This can be fed back into the petrochemical plant to make fresh plastic. One difference between the Grangemouth plant and the German process is that it could be replicated at many small plants rather than a few big ones. These plants, with capacity of 25,000 tonnes a year, would be located at chemical works or even beside municipal waste tips, which should reduce the costs of collection compared with the centralised German system. They would also manufacture their own energy and be self-sustaining. But although engineers at Grangemouth are pleased with the technical performance of their plant, the economics of plastics recycling remain a formidable obstacle, mainly because of the collection and sorting costs which account for two-thirds of the total. According to Christian Troussier, chairman of the consortium, the most economic way of using waste plastic is to burn it as a fuel, but this is widely viewed as wasteful. The least economic way is mechanical recycling, although that tends to be the most popular with the public. Feedstock recycling, he says, fits somewhere in the middle. It is not as expensive as mechanical recycling, and it has public acceptability. To make it work, he believes that up to two-thirds of the cost would have to be covered by a 'service fee' - in other words people would have to pay to have their plastic recycled, either voluntarily or through a levy. Buzzacott says: 'The limit on how far we go will depend on the green conscience of Europe. But in the end, the consumer or the taxpayer will have to pay.' This view is disputed, however, by the environmental lobby which accuses the plastics industry of deliberately exaggerating the cost of plastic recycling in order to obstruct regulatory moves. The industry could do much more, it argues, to reduce collection costs. Some environmentalists say that manufacturers of plastics containers should go further and design their products so that they are more readily re-usable, doing away with recycling altogether. The plastics industry feels, though, that the debate about recycling ignores some key aspects. For example, only 4 per cent of crude oil is turned into plastics. The rest is burnt as fuel. So if people are concerned about wasting a non-renewable resource, they would do better to curb the use of petrol. Moreover, greater use of plastics can itself save energy. Dieter Burkle of Elf Atochem says that 100kg of plastic can replace 200-300kg of metal in a car. This weight reduction should save 750 litres of petrol over the lifetime of the car, which is a significant contribution to conserving resources.</p>

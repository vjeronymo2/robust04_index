Khayme, Perm Scientific Research  Institute for Engineering Seismology (PNIIIS); UDC 551.24+550.34  (471.503, 471, 505]    [Abstract] At the PNIIIS experience has long been  accumulated on carrying out many-sided  (geological-geomorphological, geophysical and geodetic) research  for detecting and predicting dangerous tectonic displacements at  construction sites. Specifically, such materials were collected  for the site of the South Ural nuclear power plant (NPP). The  scope of this research program and the procedures used in the  collection of pertinent materials are described in detail. The  research program revealed that the Ural plant, which is under  construction, is located in an area with favorable geological  conditions and there are no contraindications with respect to  recent tectonic movements against continuing construction  because its site is situated within the limits of a unified  morphostructural block. Moreover, the fault structures  intersecting this construction site and the foundations beneath  the reactors have not been rejuvenated during about the last 30  million years by local ruptures and zones of increased  fracturing. The research program carried for this site is  particularly important because it can serve as a model for other  NPP sites where dangerous conditions may exist which should be  detected before construction is initiated. It represents a  considerable improvement over previous engineering programs used  during study of NPP construction sites. Figures 6; references  24: 23 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

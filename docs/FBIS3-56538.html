The head of the Belarusian Parliament thanked the U.S.  President for his great personal contribution to the protection  of human rights and highly assessed the Partnership for Peace  cooperation program proposed by Bill Clinton.    Speaking about the situation in the republic, Stanislav  Shushkevich said he is advocating a democratic development of  the state, early elections of supreme legislative bodies, and  economic reforms. He expressed hope that the new constitution  -- the Supreme Soviet is to consider it at its current session  -- will assist in this.    Bill Clinton, in his turn, said the United States wants to  support democratic processes which are under way in the Republic  of Belarus, and is ready to provide technical aid in holding  early elections. Bill Clinton said the United States is  allocating an additional $25 million in order to implement the  process of withdrawing the strategic nuclear forces from  Belarusian territory. He also said that an American business  center will be opened in Minsk, possibly in the next two months.    The Treaty on Encouragement and Mutual Protection of  Investments between the Republic of Belarus and the United  States, signed today by Stanislav Shushkevich and Bill Clinton,  will help to develop economic cooperation between the two  countries.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: OIS Intl progress at midway OIS International Inspection, the technical inspection services group, returned profits of Pounds 1.44m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 24.2m for the six months ended June 30. No directly comparative figures were available. The company came to market at the tail end of last year and for the 12 months to end-December reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.74m, some 10 per cent ahead of the prospectus forecast. Turnover totalled Pounds 46.8m. Directors said the half year performance reflected the holding of margins in a competitive environment, reduced interest charges and the elimination of losses from discontinued activities. The group's UK operations, based at Aberdeen and Stockton, performed 'well ahead of expectations'. A maiden interim dividend of 0.7p is being paid from full diluted earnings of 3.2p. The shares closed 3p higher at 77p.</p>

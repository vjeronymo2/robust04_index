			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GEORGE SCOTT; BUSH'S NAVIGATOR IN WORLD WAR II  </P> <P> George A. Scott, a radar and Navy communications pioneer who served as a  navigator for pilot George Bush during World War II, has died. He was 82.  </P> <P> Scott, who died Sunday at Grossmont District Hospital in La Mesa in San Diego  County, joined the Navy in 1925 and quickly proved adept in electronics. The  Navy loaned Scott's services to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to  teach radar and associated concepts.  </P> <P> He later signed on for submarine service and remained in that area for 10 years  before World War II. Scott and a friend developed a method of communication  between submarines and surface ships during that time. The Navy later perfected  the sub-to-ship concept and Scott was transferred to communications.  </P> <P> One of his most memorable assignments was as navigator and gunner on a torpedo  bomber piloted by now-President Bush, said Scott's wife, Frances.  </P> <P> At the end of the war, Scott was assigned to San Diego to supervise the  construction of Navy communication towers. He was discharged in 1955 with the  rank of lieutenant and immediately began working for the government on  developing a two-man submarine.  </P> <P> A few months later, he went to work for General Dynamics Astronautics, where he  was assigned to the Atlas Missile Project. He retired in 1961.  </P> <P> Besides his wife of 60 years, survivors include their son, John W. Scott, of  Merced, Calif.  </P></p>

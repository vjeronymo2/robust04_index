			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "Russian Radar Station Will </F> Probably Continue Operating in Latvia for Another Few Years"]    [Text] Riga -- The latest round of interstate talks  between the Latvian and Russian delegations has finished in  Riga. Latvian observers are acknowledging that "some progress"  has been made.    The main document concerning the withdrawal of Russian  troops  from Latvian territory has basically been prepared over more  than two years of work by diplomats and military specialists.  Until recently the stumbling block remained the Russian  military installation in the Latvian settlement of Skrunda -- a  radar station which forms part of the overall missile early  warning system.    Skrunda has been the central issue at three rounds of  interstate talks. On this occasion, it seems, the two sides  were able to reach a definite compromise. I am couching this  affirmation in deliberately loose wording: It is clear that  both sides could still make some adjustment to their positions.  Thus, for example, coordinating the time frame for operating  and dismantling the station will be a complex task, since Latvia  is saying three years plus one, whereas Russia is insisting on a  total of five years.    The talks took place against the background of an incident  that made the work more difficult and which occurred 10 January  in Riga, when two Russian generals were arrested. On 12 January  the head of the Russian delegation, Special Envoy Sergey Zotov,  told your IZVESTIYA correspondent that he thought it would be  possible to resume the talks that had been broken off once the  servicemen had been released, once the blockade of Russian  installations had been lifted, and once the Latvian leadership  had submitted an official apology. Envoy Zotov regards these  events as a possible rehearsal for the seizure of Russian  civilian installations, and for this reason the delegation  stressed once again that the radar at Skrunda can only be used  for military purposes. Deputy Foreign Minister Martins Virsis,  head of the Latvian delegation, said that the Latvian view was  as follows: The radar at Skrunda is a military establishment  under civilian control. In any case, Virsis stressed, the  station will not be given the status of a military base.</p>

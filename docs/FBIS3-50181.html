His schedule  included, among other things, a meeting with the command  personnel of the Officers' Higher School of Mechanized Military  Units in Czajkowskiego Street. General Koziej promoted his  latest book entitled The Theory of the Military Art  [Teoria sztuki wojennej]. After the meeting, he held a brief  press conference, during which reporters fired a volley of  questions at him.    [Question] Following the NATO summit in Brussels, certain  circles in Poland have come to believe that the decisions made  at the summit have reinforced the situation whereby we are kept  in a certain state of vacuum, in military isolation. Are there  reasons for us to be afraid?    [Koziej] The state of anxious concern is to a certain extent  justified by our sense of finding ourselves in a "gray security  zone." However, I would certainly be disinclined to dramatize  this situation and to react to it nervously. From the viewpoint  of Polish interests, the concept of "Partnership for Peace"  defines the limits of what we can now realistically attain.  However, we must not forget that, as a result of a concentrated  diplomatic campaign conducted, among others, by President Lech  Walesa and [Foreign] Minister Olechowski, the general formula  for the partnership has acquired a tangible content. For  example, we know that by following that path we will eventually  come to NATO. I believe that much will still depend on our  taking our own initiative. Poland should press for the signing  of a specific agreement with NATO that would take into account  the timetable of activities that can bring us closer to a  rapprochement with the Atlantic Treaty. However, it must not be  a register of wishful thinking on our part, but a cool political  and economic calculation.    [Question] How would our rapprochement with NATO look from  the purely military perspective?    [Koziej] The West has been putting out certain signals and  directions. To begin with, it should involve participation by  the Polish armed forces in joint exercises and maneuvers in  order to achieve a degree of perfection in cooperation at  headquarters level and in joint operations. In addition, our  armed forces should take part in peace missions alongside NATO  forces' soldiers. I believe that these are good ways of  achieving mutual adjustment of our respective military  structures. I will not deny that the greatest problem will be  posed by our need to adjust to the high technology applied in  NATO command, communications, and reconnaissance systems. On  the other hand, we have nothing to be ashamed of when we compare  the levels of theoretical and practical knowledge at the command  of our officers' cadres, or the training of our soldiers.    [Question] But are we prepared for the possibility that,  despite all the declarations and promises, the entrance door to  NATO will, in the end, be slammed shut against us--in our faces,  so to speak?    [Koziej] I do not share such fears. After all, certain  changes and transformations are bound to take place even within  the Atlantic Treaty itself. Even today, that structure is not  altogether capable of coping successfully with all the tasks  that the present day requirements place before it. I believe  that, over the next few years, we will undergo an inevitable  evolution of the entire system of European security. It is not  outside the bounds of possibility that it will eventually become  NATO's policy to accept all willing partners into the ranks of  its self-reforming structure.    [Question] Including Russia and Ukraine?    [Koziej] Time will tell. Let me reiterate that, in my  opinion, a joint security system will eventually evolve in  Europe on the basis of NATO, and that the West will constitute  its nucleus and its guarantor.    [Question] General, could Poland be threatened by a military  conflict likely to develop in Central Europe?    [Koziej] We could be tempted into all manner of theoretical  musings on that subject. For example, the Americans recently  considered the possibility of a major invasion threatening  Poland from the East and concluded that, in such an eventuality,  we would be utterly defeated--a conclusion that is not  particularly surprising when we consider the existing ratio of  forces. Personally, I believe that we will not be seriously  threatened with a direct and total military invasion from the  East within a foreseeable future. I would rather perceive a  real threat for Poland in the possibility of local conflicts  erupting in the vicinity of our state borders--for example, if  uncontrollable nationalistic feelings come to a head in  Slovakia, Ukraine, or Russia. It would be relatively easy then  for "offshoots" of those disturbances to penetrate our own  territories.    [Question] What is the current military potential of our own  250,000-strong armed forces?    [Koziej] We have at our disposal a military potential that  currently permits us chiefly to carry out effective defense.  Insofar as our capabilities allow, we will strive to adjust to  the requirements of the contemporary universal military art,  drawing on the theoretical achievements of both East and West  European armies. With the passage of time, our armed forces  should increasingly assume the character of combined  air-and-surface formations in consideration of the potential at  the disposal of our hypothetical adversaries. The rule that the  stronger of the two adversaries dictates the rules of the game  will always hold true.    [Question] Does this mean that certain changes in the Polish  armed forces are inevitable?    [Koziej] It would be difficult to deny that they are  inevitable. It is not inconceivable that the Polish defense  system could demonstrate a certain inefficiency even before the  end of this year. Consequently, political decisionmakers should  look at the problems associated with the functioning of the Army  not only in the perspective of just one term of office but also  in a longer time scale. For quite a while now, President Walesa  and the National Security Bureau have insisted that adequate  levels of budget resources be allocated for defense. In my  opinion, we should aim to have a small but  extremely-well-trained and well-equipped Army in Poland. I  believe that we should gradually convert to professional, career  military service assisted by contract military service. Of  course, reserve military training should still be preserved in  addition to those two main forms of military service. An army  that is composed predominantly of career servicemen need not be  more expensive to run than one made up of drafted soldiers; one  European example that proves this thesis is that of the British  military service.    [Question] The alderman of Koscierzyna parish has offered to  allocate 1 billion zlotys of his parish funds to benefit the  National Defense Fund. Do you think that a nationwide  collection, held in peacetime, for such a purpose is a good  idea, or is it merely a case of a disproportionately emotive  initiative that could only alarm our neighbors unduly?    [Koziej] I would assess that particular initiative in  positive terms. At the same time, I believe that it is an  expression of an understandable public concern over the Polish  armed forces' material condition. Perhaps as a result of it  politicians will now turn their attention more closely to the  problem it highlights. To go back to your question, however, we  could easily picture a situation where each voivodship would  make a contribution toward the purchase of three modern tanks by  the Army. Surely there would be nothing wrong in such a scheme?  In any case, I believe that the extramilitary sector is the  weakest link in our defense system. I am thinking here of the  levels of knowledge and awareness of a whole range of defense  issues prevalent among our population. There is, however, a  marked improvement on that score among the voivodas, which was  noticeable as early as last year. Nevertheless, there is still  much scope for improvement in our central administration and  within individual ministries.</p>

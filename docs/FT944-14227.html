			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Markets: Brighter outlook for aluminium - Commodities When the US aluminium industry began organising its first international conference and exposition last year its mood was close to suicidal. Aluminium prices were at an all-time low in real terms and most companies were piling up losses. How quickly the mood has changed. The industry will make its way to Alumitech '94 in Atlanta, not to commiserate but to celebrate. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange were above Dollars 1,700 a tonne on Friday, a level which allows every smelter in the world to make a profit. With their short-term difficulties apparently behind them, the 1,200 executives expected to attend - from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Russia and the UK, as well as the US - will hear some heartening forecasts about aluminium's global growth prospects, particularly in key markets such as the beverage can and the automotive industries. One keynote speaker, Mr Richard Holder, chairman of Reynolds Metals, the world's third-largest aluminium group, already has predicted that the global aluminium can market will grow by 65 per cent by the year 2000. Another speaker, Mr Jacques Bougie, president of Alcan, the second-largest aluminium producer, says confidently: 'By the year 2010 the world automotive industry could be consuming as much as three times the aluminium as it does today. The additional shipments to this market alone could require the equivalent of the output of 30 to 40 additional world scale aluminium smelters.' Alumitech '94 lasts from Wednesday to Saturday. Natural resources will be considered at a conference, Doing Business in Uzbekistan, which will be held in London on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. Subjects for debate will include: oil and gas; mining; tobacco; cotton and, inevitably, prospects for foreign investment in this part of the former Soviet Union.</p>

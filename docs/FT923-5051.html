			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Estate to be demolished MOST of St Cuthbert's Village, a late 1960s Tyneside council housing estate with access and crime problems, is to be demolished even though Pounds 4.7m has been spent on the estate since 1979 and repayment of loans used to finance its construction will continue into the 2020s. Gateshead borough councillors decided yesterday on demolition and Mr Paul Tinnion, housing committee chairman, said upgrading attempts since 1979 had been a waste of public money.</p>

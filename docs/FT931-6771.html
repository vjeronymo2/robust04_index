			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Strong second half helps Mallett to Pounds 0.52m MALLETT, the antique dealer, saw pre-tax profits halve from Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 519,000 in the year to December 31, though this disguised a strong second-half performance. And last year's figure included an exceptional credit of Pounds 660,000. The company recently broke off merger talks with an unnamed company, thought to be Asprey, the silver, jewellery and luxury goods company, Having incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 485,000 in the first six months, the company made profits of Pounds 1.11m before exceptional items in the second half. Mr Peter Dixon, company secretary, ascribed the turnround to the global improvement in the art market in general, sterling leaving the ERM and its devaluation. Turnover slipped to Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 8.39m), though operating profits climbed to Pounds 802,000 (Pounds 537,000). Interest payable doubled to Pounds 176,000 (Pounds 84,000). The exceptional charge of Pounds 108,000 related to the relocation of all Christopher Wood Gallery activities into the New Bond Street premises. Earnings fell to 2.52p (5.96p) per share and after the passing of the interim a final dividend of 2p is recommended. Last year's total was 4.5p.</p>

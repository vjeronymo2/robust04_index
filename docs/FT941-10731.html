			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Observer: Worms turning Funny how the enthusiasms of Tory MPs wax and wane. A few months back they were up in arms about over-regulation of seaside hotels and boarding houses. Socialist local authorities, they said, were tangling them up in bureaucracy. But now Michael Heseltine has agreed to add many of the rules to his planned red-tape bonfire, the same MPs have come up with another problem. Too many small hoteliers in Bournemouth and Bridlington are allegedly lowering the tone of the resorts by letting out their rooms to social welfare claimants. But there is a solution, oh yes; tougher regulation by local authorities.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A step back in Algeria Mr Chadli Bendjedid, who resigned with evident reluctance as Algeria's president on Saturday night, has discovered, as Mr Mikhail Gorbachev did before him, that initiators of democratic reform rarely enjoy its fruits. Following his departure - apparently under pressure from army officers anxious to forestall an election victory by Islamic fundamentalists - the process of political liberalisation that the president set in motion more than three years ago seems to be shuddering to a halt. The second round of voting in the country's first free parliamentary elections - which had been due to take place on Thursday - was duly cancelled last night. Now, the country seems set to be ruled by an unelected body of ministers from Mr Chadli's last government behind which lurks the army. The result, unless this body plays its cards with great shrewdness and sensitivity, could be a worsening showdown between the military and Islamic militants with serious repercussions throughout north Africa and the Arab world - and with worrying side-effects in Europe. There has been something tragically predictable about the unfolding of Algeria's gravest crisis since it settled down after independence from France in 1962: after decades of exercising a stultifying, often incompetent and sometimes corrupt monopoly on power, the ruling elite faces a growing challenge on the streets, agrees to hold elections, alternately confronts and seeks to co-opt the opposition, finds itself in imminent danger of being swept from power by forces of which it violently disapproves, and seeks to abort the embryonic democracy with a 'constitutional' coup. Prominent casualty President Chadli is the most prominent casualty of this process. He deserves credit for his sincere efforts to open up Algeria's political system to the widest range of participants, including the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS), the Islamic movement that won a startling majority in the first round of voting on December 26. If the experiment with democracy has now been halted it is not down to him but to others in the military establishment who could not contemplate the prospect of a government involving the FIS and setting out to create some form of Islamic state. Civil strife Here is the rub. The prospect of such a change of government fills many educated, middle-class Algerians with horror and countries with close links to Algeria, such as France and Italy, with dismay. The former fear civil strife between advocates and opponents of adopting Islamic law; the latter, an increasing tide of disenchanted emigrants reaching the shores of Europe. Such worries cannot be lightly dismissed. The FIS has not displayed much enthusiasm for democracy except as a route to gain power; its leaders often suggest that if they do so, they will move swiftly to make the process irreversible. In a country where democratic institutions are young and fragile, a party that espouses democracy only with a view to overturning it is bound to cause political strains. But to acknowledge the difficulties is not to condone a suspension of the electoral process. Algeria is unlikely to turn into another Iran. For better or worse - and even allowing for the irregularities at the polls that the government has complained of - the FIS seems to have been chosen by a large plurality of Algerians on December 26. If it puts up a candidate for presidential elections - if they are held as they should be within 45 days - it would almost certainly sweep the board there too. To seek to contain or suppress such a party by force - or by legalistic sanctions such as Tunisia has imposed on its fundamentalists - would be foolish, and probably counter-productive. Algeria has gone too far down the road to democracy now to return to one-party rule - either of a military or an unconstitutional Islamic kind. The job of those outside powers which might be able to influence events is to discourage the country's new rulers from thinking that the west's preference for secular governments will mean that it turns a blind eye to abuses of power.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> SANCHEZ HAS ANSWERS FOR LENDL  </P> <P> As he did all day long, Emilio Sanchez had an answer for Ivan Lendl.  </P> <P> After Sanchez upset Lendl, 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4, Wednesday in the fourth round  of the International Players Championships, the top player in the world said  the Spaniard won't win the tournament.  </P> <P> "I don't know (if I can)," Sanchez said. "He can't, for sure."  </P> <P> In another major upset, Conchita Martinez of Spain knocked off top-seeded  Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, 7-6 (10-8), 6-2.  </P> <P> Lendl fought off three match points to bounce back from a 5-2 deficit to trail,  5-4, in the final set.  </P> <P> He couldn't hold serve in the 10th game and lost to Sanchez for the first time  in four meetings.  </P> <P> "In my career, I've beaten most of the guys -- (Boris) Becker, (John) McEnroe,  (Stefan) Edberg -- but not in the same tournament," Sanchez said. "Lendl was  the only one that I could never beat.  </P> <P> "I've come close many times, and today I almost let the match escape from me.  When I had the match points and didn't win them, I kept telling myself to keep  trying and keep fighting. If he beats me, he beats me."  </P> <P> Lendl said he would have preferred to have been someplace else this week  because he usually doesn't play well in South Florida's humid weather.  </P> <P> "I never felt I was out of the match because I was coming back and started to  play better," he said. "But I never felt I was in control, because when you're  down and serving into the wind, no one can feel in control.  </P> <P> "Every time I come down here, it's humid and I don't feel like the ball is  coming off the racket the way I wanted it to."  </P></p>

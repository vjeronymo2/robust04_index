			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bequest might be too big My wife and I have no close relatives and are considering leaving our estates to a small Baptist chapel of which we are members. But I am concerned that the amount - roughly Pounds 275,000 - might be an embarrassment because of the chapel's lack of experience in handling sums of this size. Would forming some sort of trust, to provide income, be the best way to proceed? Are there any obvious difficulties to such a plan? We understand that you are proposing to write your will so that all assets pass to the surviving spouse, with the chapel receiving all the estate on his or her death. Under these circumstances, there should be no inheritance tax payable on the first death and, so long as the bequest is made to a registered charity, no IHT would be payable on the death of the survivor. In your wills, you could leave the estate in a trust on the death of the surviving spouse. The trust could be a charitable one and would need to be registered with the Charity Commissioners, having as its aims the provision of income and capital, where necessary, to the chapel. Selecting the trustees is crucial. Their duties include investing the capital and paying income to the chapel. Also, they can be empowered to advance capital to the chapel if authorised. Thus, it is important you are satisfied the trustees would act responsibly. Reply by Barry Stillerman.

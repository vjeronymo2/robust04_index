This meeting had  been agreed upon in early December 1993.    The meeting, which lasted a couple of hours, was held at the  official residence of Los Pinos in an atmosphere of cordiality  and frankness. They reviewed the regional situation, bilateral  relations, the outlook for the free trade agreement, and various  topics of interest to the three countries, as is explained in a  communique issued a few minutes ago by the Presidency General  Media Directorate. The governments expressed their desire to  cooperate and to provide mutual support to achieve greater  development in the region.    The Salvadoran and Honduran presidents will return to their  countries today. The communique does not specify whether the  presidents discussed the topic of Chiapas.</p>

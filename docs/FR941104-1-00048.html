			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight responses concerning these sharks were received within the comment period; four favored their listing in Appendix II, and four were opposed to a listing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CMC, NAS, and HSUS, along with other commenters, stated that because large sharks are slow to reach sexual maturity and reproduce at long intervals, they must be managed more conservatively than other commercial fisheries. They cite the demand for shark fins as probably the largest factor in the presumed global decline of sharks, although meat is also in demand, and a new market for shark cartilage as a cancer treatment has developed. The NAS pointed out that most shark experts question whether sustainable exploitation of sharks is even possible and that over 90 percent of the shark fisheries in this century have failed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TRAFFIC USA submitted an unpublished paper from the World Conservation Monitoring Centre on shark fin trade, entitled, ``International Trade in Shark Fins.'' The study was undertaken to quantify the volume and value of shark fins in international trade, and to identify the main producer and consumer nations. However, due to the limited availability of trade data, statistics from only nine countries were analyzed. The paper calls for closer attention to studies of trends in shark populations, in order to protect sharks from overexploitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In opposition to a CITES listing, the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations and the National Fisheries Institute commented that the lack of available information on population structure, distribution, abundance, and population trends for these species limit the presentation of scientific evidence to support a proposal for listing. They expressed concern that an Appendix II listing might encourage unilateral actions, such as the U.S. Atlantic coast shark fishery management plan, that could provide a basis for CITES nations to determine that their shark production was non-detrimental, rather than participating in regional cooperative management programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Japan Fisheries Association and the FAJ indicated that available scientific information does not support listing these shark species, and that a listing would impose an excessive burden on the management and scientific authorities of concerned parties to CITES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS took note of the lack of specific information in many comments received, and based on this limitation, combined with the lack of research cross-referencing trade statistics with population trends, NMFS decided that they would not recommend proposing any shark species for listing in the CITES Appendices. The Service agrees with this view, and also feels that the data available on the status of shark species worldwide are not sufficient to support the listing of all species in these two families at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Whale shark ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhincodon typus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The whale shark is the only species in the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhincodon, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and occurs worldwide mainly in tropical and subtropical waters (except in the Mediterranean). It is a large (8&hyph;10 m, and up to 4.5 metric tons), slow, mainly surface dwelling, plankton-feeder. Historically it appears to have been infrequent in occurrence; no reliable population estimates seem to exist, and they are nowhere abundant. The meat is eaten, but it is soft and apparently brings a low price in most markets. Whale sharks are taken commercially in a few places around the world (mostly in Asia), especially during seasons when other more valuable fish species are not available. Although fins are removed for the shark fin soup trade, some are considered second grade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIA proposed to the Service that the whale shark be considered for inclusion in Appendix II of CITES. The Service received nine comments on the whale shark within the comment period; five supported a listing and four were opposed. (Most comments were directed to all sharks, not specifically to the whale shark.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TRAFFIC USA indicated that TRAFFIC Oceania has undertaken the collection and analysis of shark species in trade globally, and enclosed a TRAFFIC USA Newsletter on sharks as well as an unpublished report entitled, ``International Trade in Shark Fins.'' The CMC noted that commercial shark fishing is increasing worldwide as the demand for shark meat and fins continues to expand, and invoked the slow growth rates, late maturation, and small number of young produced as being characteristics of sharks in general that also apply to whale sharks and increase their vulnerability. They indicated that there are commercial fisheries for whale sharks in waters off India, Pakistan, China, Senegal, and the Philippines that appear to be expanding, and noted that the generally coastal habitat of whale sharks and their slow movements make them vulnerable to boat collisions and harpooning. The AHA and the NAS reiterated these comments, adding that, as a precautionary principle, the species should be listed rather than waiting until additional data and information is accumulated. The HSUS noted that shark populations in general are considered overexploited, at least in parts of their range, and, although data are lacking, they believed that trade in whale shark fins is probably increasing. They supported a listing in order that data on trade and exploitation might be collected for the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In opposition to the listing of the whale shark, the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations and the National Fisheries Institute, Inc. suggested that an Appendix II listing would probably not affect the limited subsistence fisheries in parts of Asia, but that it might limit or undermine a more coordinated international approach that could effectively control mortality. They repeated the comments from others that there is little or no information on the whale shark's population structure, distribution, abundance, population trends, or trade. The Japan Fisheries Association stated that available scientific information on sharks does not warrant listing these species in any CITES Appendix. The FAJ essentially agreed with this assessment, adding that a listing would add an excessive burden to the Management and Scientific Authorities of the CITES Parties concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS took note of the lack of specific information in many of the comments received, and, based on this limitation, combined with the lack of research cross-referencing trade statistics with population trends, NMFS decided that they would not recommend proposing the whale shark for listing in a CITES Appendix. NMFS will continue to monitor work being done in this area in order to better assess possible recommendations at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: ICI to cease production of CFCs in the UK ICI, the chemicals group, is to phase out production of the two main ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 1993 and buy in supplies from Akzo of the Netherlands to satisfy rapidly declining demand. Akzo announced yesterday that it had agreed with ICI that the two companies would concentrate their European production of CFCs 11 and 12 at the Dutch company's plant in Weert, near Maastricht. The agreement, already approved by the UK and Dutch authorities, has been submitted to the European Commission in Brussels for approval. It marks the first time that two European companies have set up a 'community of production' as envisaged by the Montreal Protocol, which calls for worldwide industrial rationalisation as a means of reducing CFC production. In 1993, ICI will halt production of CFCs 11 and 12 at its plant in Runcorn, Cheshire, where it also produces CFC alternatives. ICI said it hoped the effect on employment would be neutral because of the launch of production of alternative substances. The Runcorn site is ICI's only wholly-owned CFC plant. Besides its Weert factory, Akzo also has a small plant in Australia. Permission from the EC is required because the concentration of the two groups' European CFC production in the Netherlands will lead to a temporary rise in output in Weert. This will fall as demand for CFCs declines.</p>

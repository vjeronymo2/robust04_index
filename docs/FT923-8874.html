			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now buyers can insure against loss of value BUYERS of new homes will be able to insure themselves against plummeting property prices under a scheme launched this week. Provided by General Accident Property Services (GAPS) - which runs a chain of 400 estate agents and is part of the General Accident insurance group - it will operate initially in the Thames Valley area near London and will spread nationally during the ne xt two months. General Accident is offering to cover owners forced to sell their home within three years of a purchase against losses of up to 10 per cent of the original price - up to a ceiling of Pounds 15,000. David Wright, national operations manager of GAPS, said the scheme would be sold through housebuilders, which would be able to offer it as a sales incentive. There are no plans to offer it generally to the public. The cost to builders would be a flat fee of less than Pounds 300 a house, which would cover purchasers for three years. Letters detailing the offer have been sent this week to companies in the Thames Valley region, including most of the national housebuilders. Wright said the insurance policies would be written by a Lloyds insurance syndicate rather than GA. 'The aim is not to generate insurance business but to try to stimulate the housing market out of the worst slump for more than half a century,' he added. To qualify for the new scheme, people must have been forced to sell their home by loss of job or a forced job move, a divorce or separation, or by the withdrawal of equity by a joint mortgagee. 'Unemployment and the fear of homes losing their value are the two biggest concerns holding back the housing market,' said Wright. A rents-to-mortgages deal for ex-armed service personnel is on offer as part of a package launched by SSAFA (the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association), AFFAS (the Armed Forces' Financial Advisory Services), and the Birmingham Midshires Building Society. Properties held by Birmingham Midshires will be available on a 12-month lease at an annual rent of around 7 per cent of the property's valuation. These properties will be available for purchase by ex-servicemen, and any rent paid during the first 12 months will be deducted from the price. Those who wish to buy will be offered a first-year mortgage rate 1.5 per cent below Birmingham Midshires' base rate, now 10.75 per cent. Mortgages will be offered, subject to normal lending criteria, on up to 95 per cent of the purchase price.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The end of the Cold War has provided Asia-Pacific  countries with a golden opportunity to determine the future of  the region themselves. It has also presented a scenario whereby  they no longer need to be new pawns of the great power's chess  board. Even this, there is no need then for the United States,  the only remaining superpower in the world, to have a physical  presence here. No doubt U.S. security is necessary in  Asia-Pacific, but America can play this role in other ways.    As Defense Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib pointed out, it  could, for instance, take the form of technology transfer. It  could also include defense information and access to  state-of-the-art training. This, for instance, could help  Malaysia in its effort to modernize its defense capabilities.  The U.S. currently does not have a permanent military base in  Southeast Asia. Some argue that with its drawdown of the U.S.  forces and the breakup of the former USSR, there will be new  powers which fill the void. It would appear in the  international media that China is to be made up as the new  future threat to regional security.    This perception is inaccurate, for China is now  concentrating  more on developing its much neglected economy. To China, its  economic prosperity, which is partly tied to the region, is in  itself a high spirit for the country. It is also currently  involved in various dialogues, whether bilateral or  multi-lateral, in the region. This is a good reflection of  China's desire to be engaged in the continuous process of  achieving regional peace and prosperity.    The South China Sea has often been described as the region's  future flash point. Rather than adhering to the old mentality,  the time has come to look to the area as an opportunity for  cooperation, not confrontation. Most Asia-Pacific countries  have no desire to stir the hornet's nest, but rather like to  cooperate with each other. Therefore, the old Cold War mindset  that the U.S. must have a permanent base here is no longer  valid. In contrast, U.S. presence should be based on gaining  access to facilities in the region based on the principle of  mutual benefit.    There is no doubt that Asia-Pacific is one the fastest  growing economic regions in the world. The stake for the  maintenance of peace and regional stability is, therefore,  economic prosperity. It is indeed a high stake for all the  countries. As such, efforts must be geared towards ensuring the  region remains prosperous so that peace would prevail. No doubt  there are some security problems in the region. This is why as  much as economic cooperation is important, it is equally  important to establish political ties.    Only when a relationship is based on a comprehensive  foundation will it be solid and able to flourish. This is what  Asia-Pacific should strive for. Member countries have the  capacity to turn conflicts and confrontations into peace and  cooperation. It should no longer be influenced by outside  powers. It is about time the region charts its own destiny.</p>

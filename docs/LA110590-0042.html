			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKE PUTS HIS TITLE ON LINE TONIGHT  </P> <P> Paul Banke will defend his World Boxing Council super-bantamweight championship  for the second time tonight in a 12-round bout at the Forum against Pedro  Decima of Argentina.  </P> <P> In his only title defense, Banke (20-4) stopped Lee Ki-Jun Aug. 18 at Ichon,  South Korea. In typical, come-from-behind Banke fashion, he was bleeding and  down on points when he stopped Lee in the last round.  </P> <P> Decima (25-2) is the No. 1-ranked WBC contender and the title fight will be his  first.  </P></p>

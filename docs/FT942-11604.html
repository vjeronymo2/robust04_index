			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Efficiency of Child Support Agency in doubt The Child Support Agency may collect no more in maintenance payments from absent parents in its first year than the Department of Social Security collected last year. The disclosure, which emerged this week in answer to MPs' questions, will be politically damaging for the government since it suggests, by one yardstick, that the controversial new regime is no more effective than the old. It comes just two weeks after it was revealed that the agency is more than Pounds 100m short of its overall target of making benefit savings of Pounds 530m for 1993-94. With figures for one month of its financial year still to come, the benefit savings secured by the agency have reached just Pounds 285m. This compares with Pounds 313m in savings secured in 1992-93. The agency is confident that it will beat this figure. In a further disclosure, Ms Ros Hepplewhite, the agency's chief executive, has told Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee, that the cost of setting up the agency was 'around Pounds 146m' and that its running costs 'are estimated at Pounds 97.8m'. The committee is to launch a review of the agency's workings when it receives the body's annual report, expected in July. The committee expects to publish its second report on the agency in the autumn. According to figures released by Ms Hepplewhite, the agency collected a total of Pounds 186m in maintenance payments in the 11 months to the end of February. This compares with Pounds 220m in maintenance obtained by the DSS in 1992-93 for income support claimants. To match that performance this year the agency would need to have collected Pounds 34m in March, the last month of its financial year, for which figures are not yet available. This would be exactly double the Pounds 17m it secured in February. The agency said yesterday that the maintenance collection figures for 1992-93 and 1993-94 were not directly comparable, since it now deals with a larger client group than the DSS had done. The agency now handles family credit recipients and private clients in addition to income support claimants. Ministers put the agency's disappointing financial performance down to changes forced by the social security committee and a refusal by some fathers to pay maintenance. In February, the DSS responded to Commons criticism of the agency by amending the formula for absent parents' maintenance payments. The changes also allowed fathers facing big bills to pay in stages over an 18-month period. Mr Field said recently that he felt the anger expressed by the public necessitated a new inquiry to decide whether the formula that determined how much parents should pay ought to be changed. In a letter to Mr Field last month, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said he was 'determined not to be rushed into further, inappropriate changes simply because the policy is unpopular with some sections of the community'.</p>

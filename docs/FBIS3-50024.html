"They all write about the budget deficit, growing  unemployment, `sugar affair' (concerning the repayment of an  Indian debt to Slovakia), and comment on fictitious speeches by  Meciar -- but they pass over the fact that Slovakia has the  smallest national debt per person of the post-communist  countries," Slobodnik said.    "The struggle against Slovakia is essentially economic.  Slovakia is portrayed in a negative way. What happens next is  that some capitalists, say from the Netherlands, who want to  invest in Central Europe and who have read such information, say  to themselves: 'With this kind of situation there, it would be  better to avoid Slovakia and invest the millions in Hungary and  the Czech Republic instead,' and that indeed is the aim of the  propaganda," Slobodnik says.    Frequent criticism leveled against Slovak Premier Vladimir  Meciar by the opposition press is a sign, Slobodnik says, of a  "concerted attack directed by someone hiding behind the scenes  who objects to the fact that Meciar is leading Slovakia to  prosperity and who is bent on replacing him with a new premier,  more amenable and responsive to foreign pressure.    "When you, the Czech journalists, do it, it is to some  degree  logical since you thus support the position of the Czech lands.  But when Slovak journalists do this, it is a case of  intentionally harming Slovak interests.    "What we do with such journalists? We tolerate them, we  respect democracy," Slobodnik says.    "Slovakia will attain the goals it aims for, albeit with  some  detours, and then it will remember those who stood in its way."    At a recent Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)  meeting, Slobodnik pointed a finger at an opposition journalist.    "You do not understand that when you shower the premier with  abuse, it will have an opposite effect. It has happened once  before with Meciar. When they willfully removed him from the  government, his popularity increased. An objective survey would  show that his popularity has been growing since last October,  because people think: 'this man is being hunted.'    "They stooped to fabricating a speech Meciar allegedly made  at Zlata Idka, but they used at least ten different voices,"  Slobodnik said.    A HZDS east Slovak regional meeting took place at Zlata  Idka,  east Slovakia, on November 27-28, 1993.    "This republic is stronger than the antagonistic journalists  would have it. Life has been difficult for the government, it  has a lot of enemies who would like to pick up power in the  streets, but they will not succeed. Slovak people do not want a  new government.    "People are able to see that the HZDS is the only force that  has fought uncompromisingly for Slovak interests without seeking  any benefits for itself. Various things have been written about  Meciar and me but nobody has dared to say that we have been  profiteering. The present government is incorruptible,"  Slobodnik says.    "The HZDS is destined to win the next elections. It will not  gain as many votes as in 1992, but it will still receive three  to four percent more than the Democratic Left Party (SDL). I  bet five bottles of whisky against one. Are you on?."</p>

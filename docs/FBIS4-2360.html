			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Loans provided by the  World Bank have gone a long way to promote the economic  development, especially the development of infrastructure  facilities in Shandong, a key economic province in East China.    The province is one the earliest to use the World Bank loans  after 1980 when the bank resumed its operations in China.    By the end of 1993, the province had used 26 batches of  loans  totalling 824 million U.S. dollars and more than 40 percent of  the loans have been used in energy development, 30 percent in  agriculture and the rest in transportation, industry and social  sectors.    Agriculture is the main area using the World Bank loan. The  province has built and developed six farm projects with a total  investment of 2.5 billion yuan, including loans totalling 262  million U.S. dollars from the World Bank.    These projects, spreading in 64 counties and cities, cover  construction of farm and irrigation facilities, animal  husbandry, processing of farm and sideline products, development  of coastal lower-lying areas and the breeding of aquatic  products.    So far four projects have has been completed and the rest  are  proceeding smoothly.    The first World Bank loan project -- the North China plain  agricultural project -- began in 1982 and was completed in 1987.    Costing 198 million yuan including 29.6 million U.S. dollars  in loan, the project involved the harnessing of river courses  and the building of irrigation facilities.    As a result, the irrigation areas have been expanded from  51,000 hectares to 80,700 hectares, accounting for 93 percent of  the total cultivated areas; 33,000 hectares out of the 43,000  hectares of the saline-alkali areas have been ameliorated; and  9,300 hectares of waste land reclaimed. The tree coverage rate  has risen from 6.2 percent to 16.3 percent.    Another World Bank loan project is the comprehensive  agricultural development in the province.    The province has completed investment of 1.014 billion yuan,  95 percent of the planned amount and transformed 187,000  hectares of lower-yield farmland and developed lower-lying areas  to raise aquatic products.    The social development projects using the World Bank loan  include improvement of medical services, training of medical  personnel, development of preventive medicine, the improvement  of school conditions, teaching facilities and laboratories,  totalling nine, with a total World Bank loans running up to  43.53 million U.S. dollars.    Two forestry projects and five industrial projects have also  yielded satisfactory results.</p>

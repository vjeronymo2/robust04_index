			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Letter: UK and US suffer same problems but politicians are not addressing them Sir, In your editorial, 'An election that matters' (March 10), you state that neither the Tories nor Labour is talking about Britain's most trenchant problems, specifically '. . . a disastrous secondary education system; local government, which has lost its independent fiscal base and its sense of purpose; and a labour market, battered by legal change and economic boom and bust, still failing to train enough skilled workers.' For a moment I was sure I was reading about the US] It is striking that the nub of our two countries' challenges could be so similar, yet our presidential candidates avoid discussing these very same issues. Certainly one could assert that Britain is now suffering the same plight as the US because Margaret Thatcher, an ideological soul mate to Ronald Reagan, allowed these problems to fester during her 12-year reign. But I believe the source of our common problems runs much deeper. The easy transference of technology and production to the populated 'third world' countries means that the return to manual ('blue collar') labour is declining and will inevitably fall further. The 30 years which followed the Second World War brought unprecedentedly high wages to US labour, but that was because the US was the only working economy after the war. Now that the rest of the world, teeming with unskilled labour, is eager to join in this prosperity, unskilled wages will decline In the US, low-skilled government workers, who constitute the only growing union movement, are trying to maintain their own wages despite the decline in those of their fellow workers in the private sector. The cities are caught in a squeeze trying to cope simultaneously with the demands of unions and the lower classes who are increasingly alienated and unprepared for the changing demands of the workplace. Public education shoulders much blame because it lacks the structure to teach new skills and offer a fresh vision of the future. In the US too many students are expected to go to college and acquire a working permit called a 'diploma', often emerging untrained for the jobs available in areas of expanding employment, such as computers, health care and skilled trades. The changing demands on the workforce will eventually affect all other industrialised nations. Continental Europe's economy appears ready to follow Britain's and the US's into a recession. Many of their cities show some of the same deterioration as those in America, as swarms of immigrants, attempting to take advantage of western Europe's higher living standards, are not being integrated into society. Even Japan, which deals with a totally homogeneous population, is battered by scandal in government, a real estate collapse that dwarfs our own, and the loss of manufacturing jobs to the new Asian markets. The responses to these challenges are not easy, but no politician is talking about them. The world would be infinitely richer if we allowed free trade among nations and heavily supported and/or retrained those who lost their jobs as a result. Furthermore, the educational system must be revamped so that job preparation, as well as general education, becomes a primary goal. The future can be bright for America and the rest of the world if the common nature of many of our problems is confronted directly, rather than lost in meaningless rhetoric of 'middle class tax cuts', 'capital gains', or 'Buy American'. Yes, this election matters - but not about matters currently debated by the world's politicians.

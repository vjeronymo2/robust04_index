			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OF MOUSETRAPS AND MEN  </P> <P> I've never before written a fan letter regarding a book review, but I must  express my thanks for Richard Eder's thoughts on Umberto Eco's "Foucault's  Pendulum" (Book Review, Nov. 5),which I have not yet read and probably never  will.  </P> <P> When "The Name of the Rose" was published to so much acclaim, I felt like a  skunk at a lawn party. Throughout his novel, Mr. Eco grandstanded his own  erudition in tedious tangents to an otherwise nifty story. I found the writing  just plain literary bad manners. Even worse, the book "turned off" many  college-aged readers who might otherwise have learned from and enjoyed a  fascinating period and milieu.  </P> <P> You've summed it all up in writing that a novel is not a truffle hunt, nor  should it be a mousetrap. Thank you. Literature is not an adjunct of aesthetic  theology. That's another way of saying that the structuralist arguments make me  scream.  </P> <P> PATRICIA DAVIS  </P> <P> WEST HOLLYWOOD  </P></p>

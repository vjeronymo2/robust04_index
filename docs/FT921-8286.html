			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: William Low The 15 per cent fall in William Low's share price yesterday was a harsh reaction to a profits warning in a sector where consistent double-digit growth is considered normal. Other food retailers will doubtless argue that Low's problems stem from a unique combination of bad luck. Eighteen months after its Pounds 38m rights issue, a trough in its development cycle and one-off reorganisation costs have coincided with deep recession in its market. The abrupt departure last week of the group's managing director will not have helped the market's confidence. But by next year, sales growth should accelerate afresh as new stores open for business. Low has always grown by leaps and bounds with the occasional stumble along the way. Assuming it makes about Pounds 20m pre-tax profit, a maintained annual dividend would be three times covered, so the group is unlikely to be another Asda. Other regional players such as Morrisons have continued to perform well against the big chains, so the case for a second tier of supermarket operators looks solid enough for the moment. All the same, Low's problems are a reminder that even the smaller food retailers have ambitious growth assumptions. Judging by its reaction, the market intends to put a heavy price on any shortcomings.</p>

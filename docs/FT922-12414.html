			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Motoring: Same glass - but double the cost WHAT does it cost to have a Lotus Elan windscreen replaced? The answer is that it depends who does it. If you call in an instant-fit specialist, it is Pounds 333. If you give the job to a Lotus dealer, it can be nearly twice as much. When Elan owner John Field discovered a small stone chip in his screen, he decided to have it replaced before it became an extensive crack. So he called National Windscreen. Before quoting a price, National asked for the Elan's chassis number. It explained that as only official Lotus sealing strips would be used, the car had to be identified precisely. Field thought National's Pounds 333 quote reasonable. But he decided that as the car was due for a service, his Lotus dealer might as well replace the screen while the car was in the workshop. He was so surprised to get a Pounds 630.33 bill for fitting the screen that he wrote to me: 'It just seems that the Lotus figure is excessive. My insurance company will pay, but is this one reason for the great increase in premiums?' I put the point to Lotus. Senior executive Colin Gething considered the dealer's price was right for both parts and labour. Why could National fit an identical screen at half the price? According to Gething, I was not comparing like with like. When replacing an Elan's screen, National did not fit new weather strips to the A-posts (windscreen pillars) as Lotus recommended. Could this really account for the charge being virtually twice as high? Apparently, yes. By Lotus's calculation, not replacing the A-post strips had saved National about Pounds 50 in parts plus three hours' labour. Gething explained that Lotus dealers set their own labour charges, which varied from one to another and took account of the level of service given. Those who collected and delivered cars for servicing, and provided loan vehicles, charged more than those who did not. That is fair enough. But assume a dealer charged Pounds 50 an hour. Three hours spent fitting Pounds 50 worth of A-post weather strips accounts for Pounds 200 on top of National's Pounds 333 quote, making Pounds 533. (Field's windscreen replacement bill, remember, was Pounds 100 more than that). David Scott, technical services manager of National Windscreen, shed some light on the matter. His firm replaces several hundred thousand front and rear screens and side windows every year. Like most modern cars, a Lotus Elan's screen is bonded in place. Some trim items have to be replaced as a matter of course. Others can sometimes be re-used, depending on the state of the car; National leaves the decision to the skilled fitter doing the job. 'We work with the insurance companies. We try to save money by only replacing what we know to be essential,' Scott said. 'All our work is covered by a 12-month warranty.' Did this include water leakage? I wondered. 'Of course.' The years of experience accumulated by National Windscreen and other specialists like Autoglass has been recognised by the insurance companies. Many now recommend their policyholders to use them instead of franchised car dealers for glass replacement. People like John Field will understand why. I would always go to a specialist. The last franchised dealer I asked to replace a broken screen wanted five days to get the new one - and his quote was nearly twice as high as that of an instant-fit specialist who installed one that afternoon in my own drive. It is not unknown for some franchised garages - I am not referring to Field's Lotus dealer - to get screen replacement specialists to do the job, anyway. The trend started long ago with tyres. A garage, asked by a customer to fit a new set while a car is being serviced, simply sends it round to the local specialist. It is good business: the work is done at trade price and the customer is charged retail. The Consumers' Association's magazine Which? reported recently on the replacement exhaust business. It gave one of the biggest and most successful chains a hard time over allegedly recommending unnecessary work. But it admitted that prices charged at instant-fit outlets were far lower than at franchised garages. To be fair, many franchised dealers have launched competitive instant-fit operations of their own covering tyres, batteries, exhausts and servicing. The tyre, battery and exhaust specialists have riposted by moving into servicing and clutch and brake replacement. Once most straightforward, family-type cars are out of the manufacturer's warranty, it is no longer essential to have them serviced by a franchised dealer. Shopping around for routine servicing can save time and money. It is no different from getting several quotes for painting a house, building an extension or buying new tyres. Servicing, particularly of sophisticated cars, can be very expensive. The high cost is worrying the leasing and contract hire companies; indeed, Stan Thompson, treasurer of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, complains: 'The cost of maintenance is going through the roof.' He suspects bills are being loaded by small extra jobs, sometimes unnecessary. 'Because of the difficulty of checking these smaller items, a Pounds 250 job becomes a Pounds 300 or Pounds 320 job. I feel we are being taken for a ride,' Thompson adds. The association's official journal cites a contract hire company's bill for Pounds 4,000 from a franchised dealer for repairing two executive cars. When they were inspected by the company's technical director, one car was found to have needed a Pounds 60 repair and the other a repair costing Pounds 100. What can the private motorist do? While a car is under warranty, take it to a known and trusted franchised dealer. When parts have been replaced, ask for the original ones to be put in a plastic bag in the boot. Some garages, especially on the Continent, do this automatically. And when the car is out of warranty, look for best buys in servicing as you would for anything else.</p>

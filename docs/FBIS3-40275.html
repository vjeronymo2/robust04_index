			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- We will start  implementing the new measures at the end of next week when the  Republic's government is expected to adopt them, although we are  already adhering to some of them, stressed Vladimir Lukic, the  prime minister of the Srpska republic [RS], at a meeting devoted  to economic recovery measures in Banja Luka this evening.    The meeting was attended by Jovan Zebic, the deputy prime  minister of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], Nikola  Stanic, the coordinator of the team of experts for monetary  reconstruction and economic recovery of the FRY, Momo Pejic, the  governor of the National Bank of the RS, Misa Jandric, the head  of the Center for Development at the FRY Government, several  ministers in the governments of the RS and the republic of Serb  Krajina [RSK], and a number of scientists, businessmen, and  bankers.    Apart from the essential features of the measures, most of  the attention centered on future relations between Yugoslavia  and the RS and RSK, and how monetary reconstruction will affect  them.    Speaking about the unification of the monetary system,  Stanic  underlined that agreement must be reached on two key issues  because the flow of goods, capital, and people on both sides of  the Drina [river dividing Serbia proper and the Srpska republic  in Bosnia-Herzegovina] must be completely free in the economic  sense, while unification, due to the climate in international  relations, should be carried out on the basis of agreements  concluded between the three governments.    Stanic proposed that groups of experts from all three Serb  states be formed for several important areas. The governors of  the national banks should become members of the board of the  Yugoslav National Bank, and groups should also be formed for  coordinating the fiscal system, customs, and customs protection  toward third countries, as well as for coordinating regulations  on foreign capital.</p>

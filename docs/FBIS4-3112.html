			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "Japan's New PM To Be Elected Next Week"] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition  is back in action after a week of political turmoil sparked by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision to resign on  April 8.    Although divided into two rival camps, the coalition  parties,  except for the new Sakigake Party [Harbinger], have finally  buried the hatchet and agreed to work for the selection of a new  prime minister and the formation of a new government.    If an accord can be reached within the alliance on major  issues such as taxes, foreign policy and administration reform,  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), will become its single candidate for the premiership,  political sources say.    But the possibility that former Deputy Prime Minister Michio  Watanabe will become a dark horse and win the upcoming  parliamentary election for premier cannot be ruled out.    Yesterday, Watanabe held a last-minute meeting with Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono, who has also  announced his intention to run for premier. The two failed to  reach an agreement on who the party's candidate should be, but  agreed to meet again on Monday [18 April].    Kono had asked Watanabe to give up his candidacy to avoid a  major breakup of the main opposition party, but Watanabe  rejected Kono's request. Their showdown may accelerate the  disintegrating process within the LDP, which had dominated  Japan's scandal-ridden politics for 38 years, until last August.    A new political map is also being drawn for the coalition.    Sakigake, a 15-member partner in the alliance that has been  frustrated because Shinseito has led the bloc's decision-making,  distanced itself from the others by declaring that it would not  provide members in the next cabinet.    Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura is currently chief  cabinet  secretary, the top government spokesman.    Sakigake said, however, it will vote for the coalition's  joint candidate for prime minister and support the government's  position on pending issues such as the overdue 1994 state budget.    The Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist  Party, both of which sided with Sakigake in opposing the  Shinseito-led management, agreed to go ahead with selecting a  candidate without sakigake.    Meanwhile, Shinseito, the coalition's core component, still  considers Watanabe a possible partner. Watanabe's stand on key  issues is close to that of Shinseito Secretary General Lehiro  Ozawa.    The political vacuum has been keenly felt on the diplomatic  front, with official visits by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak  and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai postponed at their  request. Hosokawa had planned a tour of Europe this month, but  now will not go.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry also postponed a visit  to Japan scheduled for April 19 to 21 following the accidental  downing of two U.S. helicopters by American jets over northern  Iraq.</p>

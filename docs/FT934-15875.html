			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Labour tension threat in Japan over jobs JAPAN'S trade union movement shed some of its traditional compliance yesterday by urging employers not to cut jobs and wages. The call came in a resolution at the end of the annual convention of the 7.8m-strong Rengo trade union confederation. While bland by European standards, it points to the arrival of labour tension, the latest consequence of Japan's worst recession for 20 years. The downturn has already forced some of the biggest companies to shed jobs and consider cutting bonus payments, in the process challenging the post-war traditions of lifetime employment and generous overtime pay. Mr Akira Yamagishi, Rengo president, warned that the confederation was determined to win pay rises in next spring's annual wage round, despite companies' efforts to cut wage bills. Management demands to choose between pay cuts or job cuts 'can never be accepted'. Rengo, which represents nearly 12.5 per cent of the workforce, has been Japan's only union federation since its foundation in 1989 from a merger of labour groups. It is unclear how unified it is or how it will try to achieve the aims it spelt out yesterday. The main electronics unions appear ready to accept a small decline in bonuses, and unions generally have been unwilling to take effective strike action. Rengo's resolution also urged the government to cut income tax by Y5,000bn (Pounds 31bn) and to abandon plans to lift the retirement age from 60 to 65, needed to ease the demands on the social security budget. Japan's employment problem is nothing like as serious as that of its US and European competitors. Nevertheless, the workforce has been worried by the long series of job cuts and warnings on pay. Earlier this week Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, warned that management would consider cutting salaries to ensure full employment in the next fiscal year. At least three leading carmakers are considering reduced winter bonuses this year and two steelmakers may give staff extra time off on low pay. Wages were under pressure even before the latest squeeze. The average private sector rise last year was 1.9 per cent, the lowest for 34 years, according to the national tax administration agency. Growth is widely expected to be even lower this year and next. Koyo Seiko, the bearings producer, yesterday became the latest Japanese company to announce job losses. It will shed 1,200 jobs. Japan's economy will not grow at all this calendar year, according to latest estimates by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, revising down its provisional growth forecast of 1 per cent last July. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the OECD's economic department, told Japanese newspapers growth would be slightly less than 2 per cent next year. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, called the estimate 'pessimistic', but admitted that recovery had been stalled by an unusually cool summer and a stronger than expected yen. However, he saw no reason to devalue the yen, in response to news conference questions.</p>

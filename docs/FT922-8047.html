			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Partial reprieve for spotted owl in logging lands THE US administration yesterday gave a partial reprieve to the Northern Spotted Owl, but proposed sharp reductions in the conservation areas set aside for the threatened species. It also agreed to allow logging in a portion of the ancient Oregon forest that provides the bird's habitat. The Endangered Species Committee (known as the God Squad because of its power to condemn a species to extinction if it sees a greater public interest) agreed to let the federal Bureau of Land Management sell timber on 13 parcels of land, although logging there might jeopardise the owl's existence. Only once, in 1979, had the committee overruled the requirements of the Endangered Species Act by granting such an exemption. Also, Mr Manuel Lujan, Interior Secretary, proposed a plan he said would stabilise the spotted owl population, but would cut the federal land set aside for the birds from 5.4m acres to 2.8m acres. An alternative plan which would have aimed not merely at preserving the owl population but at restoring its numbers would cost 32,000 jobs in the region, the Interior Department said. 'Our preservation plan takes a common sense, middle ground approach that will save more than half of the 32,100 timber industry and related jobs that would be lost through strict compliance with the Endangered Species Act,' Mr Lujan said. 'It will give us a better than even chance that the owl will be preserved for the next 100 years.' The fate of the spotted owl has become the focus and the symbol for the conflict between jobs and environmental protection in the north-western US, which is heavily dependent on the timber industry.</p>

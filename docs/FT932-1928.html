			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Thais make a mess of their muddling - Motorway contract row unsettles investors THE THAI government's decision recently to flout a Dollars 1bn contract for an elevated motorway in Bangkok has unsettled international bankers and will make it harder to finance planned infrastructure projects worth at least Dollars 30bn, bankers and businessmen say. The row over the so-called 'Second-Stage Expressway' has undermined the reputation of Thai technocrats for being able to muddle their way through the country's widespread corruption and near-impenetrable bureaucracy to keep the economy thriving. Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL), a construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan and financed by Thai and foreign banks, signed a 30-year contract to build and operate the new road with the state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) in 1988. With the first 20km section of the road all but complete, consortium members and lenders accuse the government of breaching the agreement on several counts, especially by refusing to allow the operators to charge the Bt30 (78 pence) toll for cars clearly specified in the contract; the government says the toll will be 20 baht. 'If we had known that these would have been the terms of the contract there would have been no deal and no money. It's as simple as that,' said one foreign banker involved in the deal. 'No one plays around with project financing deals, not the Philippines, not China, no one, because they know that if they do, then at the very least it will cost the country more to get funding in the future,' he said. Thailand has a record of military coups and rapid changes of government, and projects approved by one government have often been dismissed or altered by the next on the grounds of corruption or unsuitability. But the expressway decision is unusual because the breach of contract is so blatant and because it has infuriated the Japanese, the leading foreign investors in Thailand. For once the Thais cannot claim that the dispute results from the failure of inflexible westerners to understand the 'Asian way' of doing business. Even before the second-stage expressway row came to a head another Japanese construction group, Obayashi, decided to throw in the towel after more than two years of negotiations to build Bangkok's third-stage expressway. Bankers to Obayashi said the company was bewildered by the number of government agencies responsible for road transport, which forestalled any agreement on a route for the road and made it impossible to raise money for the purchase of land. Meanwhile, the Dollars 500m, two-thirds completed Don Muang tollway - which runs between central Bangkok and the airport - is running into financing problems because its bankers are loath to lend more money for cost overruns during a continuous battle with the government over the terms of the contract. 'The government of Thailand is considered less and less a reliable partner and that makes it difficult to get money,' says Mr Hans Roth, Don Muang Tollway's general manager. Foreign bankers have also given a lukewarm reception to a project by Tanayong, a local property company, to arrange the building of an Dollars 880m elevated railway. Mr Chai Na Sylvanta, vice-president of Bangkok Bank and financial consultant to the project, has been quoted as saying that foreign bankers will not lend money to the scheme until the government honours the second-stage expressway contract. With the Thai economy growing at more than 7 per cent a year, billions more dollars from foreign and local investors are needed for everything from power stations and telephone lines to sewage works (see table). A deal to open the second-stage expressway is likely to be worked out in the end - one possibility is that the Thai banks will buy out the foreign investors - but much damage to Thailand's reputation has already been done. Senior government ministers admit they are failing to adhere to the letter of the contract, but remain unrepentant. They say traffic flows will be double the original predictions and insist that they will protect BECL, and therefore the foreign creditors, by giving the consortium its original cut: Bt18 per car or 60 per cent of the agreed Bt30 toll. But with the toll at Bt20, that leaves only Bt2 per car for the ETA, crippling for an organisation which is supposed to buy more land, co-operate with BECL for future sections of the new expressway and repay previous loans to Japanese and other creditors. The ETA would have to be subsidised by the state. The coalition government's justification for breaking the contract is that Bangkok's motorists would be angered by high toll fees, but most of its MPs were elected on a platform of helping the poor and redistributing wealth to the provinces. Apparently to appease the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party, which is part of the coalition and has strong support in the capital, the government has decided to make taxpayers throughout the country help pay for the new road. It has managed to infuriate foreign investors in the process.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         SEVENTH NATIONAL PLAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS - 1992-1996  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Project                                      Estimated     Duration                                                cost                                             (dollarsm)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All energy-related projects                    11,071       1992-96 Bangkok 2m telephone lines                      3,922       1992-96 Nong Ngu Hao International Airport              3,200       By 2000 Hopewell elevated railway (60km)                3,137       1991-01 Provincial 1m telephone lines                   1,961       1992-96 MRTA Skytrain (19km)                            1,804       By 1997 Second stage expressway (40.5km)                1,176       1991-95 Provincial highways                             1,145       1990-95 Tanayong electric train                           800       1992-96 Third stage expressway (31km)                     878       1995-00 Ekamai-Ramindra expressway (18.7km)               412       1994-96 Don Muang tollway                                 408       1991-94 Optical fibre network                             373       1992-93 Thailand national satellite project               216          1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Board of Investment Review, Vol 2 No 1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) proposed to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ  -- of Japan] Saturday [25 June] its version of policy guidelines  for a new government that would succeed the administration of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    LDP President Yohei Kono and Ryutaro Hashimoto, chief of the  party's Policy Research Council, met with SDP chairman Tomiichi  Murayama and presented him with the policy draft that the LDP  drew up in an attempt to forge a new coalition to replace the  Hata cabinet which stepped down en mass Saturday morning, party  sources said.    The LDP, which dominated Japan's politics for 38 years,  became the primary opposition party last August after it failed  to retain a majority in the Diet following the July elections of  the powerful House of Representatives.    LDP officials said the LDP, still Japan's largest political  party, also presented its policy draft to Hata's Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government Party] and  other parties.    The SDP, which was a leading bloc in the administration of  Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, abandoned the coalition  in April to become the second-largest opposition party after a  feud with its coalition partners over a new intraparliamentary  group excluding the SDP.    The LDP's policy proposals are made up of seven points --  political reform, administrative reform, foreign affairs and  national security, economic measures, social welfare,  agriculture and education, the sources said.    The draft proposals spelled out that a new government will  eradicate the exclusivity and selfishness in the decision-making  process, the sources said.    Concerning North Korea's suspected nuclear program, the  draft  proposals said that Japan will make efforts to resolve the issue  peacefully through cooperation with the United States, China,  South Korea and Russia under the flag of the United Nations.    The policy proposals did not refer to "emergency  legislation"  to deal with crises, which has divided the political parties,  but mildly said the government will take as many steps as it can  to manage the country's security, they said.    The LDP has also pledged to take steps to ride out Japan's  prolonged economic slump and help reduce Japan's huge current  account surplus.    The ruling coalition parties, meanwhile, agreed Saturday  that  they will cease reconciliation talks with the SDP and see how  the LDP, as the leading opposition party, will move to form a  new government, coalition officials said.</p>

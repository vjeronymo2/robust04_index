			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Genting raises LIG stake London International Group said yesterday that Genting, the Malaysian casino and plantations company, had increased its stake in the UK rubber goods manufacturer to 9.53 per cent. Genting, Malaysia's fifth largest company with cash assets estimated at MDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 381m), acquired the shares through Powerstock, its London-based investment company. Its holding, which stood at 4.4 per cent in April, now totals 32.3m shares. Genting last year spent MDollars 150m on a 6 per cent stake in Lonrho, the UK conglomerate. It is believed to have sold the majority of that stake.</p>

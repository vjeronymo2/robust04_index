			<p>BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed says countries of  the South can meet the challenge of the so-called social clause  to be included in the Marrakesh Declaration if they stand  together.    The United States proposes to include Marrakesh Ministerial  Declaration, the clause of seeking a committment to address the  link between social and labor standards towards international  trade in the world trade organization.    The prime minister said this when replying to a question  posed to him at the news conference at the end of the fourth  G-15 summit in New Delhi. He said if the U.S. and other  developed nations insist on imposing a global minimum wage, it  will not be advantageous to the South nations. He pointed out  that cheap labor is the only comparative advantage the  developing world has against the developed nations. The  developed countries on the other hand, have full advantages,  namely, capital, technological knowhow, management and marketing  know-how, and huge domestic markets.</p>

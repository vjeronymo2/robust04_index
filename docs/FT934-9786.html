			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Light trading in two new Lloyd's trusts SHARES in two of the new Lloyd's investment trusts began trading yesterday. Hiscox Select Insurance Fund immediately moved to a 10p premium compared to net asset value with the shares closing at 110p. Hiscox has raised some Pounds 30m in capital. The larger HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust, which raised Pounds 65m when it was launched late last month, closed 1p up at 101p. Trading was relatively light with 765,000 shares in Hiscox and 112,000 shares in HCG changing hands. Analysts suggest investor interest in listed shares will be restricted until all the trusts have come to the market. 'They are coming thick and fast at the moment. Interest will be limited until they are all fully traded,' said one specialist. Ten trusts have now raised more than Pounds 600m in equity capital to support underwriting at the Lloyd's market. Two of the largest schemes, London Insurance Market Investment Trust and CLM Insurance Fund were both launched last week.</p>

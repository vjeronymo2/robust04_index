			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Insolvency Service commission The government is to commission new work examining the feasibility of handing parts of the work of the Insolvency Service to the private sector, Richard Lapper writes. The announcement follows the completion late last year of a study by Stoy Hayward, the accountants. It concluded that the private sector could handle most of the mechanical processing of bankruptcy and compulsory liquidations work, leaving the official receivers to concentrate on their investigative role. In answer to a parliamentary question, Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister for corporate affairs, said that Stoy Hayward's findings 'provide a sufficient basis for further, more detailed work'. If the work reveals 'likely value-for-money gains' the government will consider the possibility of 'live trials in one or more regions'. It is expected that the government will appoint consultants to carry out the new work before the end of the month.</p>

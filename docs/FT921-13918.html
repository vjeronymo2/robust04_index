			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Reality at the epicentre of recession - Wall Street POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY made a virtue of intellectual honesty this week as both the US President and the chairman of America's biggest bank stared reality in the face and issued a string of mea culpas. For George Bush the occasion was a campaign visit to New Hampshire, where - after assuring voters that he was not going to 'throw up' again - he said the nation's economy was in a free fall and admitted he needed to exert stronger leadership on domestic issues. The US economy is not exactly in a free fall, but it does appear to be headed for the much feared double dip recession. 'I've known this economy is in a free fall. Maybe I haven't conveyed it as well as I should have, but I do understand it,' said a seemingly chastened Bush. Back in New York, one of the epicentres of the US recession, the embattled John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, also issued an apology or two. After ousting the head of his global corporate banking division - and announcing a Dollars 450m (Pounds 251.3m) to Dollars 475m loss for 1991 and Dollars 650m of fourth quarter commercial loan write-offs and writedowns - Reed put on sackcloth and ashes. 'One of the things I have been correctly criticised for is that the management (of the corporate division) has produced some pretty horrendous results,' said the Citicorp chief. 'We are guilty of having run the business a bit cavalierly,' he added. Reed's management changes, and a promise that his Dollars 1.7bn cost-cutting scheme is on track, gave Citicorp's depressed share price a boost. The effect of Bush's new policy of admitting times are tough has yet to be judged by voters. The relative intellectual honesty of Wall Street, however, is quite another matter. Many investors, both institutional and individual, have clearly made up their minds that economic recovery is coming in the latter half of 1992. That conviction, together with the desire to shift away from instruments such as bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit  - all of them yielding less since last month's full-point cut in the discount rate - accounts for the rally that has been under way since late last month. Trading volume has been heavy in recent days, up above the 300m share mark on two occasions this week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 12 per cent since the Fed's interest rate cut on December 20. This is not the first time that lemming-like equity investors have gone on a buying spree that is based on the discounting of future economic recovery. It happened just 12 months ago, even as bombs were falling on Baghdad. At that time the rally was driven by confidence in the security and price of Gulf oil supplies, combined with predictions of a second half 1991 recovery. The oil price stayed low, but the recovery failed to materialise. Now, with parts of the US economy apparently still contracting, the optimists are again making the running. It may be that corporate America has seen the worst in recent quarters, and it may be that lower interest rates and an expected election year package of tax cut gimmicks will restore confidence to the US consumer, but few in finance and industry appear willing to recognise the economy's deep structural problems. One cannot help thinking that Wall Street's rally may be another example of the market's propensity for short-term, superficial behaviour. Investment patterns in the troubled US banking industry offer slightly more in the way of logic. The fourth quarter results from banks such as Chase Manhattan, Bank of America, Security Pacific, Chemical Banking and even Citicorp included no new shocks, which was a comfort. Bottom fishing has become quite the vogue, and where better to start than with Citicorp? Just before the interest rate cut last month 20, Citicorp's share price stood at a measly Dollars 8 1/2 . Jim McDermott, of analysts Keefe Bruyette, says worries about Citicorp were such that 'last month you couldn't give the stock away at Dollars 8 1/2 .' The bank's share price has underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index by about a third over the past 12 months, but has bounced back. This week's announcements, including plans to divest itself of its remaining 49.7 per cent stake in Ambac, the municipal bond insurer, have helped Citicorp's share price to rise by more than 35 per cent over the past seven days. Analysts say investors now see banks as recovery stocks that will outperform the market this year. The question that remains is how long it will take for the banking sector, like the rest of the US economy, to justify Wall Street's faith in the future.  --------------------------------- Monday      3185.60  -  13.86 Tuesday     3246.20  +  60.60 Wednesday   3258.50  +  12.30 Thursday    3249.55  -  8.95 Friday      3264.98  +  15.43  ---------------------------------</p>

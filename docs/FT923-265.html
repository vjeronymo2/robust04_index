			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Fudge-free accounting plans 'incompatible with reality' ATTEMPTS TO introduce accounting standards which do not permit financial information to be 'fudged' are not compatible with providing a true and fair view of the underlying realities of a company, a circular from MAP Securities warned yesterday. Mr David Damant, chairman of MAP, the stockbroking and corporate finance house which is part of Spanish insurance group Mapfre Mutualidad, also called for a redefinition of the concept of earnings. He said that many critics of existing accounting practice in the UK have argued that standards are too flexible and depend too much on the judgment of a company and its auditor. Many called for 'unfudgeable' rules to guide good behaviour and provide a firmer basis upon which auditors can work. But, he argued, this would contradict the requirement for accounts to present the true and fair view essential for the efficient operating of the equity markets. Reality is too complex and the figures often rely on careful case-by-case judgments which cannot always be reduced to firm rules, he said. Mr Damant also argues - in a separate paper - that a single definition of earnings on the profit and loss account cannot be both correct and unfudgeable. The word 'earnings' is not neutral, he says, but rather implies a measure of the operating performance of a company and should therefore reflect the maintainable profit or loss. Any other definition will make earnings too volatile and make limited sense of price/earnings ratios. Earnings may sometimes exclude both extraordinary and exceptional losses or gains, but this will require careful judgments in each case, he adds. Damant suggests that the word earnings should be replaced on the bottom line of the profit and loss account with a phrase such as 'net income for the year'. At the same time, he says, there is a need for adequate disclosure of the information required to to calculate a meaningful level of performance. Earnings; Unfudgeability.

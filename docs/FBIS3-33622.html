			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Rubio in Chiapas from the "First Thing </F> in the Morning" newscast; passages within quotation marks  recorded]    [Text] Agreements have already been reached on five points,  which constitute one-fourth of the neo-Zapatists' [as heard]  demands.    [Zapatist Subcommander Marcos] "So far, we have received  satisfactory replies to our demands on the following points:  health, education, true and timely information, housing, and  respect for culture, traditions, rights, and the dignity of the  Indian groups in Mexico."    Other, more complex demands which were not mentioned will be  submitted to advisory groups for study, and, even Marcos has  admitted, there are other proposals that go beyond the  possibilities of these negotiations.    [Subcommander Marcos] "Let it be understood that what the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] wants is that just like  the war was decided in a democratic manner, peace must  necessarily follow the same democratic procedure."    The rebel subcommander and EZLN delegates are not rushing to  reach definite agreements.    [Subcommander Marcos] "You must return to your areas; you  must return to your committees and explain to your companions  the proposals you have received regarding the points which  started our movement on 1 January 1994. The communities will  then decide yes or no."    [Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis] "We are making  much  faster progress in discussing these problems than I expected at  the beginning of these meetings."    Camacho Solis announced he will follow a similar process.    [Camacho Solis] "I will report to the president of the  republic on each one of the points we have agreed on. I will  also report to the mixed commission of senators and deputies,  and I will seek to report to the main political forces  [pauses]... to all the political forces of the country so there  will be a broad consensus."    New faces were seen during the third day of negotiations in  San Cristobal de las Casas. These included Monterrey Archbishop  Adolfo Suarez; Oaxaca Archbishop Hector Gonzalez; and Bishops  Carlos Talavera from (Cuatzacualcos), Felipe Aguirre from Tuxtla  Gutierrez, and Felipe Arismendi from Tapachula. They are all  members of a special commission of the Mexican Bishops  Conference, which is following the peace process. They will meet  with political parties representatives and leaders of  nongovernmental organizations.    (Arturo Warman), ombudsman for agrarian affairs, was also  seen here. He is studying the possible juridical modifications  that will result from agreements over the land problems.</p>

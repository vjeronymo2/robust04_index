			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 6 SAPA -- The defeated African National  Congress in KwaZulu/Natal on Friday [8 May] greeted the news  that it had lost the province to its arch-rival Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] with distaste.    ANC Southern Natal spokesman Dumisani Makhaye claimed the  elections in the province had been fraudulent and the results  would rest on the consciences of Independent Electoral  Commission leaders. "All the evidence is of massive rigging in  terms of millions...Even the IFP knows it didn't win Natal," he  said, adding that "the overwhelming majority of people in Natal  will not accept the results".    Mr Makhaye said it was now up to the ANC leadership to  consult its followers for a mandate on a course of action and  strategy to deal with the defeat. Mr Makhaye's sentiments were  echoed by Northern Natal ANC Chairman Bheki Ntuli who said "it's  distressing that they've won after such great intimidation of  our members". Mr Ntuli said the ANC was "a mature political  organisation" and its reaction to the IFP's success was not  "sour grapes".    The IFP won KwaZulu/Natal with 50.3 per cent of the votes  compared to the ANC's 32.2 per cent. A total of 3.7 million  people voted in the province.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFIT TAKING SENDS DOW DOWN 4  </P> <P> The stock market retreated further Thursday as some investors took profits from  the recent rally and others held back from buying ahead of the January jobs  report due out today. The Dow Jones industrial index ended down 4.46 points at  2,333.75, extending its modest 4.11-point loss on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. Big Board volume came to 183.43 million  shares, down from 215.64 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> "It's a very benign decline," said Jon Groveman, head trader at Ladenburg  Thalmann. "People are lightening their positions ahead of the employment  report."  </P> <P> The report is viewed as a good gauge of the economy's strength and therefore  provides a clue as to whether the Federal Reserve will feel pressured to nudge  rates higher.  </P> <P> "It's basically at a standstill while we wait for the numbers," said trader Ken  Ducey of S. G. Warburg. Economists expect that 291,000 jobs were created last  month, up from 279,000 in December, and that the jobless rate remained  unchanged at 5.3%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Substantial Rally  </P> <P> "Basically you're seeing people nervously taking profits after the explosion we  had last week and early this week," said James McCarthy, a technical analyst  with Paine Webber Inc.  </P> <P> In the six sessions leading to Wednesday, the Dow index tacked on more than 100  points in a rally helped by firm U.S. Treasury bond prices and a rising dollar.  </P> <P> The mild profit taking of the past two days is "probably healthy for the market  from a technical standpoint and could establish a new zone of support that  would take the market higher over the intermediate term," McCarthy said.  </P> <P> Many analysts agree that the market's tone looks good. "The short-term trend is  definitely up," said Groveman of Ladenburg Thalmann. "Sentiment is definitely  starting to change."  </P> <P> "People who are uncommitted are looking for an entry point," said Michael Metz  of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Some high-technology stocks were strong, continuing to benefit from recent  earnings reports that exceeded expectations.  </P> <P> Stocks closed higher in active trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei  225-share index, which fell 220.62 points Wednesday, gained 137.62 to close at  31,498.30. Share prices also rose on the London Stock Exchange after the  market's already bullish mood was boosted by the government's approval of the  $5-billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC. The Financial Times 100-share  index closed 3.7 points higher at 2,043.4.  </P></p>

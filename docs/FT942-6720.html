			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Digital's finance chief resigns Digital Equipment's chief financial officer has resigned as the embattled computer company prepares for a broad restructuring to include about 20,000 job cuts. Mr William Steul, who has been chief financial officer since June 1992, is the second senior Digital executive to resign since the company reported far bigger than expected quarterly losses of Dollars 183m last month. Mr Edward Lucente, head of worldwide sales, also resigned unexpectedly. Digital said Mr Steul will be succeeded by Mr Vincent Mullarkey, Digital's controller since 1992 and who has long-standing ties to Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's chief executive. Mr Mullarkey's appointment 'is one of an ongoing series of steps we are taking to strengthen our management team,' said Mr Palmer, suggesting that further management changes may be planned. 'Digital is making steady progress toward the resumption of sustained profitability,' Mr Palmer said, 'the appointment accelerating that progress.' Prior to his latest position as controller, Mr Mullarkey had held a financial management position in Digital's semiconductor operations, which were headed by Mr Palmer before he was appointed chief executive in 1992. Mr Mullarkey's first task will be to develop restructuring plans which the company has said will be completed by the end of the fiscal year, in June. These plans are expected to include proposals to sell portions of the company's operations, as well as extensive workforce reductions. Analysts expect Digital to take a charge against earnings of about to Dollars 1bn to pay for cutbacks and lay-offs. In a further management change, Digital announced yesterday that Mr Bernhard Auer, manager of the company's European personal computer operations, has been promoted to take charge of the PC business world wide. He succeeds Mr Enrico Pesatori, who recently assumed additional responsibilities for all of Digital's computer operations and worldwide sales and marketing, following the resignation of Mr Lucente.</p>

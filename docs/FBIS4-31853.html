			<p>BFN     [Text] After we had started broadcasting our news program,  we received the following press communique regarding the  negotiations held today between the government and trade unions  from Government Spokesman Ioan Rosca:    [Begin Rosca recording] As is known, a number of protest  actions are currently taking place in Bucharest, that is,  protest rallies and marches organized under the protection of  the Cartel Alfa Trade Union Confederation. In contradiction  with the authorization granted to the organizers, they localized  their protest actions and blocked a part of the Victoria Square.  For about two days, approximately 300-400 people from Bucharest  and the provinces have been participating in this action and  they asked the government for negotiations on a list of four  claims.    Although the demonstration and the obstruction of the square  are illegal, the government agreed to hold discussions with the  representatives of trade unions and, in this respect, it  established a team of negotiators that includes: Mircea Dan  Popescu, minister of state and minister of labor and social  protection; Florin Georgescu, minister of state and minister of  finance; Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government;  and Octavian Partenie, secretary of state and the representative  of the government in relations with trade unions and the  employers' association.    We wish to mention that a first round of talks was held on  Tuesday, 14 June 1994, between 2215-0100, and all four claims of  the Cartel Alfa were approached. These claims, through their  content, demonstrate that the union representatives are not  aware of the executive's duties. The claims are mainly attempts  to destabilize the current situation in Romania and to attract a  large group of participants in this action, which obviously has  a populist nature.    The government believes that the recent demonstrations have  a  clearly political hidden motive as political leaders who belong  to the opposition have been noticed among the demonstrators.    A new round of talks was held between the government team  and  the representatives of trade unions this afternoon.    One of the claims refers to the minimum 50-percent increase  in salaries throughout the economy and the cancellation of the  current legal levers, with which our government is working, just  like governments in other countries that undergo a process of  transition, to reduce the negative effects of the salary  increase that could turn into the major source of inflation. We  note that the increase in salaries can be achieved solely  through direct dialogue and negotiations between trade union  organizations and the employers' association. The result of  these negotiations, which can take concrete shape in an increase  in salaries, depends exclusively on the financial potential  available to each trade company or private corporation at a  certain moment, financial potential that can result from the  increase of production and economic performance.    In accordance with the current laws, the government has no  authority to get involved in such a process. We wish to note  once again that the involvement of the government to force  companies and private companies to carry out a standard increase  of salaries is not possible, and that such a measure in no way  would lead to the restoration of the population's purchase  power, as the Alfa Cartel leaders claim, but it would lead  instead to the escalation of inflation and to the rapid  deterioration of the standard of living.    In connection with the request forwarded to the government  to  supplement by 500 billion lei the budget allotted to education  and, in correlation with it, to allot additional sums for the  other budgetary sectors, we note the following: As is known,  the state budget for 1994, which also includes provisions  regarding the funds allotted to various budgetary sectors,  including education, within the limit of the existing resources,  was approved by Romania's parliament, and the government,  through the legal duties incumbent on it, is called upon to  implement it. Thus, the government cannot respond to such a  claim, which would be against the law. Apart from the fact that  there are no such resources, the budget, as is known, registers  a 1.8 trillion lei deficit, to which solutions are still being  sought. On the other hand, complying with the same budgetary  provisions, the executive decided that in accordance with the  financial potential that remains to be identified through the  rectification of the budget, maximum priority will be granted to  the chapter on material expenditure and investment in education,  and then to the other budgetary sectors.    We remind the public that on the bases of the parliament's  examination and approval, we proceeded to the reestablishment of  the correlation between the salary of the personnel in this  sector and the other employees' salaries, by increasing, as of  September 1994, the basic salaries in the budgetary sector by  23-30 percent. We gave particular attention to granting a  higher percent of salary increase to the group of employees  whose work belongs to the category of top social services.    The second claim advanced by the Alfa Confederation does not  have the necessary legal foundation either. It refers to  actions of speeding up the act of concluding collective labor  contracts at all levels and offering guarantees that they will  be respected. We remind the public that, also in accordance  with the legal provisions currently in force, the conclusion of  these contracts is the sole duty of the two sides; that is the  trade unions and the employers' association.    However, the government again expresses its willingness to  support the proper unfolding of this action. In order to better  inform the public, we mention that there is only one  controversial point that stopped the signing of the collective  labor contracts. The trade unions ask that those who are not  trade union members should also be compelled to pay a certain  fee. The argument for this request is the idea that they also  enjoy the benefits of the provisions of the collective labor  contract.    The government cannot interfere in this case through  administrative measures either. A final decision has to be  taken through negotiations between the two sides that are, as we  have already mentioned, the trade unions and employers'  association.    To force employees to pay a fee through an administrative  decision would be at variance with democratic principles,  including the trade union democracy, and nobody can be permitted  to take such a decision.    The third claim referring to the recognition of labor groups  created after the revolution and the pensioning according to  these groups is absolutely useless. Romania's government has  never had the intention of modifying the practice of placing  employees in labor groups and granting pensions according to  them, created after the revolution or before that event.    Likewise, the government does not intend to carry out any  modification in the act of pensioning in accordance with the  labor groups and, in this respect, it presented a written  viewpoint to the trade union organizations. Thus, this is a  claim without substance.    The fourth and last claim refers to the compulsory  indexation  of salaries, including the minimum salary per economy. We wish  to remind the public that the government can decide on the  indexation of salaries in accordance with its prerogatives  solely in the budgetary sector and in the sector of social  protection, and can do it solely in direct correlation with the  foreseeable evolution of prices for each quarter.    For the other groups of employees, the government can only  recommend indexation, but the decision undoubtedly rests with  each trade company and private corporation, in accordance with  the financial potential of each of them.    The viewpoint of the government is that the increase in  salaries can be achieved only in two ways: by increasing  production and labor productivity or by restructuring commercial  companies.    The four claims of the Alfa Cartel bring us back to a period  that we thought belongs to the past, which is the command,  planned, and centralized economy and the implementation of those  claims would mean the administrative involvement of the  government in economy, on the basis of some prerogatives that it  does not possess and does not even wish to have, because this it  would mean the reinstallation of practices of the totalitarian  regime, from which, through joint efforts, we barely succeeded  in departing four years ago.    Romania's government is determined to support the  establishment of a society based on genuine democratic  principles, to build a competitive market economy that excludes  any interference through administrative levers in the economic  and social development of society.    Such demonstrations and protest actions that flagrantly  violate the legal provisions do nothing else but lead to the  destabilization of society, with very serious effects on the  whole reform process, and to the danger of losing everything  that has been obtained so far through the joint efforts of all  citizens: the economic increase, the reduction of inflation,  macro-economic stability, and international trust.    Just as has been done so far, the government expresses  openness for dialogue, but on a principled position, with the  realist approach to all issues that the trade union  confederations raise, and only if they are the subject of the  activity of the executive, as has been established by the law.

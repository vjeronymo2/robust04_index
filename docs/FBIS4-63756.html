			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Klaskowskaya: "Belarusian Popular Front </F> Calls for Unification of Democratic Forces During Election  Campaign"]    [Text] The Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] has held a news  conference, during, which a statement by the BNF Secretariat was  publicized. The statement, in particular, notes that Zyanon  Paznyak, a presidential candidate put forward by the BNF,  collected the largest number of supporting signatures among  those candidates who did not utilize the state apparatus in  collecting them. In the opinion of BNF leaders, this testifies  to the fact that Zyanon Paznyak is the most realistic contender  for the presidential post among democratically oriented  candidates.    The BNF calls for the unification of democratic forces  during  the election campaign, the organizers of the news conference  agreed. However, they expressed an apprehension that a likely  dispersion of votes among candidates of democratic orientation  can lead to the victory of pro-Communist forces. "Therefore, we  appeal to all those candidates who regard themselves as  democrats and to their supporting teams to consider a possible  withdrawal of their candidacies on behalf of the most realistic  contender," the statement notes. According to the BNF  leadership, such a step can encourage unity and the future  victory of Belarusian democratic forces.</p>

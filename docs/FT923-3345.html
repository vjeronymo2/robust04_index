			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Mitterrand illness brings speculation PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand was reported yesterday to be in 'satisfactory' health after undergoing prostate surgery. A medical bulletin said the operation on the 75-year-old president had taken place 'normally'. The surprise announcement came only nine days before the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty next Sunday. Presidential aides said Mr Mitterrand would stay in hospital for four to six days, but he firmly intended to cast his referendum vote in person and attend the Franco-African summit in Gabon in the first week of October. The officials' soothing words, however, are unlikely to dampen speculation about the president's political future, which was already rife before the operation. While they insisted that some 80,000 Frenchmen underwent successful prostate interventions every year, clinical tests still have to establish whether Mr Mitterrand's complaint was benign or whether he was suffering from a malignant tumour. Even if he recovers quickly, those Mitterrand supporters who would like to see him run for a third term at the next presidential election in 1995 must now consider the chances of this happening as greatly diminished. Mr Mitterrand's ill-health also makes it more likely that he would resign in the event of a No vote in the referendum, though he has repeatedly avoided committing himself to any course of action if that happens. It was not clear what effect the president's temporary incapacity will have on the referendum campaign in which he has played a crucial part. His impressive performance in a television debate nine days ago, at a time when the No campaigners had established a clear lead in the opinion polls, completely reversed the trend. Louis Harris and CSA polls, published last night, respectively gave the Yes camp 54 and 52 per cent of the vote. However, a BVA poll published today predicted a tie. Publication of official polls will be banned from midnight tonight until voting day, on September 20.</p>

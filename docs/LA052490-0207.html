			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 CAJUN, ZYDECO PROS KEEP MUSIC PURE, TRADITIONAL;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL: PURISTS WILL PERFORM THE MUSIC OF THEIR LOUISIANA HOMELAND IN LONG  BEACH THIS WEEKEND.  </P> <P> To Cajun and zydeco music veterans D.L. Menard and John Delafose, there's  nothing wrong with younger performers who mix elements of traditional Louisiana  music with rock, blues and modern-day country to reach a wider audience.  </P> <P> But for themselves, the music of their homeland is like air itself: the purer  the better.  </P> <P> In Menard's case, that means that as a guitarist, even though he has the  technical proficiency to toss off juicy jazz and blues licks, he mostly eschews  the fancy stuff in favor of basic three-chord strumming behind his old-timey  two-steps and waltzes.  </P> <P> For Delafose, it means still singing the bulk of his zesty zydeco songs in the  traditional Cajun French, instead of abandoning his native tongue to lure  English-speaking audiences.  </P> <P> And what that means to those who catch Menard and Delafose this weekend, at the  fourth annual Southern California Cajun and Zydeco Festival in Long Beach, is  that they'll be hearing rural Louisiana music pretty much the way it has  sounded for decades throughout Cajun country. (In addition to Saturday and  Sunday performances by Menard's Louisiana Aces and Delafose's family-dominated  Eunice Playboys, this year's lineup includes two other Louisiana acts --  relative newcomer Nathan (Williams) &amp; the Zydeco Cha-Chas and accordionist  Bruce Daigrepont's Cajun Band -- plus three California-based groups. There also  will be dance workshops and Cajun and Creole cooking available at booths set up  by local restaurateurs.)  </P> <P> Ask Menard and he'll be at the front of the line defending such crossover acts  as Beausoleil, Zachary Richard and Wayne Toups, who have gained ground in rock  circles.  </P> <P> "You play music the way you feel it," Menard, 58, said by phone last week from  his one-man chair factory in Erath, La., where he turns out custom wood  straight-backs and rockers when he isn't on tour. Road trips have taken him  around the United States several times as well as to Europe, Central and South  America and the Far East.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bother me if Wayne Toups jumps up and down on stage and does a  split -- I'm all for it, if that's the way he likes it. I feel like doing it  real straight -- that's the way I'm comfortable with it and that's the way I'll  keep on doing it."  </P> <P> Much in Menard's outlook can be traced back to a chance 10-minute chat with his  idol Hank Williams nearly 40 years ago, though he still talks about it as if it  happened last week.  </P> <P> "Hank Williams told me this one time -- he said: 'All music is good if it is  your music,' " said Menard, who has been dubbed the "Cajun Hank Williams" for  plaintive vocals that sound, when he sings in English, eerily like those of the  country-music giant.  </P> <P> It's a moniker he accepts politely, but with a blush. "It don't bother me. If  people see me that way, I'm grateful," he said in the distinctly syncopated  Cajun accent. "But there was only one Hank Williams and nobody is gonna touch  his shoes."  </P> <P> Menard's Louisiana Aces band currently includes his longtime, champion  fiddle-playing cohort Ken Smith and accordionist Eddie LeJeune, the son of  Cajun music great Iry LeJeune. In a warm-up for this weekend's festival, Menard  and his group will play a Cajun dance Friday at the War Memorial Hall in South  Pasadena.  </P> <P> John Delafose is often mentioned along with Boozoo Chavis, Rockin' Dopsie and  Buckwheat Zydeco's Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural as a leading contender for the  "King of Zydeco" crown left in 1987 by the death of Clifton Chenier.  </P> <P> But Delafose isn't particularly worried about when, or if, that crown will be  passed. Chenier is pretty much credited with inventing zydeco, the rollicking,  rhythm-and-blues infused strain of Cajun music, and Delafose, 51, notes that  "in Clifton's time, it was only Clifton for a while. But there are so many  (zydeco) bands around now, it's hard to have a single person as the people's  choice."  </P> <P> "Now," the accordionist added with a chuckle, over the phone from his home in  Eunice, La., about 40 miles northwest of Lafayette, "Rockin' Dopsie has got  himself a crown and says he's the king. But I think that should be appointed by  the people. Anyway, it's all right if I'm not the king -- as long as I get the  most gigs."  </P> <P> If Delafose has a concern, it's that too many bands may stray from the musical  source point. But his family is doing its part: Son Geno, who plays drums for  the Eunice Playboys, also plays accordion and speaks Cajun French, "so he's  gonna have a good zydeco band of his own one day." Another of Delafose's sons,  Tony, is the Playboys' bass player.  </P> <P> Some advocates hoped that "The Big Easy" film in 1987, with its Cajun and  zydeco-rich soundtrack, would catapult Louisiana music to the national  forefront the way "Urban Cowboy" did for country music in the early '80s.  Menard and Delafose don't fret much that it didn't work out that way.  </P> <P> "In some ways maybe people were disappointed, but it's still growing," said  Delafose, who also plays tonight at Patout's Cajun restaurant in Westwood and  Friday at Verbum Dei High School in Compton, which not coincidentally was  Clifton Chenier's favorite Southland concert stop.  </P> <P> "People come to (the annual New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage) festival from all  different areas," Delafose said. "Now there's other (Cajun-zydeco) festivals in  California, Texas, San Francisco, Rhode Island. People will go to a festival  and like it, then go home and spread it out."  </P> <P> In that respect, both men line up squarely in the corner of Southland  Cajun-Zydeco Festival organizer Franklin Zawacki, who organizes the Southern  California festival out of his brother's house in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I prefer the way it's going now," said Zawacki, a music lover who's more  likely to be found in front of the bandstand dancing Cajun style than  sequestered backstage in an office tallying gate receipts. "I'd rather have  people come to the music, like it and then love it, rather than wear it in a  hip fashion for a while and then lose interest next season."  </P> <P>  The fourth annual Southern California Cajun &amp; Zydeco Festival takes place  Saturday and Sunday from noon to 7 p.m. at the Rainbow Lagoon, Long Beach  Boulevard and Ocean Avenue, Long Beach. Tickets: $15 general; $12 students and  seniors; free for children under 12. Information: (213) 867-2215 or (714)  638-1466.  </P> <P> </P></p>

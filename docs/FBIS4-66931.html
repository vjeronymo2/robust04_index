			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Athens, 12 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "All initiatives  concerning the fundamental interests of stability and security  in Europe are best to be implemented within the CSCE framework."  Such is the position taken by the Russian diplomacy on the pact  for stability in Europe which is planned to be signed on 26-27  May in Paris, as members of the Russian delegation that took  part in a preparatory meeting of senior officials held in Athens  on Thursday told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today.    The meeting was attended by delegations from almost all  European countries, the United States and Canada, as well as  seven international organizations including the United Nations,  CSCE, the European Commission, WEU [Western European Union] and  NATO. The CIS countries were represented by delegations from  Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Armenia and Azerbaijan  were present as observers. [passage omitted: initiative of the  pact was originally proposed by French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, and later became an EC project]    As ITAR-TASS correspondent learned, Russian diplomatic  circles are especially concerned about the question of borders.  Russia believes that this question should be considered only on  the basis of such fundamental principles of the CSCE as  inviolability of the borders, respect for territorial integrity  of the states and their sovereignty. [passage omitted: general  topics under consideration at the conference included questions  of national minorities and setting up regional negotiation  tables for the Baltic and Central European regions]</p>

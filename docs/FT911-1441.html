			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Parcelforce aims to cut 550 jobs and raise prices PARCELFORCE, the parcels division of the Post Office, is to shed about 550 white-collar jobs by the end of this year and increase prices by an average of 26 per cent in an effort to stem losses arising from the recession and increased competition from private couriers. The programme to improve profit margins by cutting costs and raising prices is designed to help Parcelforce to break even this year. The division has gone into loss after making a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m last year on a turnover of about Pounds 600m. Parcelforce also plans to streamline its network of parcel sorting centres over the next two to three years, mainly by cutting its large regional parcel sorting centres from 18 to 12. The Post Office said that would not affect employment as more work would be transferred to local offices. Parcelforce is the market leader in the UK parcels market, but it faces growing competitive pressure from internal private courier groups such as Federal Express, TNT and United Parcel Services. The recession is thought to have cut overall parcel volumes by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. The division's financial position has also been affected by the corporation's efforts to focus the letters and parcels operations more clearly on their markets. Until this year, a sample of postal traffic had been used to divide revenues between parcels and letters. A more accurate system for measuring postal flows introduced this year found the parcels division had been awarded Pounds 60m more revenue than it had really earned. The transfer of that revenue to the letters division amounts to a 10 per cent cut in income and a 1.5 per cent increase in the letters revenue of Pounds 1.5m. The 550 job cuts among Parcelforce's staff of 12,500 will be achieved through natural wastage and voluntary redundancies, the corporation said. The price rises, which follow a 9.75 per cent increase in September, will be introduced from July 1.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Charter on rights rejected by ANC THE African National Congress (ANC) yesterday rejected the South African government's draft human rights charter, saying it was a prescription to maintain white privilege, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'The charter fails to outlaw discrimination and racism. The equality provision is extremely weak. The charter condones the disenfranchisement of the majority,' the ANC said in a statement. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee published a draft human rights charter on Tuesday that outlaws discrimination, but provides for capital punishment and detention without trial. The rejection came as angry taxi drivers yesterday continued their protests. They stoned buses and attacked bus drivers in Soweto, the biggest black township. Police tried to stop the protest spreading to central Johannesburg. Two people have been killed and dozens injured in running battles between police and the protesting taxi drivers. The drivers allege they are constantly harassed by police and seek government subsidies.</p>

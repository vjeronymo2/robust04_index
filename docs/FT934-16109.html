			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / More troops for Somalia: US will not cut and run from its mission, pledges Clinton PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, declaring that 'we must finish the work we set out to do', last night ordered the doubling of the US military presence in Somalia but promised that all but a few hundred non-combatant personnel would be home by March 31 next year. In a sober televised address from the Oval Office, which sought to define US policy, he insisted the US could not 'cut and run' and leave Somalia to the starvation and anarchy which prevailed before the US intervention last November. 'We need more strength to do our job,' Mr Clinton declared. To this end an additional 1,700 infantry troops and 104 armoured vehicles were being despatched immediately along with 3,600 Marines to be stationed offshore on an aircraft carrier and in two amphibious groups. Their mission, he said, would be to protect the 4,700 US troops already in Somalia, to keep open roads and airfields so that humanitarian supplies could still get through, to maintain pressure on those fighting US and UN forces and to give the Somalis time to achieve their own political solutions. In pursuit of the last goal he was sending Mr Robert Oakley, US envoy under President George Bush and at the beginning of the current administration, back to Somalia with the brief to facilitate negotiations. Mr Clinton did not mention by name General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the faction leader, whose forces killed 13 Americans in a bloody confrontation last weekend and another in Mogadishu yesterday. He said it was vital not to personalise any conflict. But he said that if the US pulled out forthwith, as some in Congress have demanded, 'aggressive thugs and terrorists would conclude the best way to change our policy was to kill our people'. The president said he was stepping up efforts to persuade other nations, including those in the region, to send in forces to replace Americans. Private US contractors would be invited to take over the logistical work undertaken by US troops. Repeatedly Mr Clinton emphasised that a political solution could only be reached by the Somalis themselves. He argued that until last June the US mission was clearly achieving success and that, although perhaps 1m Somalis still depended on relief supplies, there was plenty of evidence of life returning to normal outside Mogadishu, the capital. In the morning the president had held what was described by some as a 'spirited' session with leaders of both parties in congress. In spite of much criticism then vented, Mr Clinton at least had the satisfaction after his address of hearing Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, commend both his actions and his explanations. He also met a criticism from Mr Dole by stating that US troops in Somalia would be operating under American, not UN, command and control. Compounding problems for the administration is a post-mortem over why last weekend's raid on the forces of Gen Aideed went so badly wrong.</p>

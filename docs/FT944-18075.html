			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: News Corporation News Corporation's share price has dropped 6 per cent since it revealed a plan at the weekend to issue preference shares with restricted voting rights. Australian investors are worried that it could allow chairman Mr Rupert Murdoch to splash out on acquisitions without seeing any diminution of his family's 33 per cent voting strength. The scheme has echoes of last year's super-voting shares proposal, which was abandoned after institutional shareholders rallied behind the slogan of 'one share one vote'. While some aspects of the original scheme were objectionable, there is little wrong with the new plan. Nobody is forced to sell ordinary shares or buy preference shares. If some investors are happy to be disenfranchised, others should not cry foul. Rather, they should welcome the issue of preference shares as a way of expanding the group without taking debt on to its balance sheet - a course which nearly led to insolvency in 1990. There is, of course, a risk that a tie-up with a telecoms group or some other multimedia venture would prove unwise. But nobody should invest in News Corp in the first place if they do not back Mr Murdoch's strategic vision.</p>

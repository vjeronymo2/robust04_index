			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (2): Swing to nationalism deters the investors - Brazil AS A result of its nationalistic restrictions combined with domestic recession, Brazil's mining sector is suffering a dramatic investment crisis, in spite of having one of the world's richest subsoils. While other countries in Latin America have been busily changing their laws to encourage and compete over inward investment, Brazil's mining code of 1988 seems positively designed to frighten off foreign investors. Mr John Guzman, head of Rio Tinto Zinc in Brazil, says 'if there's one sure way to discourage foreign investment it is the current law which is totally out of step with the rest of the world. Instead of protecting the country it is hurting it.' According to figures of the National Mining Department (DNPM), investment is now down to a fifth of what it was 10 years ago and fell from Dollars 122m in 1988 to Dollars 46.2m in 1990. Last year it was even lower. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of tin, bauxite, aluminium and iron ore. Its iron ore reserves are believed to be equivalent to about a third of the world's total, its bauxite reserves are the largest in Latin America and it has important deposits of manganese, zinc, gold, tin, copper, kaolin, chromium and precious and semi-precious stones among many others. Yet relatively few of these minerals have been produced in significant quantities and Brazil's current mineral production represents only about 2 per cent of GDP - far below its potential. The fall in investment is expected to result in an increase in mineral imports by the end of this decade. Mr Jose Mizael, executive secretary of the Brazilian Mining Institute, attributes the situation largely to the restrictions on foreign investment introduced in the highly nationalist 1988 Constitution. This prohibits foreign companies from participating in the mining sector unless they have a majority Brazilian partner. Those already operating in Brazil must find a local partner to take control or industrialise production by this October to process minerals, or leave. Brazilian partners are hard to find in the current economic climate with recession in its third year and interest rates at more than 30 per cent a month, and Brazilian business has little tradition of investing in the mining sector where returns can often take 10 years. Around half of current total investment is provided by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the well respected state mining company, but state companies have had their budgets slashed as part of the government's austerity programme. The 1988 Constitution could hardly have been more effective at deterring foreign investment in mining. Those foreign companies that had already industrialised such as RTZ, which has been in Brazil 20 years, stayed but those which were exploring have pulled out or significantly reduced investments. The country's backward mining code is not the only impediment. Much of Brazil's untapped mineral wealth lies in remote parts of the Amazon where lack of infrastructure means high transport costs and environmental concerns mean taking special, and often costly, measures. Some is in the territory of Indian reserves where Congressional approval is required for exploration. Consequently until now the Amazon has largely remained the territory of garimpeiros - wildcat gold or tin miners who operate illegally throughout the jungle. Efforts in 1990 by the government of President Fernando Collor to wipe out the estimated 300,000 garimpeiros by dynamiting their airstrips petered out but lower gold prices and an exhaustion of easily accessible gold has reduced garimpeiro production. According to the DNPM, last year for the first time production from mining companies outweighed that from garimpeiros. What formal investment is going on in mining is aimed at maintaining Brazil's place in the world rather than advancing production. Last year mining production fell around 2.8 per cent to around Dollars 10bn mainly because of a decrease in gold and iron production. Gold production fell 12.4 per cent to 90 tonnes while iron ore production fell 1.5 per cent to 150m tonnes. Exports increased 7.2 per cent to Dollars 3.05bn of which 85 per cent was iron ore, but the country had a mineral trade deficit of nearly Dollars 2bn largely due to petroleum imports. The country's only new large project in recent years was Carajas, the world's biggest high grade iron ore mine with estimated reserves of 1.4bn tonnes. Built by CVRD, the Dollars 4bn project, which involves a special railway and port, has been coming on line since 1983. Situated in the Eastern Amazon the project has won worldwide credit for showing that environment and development can coexist. As a direct effect of falling investment, Brazil has had no significant discovery for more than a decade despite its considerable mineral riches and the situation is expected to deteriorate. More than half the country's geologists are unemployed and Mr Otto Bittencourt, a director of DNPM, says, 'we've retarded the discovery of new minerals. Geological mapping is falling further behind and this will have a very negative effect in the future'. He points out that a recent World Bank report said Brazil's mining sector has capacity to absorb average investments of Dollars 300m a year. In response to the situation, the Collor government has sent a project to Congress to end the discrimination against foreign capital as part of its modernisation programme. Mr Bittencourt says, 'everyone's competing for investments so we need to make sure we at least offer the same conditions'. However, although there is considerable consensus behind the change, constitutional amendments require a three-fifths vote and, with Mr Collor currently besieged by a torrent of allegations of corruption which could result in his impeachment, the new legislation is unlikely to be approved in the near future. Moreover, if Mr Collor does not survive, his successor, Mr Itamar Franco, the current vice-president, is expected to bring in as minister of mines Mr Aureliano Chaves, a man known for his strong nationalist tendencies.  -----------------------------------------------------------                 BRAZIL MINERAL OUTPUT TONNAGE                     (excludes oil and gas)  -----------------------------------------------------------                  1990 (revised)      1991 (provisional)  ----------------------------------------------------------- Bauxite               9,678,203             10,310,000 Asbestos                232,332                233,100 Kaolin                  710,000                839,600 Lead (1)                  9,291                  8,600 Copper (1)               34,441                 37,000 Chromite                256,453                336,900 Diatomite                13,279                 12,400 Tin (1)                  39,149                 29,300 Iron ore            152,250,000            150,000,000 Natural phosphate     2,967,916              3,278,600 Fluorite: acid grade     59,630                 54,800 Met. grade               24,850                 46,900 Gypsum                  827,953                880,300 Manganese             2,361,718              1,966,800 Pyrochlore               17,648                 18,100 Nickel (1)            1,459,247              1,590,000 Gold (kilogrammes)      101,728                 89,109 Scheelite (1)               513                    300 Zinc (1)                132,000                134,100  ----------------------------------------------------------- (1) metal in concentrate.

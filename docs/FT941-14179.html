			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Too harsh a view of life insurance industry Sir, You cannot imagine how disappointed we were to read the editorial, 'An end to foot-dragging' (January 12), concerning the life insurance industry, and in particular the resignation of Jim Stretton from the Personal Investment Authority board. To nail our colours to the mast, we are firm supporters of long standing of a single retail regulator. If the proposed constitution is too weighted towards public interest to achieve that objective, then greater practitioner in-volvement clearly is the answer. The KPMG report to which you refer obliquely, does not disclose that sales were made of personal pensions without proper advice. It only indicates that there were shortfalls in file notes and therefore there was no evidence on the files that certain actions had been carried out. Not one client nor one adviser has been interviewed in the course of the KPMG report to establish if any actual bad advice has been given. You mention that 'undesirable - and far too widespread - selling practices have been revealed'. Where? The life insurance industry delivers to its policy holders Pounds 3.4m in benefits every hour of every day (1992 ABI statistics). We have 10m policyholders and last year there were only 1,700 substantiated complaints handled by the ombudsman. The legal profession had 17,000 complaints and it is not taking the public berating that life insurance salespeople are taking. The Financial Times is well respected for researching its topics and publishing the facts. I have to say in this instance that the Life Insurance Association wishes to register its disquiet at the way you seem to suggest that the industry has been tried and convicted and is only waiting for sentence by a regulator yet to emerge. You might well look at the possibility that a complex commercial and regulatory situation is being exploited politically for ends we can only guess at. Finally, there have been accusations of mis-selling based on high surrender values in recent years. However, a recent Times report interestingly revealed government statistics that showed 28 per cent of the population (15.7m) were unemployed over the two year period 1991-93. I would ask you the question - is there a correlation between this statistic and the level of surrender values?

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Unicorp Energy forced to sell unit UNICORP Energy, once a key holding of Toronto financier Mr George Mann, has refinanced CDollars 320m (USDollars 268.90m) in loans and preferred stock due to mature on March 31. However, it must sell or merge its most prized asset, Union Energy, one of Ontario's two natural gas distributors. Unicorp has raised Dollars 440m from six banks to repay a Dollars 120m loan to National Bank of Canada, and repay preferred stock held mainly by the Edper group and the Reichmann family of Toronto. Under the refinancing terms, Unicorp has a fixed period in which to sell or merge Union Energy. Unicorp lost Dollars 12m, or 2.80 a share, in 1991 against a loss of Dollars 1.62 a share in 1990. Besides the profitable gas distributor, it owns a troubled portfolio of property, financial services and other energy assets. Diners Club, through Citibank Canada, is buying Air Canada's enRoute credit card business. With it goes a contract to supply the credit cards used by federal government employees when they travel. Air Canada has been trying to sell enRoute for more than a year.</p>

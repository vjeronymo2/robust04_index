			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: BETTER SKIP MAIL-ORDER DIAGNOSIS  </P> <P> A Tufts University student walked into introductory nutrition recently and  handed one of us a thick booklet. It had come from a "wellness center" in  California where her mother was considering signing on for an evaluation. The  student had a healthy skepticism about what was being offered her mother --  skepticism that was right on target.  </P> <P> Here's how the program worked. For a fee of $125, payable in advance, the  subscriber would get "56 chemistries, a consultation and a month of answers to  questions." A postscript advised that follow-up by mail at $50 for three  months, or at the bargain cost of $150 a year, or in-person appointments at $50  each were "highly beneficial" to success in a "new lifestyle of optimum  health."  </P> <P> According to the cover letter, laboratories where the chemical analyses can be  performed are available in eight states from Maine to Hawaii.  </P> <P> In the next section, the subscriber was asked to furnish an extensive and  somewhat strange health history, reminiscent of those used by charlatans for  decades. It asked about a host of symptoms and conditions, from the specific,  such as diabetes or high blood pressure, to the very vague: chronic fatigue,  inability to concentrate, mucus and stress. From this laundry list, the  "nutritionist" in charge will identify symptoms that supplements can correct.  </P> <P> The inventory also includes a profile of typical food intake, medication use,  exercise and, most specifically, an "elimination record." Then follows a  patient "stool evaluation," an in-depth inquiry into color, odor and  consistency. If you're beginning to squirm at this point, so were we. But hold  on, it gets worse.  </P> <P> On the final page of the history, the individual is asked to perform a test of  colon transit time, taking a "moderate" serving of corn or beets and noting  when the vegetable shows up in the feces. Too long a transit time may signal  "suboptimal colon health," while a very rapid transit time "may indicate poor  absorption and assimilation of nutrients."  </P> <P> Next comes a disclaimer, which must be signed by the subscriber and witnessed.  It can be described only as a mixture of gobbledygook and legal cover. And as  you might expect, the last three pages are order blanks. One is for books,  tapes and videos (costing as much as $49 for "Miracle Man"). Two are for  "metabolic" products, to "temporarily spark normal functions." Curiously, of  some 68 products on the list, just three can be clearly identified as  nutrients, and none is likely to be in short supply in the diet.  </P> <P> We can sum up this program in one word: outrageous. Without going into a  point-by-point review, two highlights should serve to illustrate. First, many  of the analyses offered are reliable only if done rigorously in laboratories  with the highest standards. When these tests are done correctly and  abnormalities are found, they are considered along with other evidence from a  physical examination by a physician, who then decides whether and what  treatment is necessary.  </P> <P> The doctor may feel that nutritional counseling is an important part of the  treatment. If so, he or she will refer the individual to a registered dietitian  or nutritionist properly trained in diet counseling. Based on a personal  interview, this professional will in turn suggest appropriate diet  modification, perhaps along with a multivitamin and mineral supplement at, but  not above, 100% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances, as a bit of insurance.  The regimen is unlikely to include such odd-sounding supplements as  "Energetic," "Tryptogenics," "Yin-plus" or "Germanium LC," the latter costing  as much as $50 for 30 capsules.  </P> <P> Second, the section focusing on lower-bowel function is particularly  bothersome. The appearance and odor of feces is influenced by many factors,  including diet. Normal variations generally are no cause for alarm. On the  other hand, blood in the stools, which can occur for several reasons, is a  symptom that demands immediate attention, not mail-order advice. That also goes  for other symptoms on the list.  </P> <P> It's true that most Americans could do well to eat a diet higher in fiber, and  that doing so shortens the length of time it takes for food to travel through  the digestive tract and for waste products to be excreted. But the so-called  "colon transit time test," looking for evidence of beets or corn in feces, is  absurd, unpleasant and diagnostically worthless.  </P> <P> Certainly there's nothing wrong with ordering multivitamin and mineral  supplements at 100% of the RDA from a catalogue, especially if they are well  priced. But beyond that, when it comes to mail-order nutrition advice, the best  place for the brochure is in the paper-recycling bin.  </P> <P> Question: I remember reading that garlic oil had caused botulism food  poisoning. I saw garlic oil recently in the grocery store where I shop. Is it  safe to eat?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes, it's safe. Following two outbreaks of botulism food poisoning  traced to garlic packed in oil, the Food and Drug Administration stepped in.  The agency now requires that garlic-in-oil mixtures that aren't heat-processed  and rely for safety on refrigeration must contain other protection: specified  levels of either substances that inhibit microbial growth or acidifying agents  such as citric or phosphoric acid.  </P> <P> In hindsight, it's easy to see why the food-poisoning cases occurred. To make  the mixture, minced garlic is combined with ice water and oil. Unfortunately,  the combination of a non-acid mixture (water), lack of oxygen in the jar and a  warm temperature created just the right environment for botulinum spores,  commonly found on many tubers and root vegetables, to germinate. The  microorganisms then grew, producing the very dangerous toxin.  </P> <P> In both cases, the problem was traced to improper handling. In other words,  consumers forgot to keep the product in the refrigerator, despite clear  directions on the label. Leaving the mixture out on the counter instead of in  the cold proved a critical error. Thanks to the new FDA regulation, the problem  is resolved. But this episode underscores the need for consumers to follow  directions on the label.  </P> <P> Q: I bought a prickly pear for the first time and really enjoyed it. Can you  tell me its nutritional value?  </P> <P> A: Prickly pear is the fruit of the cactus of the same name. A typical fruit  contains about 50 calories and more than one-third of the day's quota for  Vitamin C. It also provides small amounts of B vitamins and minerals. Whether  or not you eat the seeds is a matter of taste. Some like them; others find them  too hard.  </P> <P> Until recently, preparing prickly pears was like tangling with a porcupine: The  pears often came with spines still attached. One technique used was to singe  them before attempting to peel the fruit. Nowadays, though, the spines  generally are removed before the fruit appears in the supermarket.  </P> <P> Prickly pears are native to the Americas and were brought back to Spain in the  16th Century. They are known by several names, including Indian or Barbary  pears and tuna figs.  </P> <P> Q: My husband is a heart-attack survivor. He has given up smoking, is  attempting to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet and is taking medication to  bring down his cholesterol. Despite a doctor's advice to the contrary, he is  skeptical about whether this is of any value or whether, as he says, it's "too  late" for him. What do you say?  </P> <P> A: We can assure your husband that his efforts are worthwhile. It's true that  the extent of damage to the heart and the severity of coronary-artery disease  are more important predictors of risk of a second heart attack, especially in  the first few months, than is serum cholesterol. But evidence from a number of  studies of individuals who have already sustained one heart attack shows that,  over the longer term, reducing serum cholesterol is linked to lowered incidence  of both nonfatal and fatal heart attacks.  </P> <P> Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and his  colleagues reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that when data from  eight such studies were considered together, a 10% reduction in  serum-cholesterol levels led to a reduction of 19% and 12%, respectively, in  the number of nonfatal and fatal heart attacks.  </P> <P> These figures aren't much different from those in studies that focus on  individuals who are at risk of heart attacks but haven't yet sustained one. In  that group, the same cholesterol reduction led to a drop of 25% in nonfatal and  12% in fatal heart attacks.  </P> <P> As Rossouw points out, these studies have been conducted over relatively short  periods. Longer trials and more effective lowering of cholesterol could produce  even more positive results. So tell your husband to keep up the good work: He's  on the right track with his cholesterol-lowering efforts, and he needn't be  discouraged.  </P> <P> We would only hope that his healthier lifestyle also includes regular physical  exercise.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Confrontational Agitation Reversing Black and White" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  "unification minister" at the "coordinating meeting on the  reunification and security policy" driveled that "sanctions on  the North are inevitable" and "the international cooperation  system" must be intensified "to increase the pressure," alleging  that the North "is delaying" a solution to the "nuclear issue"  by refusing to accept the demand of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA].    Denouncing this as an outrageous and disgusting hokum, an  analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says:    As regards the replacement of the fuel rod at our atomic  power station, we voluntarily informed the IAEA of this plan and  allowed the inspectors of the agency to observe the process of  the replacement and verify that the nuclear materials are not  diverted to a non-peaceful purpose.    This notwithstanding, the South Korean puppets are again  crying for "sanctions" and "international cooperation system"  with preposterous arguments. This is an unpardonable  treacherous act motivated by the sinister intention to block a  peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula  and harm and stifle fellow countrymen over the "nuclear issue".    When they linked the North's proposal of negotiations for  establishing a new peace arrangement in place of the present  armistice body with the "nuclear issue", they sought to obstruct  the negotiations between the DPRK and the United States for the  guarantee of peace.    The reckless remarks of the "unification minister" clearly  show once again how frantically the South Korean puppets are  trying to harm and stifle the North over the "nuclear issue".    Those who commit treacheries must be removed from the  nation.</p>

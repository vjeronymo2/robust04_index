			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South  Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su met with  U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor in the Moroccan  city of Marrakesh Wednesday to discuss such bilateral issues as  opening Korea's motor vehicle market and future use of the  feared super 301 provision.    They are among ministers and officials from more than 120  countries here to sign the landmark Uruguay Round accord giving  birth to the World Trade Organization [WTO], a more powerful  multilateral trade system than the current General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Kim explained Seoul's position on opening its motor vehicle  market and the two men agreed to discuss the matter further at  the working level.    Kantor cited examples of Korea's unfair trade practices,  taken from the USTR's National Trade Estimate (NTE) released  last month, and called for elimination of tax discrimination  against foreign cars and psychological prejudice created by  labeling them an extravagance.    Kim admitted Kantor had a point, considering that foreign  cars account for a meager 0.2 percent of the domestic market,  but said more time and intra-governmental coordination are  needed to resolve the problem. Noting that discussions were  under way on acquisition and special excise tax cuts, he said  nothing has been decided yet.    He pointed out that reauthorization of Super 301 ran counter  to multilateral rules with the WTO's birth and advised prudence  on its application.    The trade minister also detailed Seoul's efforts on  intellectual property rights and asked Washington to move Korea  to the watch list from its current spot on the priority watch  list at this month's screening.    Kantor went further to ask that the tax on dyes and  petroleum  resin be cut to 6.5 percent from the current 13 percent, while  Kim sought a correction in random anti-dumping action on Korean  color televisions and oil pipelines.    Earlier in the day, Kim had a breakfast meeting with his  Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) counterparts and  discussed the date, place and agenda of a trade ministers'  meeting slated for this fall. Kantor proposed that the meeting  take place in Los Angeles.</p>

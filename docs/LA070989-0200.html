			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOWEN BUILDINGS RAZED FOR HOMES  </P> <P> Recently, through a tragic turn of events, a major developer won permission to  destroy a Huntington Beach landmark and build six upper-income, single-family  dwellings directly across the street from the new Civic Center parking lot. His  profit, according to data in the environmental impact report, will be slightly  less than $400,000. The cost of his project to this city is virtually  inestimable.  </P> <P> As you drive by these homes in the future and see the bronze marker identifying  the location of the former landmark structures, the Bowen Buildings, try to  estimate the value of what was lost: an $8-million petroleum museum, once  offered at virtually no expense to the city of Huntington Beach; positive  recognition as the location of the only such museum in the Los Angeles basin;  and retention of a historic landmark of major significance.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission and the City Council had the opportunity to evaluate  the proposal for this grand museum and determine for themselves if it was  feasible. They failed. How many more opportunities for cultural advancement  will be ignored because they do not fit into city leaders' previously conceived  plans?  </P> <P> A modern city is seldom evaluated on just the number of expensive houses it has  built. Houses can be built anywhere. The factors that contribute to the quality  of life are those that are unique to an individual city or that offer cultural  and social advantages. It is, unfortunately, too late for this cultural jewel.  Will Huntington Beach also lose the next one, and the one after that?  </P> <P> BARBARA MILKOVICH  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

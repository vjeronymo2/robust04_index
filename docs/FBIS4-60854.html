According to the agreement, Russia sells weapon to Turkey.    The declaration says, "This bargain was arranged when  Germany, a NATO partner of Turkey, made up its mind to stop  weapons delivery to Turkey because these weapons are being  finally used against the civil population of Kurdistan.    In the opinion of the authors of the declaration, Turkey  uses  these weapons not only against the Kurds but also will threaten  Armenia -- a member of the CIS, a state which participates in  the Collective Security Treaty.    The declaration also mentions that these weapons will be  delivered by Turkey to Azerbaijan to be used against the civil  people of Karabakh. This bargain is aimed not only against the  people of Kurdistan fighting for freedom and independence but  also against the interests of Russia and its CIS partners.    The "Kurdistan" Committee and the Council of Kurd  intelligentsia appeals to the deputies of the State Duma of  Russia, social and political organizations, all the people of  Russia raise their voice against such bargains.</p>

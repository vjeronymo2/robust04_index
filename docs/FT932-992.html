			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Vibroplant confirms decline PRE-TAX profits at Vibroplant, the plant hire group with operations in the UK and the US, fell from Pounds 4.51m to Pounds 1.9m in the year to March 31 1993 - as foreshadowed at the interim stage. A reduced final dividend of 1.28p cuts the total to 2.5p (3.6p), covered by earnings of 2.66p (6.55p) per share. The shares were unchanged at 66p. Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman, said the results in the UK had been affected by Alphabet Event Hire, which was acquired in February 1992. It had been expected to break even, but had run up 'a few thousand pounds' of losses. More important, though, was the squeeze on prices throughout the whole UK side. Volume and activity levels had been similar to the previous year, said Mr Pilkington, but prices had been 'significantly and painfully cheaper'. UK turnover fell to Pounds 34.9m (Pounds 37.9m), with profits at the operating level at Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4.83m) and at the pre-tax level Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 3.27m). In the US, where the group only hires out aerial work platforms and during the year combined the various subsidiaries into one, the promised recovery had not happened. Turnover there declined to Pounds 35m (Pounds 38.9m) and pre-tax profits to Pounds 608,000 (Pounds 1.24m). A bright spot was the group's strong cash flow which helped reduce gearing to 50 per cent from the 90 per cent level of two years ago. Mr Pilkington's short-term aim is for another Pounds 8m-Pounds 10m to be paid down this year, bringing gearing down to the mid-30s.</p>

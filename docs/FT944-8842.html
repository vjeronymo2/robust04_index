			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Chinese fail to rein in prices China yesterday issued another urgent call for belt-tightening as inflation defied controls, the value of industrial output surged and the goal of cooling the booming economy receded out of sight. Consumer price inflation was a year-on-year 27.7 per cent in October, the State Statistical Bureau said in a report carried by the official Xinhua news agency. The consumer price index in October was 1.7 per cent higher than in September. For a chosen group of 35 cities, the index rose by 24.8 per cent compared with the same month in 1993 and was 1.0 per cent higher than in September, indicating that urban price rises may be slowing. China has adopted urgent measures to control inflation, including limiting new construction projects and squeezing credit, but has already said it will fail to hold price rises to its target of 10 per cent this year. Retail sales in October jumped by 37.4 per cent to Yn144.4bn (Pounds 10.3bn), the biggest monthly rise this year, the bureau said. The Finance Ministry directive, broadcast on state radio, ordered departments and state enterprises not to exceed wage and bonus limits before the end of the year and to curb what it called rapid growth in the spending of state funds on consumer items. The value of industrial output in October rose 24.3 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Yn142.6bn or a 6 per cent increase compared with September when calculated on a daily basis, the statistics bureau said.</p>

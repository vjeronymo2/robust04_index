			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the </F> coalition member Japan New Party, by unidentified NHK reporter  at Japan New Party headquarters in Tokyo -- live via satellite;  from the "NHK News" program]    [Text] [NHK] What do you think of the general resignation  of the Hata cabinet?    [Matsuoka] I regret the Hata cabinet resigning en masse at a  time when political reform is on the verge of completion. If the  House of Representatives is dissolved, political reform will  disappear. We were really worried that the Hata cabinet would be  voted out of power in the Diet. Political reform should be  completed, and a host of domestic and foreign issues should be  tackled. The people do not hope for the dissolution of the  House of Representatives and the holding of general elections. I  would like to express my heartfelt respect for Mr. Hata's  decision on the general resignation of his cabinet.    [NHK] The dissolution of the House of Representatives and  the  holding of general elections have been avoided. What does the  Japan New Party [JNP] think of their avoidance?    [Matsuoka] As you know, political reform was initiated by  the  Hosokawa cabinet and the implementation of political reform has  been a task for the JNP. If the House of Representatives were  dissolved, political reform would disappear. The enactment of a  bill on demarcating the current constituencies will complete the  political reform. The JNP welcomes the prime minister's decision  to resign with his cabinet en masse.    [NHK] Who do you think is desirable to be the next prime  minister?    [Matsuoka] The next prime minister should continue to push  for reforms. The next prime minister should practice politics  for improvement of the people's livelihood and pursue clean  politics. The next prime minister should rally political forces  to overcome the present difficult time. This is what our party  thinks. As a partner in the ruling coalition, our party will  advocate the need to hold the ruling coalition parties together  at the meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition  parties. The ruling coalition parties have 180 seats in the  House of Representatives, and I believe that the will of 180  legislators cannot be ignored in running the Diet. The ruling  coalition parties intend to unite in the future. They have  affirmed their intentions to work together to resolve various  problems involving the people's livelihood and push for reforms.</p>

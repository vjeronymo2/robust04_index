			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin  said here today that China and Finland should tap their economic  cooperation potentials and further boost all-round ties.    Finland has its own features in many areas and its economic  cooperation with China should be expanded, Jiang told visiting  Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho here this afternoon.    China and Finland enjoy ties of friendship and mutual  respect, and in recent years the bilateral exchanges and  cooperation in fields of economy and trade, science and  technology and culture have been further developed, he said.    "We are satisfied with this," Jiang told the Finnish prime  minister. "Your current visit will further promote Sino-Finnish  relations in all fields," he added.    Aho noted that the long geographical distance does not  constitute a hindrance to the high-level contacts between the  two countries.    On the contrary, extensive political and economic relations  of cooperation have been established between the two countries,  Aho said.    He described his current visit here as "an important  milestone" in the history of Finnish-Chinese friendship.    Finland supports China's re-entry into the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Aho said, adding that the re-entry  will make a significant impact on Finnish-Chinese economic  relations and the global economy.    Aho also told Jiang that the visit had impressed him deeply.    During the meeting, Jiang asked Aho to convey his best  regards to Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and to pass on his  invitation to the president to visit China.</p>

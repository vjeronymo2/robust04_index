			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Observer: . . . or be damned? Instant fame, and possibly rapid penury, is advertised on Page 13 (lucky for some?). Scallywag, the satirical magazine being sued for libel by John Major, is offering a 70 per cent controlling interest for Pounds 50,000. Prospective purchasers will be reassured that the editor and staff will be happy to stay and that overheads and outgoings are low. So far, at any rate.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seventeen commenters requested the SBA to further adjust the size standard levels of their respective industries. The most often cited industries were: Management Services &amp; Consulting (SIC codes 7341 and 8742); Testing Laboratories (SIC code 8734); Building Maintenance (SIC code 7349); Computer Services (SIC codes 7371&hyph;7379); and Security Guard Services (SIC code 7381). Many of the reasons cited in support of an additional increase to one of these industries' size standards raised issues not considered or evaluated by the SBA in proposing the fixed size standard levels for purposes of simplification or in adjusting the current receipts-based size standards for inflation. The SBA's size standards are generally established based on structural characteristics of an industry. In reviewing the appropriateness of a size standard of a particular industry, the SBA utilizes five primary factors: Industry competition, average firm size, start-up costs, distribution of firms by size and the impact on the SBA's programs. The SBA does not believe that it has the discretion to make changes to size standards based on these considerations without first proposing such changes and affording the public an opportunity to comment on the basis of such proposals. The SBA's proposed rule discussed adjustments to size standards based on inflation in the economy as a whole and based on a further adjustment to achieve simplicity overall. Neither component of the proposed rule discussed characteristics of specific industries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this rule, a straight inflationary adjustment of 48.2 percent has been applied to all industries, with a small further adjustment for rounding purposes. With the elimination of the simplification component of the proposed rule (whereby size standards would have been further adjusted to one of the four receipts-based size standards) the size standards for the Building Maintenance industry, SIC code 7349, becomes $12 million rather than $10 million. The size standards of the other industries cited by these commenters either remain at the same level as established in the proposed rule or are adjusted slightly to achieve the rounding to the nearest $0.5 million. The SBA intends to conduct a separate industry study on these industries on a priority basis, which may or may not lead to further changes in their respective size standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters specifically expressed concern with the disproportionate changes within the size standards resulting from the rounding methodology stipulated in the proposed rule to adjust the industry size standards to one of the four newly established size standard levels. As indicated above, the SBA has decided to give further study to the best way to simplify its size standards, and this rule does not reduce the number of receipts-based size standards to the four proposed standards with their accompanying ``disproportionate'' changes as feared by these commenters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight commenters specifically suggested that the SBA should establish a policy to review and adjust the receipts-based size standards on a regular and recurring basis. Of the eight commenters, these recommended that the size standards be reviewed and adjusted every four to six years, one recommended that they be reviewed and adjusted biennially, and four suggested annual reviews and adjustments. The SBA is continuing its evaluation of a policy to review the impact of inflation on a regular and recurring basis. This will be part of SBA's further review of the simplification of the size standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

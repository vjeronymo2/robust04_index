			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stakis dismisses Robertson reports STAKIS, the Glasgow-based hotels, casinos and nursing homes group which announces its results for 1992 on Thursday, yesterday dismissed weekend reports that Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, was to announce his retirement. 'It has not been considered by the board,' the company said, calling the reports speculation. Sir Lewis came in as chairman of Stakis in 1991 when the company faced a financial and management crisis. It is expected to announce that it has moved a pre tax loss last year of Pounds 47m to around break even. It is also expected to announce a one-for-three rights issue and the sale of its nursing homes subsidiary, Ashbourne Homes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hasan Cemal: "What Might Happen If the U.S. Aid </F> Package Is Rejected or Accepted?"]    [Text] Ankara -- We met many of our high-ranking diplomats  during [journalist] Fatih Cekirge's cocktail party in the SABAH  office in Ankara on Tuesday evening [21 June]. We held talks  with Minister of Foreign Affairs Hikmet Cetin and Under  Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozdem Sanberk. One of the  issues we discussed was the relationship between Turkey and the  United States. In other words, we exchanged views on the new  kind of relations emerging between the two countries since the  cold war era ended. The matter came up when we were exchanging  views on whether or not the U.S. aid package for Turkey should  be rejected. That is currently an important issue on the  diplomatic back burner. A number of diplomats argue that it  should be immediately rejected.... Several others are inclined  to take a more professional approach on the matter. They  maintain that an effort should be made to find an approach more  effective than ostentatious and daring initiatives. Meanwhile,  several diplomats have described Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  statement that her government may reject the conditional U.S.  aid as an example of diplomatic blunder.    As far as the U.S. aid package is concerned, the general  view  is that it should not be accepted if conditions are linked with  it.... However, the diplomatic struggle must be maintained  against this bias in the U.S. Congress.... Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin shares that view.    What can be done? It will be useful to discuss several  points before that question is considered. We still have the  old habbit of referring to what we receive from the United  States as U.S. aid. However, what we actually receive from that  country is not aid but credits in accordance with the existing  market conditions.... The U.S. Congress is gradually reducing  the U.S. aid package to foreign countries because the Soviet  Union has collapsed and the cold war has ended. The U.S.  military aid is expected to end in a few years.... That is why  the Turkish officials think like this: The aid is going to end.  Let us be the side which is more daring. The material aspect  of the matter is not important. Therefore, the aid package  should be rejected right now, at this moment.    Another reason put forward by those who support that view is  as follows: The anti-Turkish lobby in the United States--that  is, the Greek Cypriot, Greek, and Armenian lobbies--have  exploited the question of U.S. aid to Turkey for many years.  (The Serbs have now moved to support those lobbies) They have  harmed Turkey-U.S. relations by imposing conditions because of  the Cyprus problem and other issues. The rejection of the aid  will deprive them of their opportunity to harm Turkey.  <H5>  The Human Rights Lobby </H5>   The general view among the Turkish Foreign Ministry  officials  is that the U.S. aid package cannot be accepted in its present  form, that is, with the conditions that have been linked to it  in connection with the Cyprus problem, human rights issues, and  the Kurdish problem. However, it is a fact that the rejection  of the aid package will not resolve the problem. Human rights  has been an important issue in the relations between Turkey and  the United States for several years. Therefore, even if  military aid is taken off the agenda, the question of human  rights will continue to be discussed in the congressional back  rooms. That point must always be kept in mind.    Even if Congress approves the conditional aid package to  Turkey, President Clinton is not expected to veto it. That  state of affairs will affect not only Turkey's relations with  the United States, but also with the European Countries.  Congress' decision will set an example for the European  countries on matters related to Cyprus, human rights, and the  Kurdish problem....    This matter should be considered calmly. The conditional  aid package should be rejected. However, that will not resolve  the problem. Looking at the relations between Turkey and the  United States only from that angle would be wrong. Let us  consider the matter from a wider perspective. Dangerous trends  -- such as chauvinism, extreme nationalist-conservative forces,  and religious trends -- are gradually strengthening in  Turkey.... Those forces must not be allowed to influence  Turkey's policy toward the United States and Europe. Turkey has  decided to join the European club. It is a member of the OECD,  NATO, the European Council, and CSCE. It is in the customs  union with the European Union. It is striving to take a place  among the top countries in the world, not the Third World  countries. Turning its back on the Western countries and  allowing its relations with the United States and Europe to  deteriorate would not be in Turkey's interest. Nor would it be  in its interest to close its doors to the outside world, concern  itself only with its own problems, and seek nonexistent horizons  because of the rhetoric that "the Western countries do not like  us."    It can be said that the same situation applies to the United  States and Europe from the geostrategic viewpoint. That is  true. Losing Turkey would not be in the interests of the United  States and Europe.... That, however, must not be exaggerated....  <H5>  To See the Greatness.... </H5>   What can be done under the existing conditions? It is  essential for Turkey to put its house in order. It has to  rectify its economy, improve its adherence to democracy,  separate the Kurdish problem from its struggle against the  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], and take the necessary steps  in that regard from the point of view of democracy and human  rights....    Turkey has no alternative as the new century draws closer.  Turkey, which has a population of 60 million people, will draw  closer to the United States and Europe if it improves its  economy. The United States and Europe will regard Turkey as an  inalienable partner if it removes its deficiencies in applying  democratic principles and adhering to human rights.... Turkey  is a great country. Neither the PKK nor the Kurdish problem  should be allowed to influence its relations with the Western  countries. Let us hope that the officials have enough foresight  to realize its greatness.    In short, whether or not U.S. aid is rejected is not  important. Turkey has to have a broader concept of the future.</p>

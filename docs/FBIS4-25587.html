			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gao Sizhang: "Sale of Treasury Bonds to Foreigners in </F> the Offing"]    [Text] China should open its treasury bonds to foreign  investors to promote development of a market-oriented bond  market, said a senior government official.    "We wish to open domestic treasury bonds to foreign  investors  as soon as possible," said Gao Jian, vice-director of the  Ministry of Finance's Department of State Debt Administration.    Gao said that a timetable has not yet been set but that it  seems sure no action will be taken this year.    He said the ministry has specified several issues for  consideration while planning how to offer treasury bonds to  foreigners.    Firstly, the bonds opened to foreign investors should be the  same as those available to domestic investors. That means they  must carry the same coupon rates for the same terms of maturity  to ensure the market's integrity.    Secondly, the bonds should be denominated in renminbi so the  government will not bear foreign exchange risks.    Thirdly, the bonds should have longer terms of maturity to  diversify the structure of bonds. This is reinforced by the  preference American institutional investors have for longer  maturities, Gao said.    In fact, Gao said, his department was very close to coming  up  with a programme to open the government securities market to  foreign investors in the first half of 1993, when authorities  had great difficulty selling treasury bonds.    The government eventually sold out all the bonds so the  programme was suspended, then finally scrapped.    The plan was to sell some of the five-year treasury bonds to  foreign investors. The maturity and annual coupon rate were the  same as those for primary dealers.    Foreign investors would have had to convert their foreign  currencies into renminbi before buying the treasury bonds.    The proposal also specified the financial status of foreign  securities firms, allowing them to subscribe treasury bonds on  the primary market and trade them on the secondary market.    Gao said foreign participation would not only broaden the  capital base for bonds but would also heighten competitiveness  in the bond market.    Opening the market is an important measure to be taken next  year to help build up a market-oriented bond-trading system.    "We anticipate a market-oriented government securities  framework to be underway two years from now," he said.    If that is the case, Gao said, lots of things need to be  done  next year.    For example, he said, the primary dealer system must be more  fully developed.    The Ministry of Finance is reviewing applications from banks  and financial institutions that want to be primary dealers.    Meanwhile, the feeling is growing that the country should  also develop short-term treasury bonds.    "We strongly suggest that six-month bonds should be  renewed,"  Gao said. "Maturity should be diversified into three months and  nine months."</p>

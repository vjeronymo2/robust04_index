			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / People: Sam Younger takes on the World The BBC has recruited an insider, Sam Younger, 42, to head the BBC World Service, its international radio service which is listened to by an estimated 130m people each week. Younger, who was promoted to director of broadcasting in February, takes over as managing director on November 1. He succeeds BBC deputy director-general Bob Phillis, who has been doing the job since April 1993. David Witherow, 57, who has been the World Service's deputy managing director since February 1989, is retiring at the end of the week. The choice of Younger is likely to be well received by the staff of the World Service who had been concerned that the BBC's new cost-conscious management team might have insisted on appointing someone with more commercial experience. Sam Younger comes from a well-connected family. His father was a former Labour MP and big wheel in the Royal Institute of Economic Affairs while his cousin, Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Lord Younger, is a former Tory cabinet minister. Educated at Westminster and New College, Oxford, Sam Younger was assistant editor of Middle East International before joining BBC External Services, as it was then called, as a talks writer in 1979. Younger will combine the job of director of broadcasting with his new role as managing director. He is being appointed to the BBC's board of management and is also joining John Thomas and Nick Chapman, the managing directors of Worldwide TV and Worldwide Publishing on the board of BBC Worldwide which is chaired by Bob Phillis.</p>

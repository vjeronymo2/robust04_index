As the first step to  respond to Saudi Arabia's request, Keidanren is studying a plan  to invest several billion yen in food, pharmaceutical, and other  companies. Keidanren plans to coordinate the final details when  its officials visit there in late April.    Through the financial cooperation of 112 major Japanese  companies and Overseas Cooperation Fund, Keidanren established  an investment company called "Japan International Cooperation  Organization" [JICO] aimed at developing industries of  developing countries in 1989. The present investment program to  help Saudi Arabian companies will also be implemented through  JICO.    Pharmaceutical and food companies, such as noodle-making  companies, are most likely to be offered the investment.  Originally, Saudi Arabia requested investment in auto makers.  However, Keidanren thinks it will be difficult to meet its  request because the amount of investment would become enormous.  A Keidanren Secretariat official said that "if possible,"  Keidanren "wants to sign contracts" when its mission visits  Saudi Arabia.</p>

Document also says that during a period of 1993 Azerbaijani  aircraft did more than 50 military air-raids to the Republic of  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Mr. Papazyan attracts the attention of the CSCE and NATO  leadership to the fact that Azerbaijan doesn't follow his  obligations mentioned in the Treaty of Conventional Armaments in  Europe. In particular, making a 1992-1993 annual report  Azerbaijan deviated from supplying with the information on  military airdromes where the military air-raids are undertaking  from. A considerable lack of correspondence on the existence,  reduction of the warplanes quantity and their losses is typical  for the informational documents.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / IMF agrees to Manila targets The Philippines yesterday won International Monetary Fund approval for a request to raise ceilings on monetary growth while keeping its programme for economic expansion on track. The agreement removes a big obstacle in the current IMF review of the country's compliance with economic performance targets to enable it to draw the second tranche of the Dollars 648m (Pounds 415m) credit support for the economic programme. A visiting IMF technical team had initially rejected the Philippine debt negotiators' request, which led Mr Cielito Habito, the socio-economic planning secretary, to remark that Manila should abandon the Fund's programme if the new monetary target was not allowed. The threat was contradicted later by Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, who insisted the IMF programme was still needed. Under the programme, base money (money held by banks and the public plus banks' deposits with the central bank) is to grow by 13 per cent next year to about 3.5 per cent of GNP. The Philippines asked that the growth rate be allowed to increase to 16 per cent.</p>

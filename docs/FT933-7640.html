			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: HealthBlend packs a purrrfect diet - Worth Watching You are what what you eat, they say. The maxim could be as true for pets as it is for their owners. HealthBlend is described by manufacturer Hill's Pet Nutrition, as the first 'healthy' pet food, to be sold exclusively through veterinary surgeries. Hill's say the scientifically-balanced diet of calories, protein and phosphorous can prevent liver and kidney disease, obesity and even hypertension. There are two feline versions and three for dogs  - including a special recipe for the 'Canine Geriatric'. Hill's: US, 913 354 8523.</p>

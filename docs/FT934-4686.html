The Euroissue was the first Indian GDR offering without warrants to be priced with no discount to the ruling market price. Mahindra's GDRs were priced at Dollars 7.44, the equivalent of Rs232.50, which was the closing price of the company's equity share on the Bombay stock market on November 25. The issue was priced five days earlier than expected, to avoid further demand. Banque Paribas, lead managers, will exercise an option to increase the issue to approximately Dollars 75m. coThe Mahindra family purchased part of the equity, to maintain their 32 per cent stake. The money will be used to expand and modernise production.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Radical opposition leaders are pulling a propaganda  stunt when they promise an early change of government, a senior  official in President Boris Yeltsin's headquarters told Interfax  Tuesday.    He did not think that former vice-president Aleksandr  Rutskoy's signature collection campaign for early presidential  elections would be a success. The official believed that even  if Rutskoy's supporters collect the one million signatures  required to hold a referendum on the issue, neither the State  Duma nor the Constitutional Court would have a constitutional  case to call a referendum.    Speaking on the recent meeting of the Accord in the Name of  Russia council he said that friction between Rutskoy and  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, members of the council, was  to be expected.    Still, he thought it possible that even though Zyuganov was  a  much more intelligent statement than Rutskoy, he might ally with  the latter temporarily in order to change the government.    The official said it was strange that former foreign trade  minister Sergey Glazyev, a Democratic party deputy in the Duma,  had joined a grouping whose goal was to kindle the fires of  discontent rather than looking for a constructive alternative to  what the government was doing.</p>

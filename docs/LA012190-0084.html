			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: TEENY TINY THEATER OF THE ABSURD  </P> <P> The other night my husband and I went to one of those movie mazes in the mall  where there are six theaters in an area the size of a three-car garage. Is it  my imagination, or are these theaters becoming smaller? I fought an  overwhelming urge to introduce myself to the other seven people who were there.  </P> <P> One of the great thrills of going to movies used to be that viewers were  treated to pictures of people bigger than life. On this screen, Rambo would  have looked like a troll, and Gandhi would have appeared lonely.  </P> <P> I drifted for a moment and actually imagined I was in my own living room. It  wasn't much of a stretch. A couple of kids played noisily in the aisle, and a  girl two rows back was having a conversation on how the cleaners had shrunk her  sweater. Someone groped to a seat balancing a taco and a 62-ounce cylinder of  cola and ice. Another man shouted up the aisle, "Loretta, while you're up, get  me some Milk Duds."  </P> <P> The man next to me was seated so close that his musk cologne put me in a coma.  Any more intimacy and we would have made plans to pick out a dish pattern. For  this I shaved my legs and put on eye makeup.  </P> <P> The problem is that no one stuck to the script. The original scenario was that  television would destroy the movie industry. Television would be so great and  so convenient that families would stay home and bond together around the  screen.  </P> <P> Someone misread kids. They don't care if "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" looks like  a piece of lint on the screen; they will still drive 12 miles and wait in line  to see it. I personally know children who entered one of those movie complexes  when they were preschoolers and didn't come out until puberty.  </P> <P> There's a trend here somewhere, but I can't figure out what it is or why. As  television screens get bigger, movie screens get smaller. If the trend  continues, we may be showing "The Brady Bunch" baking cookies at your local  theater and "Lawrence of Arabia" on home TV screens that span the living room,  dining room and kitchen.  </P> <P> Maybe family life will center on these small cinema-closets where the same  people will meet week after week and get to know one another. Intimacy will  spark relationships. ("Remember me? I sat next to you at 'Caddy Shack' and we  laughed at the same jokes.") Babies will be born. ("I was two rows behind you  when you went into labor during 'Fatal Attraction.' ")  </P> <P> We're almost to that point. When you call the theater and ask what time the  feature begins, don't be surprised if the manager answers, "It starts in five  minutes. If you're late, don't expect me to fill you in on the beginning."  </P></p>

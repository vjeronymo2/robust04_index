			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / East German steel subsidies rejected CONTROVERSIAL plans to pump more than DM1bn (Pounds 400m) of state subsidies into the Ekostahl steel plant in eastern Germany are likely to be turned down by the European Commission today. The decision will take the form of a proposal to member states rather than a binding ruling, and will be subject to ministers' unanimous app-roval, but is still likely to cause a storm in Germany. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, yesterday defended the Ekostahl plans in a last-minute attempt to influence the decision. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is recommending that the Eko-stahl plan should not be exempt from strict rules on state aid for steel producers. The Commission is under pressure from Germany, Spain and Italy to approve steel aid, but Mr Van Miert has repeatedly stressed the Commission will adopt a tough attitude, to avoid a damaging 'subsidy race' among European governments. An ambitious plan worked out by the Treuhand - the state agency responsible for privatisation -would modernise Ekostahl's cold steel works for DM310m. In a second phase, Ekostahl would be turned into a mini-mill for DM750m.</p>

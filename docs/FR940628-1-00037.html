The proposed revisions specify SIP requirements only for areas that are subject to the basic Inspection/Maintenance program requirement and that otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment for the carbon monoxide or ozone national ambient air quality standards. This rule proposes to allow such areas to defer adoption and implementation of some of the otherwise applicable requirements established in the original promulgation of the Inspection/Maintenance rule. This proposed rule applies only to areas that by virtue or their air quality classification are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit, and otherwise qualify for, a redesignation request. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments on this proposal must be received no later than July 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency will hold a public hearing on this proposed amendment if one is requested on or before July 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a public hearing is held, comments must be received 30 days after the hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Interested parties may submit written comments (in duplicate if possible) to Public Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;21.

Section 175A in turn requires states that submit a redesignation request to submit a plan, and any additional measures if necessary, for maintenance of the air quality standard, for a least a 10 year period following EPA's approval of the redesignation. It also requires the plan to include contingency provisions to ensure prompt correction of any violation of the standard which occurs after redesignation. The contingency measures must include a provision requiring the state to implement measures which were contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) prior to redesignation as an attainment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this document is to propose amendments to the rules in subpart S of part 51 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (subpart S) to address Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program requirements for basic areas that qualify for and will ultimately obtain approval by EPA of redesignation requests to attainment. This notice proposes to add a new paragraph to the regulation pertaining to State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions for areas required to implement a basic I/M program that are submitting and otherwise qualify for approval of a redesignation request. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  There are basic areas that will be submitting redesignation requests that do not currently have I/M programs, or have either a basic program implemented pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act or a basic program upgraded to meet the requirements of EPA's I/M regulations. This rule applies only to areas that by virtue of their air quality classification are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit, and otherwise qualify for a redesignation request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For EPA policy and procedures on being redesignated from nonattainment to attainment for ozone and carbon monoxide see memoranda dated: June 1, 1992; September 4, 1992; October 28, 1992; July 9, 1992; July 22, 1992; and September 17, 1993, which are included in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a May 6, 1994 decision, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that EPA did not have authority to construe section 110(k)(4) to authorize conditional approval of an I/M committal SIP that contains no specific enforceable measures, but a promise to adopt specific enforceable measures within a year. Merely, section 110(k)(4) states that: The Administrator may approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Any such conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval if the State fails to comply with such commitment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

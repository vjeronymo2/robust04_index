			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (11): A change in Japan's image - Japan's growing presence in the EC is leading to greater familiarity with what has long been the unfathomable Japanese way IN ITS recent history Europe has regarded Japan with conflicting feelings of fear and admiration but the image of Japan in the EC is beginning to undergo a significant change with the growing presence of Japanese corporations on European soil. Japan's image in Europe has differed from country to country depending on the specific economic and political environment of the day. Broadly speaking, interest in Japan has been heavily geared towards industrial and economic issues, with politics, social and cultural themes providing an entertaining additional insight into the nation and its people. The result has been to exaggerate the impression that Japan is a nation of economic animals who put business before all else and are deprived of the high quality of life enjoyed by many Europeans. Japan is seen in Europe as a nation of disciplined and dedicated workers where a rigorous educational system, a stable social order and co-operation between industry and government have produced a twentieth century economic miracle. But this admiration in Europe for Japan's industrial achievements has been offset by increduilty at what appear to many Europeans to be deplorable living and working conditions in Japan and criticism of the collusive business and trade practices and closed society which are seen to be at the foundation of the country's economic might. The more positive response to Japan contrasts sharply with the suspicion and hostility felt by some towards the 'Japanese way' of doing things - the long working hours and group-oriented way of life - which has been seen to be the basis for the country's economic miracle. Particularly in countries where nationalistic feelings have run strong, Japan's economic strength has been portrayed as having a price that would be too high for Europeans to pay. The notorious depiction by Mrs Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister, of the Japanese as being like ants who have little time for anything besides work, is probably not very different from the view that many Europeans have of the Japanese. The French elite have been scathing in their remarks about Japanese business practices - 'the Japanese electronics industry has developed a fearsome war machine,' and employs a long-term strategy that is pursued until 'Japan has conquered the entire electronics industry,' writes SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor group, in a report. Where a nation's elite feel threatened by the Japanese challenge, they will stoke popular fear, says Prof. Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at the University of Wales. Thus in France, where the Japanese onslaught poses a large threat to the elite who would be deprived of jobs if Japanese companies take over most industries, popular opinion has often been antagonistic. While the image of Japan in Europe is not so far divorced from the reality, as far as working conditions, lifestyle, business practices and the way society works are concerned, there has perhaps been a tendency to read too much into these social differences and the role they have played in Japan's industrial success. The large number of Japanese corporations being established throughout the EC is, however, leading to less of a hysterical portrayal of Japan as a nation of economic warriors and more of a concerted effort to take a direct look at what lies behind Japan's industrial prowess. 'We've been going through a learning process in most European countries,' says Prof. Jones. Business executives are beginning to see that the Japanese success is not something that stems from alien social factors that would not be acceptable elsewhere but from a different way of production, he says. Prof. Jones is co-author of the book, The Machine that Changed the World, which identified the Japanese production process as the source of their success and attempts to explain it. The growing presence of Japanese transplants in Europe has helped that learning process in Europe - 'the more you look at the Japanese transplants you can see that that can be done outside Japan,' he says. While the UK has a big advantage in that respect, the French are also seeing changes in Japan's image among influential circles, according to Mr Claude Meyer, deputy general manager of Bank Europeenne de Tokyo and lecturer on Japanese economy at the Paris University Graduate School of Social Sciences. 'Even in business, the Japanese style of industrial management and processes is positively covered, including Japanese factories in France, and has led to some adaptations of industrial processes in French companies,' he notes. The changing environment in Germany, meanwhile, has brought about a shift in Japan's image in another direction. While the Germans have respected Japan's success, their own industrial might has meant that they have been less paranoid, at times almost dismissive, about the Japanese challenge. However, Professor Jones says that Nissan's launch of Lexus, the luxury car 'sent a complete shock through the German system.' The Japanese have shown in Lexus that they could do very well in an area that the Germans felt was their own preserve. Now, the Germans are looking at Japan in a very different way and realising that they have to get their act together. The Machine that Changed the World has sold three times as many in Germany as in the UK.</p>

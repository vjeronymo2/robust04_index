			<p>BFN     [Text] Epidemiologists in Brest are alarmed. In some  villages near the center of the oblast, outbreaks of an  especially dangerous and infectious disease -- swine plague  [chuma sviney] -- have been recorded. This is an unusual  incident, because the disease wipes out pigs of any breed and  any age. The (?greatest) danger is posed by the meat of the  infected pigs, which are being slaughtered. Their meat may only  be safely used after thermal processing and even then, only for  preparing stewed sausages and canned meat.    The Brest Rayon Executive Committee has imposed a quarantine  in all infected regions. During this quarantine, all exports  and imports of pigs, as well as the grazing of cattle at  collective farms, are forbidden; transportation movement is also  limited. Other regions of the oblast are also alarmed; free,  large-scale swine vaccination campaigns are already being  implement in those areas.</p>

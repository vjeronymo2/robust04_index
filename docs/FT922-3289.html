			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Management: Grounds for optimism stir in Hungary - The experience of one US consumer products group in eastern Europe WHEN Robert Combee took over as head of Compack, Hungary's largest coffee and tea company, he was ready for almost anything. But nothing had prepared him for adventures in the skin trade. Hidden in Compack's balance sheet and stored all over Hungary were huge piles of rotting animal skins. They had been imported from Russia, apparently with some assistance from the KGB, by the company's former accountants, who had hoped to make a quick profit by turning them into fertiliser. 'There were thousands of tons of the things, and they stank like hell,' Combee says. After the failure of several ingenious attempts to smuggle the putrefying hides back into Russia, he eventually off-loaded them in Romania and the Ukraine. The bizarre and the unexpected have become routine for the fast-talking 47-year-old Dutchman since he arrived at Compack 15 months ago, shortly after the company was acquired by Sara Lee, the US consumer products group. His exploits, shared with seven expatriate colleagues of various nationalities, are a vivid case study of the experiences - good and bad - which can await western companies acquiring in central Europe. Compack is a rare example of a central European company with a strong brand identity. It also has a willing and hard-working staff of 1,300. In most other respects, however, its business has had to be re-built from scratch. 'Things like job descriptions didn't exist, and there was no wage structure,' says Combee. 'Though people in Hungary study marketing, what counts is experience, and nobody here has it.' Among the assets inherited from the past were large stocks of surplus tea from Vietnam - the result of an earlier barter deal - and a vast tea-drying machine. 'It was unbelievably complex and big enough to serve half of Europe,' Combee says. After clearing these out, he set about recruiting salesmen. Advertisements were placed in the newspapers, but because the concept of selling was almost wholly unknown in Hungary, they drew a very mixed response. Eventually a 40-member sales and merchandising team was assembled, many of them existing Compack employees. The next challenge was training. Since Combee speaks no Hungarian, his first idea was to hire English-speaking local academics and get a western specialist to teach them how to train. But advertisements attracted only two candidates. 'The younger of them was aged 85 and they both had Karl Marx University printed on their cards,' he recalls. Trainers were eventually found and today, Compack's fledgling sales force is out on the streets in smart new vans. What they lack in experience, they make up for in enthusiasm: one saleswoman who had difficulty meeting her quota got her husband to help out at weekends. Compack has also had to train its retail customers. Merchandising experts have been drafted in from Douwe Egberts, Sara Lee's Dutch coffee subsidiary, to instruct shopkeepers in basic techniques such as shelf management, stock control and modern financial accounting. Simultaneously, the company's product range is being re-launched, backed by a television advertising campaign. Packaging has been re-designed to incorporate the name of Douwe Egberts while retaining Compack's Omnia brand name and its familiar coffee bean symbol. The introduction of western marketing techniques has not gone altogether smoothly, however. Compack's attempts to sell direct to retailers and to increase prices have led to bruising confrontations with the Fuszerts, the state-owned wholesalers which still control much of the grocery trade. Combee hopes the problems will diminish as Hungary's growing numbers of supermarkets set up their own warehouses and distribution systems. However, the biggest headache has been a sharp fall in domestic coffee sales, about 40 per cent of which have been replaced by smuggled imports. These have been encouraged by a steep rise in duties and taxes which today account for half the retail price of coffee in Hungary, making it among the most expensive in Europe. Compack recently secured a small reduction in taxes. However, with coffee sales still in the doldrums, the company has been forced to make up the lost revenues by expanding its other businesses. In less than a year, it has launched and re-packaged about 50 items, including new brands of tea, insecticides, a range of baby care products and spices and mixes. 'I don't think you can find any western company which introduced so many new products in such a short time,' says Combee. The new lines, mostly imported from other Sara Lee subsidiaries, may be produced in Hungary in future. sales of about Ft1bn (Pounds 6.9m). Combee, who previously worked for Heineken, the Dutch brewery, will not disclose profit figures. But he says returns on investment are higher than at Heineken, though still below Sara Lee's standards. The focus now is on improving Compack's operating efficiency. Two of its six factories have been closed, and the remaining plants are being reorganised and automated. Accounting systems are being modernised and an outside consultant is drawing up formal job descriptions and wage structures. One of the most positive surprises was the advanced state of Compack's computing systems when it was acquired. Prevented by western export controls from buying modern mainframe machines, the company's staff developed highly sophisticated information systems based on personal computers. But despite all this technical wizardry, Compack's productivity remains handicapped by heavy over-manning at its head office in Budapest, which employs more than 350 people. Combee says the numbers must fall dramatically, though he aims to phase cuts in gradually to soften the impact on morale. For all the ups and downs of the past 15 months, he has no regrets. 'Why did I do a job like this? It's the adventure. When I go into supermarkets and see all those products which are my babies, I get very excited.' However, what he calls the 'skins problem' and other unedifying discoveries about Compack's affairs have left him decidedly cautious about further acquisitions: 'If we saw an opportunity here which looked attractive, we would think twice. Given our experience, we would be a lot more careful.'</p>

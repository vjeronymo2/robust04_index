			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Greece plans telecoms privatisation GREECE plans a partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, through a trade sale of at least 20 per cent of the company. The sale will be followed by a share flotation on the Athens Stock Exchange, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The trade buyer would be expected to take over management of OTE which, with net income of Dr41bn (Dollars 213m) in 1990 on turnover of Dr200bn, is the only profitable Greek utility. The government has appointed Credit Suisse First Boston, the international merchant bank, as its adviser on the sale. CSFB is already advising it on the selection of private operators for two mobile telephone networks to be launched in the Athens district next year. The size of the flotation will be determined by the percentage of OTE acquired by the trade buyer. However, no more than 49 per cent of the utility can be privatised under the provisions of the Greek constitution.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV-RADIO: GREG GUMBEL GETS A TOUGH CALL -- LMU AFTER ITS TRAGIC LOSS  </P> <P> In mid-January, two weeks after Greg Gumbel began doing sports for "CBS This  Morning," he was sent out to Loyola Marymount to do a piece on Hank Gathers and  Bo Kimble.  </P> <P> "I remember Sports Information Director Barry Zepel telling us we were going to  love these guys, that they were bright, personable and a pleasure to be  around," Gumbel said.  </P> <P> "And he was 100% right. I got to know Gathers pretty well, so the news of his  death hit me pretty hard."  </P> <P> Tonight, Gumbel will be the play-by-play announcer for Loyola's NCAA tournament  game against New Mexico State, which is being televised by CBS. Quinn Buckner  will be the commentator.  </P> <P> The game will be on Channel 2 live at 8:30, and at 11:30 in the rest of the  nation -- delayed in the West, live in the East.  </P> <P> "We'll address the Gathers story at the top of the telecast," Gumbel said. "But  once the game starts, for the most part we'll try to treat it as New Mexico  State vs. Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> "Of course there will be times when we'll have to mention the Gathers  situation, but we don't want to beat the story into the ground and take away  from the game."  </P> <P> For most of his career, Gumbel, 43, was best known as the brother of Bryant,  who is 1 1/2 years younger.  </P> <P> But the older Gumbel is establishing his own identity and becoming recognized  for his own abilities.  </P> <P> Whereas Bryant, host of NBC's "Today" morning show, skyrocketed to network  stardom, Greg took a little slower route.  </P> <P> A graduate of Loras College, a Division III school in Dubuque, Iowa, Greg  Gumbel was working as a sales clerk for a hospital supply company in Detroit in  1973 when he got his first broadcasting job.  </P> <P> Bryant, working as a weekend sportscaster at KNBC at the time, suggested that  Greg apply for a job as a weekend sportscaster at WMAQ in Chicago. He got the  job and spent 7 1/2 years at WMAQ, followed by 5 1/2 at ESPN and a couple with  the Madison Square Garden Network before becoming full time at CBS last  October.  </P> <P> There are plans to use Gumbel as a fill-in for Harry Smith on "CBS This  Morning" when Smith is on vacation. That means the Gumbels would be going  head-to-head -- Greg on CBS, Bryant on NBC.  </P> <P> Gumbel and wife Marcy live in New York. They have a 21-year-old daughter,  Michelle, who attends Roger Williams College outside Providence, R.I.  </P> <P> Gumbel, who says Michelle isn't much of a sports fan, tells this story about  her:  </P> <P> "She and a couple of friends came to the East Regionals in Providence last year  after I offered her some tickets. That was the day Georgetown had to come from  behind to beat Notre Dame, and then North Carolina State beat Iowa in double  overtime in a tremendous game.  </P> <P> "My daughter called the next day to say how much she enjoyed the  Georgetown-Notre Dame game. I said, 'But what about that double overtime game?  Wasn't that something?'  </P> <P> "She said, 'Oh, was there a second game?' "  </P> <P> Kudos to KCBS for preempting network programming to bring L.A. fans today's  UCLA and Loyola Marymount games live.  </P> <P> "Getting the network to allow us to push back 'Dallas' and 'Falcon Crest' to  11:30 p.m. was a real coup," said the station's Lisa DeLucia.  </P> <P> Loyola-New Mexico State wasn't quite a sellout late Thursday, so KCBS  guaranteed it would buy up any remaining tickets in order to ensure the game  could be televised live.  </P> <P> UCLA's game against Alabama Birmingham will be on at 4 p.m., with Ralph Hacker  and Dan Belluomini reporting. It will be shown again on ESPN at 12:30 a.m.  </P> <P> KCBS also deserves praise for taking steps to ensure that last Sunday's NCAA  pairings announcement show did not have to be delayed.  </P> <P> To do it, the station eliminated the halftime of the Pacific 10 tournament  final, which was shown on a half-hour delay.  </P> <P> "I know the viewer at home only cares about what he sees on the air," said Jay  Strong, the director of programming. "But I can tell you that, behind the  scenes, we went to a lot of trouble and financial sacrifice to make sure the  Pac-10 telecast ended in time."  </P> <P> Michaels update: Al Michaels, through a spokesman, said he has no comment  regarding his reported suspension by Dennis Swanson, ABC Sports president.  </P> <P> The spokesman said Michaels wants to put it all behind him.  </P> <P> Michaels reportedly was suspended for two weeks to a month because his teen-age  daughter worked as a messenger at a figure skating event last month, which is  apparently against ABC's policy on nepotism.  </P> <P> But Michaels was not scheduled to work during the suspension period, so  suspension might be the wrong word.  </P> <P> In a new development Thursday, it has been learned that the production  assistant who had hired Michaels' daughter was suspended without pay for two  weeks.  </P> <P> The most interesting aspect of the Michaels story is that such strong measures  were taken for such a minor offense.  </P> <P> One has to wonder what is really going on between Swanson and his top  sportscaster.  </P> <P> Swanson, back in 1986 and '87, had several run-ins with another top  sportscaster, Jim Lampley.  </P> <P> Lampley left the network abruptly after a meeting with Swanson, and was  unemployed for a couple of weeks before landing a job with KCBS, where he has  since become a news anchorman.  </P> <P> TV-Radio Notes  </P> <P> There will be seven NCAA tournament games televised by CBS this weekend -- four  Saturday and three Sunday. CBS is planning to televise both UCLA and Loyola  Marymount on Sunday, provided both win tonight. However, if Loyola plays Sunday  in Long Beach, its game may not be televised if it doesn't sell out 24 hours in  advance. If Loyola doesn't play Sunday, CBS' first NCAA telecast probably will  start at 9 a.m. Otherwise, the first telecast will be at 11 a.m. . . . NBC  commentator Al McGuire, on Dick Vitale: "He's built a cult following. He's not  of this earth. If (ABC partner) Keith Jackson doesn't have a twitch by now,  he's an amazing man." And: "It's too late for him now. He has to stay with his  style. He's a smart guy and in great physical shape. I do 15 games a year, he  does 15 a week. And I don't shout a lot."  </P> <P> Attention boxing fans: The Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor fight on HBO  Saturday night at 7 figures to be outstanding. Ross Greenburg, HBO's executive  producer of sports, said that promos for this fight originally called it "the  fight of the year." Said Greenburg: "Then we got blindsided by Buster Douglas,  so we had to change our promos. But this is certainly the second-best fight of  the year."  </P> <P> Channel 9's news-block format is not exactly off to a roaring start. Although  the Lakers' telecast from Charlotte last Monday got a peak Nielsen rating of  14.6 near the end, the rating for the 2 1/2 hours of news that followed slipped  considerably. The station averaged a .6 rating for the 10-to-11 p.m. hour. . .  . Turner Broadcasting has announced that its NFL football will be carried on  TNT rather than TBS, as previously announced. . . . Turner has also announced  that 24 World Cup soccer games June 8 through July 8 will be televised on TNT.  The first U.S. game is June 10 against Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Last month's NHRA Winternationals at Pomona will be televised on NBC Saturday  at noon. The announcers are Fred Roggin, Don Garlits and Steve Evans. . . .  Thanks to Prime Ticket, SportsChannel and ESPN, there is baseball on TV this  weekend -- college baseball. During Prime Ticket's coverage of tonight's 7  o'clock Cal-USC game, the crowd may look a little strange. As part of USC's  Comedy Day, Groucho Marx glasses will be handed out to those in attendance.  Announcers Tom Kelly and Steve Garvey may even don them.  </P> <P> CBS Sports, as part of a new marketing ploy, is in the midst of a shopping mall  tour. It makes its eighth stop at the Northridge Fashion Center, from 10 a.m.  to 9 p.m. today and Saturday, and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. Called the "Dream  Season National Tour," it features exhibits and games. Shoppers are invited to  compete in such things as shooting a basketball, hitting a tennis ball at a  target, and chipping a golf ball, or answering trivia questions. Various  prizes, such as CBS hats and sweat shirts, are handed out. "The idea behind  this is to get people to come out to our sponsors' stores," said Mike Nowacki,  CBS Sports' vice president of marketing. "And it's gone over pretty well. We've  so far drawn at least 25% more people than normal."  </P></p>

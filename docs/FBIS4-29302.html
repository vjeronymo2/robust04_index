			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Somsavat Lengsavat, foreign affairs minister </F> of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, at Hokham Presidential  Palace in Vientiane on 13 June on success of the five-day visit  to Laos by Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council of the Union of Myanmar, -- recorded]    [Text] The visit to our country by His Excellency [H.E.]  General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council of the Union of Myanmar [Burma], is a great  honor for our country, as it was the first country he visited on  his overseas trip. During his four days here, in addition to  holding official talks with H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan,  H.E. Gen. Than Shwe also called on H.E. Khamtai Siphandon,  chairman of the party Central Committee. During the talks, the  two leaders exchanged views on the situation in their respective  country, thus enabling each other to understand more deeply the  changes that are taking place. The most important event of the  visit was the signing of three agreements by the two sides as  reported earlier, namely the agreement on the international  boundary; the agreement on the establisment of a joint  commission for economic, scientific, and technical cooperation;  and the agreement on tourism cooperation. I believe that the  three agreements are politically and economically significant  because they have laid down a basis for the strengthening of  relations between our two countries in the future.    Therefore, it can be said that the visit was very successful  and the two sides are very satisfied with its outcome. Before  we came here, H.E. Chairman Than Shwe and H.E. President Nouhak  Phoumsavan also met and had a chat with each other, reaffirming  the success of this visit.</p>

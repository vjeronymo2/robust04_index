			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Market-making Sir Bryan Carsberg has caused another minor storm in the City. Last week, the Office of Fair Trading's director-general published a report lambasting underwriting commissions. Yesterday, it was the ability of market-makers to keep large share trades secret for 90 minutes - and in some cases five days  -that attracted his ire. Such secrecy is typically justified by market-makers on the grounds that it gives them time to off-load the risk of trading large blocks of shares: requiring them to be open is rather like asking poker players to reveal their hands. But the OFT thinks market-makers who handle large trades gain valuable information, from which secrecy gives them time to profit. Two alleged anti-competitive consequences follow. First, big market-makers - which handle most large trades - have an unfair advantage over smaller rivals. Second, market-makers are so worried that they may be hit by a large trade being unwound that they defensively widen the dealing spreads for normal-sized trades. Investors suffer through not getting the best prices for normal-sized deals. The thesis is plausible enough but fuzzy. The OFT is vague on exactly what information market-makers gain from handling large trades and how they profit from it. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence that dealing spreads for normal-sized trades are wider than they need be. If the OFT is to press ahead with its attack on secrecy, it must be more convincing in showing that there are victims.</p>

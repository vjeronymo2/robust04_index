			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH CHOIR REVAMPED 2ND TIME IN 2 YEARS  </P> <P> International Children's Choir, a Long Beach institution for 32 years, is being  reorganized for the second time since 1987.  </P> <P> Members say they are planning to change the name, possibly to the International  Children's Choir of Long Beach, following the withdrawal of president Ann  Livingston for personal reasons.  </P> <P> Livingston's mother, Easter Beekly, founded the choir in 1957. Under her  leadership, the musical group -- which features children ages 4 to 17 dressed  in a variety of national folk costumes -- became an internationally acclaimed  performance organization making appearances throughout the world.  </P> <P> But in 1987, Livingston -- who succeeded her mother as the choir's leader --  fired musical director Irene Bayless, claiming that Bayless had undermined the  choir's original purpose by concentrating on polished high-profile performances  rather than community-based public-interest appearances.  </P> <P> Bayless responded by forming her own choir, the International Peace Choir,  which ended up wooing away most of the original group's singers, thus causing  it to recruit new ones.  </P> <P> Today, Bayless' 60-member group is reported to be doing well. And organizers of  the soon-to-be-named International Children's Choir of Long Beach say they  expect to retain most of Livingston's 40 members, despite the former  president's withdrawal.  </P></p>

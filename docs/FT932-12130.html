			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Sweden back with FFr3bn issue THE Kingdom of Sweden returned to the Eurobond market yesterday with a FFr3bn seven-year issue, the latest borrower to tap the popular French franc sector. Borrowers have flocked to the Euro-French franc sector since the centre-right parties swept to victory at last month's general election. The result lent support to the French currency, enabling the Bank of France to lower interest rates - helped by the Bundesbank's recent easing of German key interest rates. Although there has already been a lot of new supply in the French franc sector, the Swedish National Debt Office pointed out that the seven-year area has been left alone. 'We saw that there was good investor demand in the seven-year area, and that suited us from our portfolio perspective,' said Ms Christine Holm, a director of the office. BNP, the lead manager, added that the seven-year maturity also provided one of the best maturities for swapping. Part of the proceeds will be swapped, probably into floating-rate francs. The bond, which has a coupon of 7.25 per cent, was launched with a spread of 35 basis points over the relevant US Treasury bond, but widened to 36.5 basis points. So far this year, Sweden has borrowed the equivalent of SKr65bn in the Eurobond market. Rumours circulated that the Kingdom of Spain may also tap the French franc sector when it makes the second of its proposed three or four Eurobond offerings this year. However, an official at the Spanish Treasury said a firm decision has not yet been taken on the currency front, and that both Euro-sterling and Euro-French francs are under consideration. In the dollar sector, the Republic of Colombia launched its much-marketed Dollars 125m five-year deal at a spread of 215 basis points over the five-year US Treasury bond. The spread tightened to 205 basis points, reflecting good demand for the issue. The proceeds from the bond, which carries a 7 1/8 per cent coupon, will be used to repay more expensive debt. Colombia lacks a credit rating at the moment, but Bankers Trust, the lead manager for the deal, said discussions with Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency are due to take place next week and they are predicting that a BBB rating will be assigned to the borrower.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Long-term bonds may be issued in Poland The Polish government was considering issuing up to 45,000bn zlotys (Dollars 2.1bn) worth of long-term bonds to help finance the 1994 budget deficit, Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, said, Reuter reports from Warsaw. Mr Borowski said the bonds, to be offered mainly abroad, were not included in the budget plan which was finally accepted by the government last Monday. He said the terms of the possible bond issue had yet to be determined. He declined to specify in which currencies the bonds were likely to be issued or other details. He also said the government might consider offering convertible bonds, which would entitle holders to chunks of privatised state-owned enterprises, but such a move would require a new law from parliament.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Assassination attempt starts outcry in Japan AN ATTEMPT to shoot a top politician has shaken the Japanese authorities out of their complacency about security just months before a nationwide election campaign, Reuter reports from Tokyo. A young ultra-rightist infiltrated a provincial meeting of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday and fired three shots at the powerful party vice-president, Mr Shin Kanemaru. No one was hurt, but one bullet flew close to Mr Kanemaru's head. 'I thought wind or an insect was passing by me,' the 77-year-old politician said afterwards. The shooting in Ashikaga, north of Tokyo, has provoked an outcry in Japan, with calls to tighten security around public figures because of the increasing use of firearms. Embarrassed police said that, despite past right-wing threats to Mr Kanemaru, they were not prepared for a gun attack. All their preparation had been aimed at foiling assaults by swords or knives. 'We were caught in a blind spot,' said the national police chief, Mr Ryoichi Suzuki. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and other LDP leaders, including Mr Kanemaru, had been expected to criss-cross the country in coming months to try to restore their waning fortunes before July's elections. Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said the party would have to reconsider senior officials' travel plans because police could not guarantee total security.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Sir Bryan's soft farewell FT-SE Index: 2,550.8 (+4.3) It is tempting to wonder how Sir James McKinnon would have approached yesterday's consultative paper from Oftel on BT's prices. Instead of the thorough but uncontroversial document produced by the retiring Sir Bryan Carsberg, the gas regulator might have thrown a brickbat or two on behalf of consumers. As the market was quick to realise, the absence in Oftel's paper of any severe response to BT's continued market dominance augurs well for shareholders, less so for customers. It looks as if Sir Bryan intends to go quietly. Indeed, the striking thing about BT's sluggish third quarter results was the neatness of their fit with Oftel's views on BT's proper rate of return. Recession and the tighter price cap introduced by last year's duopoly review have temporarily reduced BT's return on capital to just below 20 per cent. But that is still near the upper end of the range regarded as acceptable by the regulator. If BT can do this well in a recession, it can presumably earn excessive returns later on. Whether it does so will be the measure of Oftel's success in this pricing review. It has emerged that while BT makes losses on line rentals and profits from UK long distance calls, they are respectively much smaller and larger than was generally suspected. As Oftel says, BT's case for a swift rebalancing of prices to remove this cross-subsidy looks correspondingly weaker. Doubtless, Mercury will be pleased; competing with BT's call charges is clearly not as difficult as it should be. It should also please domestic customers, who would bear the brunt of higher rentals.</p>

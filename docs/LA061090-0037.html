			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN WATCH;  </P> <P> ABORTION DISTORTION  </P> <P> National political analysts already are calling California's upcoming general  election the fall's most important state campaign. It is entirely possible,  however, that November's vote will be reduced to little more than a plebiscite  on abortion.  </P> <P> All the signs are there to read: The candidates atop the Democratic slate --  Dianne Feinstein, Leo T. McCarthy and Arlo Smith are abortion rights advocates;  the Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general --  Marian Bergeson and Dan Lungren -- are abortion foes. Sen. Pete Wilson is not.  But his party's national platform opposes abortions except in cases involving a  threat to the mother's life, rape or incest.  </P> <P> As if the wish were father to the fact, Wilson says abortion is a "dead issue."  Feinstein has other ideas. Asked about the role gender and abortion rights  might play in November, she replied, "I think when it comes to that specific  issue -- which for women is a very emotional one -- it's correct for women to  believe they are best protected by a woman who is governor." Meanwhile, voters  polled Tuesday ranked abortion as the second most important issue -- after the  death penalty -- in deciding how they cast their ballot.  </P> <P> The reductionism of single-issue politics; the exchange of slogans rather than  debate; an anxious and angry electorate -- these are the consequences of the  U.S. Supreme Court's flight from responsibility in the Webster case and,  perhaps, the unfortunate characteristics of the fall campaign.  </P></p>

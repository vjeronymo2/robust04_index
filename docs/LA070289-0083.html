			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAILED LAGUNA HILLS CITYHOOD ELECTION  </P> <P> On June 6, voters of Laguna Hills rejected cityhood, the majority of the  dissent originating from Leisure World (within two golf shots of my home).  However, to my dismay, the registrar of voters informed me that my precinct of  Laguna Hills was not included in the election.  </P> <P> Since state law prohibits the same area from seeking cityhood within two years  of a failed attempt (The Times, June 25), why not exclude Leisure World and  allow them to be the rugged individualists that they wish to be? After all,  they provide their own security needs and street maintenance.  </P> <P> After surveying my neighbors, I decided that by including all areas of Laguna  Hills, the 284-vote margin would be nullified (with or without Leisure World).  But this solution appears to be too difficult, so let's try redrawing the  boundary lines and let the votes fall where they may.  </P> <P> SCOTT A. WEBER  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero by </F> Washington correspondent Paulo Sotero; place and date not given]    [Text] [Sotero] When you take the oath as finance minister,  whether you like it or not, you assume the role of a decisive  voter in the presidential dispute. Traditionally, the  government spends money during election years to help its  favorite candidate. Will this happen during your tenure?    [Ricupero] I want first to make it absolutely clear that I  will play an entirely impartial role. I am a public servant. I  have devoted my whole life to this. I may have my preferences  as a citizen, but as finance minister I will keep in mind  collective and public interests which are today embodied in  economic stabilization. As I said earlier in some articles, I  believe this is in the best interests of all of the candidates  too. Anyone seeking a federal or state office will win if he  gets elected when the economy is already at an advanced stage of  stabilization. If there is no awareness of this fact, those  elected will have to rule under the excessively heavy burden of  an economy out of control.    [Sotero] Will government coffers continue to be locked?    [Ricupero] The government has clearly defined its position  on  spending: It will seek a strict balance between public accounts  and the federal budget. The budget is both small and behind  schedule. Many sectors will suffer hardships, but the budget was  prepared along those lines. It is important for it to be  approved so that clear guidelines may be established for the  administration, and to enable it to be rigorously implemented.  We only need the budget to ensure the success of the program.  The budget will be the law for the government. This will  preclude any possible use of it for electoral purposes.    [Sotero] Do you attach any significance to the fact that it  was [Former Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique Cardoso who  proposed your appointment to President Franco?    [Ricupero] I am a friend of Cardoso. I will not say that  this is meaningless, because I am honored by his proposing me.  This will be very important in ensuring the continuity of the  plan. I fully endorse the plan.    [Sotero] Do you have any doubt about achieving fiscal  adjustment with the measures adopted thus far? Is it a question  of just implementing them?    [Ricupero] I believe fiscal adjustment has been basically  achieved. We have to formalize it through the approval of the  budget. It would have been better if the original Social  Emergency Fund proposal had been approved. Unfortunately, it  was not possible to have it approved without changes. Even so,  we can achieve fiscal balance with what we have. New decisions,  like salary changes for personnel of other branches of  government, would make this goal more difficult. These expenses  are not included in the budget. This is why I have insisted on  the need for a final solution to these structural problems in  the Constitution itself, whose provisions have led to salary  differences among the branches of government and to decisions  that provoked new problems. All this must be addressed with a  desire to promote harmonious coexistence among the three  branches. I have never addressed this problem without observing  absolute respect for the Supreme Court, for the judicial branch,  and for Congress, while bearing in mind the aim of their  members, as Brazilians, to reach stability. We have to address  the causes of these problems. If we find that the present legal  system jeopardizes stability and that the country is thus  finding it difficult to bring inflation under control, then the  current constitutional revision process, which still has two  months of sessions, should focus on this problem. There is no  reason why we should not to try to improve those constitutional  provisions.    [Sotero] In the wake of your appointment, it has been  speculated that you might have problems because you will not  enjoy the same type of relationship Cardoso had with President  Franco.    [Ricupero] I am glad you mentioned that. I maintain very  harmonious relations with the president and with members of his  staff. I am a close friend of all of them. I am on very good  terms with Henrique Hargreaves, who was my colleague during  [Former President Jose] Sarney's government; and with  [Presidency Secretary General] Mauro Durante, who helped me the  most when I was appointed minister for the Amazon region.  Besides, I have my own staff at Planalto Palace, whom I intend  to keep with the president's concurrence. I am a close friend  of Jose Castro Ferreira and the other presidential advisers:  Osiris Lopes is a longstanding friend. I am also on good terms  with the members of Cardoso's team, and I feel one of them  because they are all longstanding friends. Thus, I cannot see  any incompatibility, and I feel I will be able to move smoothly  from one position to another.    [Sotero] Do you find it necessary to adjust the plan?    [Ricupero] I do not see any flaw in the plan. Respected  economists like Mario Henrique Simonsen have praised the plan  and have described the concept behind it as excellent. The  issues we will have to address from now on will be focused on  how to translate all this into our daily life. As the American  saying goes: "The devil is in the details." Details have not  yet been worked out. One cannot speak of adjustments, because  this means correcting the plan, which would not be the case. As  scheduled, we will now define all the financial, economic, and  legal rules for the transition into the real cruzeiro. This  process, which is now under way, requires an enormous amount of  work. The legal side alone poses intricate issues. By  arranging the transfer of office on 5 April, Cardoso and I will,  in our speeches, touch on certain general guidelines for the  next stage -- although still in very general terms -- because it  is still in the preparatory stage.    [Sotero] Has a date been set for the change of currency?    [Ricupero] No. This is one of the topics under discussion,  not just by the team but by the president and members of the  government, because we need to find a point of equilibrium. We  can neither be hasty nor wait for too long. This is not an easy  task. It requires fine tuning with economic developments. The  only firm information is that which has already been announced;  that is, that the date for the implementation of the new  currency will be announced 35 days in advance. Thus, no one  will be taken by surprise.    [Sotero] Do you have a date in mind?    [Ricupero] You know I am not inclined to lie. Whenever I  cannot tell something to the press, I state my reasons. The  issue here is not that I cannot disclose a conversion date,  written on a piece of paper, that is being kept in a safe. The  truth is that no date has been set.    [Sotero] Does the same rule apply to the various exchange  rates of the new currency? Does the internal debate indicate  that the government is moving toward a fixed rate or a system of  levels? How will the question of convertibility of the new  currency be resolved?    [Ricupero] Those possibilities are being duly assessed, one  in relation to the other. There has yet been no definition. I  hope that by early next week the economic team will give me some  paragraphs on the general characteristics of stage three of the  plan. One thing I have sharply emphasized is that I will first  examine any proposal brought to me by the team and then take it  to the president. I want to do everything in absolute agreement  with him, just as Cardoso used to do.    [Sotero] Is Brazil prepared to end inflation?    [Ricupero] I believe Brazilian society is mature enough to  undertake the final effort toward stabilization and reform with  a view to resuming development. People are weary of inflation  and hope the country will find its course. There are still some  problems stemming from our political institutions and  constitutional provisions. I believe our objective economic  conditions are good. We did not have these conditions during the  previous transition period in 1989. We have a high level of  reserves that enable the Central Bank to overcome any  speculative maneuvers. We have concluded our foreign debt  negotiations. In a few more days, the foreign debt will be a  finished business. Furthermore, contrary to the situation  prevailing a few years ago, our economy grew in 1993 and  continues to grow in 1994. This has brought us relief. This  growth has been achieved through an extremely high productivity  rate. Our agricultural harvest could be the largest ever  because the Northeastern region again figures for statistical  purposes and companies have been streamlined. The rate of  indebtedness within the private sector is currently the one of  the lowest in the world. I believe the subjective conditions  influencing business and workers confidence are equally good.  There are also favorable international economic conditions  because there has been an acceleration in the U.S. growth with  reasonable interest rates, and there are signs of an economic  recovery in Europe. All these point in a positive direction.  All that is required now is to be very firm in the subject of  balancing the budget and of improving our constitutional  provisions.</p>

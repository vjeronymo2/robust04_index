			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe rises on bid war speculation Defence and engineering giant British Aerospace tookcentre stage for a second time this week on rumours of a counter bid for its Rover subsidiary and on the news of a larger than expected Pounds 250m provision for its regional turboprop fleet. Dealers reacted with initial shock to the level of provisions and marked the shares sharply lower. However, the stock ralliedquickly on rumours that BAe's Pounds 800m deal with BMW could be surpassed. Renault was seen as a potential bidder while a Rover management buyout was also mentioned. But it was Honda - holder of a 20 per cent stake in Rover - which received most attention. The shares eventually closed up 22 at 575p, with turnover hitting 6.7m. Analysts were sceptical of any bid. 'Honda was offered the BAe stake last autumn and decided not to take it,' said Mr Bruce McDonald at Smith New Court. Suggestions that GEC, up 5 at 349 1/2 p, might revive interest inBAe were not taken too seriously. BAe's decision to make provisions was universally admired as simplifying the balance sheet. Although widely foreshadowed, the amount was Pounds 50m more than expected and triggered an early sell-off to 538p. But initial worries melted away on closer scrutiny and one analyst, reflecting the confident mood over BAe since the Rover deal, forecast a target upsideof 700p a share.</p>

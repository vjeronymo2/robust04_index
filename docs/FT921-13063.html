			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Trade burns bright on US presidential trail - Bush's ill-conceived Tokyo trip has exposed underlying tensions PRESIDENT Bush's ill-conceived trade mission to Tokyo exposed underlying tensions in the US-Japan relationship at a time when the presidential campaign already under way has made trade issues more prominent than ever. The aftershocks of Mr Bush's visit are still being felt. In Tokyo, Mr Yoshio Sakaurauchi, the House speaker, issued a pro forma apology for suggesting that American workers are lazy and illiterate, but no amount of contrition will obliterate his boast that the US has become 'Japan's subcontractor'. It plays directly into fears in the American electorate, which has never quite accepted the contention that foreign-owned factories bring only 'jobs, jobs, jobs'. In New Hampshire, on Sunday night, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democrat's early frontrunner, tapped deep into the vein of American resentment, calling it 'one of the darkest days in my adult lifetime when a Japanese prime minister said he had sympathy for the American people'. In Washington, the Democrats have virtually been free to criticise the president's trip, because Republican defenders are few. Reports are circulating that the car executives in Mr Bush's entourage only learned they were to make the trip after reading it in the press. In the past they have sought new voluntary import restraints, but this time they were told the policy was to break into the Japanese market, whether or not they had a marketable car to sell. Around the country, newspaper headlines have been thundering about Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's contention that pledges to double purchases of US cars by 1995 were 'only a target ..a kind of forecast.' It has been noted that President Bush's deal is the kind of 'managed trade' he has always opposed. Worry about the economy has been dominating the New Hampshire primary, and Japan provides an incendiary focal point. Sen Bob Kerrey is playing the Japan card to the hilt in one of his television commercials, vowing to 'tell the Japanese if we can't sell in your markets, they can't sell in ours.' Neither Gov Clinton nor SenKerrey are protectionists. Both see the US troubles with Japan as rooted in the failure of the Reagan and Bush administrations to apply consistent pressure on Japan under the US trade laws on the books. Sen Kerrey refuses to support the latest proposal by Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, which would force Japan to reduce its trade deficit by 20 per cent a year over the next five years. That would be necessary 'only if George Bush is re-elected,' Sen Kerrey said. Mrs Paula Stern, former chairman of the International Trade Commission and one of Gov Clinton's advisers, says he is a committed multinationalist who wants greater co-operation among the big three economic powers. There are two protectionists in the presidential race - SenTom Harkin, the Democratic populist, and Mr Pat Buchanan, the president's Republican challenger, who vows, as 'an America First president,' to stand up to the 'tough-minded nationalists' in Japan. Sen Harkin is promising to 'bash' President Bush instead of Japan. 'He's doing what's in Japan's best interest, and we need a president who will do what's in our best interest.' Sen Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, took to the Senate floor on Monday, its first day in session, to contend that the trip 'smacks of a political quick-fix to the Japanese trade problem.' If the president really wanted to solve US trade problems with Japan, he would have worked with Congress 'to fashion comprehensive trade and competitiveness policy,' Sen Baucus said. 'Such a policy could make a real difference. Unfortunately, it could not be completed in time for the primary season.' It took the Wall Street Journal, that unremitting enemy of managed trade, to come to the president's defence, noting that the car parts deal could serve 'a useful purpose' in changing Japanese behavior. 'If the auto parts agreement leads Japanese multinationals to become more open to the rest of the world, then the end result of this flirtation with managed trade could be a freer world trading system,' it said.</p>

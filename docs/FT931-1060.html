			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Germans reduce Treasury bill rate PRESSURES inside the European exchange rate mechanism eased again yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised some currency dealers by announcing a large cut in the interest rate of one of its money market instruments. The Bundesbank cut the interest rate on its 3-day Treasury bill by 90 basis points to 7.5 per cent. The move came a week after the Bundesbank cut its discount rate by 50 basis points, also to 7.5 per cent. Some dealers described the move as a significant easing of policy by the Bundesbank because the Treasury bill rate is sometimes seen as marking the effective floor for all rates in the German cash market rates. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, said the cut was significant because the cost of borrowing D-Marks overnight has been at comparatively high levels recently.

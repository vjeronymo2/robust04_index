			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KHOMEINI'S HEALTH DETERIORATING; PRAYER URGED  </P> <P> Iran said Saturday that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's health is  deteriorating, and it urged the nation to pray for its leader, who has taken a  turn for the worse after undergoing major surgery last month.  </P> <P> A statement broadcast on Tehran Radio described the change in the 87-year-old  leader's condition as a "complication" but gave no details.  </P> <P> It said doctors were attempting to carry out the necessary treatment and that  it hoped and expected that the prayers of the people would be answered.  </P> <P> "We call on all the pious nation to continue their sincere prayers," the  statement said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Son Calls for Prayers  </P> <P> Khomeini's office, controlled by his son and chief aide, Ahmed, also appealed  to the revolutionary leader's Shiite Muslim followers to keep praying for his  recovery.  </P> <P> Tehran Television followed its regular evening newscast with film of Khomeini  in his hospital bed awaiting surgery, interspersed with shots of Iranians at  mass prayer sessions.  </P> <P> The same sequence has been shown nightly since the revolutionary patriarch  underwent surgery at a Tehran hospital May 23 to control intestinal bleeding.  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication that Iran's official media were preparing the  nation for an announcement of his death.  </P> <P> But the report that Khomeini's condition had worsened made a sharp contrast  with earlier medical bulletins stressing that he was making a normal recovery  and taking solid food.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Tehran television said that Khomeini got out of bed to visit with  friends and relatives outside the hospital building. It showed film of the  white-bearded leader sitting in the open air, performing his prayers.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, the television said a "slight cardiac complication" had  arisen May 27 but that it was relieved the next day.  </P> <P> Iran's main opposition group, the Moujahedeen, said last week that Khomeini  suffered a heart attack May 27. The statement by the Iraq-based group said the  heart attack came five days after he underwent surgery on the duodenum, a part  of the small intestine close to the stomach.  </P> <P> But the Moujahedeen's claim could not be independently confirmed.  </P> <P> Khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart attack in 1986.  Since then, he has rarely been seen outside his home in the north Tehran suburb  of Jamaran.  </P> <P> But his hospitalization has heightened already intense speculation about who  will succeed him as leader of the theocratic state.  </P> <P> Political turmoil has gripped the country since Khomeini launched a radical  resurgence in February with his death decree against British author Salman  Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> A purge of so-called moderates who apparently favored rebuilding ties with the  West followed as the 10-year-old Islamic regime withdrew into its isolationist  stance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ousted Montazeri  </P> <P> Khomeini in March ousted his designated successor, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali  Montazeri, who had openly criticized the regime's shortcomings, then appointed  a 20-member committee to review the succession.  </P> <P> But in the absence of a single personality who could match the patriarch's  political and revolutionary authority, there is widespread speculation that  Iran may be ruled by a collective leadership in the post-Khomeini era.  </P> <P> Khomeini swept to power in 1979 in a mass movement of Islamic enthusiasm and  rejection of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's pro-Western monarchy and directed the  nation through an eight-year war with Iraq.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Silvia de Souza Costa] </F>   [Text] Brazil is proposing that ALADI [Latin American  Integration Association] be transformed into a regional  negotiation forum similar to GATT to promote the creation of a  South American Free Trade Area [Area de Livre Comercio  Sul-Americana -- ALCSA]. According to Ambassador Paulo Nogueira  Batista, the idea, presented by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim on  11 February during the ALADI meeting in Montevideo, was well  received by the other 10 countries that are members of the  organization.    "The foreign ministers were very comprehensive and now we  intend to strengthen contacts so as to prepare a concrete  proposal as soon as possible. We hope this will be possible  during the first half of the year in order to begin the free  trade process on 1 January 1995," Nogueira Batista said.    Minister Amorim explained in Montevideo the details of ALCSA  which was presented by President Itamar Franco to the Rio Group  at the end of last year. During informal meetings with his  colleagues, Franco discussed the Brazilian initiative whose  objective is "to favor economic and social development through  accelerated free trade" among the South American countries  within a maximum period of 10 years. The beginning of this  agreement would be the existing structures of Mercosur and the  Andean Pact. "We understand that the free trade negotiations  should be limited to goods and tariffs and nontariffs, through  which we could simplify and make possible the faster approval of  these agreements," the foreign minister said.    Minister Amorim said that the creation of ALCSA "will  reinforce the action capability of Latin America in a  hemispheric and international scope." Ambassador Nogueira  Batista said that any eventual negotiation with NAFTA (North  American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada,  and Mexico) should take place only on a second stage.    According to the ambassador, the summit meeting summoned by  U.S. President Bill Clinton for the second half of the year will  be political and will not deal with trade matters. An indication  of the good reception given to the Brazilian proposal was the  decision of the 11 ALADI members (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia,  Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and Uruguay,  besides Brazil) to strengthen the association.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Putting a spin on London news A Yorkshire tumble-dryer millionaire plans to launch a free evening newspaper for London within the next few months. The newspaper - to be called Tonight - will be the first competition for the Evening Standard since 1987 when Lord Rothermere closed the Evening News for the second time. It had been temporarily revived to spoil the launch of Robert Maxwell's London Daily News. The man behind the newspaper, which is to be published Monday to Friday, is Mr Derek Clee who took over tumble-dryer manufacture at a Halifax factory formerly owned by Philips, the electronics group. The newspaper is to be edited by Mr Peter Grimsditch, the Oxford classics graduate who used to edit Mr David Sullivan's Daily Sport, best known for its pictures of naked women. Mr Grimsditch, who has also edited the Daily Star, got his new job after answering a small advertisement in The Guardian for a newspaper editor. Tonight will be distributed at main London underground and railway stations. Mr Clee has signed a five-year agreement with the PA news agency for news, sport, pictures and graphics. The newspaper is taking Pace, the new PA service for evening newspapers. Distribution will be handled by Mr Jim Basford, who has been circulation director of the Evening Standard for 20 years. Mr Grimsditch said last night that the Evening Standard had become too elitist. Tonight would be 'a modernised Evening News' aimed at the middle market. He plans to hire about 15 journalists, while relying heavily on material from the PA. 'Some people at least buy the Standard because there is nothing else to buy,' he argued. 'I am trying to meld national newspaper professionalism with regional content.' The newspaper will aim for a distribution of about 150,000 copies a day within a week of its launch. Eventual distribution will cover the whole area within the M25. Last night Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Evening Standard, said: 'I regard all daily newspapers as competition.' But he warned that the new newspaper was planning to launch at a time when newsprint prices were rising and classified advertising had not fully recovered from recession. The launch of Tonight will be a departure for London, which has not had a free newspaper. Robert Maxwell talked about launching a free newspaper for the capital called The Londoner while he was setting up the London Daily News. But nothing ever came of it. Reed International launched the Daily News as a free title in Birmingham, but it was not a financial success and is now a weekly.</p>

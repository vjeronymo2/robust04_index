			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Japanese season remains clouded - Sony/Matsushita/Honda Earnings announcements by Japanese companies gather full steam this week, with brokers, trading houses, construction companies and leading consumer electronics companies reporting their annual results. Although many brokers, due to unveil results on Wednesday, reduced their profit forecasts in March, most are likely to show recovery. In consumer electronics, Sony will release figures on Thursday. A 30 per cent fall is expected in parent company pre-tax profits, due to depressed domestic demand, while pre-tax earnings are forecast to rise 8 per cent due to recovery in the US. Matsushita Electric Industrial, due on Friday, expects a 4 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax earnings and a 7 per cent decline at pre-tax level. With orders falling for nearly two years, construction companies, reporting on Thursday, are expected to show weak figures. Nomura Research Institute estimates that the sector's pre-tax profits fell by about 17 per cent in the year to March. NRI forecasts a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the trading houses, hit by a decline in imports caused by the economic slump. Many companies are still suffering from securities investment losses from the late 1980s. Honda, the carmaker, has pencilled in a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits because of decline in domestic demand.</p>

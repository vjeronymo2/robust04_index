			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Prescription for IBM: a new Thomas Watson: The search for a leader to turn around the ailing computer giant THE deliberations of the directors charged with finding a new leader for the world's largest computer company have been cloaked in secrecy. Even senior International Business Machines executives are in the dark. However, the search for a successor to Mr John Akers remains the favourite topic of industry gossip. Seven weeks before a self-imposed deadline, the quest for a new chief executive appears to be narrowing to a short list of candidates from within the industry. Names frequently mentioned include Mr John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer, Mr Paul Stern, who resigned as chairman of Northern Telecom just two days after Mr Akers announced that he would be stepping down at IBM, Mr Larry Bossidy, chairman of Allied Signal, and Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior vice-president, the only 'insider' considered a likely candidate. When the search committee was established in January, IBM said that it was seeking the best qualified person - inside or outside the company, and inside or outside the computer industry. Technical expertise is not seen as a necessity, the company said. The most important qualification, IBM says, is that the individual be 'a proven and effective leader, skilled in managing change'. The new chief executive of IBM must be able to deliver inspirational addresses and at the same time cut the workforce by tens of thousands. He must rebuild the confidence of Wall Street in the company that was long the bluest of blue chips, but which lately has seen its stock price plunge and its dividends cut. Most importantly, he must make customers believe, once again, that IBM can provide technology that will enhance the performance of their businesses. Finding somebody able and willing to take on such a challenge will not be easy. Those who want the job probably underestimate the difficulties, while those who appreciate the enormity of the task may shrink from it, industry executives say. Yet IBM's problems are not unique. Like many smaller companies it has been overtaken by market and technology trends. IBM's next leader is probably somebody who has already addressed such problems. He will be a 'change agent' who commands respect, if not popularity. Mr Paul Stern made few friends at Northern Telecom and would not be a popular choice among IBM employees. However, as an ex-IBMer he is said to understand the company's culture. He is known as a hard-driving manager who would not flinch from prescribing the drastic surgery that many industry analysts say IBM must undergo. Mr John Sculley has told close associates that he has no plans to leave Apple Computer. However, his recent purchase of a house in Greenwich, Connecticut, close to IBM's East Coast headquarters, has fuelled the rumour mill. According to one former IBM executive, Mr Sculley has engaged consultants to research IBM's problems so he can make a persuasive presentation to IBM's selection committee, but associates of Mr Sculley say this is unbelievable. Apple's alliances with IBM in the personal computer arena have given Mr Sculley more insight into the workings of IBM than any other 'outside' candidate. He is also a master of public relations and has a reputation as a technology "visionary'. Mr Larry Bossidy of Allied Signal is reported to have made several visits to IBM's headquarters in recent weeks, firing speculation that he may be in the running for the top job. At Allied Signal, a diversified industrial conglomerate, Mr Bossidy has masterminded a broad restructuring and produced a strong profit rebound. Mr James Cannavino has long hoped to succeed to the top post at IBM, according to associates and industry executives. As general manager of IBM's personal systems division, he was responsible for last year's restructuring of IBM's personal computer business which is now increasing its market share after several years of decline. Mr Cannavino is also in charge of IBM's workstation technology which promises to become the core of the company's next generation mainframe computers, as well as future personal computers and hand-held computer devices. Known within the company as a non-conformist, Mr Cannavino eschews the buttoned-down style of IBM's top echelon. He is called the 'outside insider', with a deep understanding of the company's culture but a strong belief that it must change. The search committee is headed by Mr James Burke, the retired chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and includes six people from outside the computer industry: Mr Thomas Murphy, chairman of Capital Cities/ABC; Mr Stephen Bechtel, retired chairman of the Bechtel Group; Mr Thomas Frist, chairman of Hospital Corporation of America; Mr J. Richard Munro, retired co-chairman of Time Warner; former US Secretary of Defense Mr Harold Brown; and Wellesley College president Ms Nannerl Keohane. The committee has hired two executive search firms, Heidrick &amp; Struggles and Spencer Stuart, to help find a new chief executive. Industry observers expect IBM to present its new chief executive at the annual shareholders meeting, scheduled for April 26. That leaves little time for the selection committee to decide on its candidate, and negotiate terms. The decision will certainly not be easy. By announcing its willingness to consider outside candidates, the board has added to the symbolism of the event. IBM has not brought in a chief executive from outside its own ranks since 1914, when the company was still called Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. The man chosen then - needed, just like today's candidates, to reinvent a floundering company - was Mr Thomas Watson Sr, the founder of the modern IBM. The new chief executive's task will be difficult enough, in all conscience, without inviting comparison with one of the 20th century's most influential businessmen. But if he can manage a fraction of Mr Thomas Watson's achievements, the search committee will have spent its time wisely.</p>

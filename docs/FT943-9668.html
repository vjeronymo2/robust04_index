			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Long hot summer hinders crops The long hot summer has produced an earlier harvest than usual in many parts of the country, but the lack of rain is pushing yields down in some areas, the National Farmers' Union said yesterday, Alison Maitland writes. The sunshine has ripened the cereal crop up to two weeks early, said Mr John Malcolm, the union's chief economist, but the shortage of rain, especially in the south and south-west of England, means that the ears of corn have not swelled out fully. Combined with poorer soil quality, this has left areas such as the Cotswolds and Chilterns reporting yields as low as 4 tonnes a hectare compared with a national average of 5.5 tonnes in a normal year. But fortunate farmers in parts of East Anglia, England's bread basket, are reporting yields as high as 10 tonnes a hectare. Mr Malcolm said this was thanks either to well-timed cloudbursts during the past month or to farmers' decisions to irrigate. Commodities, Page 24</p>

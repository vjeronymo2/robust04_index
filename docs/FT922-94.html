			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / E German unions plan jobs protest EAST German trade unions have called a demonstration outside the Berlin headquarters of the Treuhand privatisation agency today against a new wave of job losses which could put up to 600,000 people on the streets in the next few months. The first redundancies take effect tomorrow when former state companies under the Treuhand's umbrella axe 150,000 jobs as a result of privatisation and restructuring. Another 10,000 jobs will be lost when the Treuhand lays off people currently employed in job creation schemes. Some 436,500 other employees on short-time work face possible unemployment as the Bonn government tomorrow halts payment of half of their medical insurance costs. The financially strapped companies employing them will be forced to pick up the entire bill. Most survive only from subsidies paid by Bonn for job creation schemes and they are considered unlikely to be able to absorb the higher personnel costs, choosing instead to shed labour. The massive dismissals will push up unemployment in east Germany, which reached an official 14.1 per cent last month or, 1.1m people. Real unemployment, however, estimated at close to 30 per cent, has long been masked by the subsidised job creation and retraining programmes. The rise in unemployment is a sign that the east German economy is undergoing a painful but necessary transformation. The grim employment picture came as east German manufacturing companies reported only marginally improved business prospects. A monthly poll of 260 companies by the Institute of Economic Research in Halle disclosed that orders in May scarcely rose from the previous month. However, the percentage of companies reporting bad business prospects fell to below 16 per cent for the first time this year.</p>

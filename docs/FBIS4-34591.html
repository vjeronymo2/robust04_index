			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gabriela Coutino] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Peasant and  Indian members of the State Council of Indian and Peasant  Organizations [CEOIC] who have been waging a sit-down strike are  refusing to put their trust in and open negotiations with  Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and other representatives  of the federal government because, they argue, "we signed a  draft agreement with them on 4 April and they failed to comply."    Meanwhile, Lopez Moreno has explained to the media that he  is  not the federal government's commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas: "As governor, it is my duty to  coordinate compliance with federal and local agreements intended  to strengthen peace." Lopez Moreno convened a news conference to  discuss the status of the state. In addition, he maintained  that conditions exist for holding elections on 21 August.    He indicated that within the past 40 hours, significant  progress has been achieved at the five bargaining tables that  were set up to establish a more direct dialogue with CEOIC  members. He did not, however, give any details, and he would  only say "they were discussing" the agenda outlined by the  organization.    As for the upcoming elections, Lopez Moreno stated: "We are  moving on satisfactorily, and we maintain good relations with  all political organizations." Tonight, he indicated he will  hold a meeting with ranchers and small rural landowners to  jointly set up a working agenda -- following the same pattern  used with the CEOIC -- and, in turn, respond to complaints made  by the ranchers.    The peasants, meanwhile, pointed out that the government is  still lying and that no substantial progress or results have  come from their negotiations. The Emiliano Zapata Proletariat  Organization [OPEZ], a member of the CEOIC, noted in a news  release: "The government is encouraging ranchers and landowners  by claiming that it will act in keeping with the law (land  evictions) to recover seized properties."    It says that in light of this situation, President Salinas  should handle the Chiapas problem himself. Having lost hope,  the peasants view "the system as their historic enemy." The  news release states that Chiapas is experiencing a class  conflict in which the government has ceased to be an arbiter and  has become the ally of the rich. The rich put the government in  power, and the rich expect to benefit from government policies.    This is why Colosio was assassinated, OPEZ adds. Camacho was  forced to resign because the government still believes Chiapas  will be a deciding factor in the upcoming elections.    But now, OPEZ asserts, current circumstances favor us. A  unique situation exists, because now there is a Zapatist  National Liberation Army [EZLN]. "There are no peace  agreements," elections are coming, and society has great  expectations. If there are no solutions, we "will radicalize"  our position by seizing land and carrying out actions to force  the government to heed us and answer our demands.    Another situation affecting the state stems from discontent  in several local mayor's offices. Following six days in jail,  four municipal officials from Angel Albino Corzo were freed by  peasants who demanded an investigation into the case and the  mayor's dismissal. According to the Chiapas Public Prosecutor's  Office, the municipal presidency remains closed to prevent any  aggression.  <H5>  Proposals From the Chiapas Diocese </H5>   Tuxtla Gutierrez Bishop Felipe Aguirre Franco said three  Chiapas dioceses will present several plans and proposals to the  federal government on the armed conflict. Pope John Paul II  will give his authorization for this action.    Aguirre Franco added that the bishops' proposal has been  addressed to the Mexican Government through Samuel Ruiz Garcia,  bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. At this point, Aguirre  Franco believes that both the federal and the state governments  are making "adjustments," but this does not mean that  negotiations are at a standstill but, rather, that the new EZLN  proposals are being studied.    Aguirre mentioned that on 1-11 July he will be in Rome,  where  he will meet with the pope. He will submit an in-depth report  on the works conducted by his diocese within the past six years  to the pope. He will also give his view regarding the armed  Indian uprising in the area of the Chiapas highlands and the  Lacandona Jungle, and he will give a thorough account of  developments since the EZLN's emergence.</p>

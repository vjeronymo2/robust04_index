			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (1): The industry's focus is narrowing - The swashbuckling days of the venture capital industry are long past. The shift now towards larger deals and the emphasis on buy-outs means that even the largest venture capital firms are being forced into alliances VENTURE CAPITAL is dead. Long live private equity. The strength of the recession together with structural changes in the venture capital industry have combined to bury the notion that the US venture capital model could be exported to Europe in its original form. It is being replaced by a range of equity investments which frequently owe more to the corporate finance skills of the merchant banker than to the hands-on, industry-wise expertise of the early US venture capitalists. It is not a risk-free activity but it seeks a more stable investment climate than that required by the venture capital pioneers who backed Genentech, Microsoft and Apple Computer. In the UK, the most innovative European venture capital market, the dominance of management buy-outs and later stage, development capital investments is so complete that an early swing back to start-ups or early stage funding appears unlikely. 'There was a naive belief that the US model could be repeated in the UK, says Mr Ian Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures. 'But you are talking about a much smaller economy with much longer lead times for companies to get established.' This narrowing of the focus of the venture capital industry has yet to become fully apparent because many of the funds which have been unable to raise further finance have simply gone quiet, managing their portfolios on a 'caretaker' basis. There is evidence though of an increasing casualty rate among the early stage players, the poor performers and the peripheral funds for which venture capital was not a mainstream activity. Even the large funds which remain have been reducing the scale of activity in tricky and less profitable areas of start-ups and technology businesses. They now concentrate on buy-outs and on helping established, profitable companies expand. 'There is a successful (UK) development capital industry, but how do we address the early stage and seed capital investments?' asks Mr John Hustler, venture capital partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Venture capital has been good for part of the funding gap.' The structural changes now under way in UK venture capital provide a sombre backcloth for the government's declared enthusiasm for the industry. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, noted approvingly in his 1992 budget speech that Britain had a venture capital industry 'the equal of that anywhere in the world, outside the US.' Yet his remarks came at a time when the industry was retreating from backing the small companies which formed the core of he government's enterprise drive during the 1980s. His comments also highlighted a discrepancy between stated government aims and its policies towards venture capital. The abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme from the end of 1993 will remove a tax-based initiative with the potential (never quite realised) to help small firms raise equity. There are already calls for a replacement for the BES to be devised but the government has shown a marked aversion to tax-based incentives of this kind or of any pump-priming help for the venture capital industry generally. Amid the gloom there are signs that the smaller investments, those which are uneconomic for the larger venture capital houses are being taken over by small, local venture firms and groups of private investors or 'business angels.' The local venture capitalists frequently have the financial backing of a local authority or its pension fund or organisations such as enterprise agencies and Training and Enterprise Councils. There is some evidence that wealthy private individuals, usually with a business background, are backing small firms, either individually or as part of small syndicates. In the US, business angels are thought to provide two or three times as much finance as the formal venture capital industry. The UK government is currently sponsoring five pilot schemes to see how this idea could be developed. At the same time, attempts are continuing to make small scale venture investments work. Midland Bank has unveiled a scheme to provide equity finance to promising business customers while 3i is experimenting with initiatives to cut the cost of small investments and to involve local business support agencies in selecting companies to back. AGAINST the background of these structural changes, the venture capitalists have to continue to earn their management fees. UK venture capital companies invested Pounds 1.15bn in 1991, a decline of 17 per cent on the year before, while the number of companies backed fell by 11 per cent to 1,386, according to the British Venture Capital Association. Funds raised also fell sharply, to just Pounds 276m from Pounds 832m in 1990. The extent of these declines is not quite as bad as it first seems because they suffer from comparison with the late 1980s when the statistics were inflated by a small number of very large management buy-outs and buy-ins. Even so, some venture capitalists expect a further contraction of the UK industry this year. With the recession less marked in continental Europe, European venture firms (including those in the UK) increased investments by 12 per cent to Ecu4.6bn (Pounds 3.2bn). The strongest growth occurred in France, Italy and Spain though Britain remained the largest single market. Continental fund raising also increased, by 14 per cent to Ecu2.9bn. In the US, meanwhile, fund-raising fell for the fourth year running in 1991 to Dollars 1.27bn, according to Venture Economics, a specialist publisher. Investment levels fell to a 10-year low of Dollars 1.36bn. But even recessions have their silver lining and the present economic climate is a good one for making investments. Deals are more reasonably priced though they frequently require far more work on the part of the venture capitalist to bring together a good management team, finance and, sometimes, a corporate partner, says David Wansbrough of ECI Ventures. The shift towards larger deals and the emphasis on buy-outs has meant that even the largest venture capital firms are being forced into alliances. Companies disposing of parts of their business by way of a buy-out increasingly want to deal with a financial purchaser rather than a management team. At the same time many venture capitalists have grown wary of participating in large syndicates. It is this trend towards 'bought deals' which has led to 3i, the largest UK venture capital group, joining forces with Prudential Venture Managers to underwrite medium and large management buy-outs. Legal &amp; General, a life assurance group which makes direct venture capital investments, meanwhile, has announced plans to seek co-investors to provide half the finance for a series of new funds which would raise Pounds 100m a year over the next few years. Even the bank-owned 'captive' funds have begun to consider raising outside finance. This has the additional advantage for them of avoiding the need to take the investee companies onto their books as operating subsidiaries - 'I would guess that we would raise capital in the market place in about three years,' says Mr David Shaw, managing director of County NatWest Ventures, part of National Westminster Bank. RECENT events have shown it is not only the independent funds, dependent on outside capital, which are vulnerable to swings in investor sentiment. Hill Samuel, part of the TSB banking group, decided earlier this year to pull out of direct venture capital investments in order to concentrate on activities with a quicker return. Most banks have made large provisions for loan losses and there can be few which have not looked at their venture capital activities, as well as their other operations, to see if they were worth continuing. Much of the heart-searching which the venture capital industry is going through is the result of the unexpectedly poor performance of many funds. Early promises of high returns have not been fulfilled, particularly by funds which invested at the peak of the economic cycle in 1988-89. Yet, until recently, no serious attempt had been made to establish a standardised method of valuing companies or of judging the performance of funds. Valuation guidelines have now been agreed in the UK and in continental Europe and work has started on comparable performance measures. This is further evidence that the swashbuckling early days of the venture industry are long past.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ru, li": "State Demands Compensation for </F> Damages Resulting From Compliance With UN Embargoes"]    [Text] Prague--The Czech Republic has lost billions  [currency not specified] as a result of economic sanctions  declared by the UN Security Council against various countries.  It is likely, however, that at least a part of these losses will  be compensated by UN bodies.    Damage resulting from the economic embargo imposed on  Serbian-Montenegrin Yugoslavia in June 1992 was estimated at  $290 million (approximately 8.56 billion Czech korunas [Kc])  late last year. The bulk of this sum, $260 million, is made up  of claims by foreign trade companies for goods delivered before  the embargo was imposed. The goods in question were mostly  engineering products, vehicles, and some chemicals, Jiri  Vetrovsky, director of the Ministry of Finance Foreign Exchange  Department, stated.    In an explanatory statement on the bill, by means of which  the Czech Republic joined the sanctions, the government voices  the expectation that losses resulting from observance of the  sanctions will be addressed in negotiations with the UN Security  Council.    Of the countries that apply sanctions against Yugoslavia,  the  impact of the embargo is felt mostly severely by Romania,  Bulgaria, and Hungary. Hungary's losses have already exceeded  the sum of $1.3 billion. Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs  Geza Jeszenszky proposed the establishment of a UN fund, from  which assistance would be given to states adhering to the  embargo. Peace mediator David Owen also called for the  compensation of losses last month.    For losses incurred in connection with the conflict in the  Persian Gulf, in the course of which an embargo had been imposed  on Iraq and Kuwait, the Czech Republic claims, for the time  being, a compensation of approximately Kc7.3 billion. It is  asserting this claim through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  with the UN Compensation Commission.    A total of 42 organizations suffered losses as a result of  the embargo, of which 19 meet the UN conditions for  compensation. The main part of the damages, worth about Kc5.5  billion, is accounted for by claims for unpaid deliveries to  Iraq and Kuwait. The remainder results from unsalable  inventories, outstanding interest payments for credits extended  under duress, and damage to property.</p>

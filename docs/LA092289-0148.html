			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EDISON DUMPS DOMINGUEZ, 30-16  </P> <P> Being at the right place at the right time three times in a row keyed Edison  High School to a 30-16 nonleague victory over Dominguez Thursday night in front  of 2,000 at Westminster High School.  </P> <P> It also offered a prime opportunity for tailback Shane Sherman, who scored  three touchdowns to lead the Chargers (2-1).  </P> <P> Although Edison trailed, 16-13, late in the third quarter, its defense forced  three turnovers, all of which led to consecutive scoring drives.  </P> <P> With seconds remaining in the third quarter, Dominguez' James Jackson fumbled  at his own three-yard line, thanks to a swarming Edison defense. Charger tackle  Lawson Mollica recovered at the three, and Sherman scored what proved to be the  winning touchdown on a two-yard run.  </P> <P> On the first play of Dominguez' next possession, Dominguez running back Bruce  Walker fumbled, and Edison's Miles Charlier recovered on the Dominguez 25.  Eight plays later, Sherman scored again, this on a four-yarder, and Doug  Merlino's kick gave the Chargers a 27-16 lead.  </P> <P> But neither team was finished with this routine yet. On Dominguez' very next  possession, quarterback Thomas Lyons was intercepted at its 32 by linebacker  Nick Agosta. Although Sherman's work brought the ball to the 14, Merlino gave  Edison its final score with a 24-yard field goal with 1:28 remaining in the  game.  </P> <P> Sherman, who rushed for 69 yards in 22 carries, also scored Edison's first  touchdown on a four-yard run in the first quarter. He said he and his teammates  were particularly inspired Thursday night after their 37-10 loss to Capistrano  Valley last week.  </P> <P> "Our team worked really hard this week. That loss was real tough for us,"  Sherman said. "They (Dominguez) gave up really early tonight. That 45 (Walker)  was really tired. We didn't give up. We had pride. They didn't. That's what it  takes."  </P> <P> Walker, a highly recruited 6-foot 4-inch, 240-pound senior, looked sensational  at the start, plowing over and through Edison's defense, and scoring his only  touchdown on a 31-yard run in the first quarter. At defense, he was a threat  too, but by the end of the game, he was little threat at all.  </P> <P> Edison quarterback Donnie Smith, who finished 11 for 17 for 136 yards and an  interception, looked especially sharp in the first quarter where he completed 7  of 8 passes. Junior fullback Craig Shusterick contributed Edison's other  touchdown on a six-yard run early in the third quarter.  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Perot under attack at congressional hearing: Senator sound-bites back at the Texan billionaire gadfly over his knowledge of US economy DARING to criticise Mr Ross Perot is reckoned to be a risky political business these days. Early on Tuesday evening, however, Senator Harry Reid decided to buck the odds. The billionaire from Texas, now almost as ubiquitous as he was when running as an independent in the presidential election campaign last year, had invited himself to Capitol Hill to testify (lecture was a more accurate description) before Congress on the iniquitous ways of the perk-ridden legislators and foreign lobbyists who were conspiring to export American jobs world-wide. Warming to his task and flanked by a crowd of cheering acolytes, Mr Perot also laid into the Clinton administration, about which he had been relatively kind, accusing it of incompetent mathematics and 'sound bite' salesmanship. His particular beef was that the president's energy policy advisers were a bunch of 'poets, philosophers and beekeepers', none of whom had ever 'met a payroll' or created a job in all of their working lives. Mr Reid is the Democratic senator from Nevada. He is not reckoned a great power in Congress but, whereas his peers had alternately taken Mr Perot's punches on the chin and fawned over him, the senator decided that he had had enough. 'Ross, I like you a lot,' Mr Reid tactfully began. 'But, in your statement here, you gave us 45 minutes of sound bites and five minutes of detail.' Worse, Mr Perot had demeaned Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of staff, who was indeed from 'corporate America, just like you,' and from the energy sector no less. He then accused Mr Perot of completely misunderstanding the structural nature of the US budget deficit and the caps on federal spending embodied in the 1990 Budget Act. 'I think you should start checking your facts a little more and stop listening to the applause so much,' the senator admonished. Encouraged by Mr Reid's resolution, several other heavyweight senators then presumed to suggest that Mr Perot's views were not always infused by knowledge. Mr Perot does not like being contradicted, especially in front of his flock. In one widely remarked incident last year, on his favourite morning television show, he had come close to losing his temper with a little old lady from Florida who bravely confessed she had not understood his answer to her question on social security. This time, before the legislators, he bristled and blustered, and hinted darkly that Mr McLarty's tenure as chief executive of Arkla, the natural gas concern, was marked by 'problems'. But, in the end, he backed off, said Mr McLarty was 'a fine man', and came as close as he ever does to issuing an apology. 'I regret that anything came up where people had to fall on their swords to defend him,' the Texan billionaire said. Mr Perot then retreated, a little bruised but not bowed, to an evening television talk show, where his reception was far more amenable and where he again laid into Congress and everybody else in Washington with his customary verve. Mr Reid, meanwhile, found himself in the unaccustomed media limelight as the man who had dared to take on Ross Perot.</p>

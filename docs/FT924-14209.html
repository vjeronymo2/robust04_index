			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Tensions mount as Iraq seizes American TENSIONS between Iraq and the US escalated yesterday when Baghdad seized an American munitions expert inside the Kuwait border, and asked a crucial weapons team to delay inspections until after the US presidential elections in November, Reuter reports from Washington. State Department spokesman Mr Richard Boucher said the US was working through diplomatic channels to secure the release of a US citizen named as Mr Chad Hall. At the United Nations, Mr Nizar Hamdoun, Iraq's UN ambassador, said he hoped 'things could be resolved through diplomatic means rather than to get into any situation whereby a crisis may emerge.' Mr Hall 'was safe and in good health', said the Iraqi ambassador. A spokesman for Environmental Health Research and Testing, a Kentucky company clearing away ammunition and explosives left in Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation, said Mr Hall had been working in the area since March. The spokesman said Mr Hall was 'well inside' the demilitarised zone, 'more than one kilometre. . . when he was approached by two men who identified themselves as Iraqis'. He said Mr Hall and two Pakistani employees of the company were only 100 metres from a UN observation post inside Kuwait, but the Iraqis, who were armed, threatened Mr Hall, and 'forced him to go the other side' of the border. Meanwhile, Iraq asked a crucial weapons team to delay inspections until after the US elections. UN spokesman Mr Francois Giuliani said the unusually large weapons inspection team of 50-60 people would go ahead anyway on October 17. It is composed of experts on ballistic missiles and chemical and biological weapons. Reuter adds:The US, under pressure to clear up its debts to the UN, yesterday paid Dollars 225.8m of its share of the UN's 1992 budget, but still owes more than Dollars 300m in various costs. The US State Department said the payment brought to Dollars 780.3m the total amount paid to the UN this year.</p>

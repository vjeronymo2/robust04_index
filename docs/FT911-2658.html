			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Management: Management abstracts Career gridlock: baby boomers hit the wall. DT Hall &amp; J Richter in Academy of Management Executive (US), Aug 90 (16 pages) Points out that for people born between 1946 and 1964 the number of management jobs available is less than the demand and shrinking. This can lead to problems of career plateauing for those with traditional ambition; asserts, however, that there are infinite ways of achieving 'psychological success'; expands on this idea by profiling the baby boomers' value systems, eg they have a need for autonomy and to question authority with a greater concern for a work/family balance. Suggests guidelines for more effective utilisation of baby-boom potential, such as replacing the promotion culture with a psychological success culture. Human resources strategy. RS Schuler &amp; JW Walker in Organizational Dynamics (US), Summer 90. 15 pages. Asserts that 'just as organisations can engage in short-term as well as long-term planning of business strategies, HR planning can be done with a short-term and a long-term focus'; then decides to use the term 'HR strategy' to refer to the short-term thrust. This is said to necessitate greater emphasis on HR concerns, concentration on key issues, the interpretation of just about every aspect of business in HR terms, and the involvement of the line in HR concerns. Relates several cases in which action on the personnel front has shown noteworthy results: the Weyerhaeuser Company's Bayer (ball bearings) plant where crash courses in (product-related) English increased the utility of ethnic labour; Grand Union (food retail) where HR measures brought about better customer service; and Swiss Bank Corporation North America where the marketing people needed training in communications with non-marketing staff.

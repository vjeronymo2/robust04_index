			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Swedish PM balks at Volvo buying Procordia SWEDEN'S prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, yesterday hit out at Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive chairman, over the motor group's proposed SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.7bn) acquisition of Procordia, the Swedish food and health care concern. In a forthright intervention into Sweden's biggest corporate power struggle, Mr Bildt insisted that his government, which has a 42.7 per cent stake in Procordia, opposed the principle of the deal. 'It is not just a question of the price (of the Volvo share offer). It is a question of getting an industrial structure that we can believe in,' he said in an interview. Declaring that the government was discussing 'alternative solutions' to ensure the company's long-term future, Mr Bildt criticised the Volvo chairman's assertiveness. 'Mr Gyllenhammar said he was ready to force the deal through against the government. There is no way that can be done.' The government's reaction to the affair, said Mr Bildt, 'illustrated the end of the old Swedish corporatist way of industrial restructuring. Things are different. The deal has demonstrated that.' Commenting on Volvo's pre-emptive announcement of the takeover two weeks ago, Mr Bildt said: 'We do things somewhat differently under this government, and that I think might be one cause of the troubles there have been. They (Volvo) took it for granted that everything they did would be automatically approved of by the government.' Volvo, already the owner of a 42.7 per cent stake in Procordia, has claimed that the link-up would produce industrial benefits, but is understood to be interested above all in access to Procordia's cash flow. However, Mr Bildt said: 'It is difficult to see any synergy effects. . . . There might be other ways of satisfying their demands for cash flow.'</p>

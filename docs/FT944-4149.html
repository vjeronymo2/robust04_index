			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Hydro-Electric declines 23% to Pounds 35m Scottish Hydro-Electric, the northern Scotland power generator and distributor, saw profits fall in the first half because of regulatory price changes and the cost of government debt redemptions. However, the company's sales in England and Wales rose sharply, cushioning the impact on the results. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 fell 23 per cent from Pounds 45.6m to Pounds 34.9m. The interim dividend was raised by 10 per cent to 4.34p (3.96p) in line with policy of lifting the pay-out by between 6 and 8 per cent in real terms. Earnings fell by 25 per cent to 6.57p (8.81p). However, the company said the underlying growth was 18.5 per cent. Mr Roger Young, the chief executive, said that revenues in Scotland were reduced by a new regulatory requirement which will cut the generation component of prices in stages over the next four years. By 1998, the prices should be in line with the Great Britain yardstick (GBY), which represents the actual price paid for electricity by regional distributors in England and Wales. The effect in the first half was Pounds 3m. Hydro also redeemed Pounds 116m of government debt, at a premium of Pounds 18.8m, but this will result in cheaper borrowing. Offsetting these factors was strong sales growth south of the border, where Hydro has three projects which are beginning to produce results. 'The strategy of expansion in England, which we've talked about for some time, is coming through quite strong now,' said Mr Young. By next year, 15 per cent of generation capacity will be in England. Hydro-Electric is the only electricity company which did not accept the price formula proposed earlier this year by Offer, the industry regulator. Offer has referred the proposal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Young said discussions had begun with the MMC, but it would be several months before the outcome was known. COMMENT The factors shaping these results had been well flagged, and they contained no surprises. The big question mark hanging over the company is the MMC inquiry. Although Hydro is thought to have a strong case for rejecting the Offer formula because of its unusually dispersed market, its commitment to an annual dividend increase of 6-8 per cent in real terms suggests that the cost of serving this market will not impact unduly on earnings. But until this uncertainty is resolved, the shares are likely to show a yield above the sector average.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 15, BNS - The Constitutional Court of  Lithuania established that the parliament's decision allowing  naturalization of former Soviet servicemen as Lithuanian  citizens violates the Lithuanian Constitution.    According to an amendment to the citizenship law, adopted by  the parliament last year, persons who served in Soviet armed  forces and other repressive structures may be granted Lithuanian  citizenship, provided they ceased service before March 1, 1992  and received Lithuanian citizen certificates before Nov. 4, 1991.    The court said dual citizenship is possible only in  exceptional cases, while former Soviet servicemen were Soviet  citizens and received Lithuanian citizenship certificates  unlawfully.    According to unofficial reports, the amendment to the  citizenship law may have affected around 800 former servicemen.</p>

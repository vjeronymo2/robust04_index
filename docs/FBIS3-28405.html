			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chong Hae-yong from Washington] </F>   [Text] A well-informed source in Washington said on 3  February that Ho Chong, North Korean deputy ambassador to the  United Nations, visited Pyongyang between late January and early  February. Observers said that Pyongyang may introduce a new  negotiations card in settling the nuclear issue, since Ho Chong  was in North Korea while the Reverend Billy Graham was there  with a message from President Clinton    The source said: So far, North Korea has kept in contact  with its mission to the United Nations via communication  facilities, such as telephone or fax. North Korea's summoning  of Ho Chong is an indication that the North Korean side is  worried over leakage of information on their negotiations  strategy through wire taps by the United States into the  communication links between Pyongyang and the North Korean  missions in New York.</p>

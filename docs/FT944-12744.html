			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / UK Company News: European groups 'on US buying spree' - Foreign investment jumped to Dollars 32.5bn in the first nine months, says KPMG UK, Swiss and other European companies have been on a buying spree in the US, according to a report by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. Led by Roche of Switzerland's Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.35bn) purchase of Syntex Corporation, foreign companies invested Dollars 32.5bn (Pounds 20.5bn) in outright acquisitions in the US in the first nine months of this year. Deals into the US were higher than at any time this decade, according to KPMG. Takeover activity across the Atlantic rose 126 per cent on the corresponding period of 1993, said KPMG. Much of the increase came from deals of more than Dollars 500m - the total number of transactions was little changed. Transatlantic M&amp;A deals, like US domestic transactions, have been concentrated in a few sectors where consolidation is advancing most rapidly. With SmithKline Beecham of the UK buying Sterling Health, as well as Roche buying Syntex, deals in the chemicals and drugs sector amounted to Dollars 11bn. Sandoz of Switzerland paid Dollars 3.7bn for Gerber Products, a US food company, underpinning Dollars 6bn of acquisitions in the food and drink sector. 'A combination of a relatively weak dollar and the fact that the US economy is leading the emergence from recession makes the US an attractive place to seek acquisitions,' said Mr Richard Agutter, chairman of KPMG's corporate finance network. Some investment bankers said the surge in transatlantic activity reflected no more than the vitality of the US market. 'The basic fact is that the US M&amp;A market is dramatically up,' said Mr Stephen Hester, joint-head of European investment banking for CSFB. 'That is just as true of domestic as it is of transatlantic.' Investment bankers expect the flow of deals in the US to continue, as the restructuring that has driven acquisitions progresses. Some also report that US companies are beginning to look more seriously at expansion in Europe. 'Interest is there, even though volume is flat,' said an M&amp;A specialist with one of the largest US investment banks. 'We expect activity in the opposite direction to pick up considerably.' However, cross-border European M&amp;A activity is at its lowest level for several years, according to a recent survey by Securities Data Company.</p>

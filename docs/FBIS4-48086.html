			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political correspondent Themba Molefe] </F>   [Text] As the new democratic government took its historic  first steps in Cape Town yesterday, it was obviously the  beginning of a new era with former enemies assuming collective  responsibility for South Africa.    It was also obvious that two of the most important players  in  the African National Congress had been sidelined, deliberately  or systematically. ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa was  excluded from the cabinet of the National Assembly as it  gathered in Cape Town. Jay Naidoo, the fiery former  general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,  is Minister Without Portfolio. While it is said Ramaphosa's  omission was at his own request, it indeed has a far-reaching  effect on the ANC-South African Communist Party-COSATU [Congress  of South African Trade Unions] alliance.    Added to that is the fact that Naidoo was tipped for the  portfolio of Minister of Manpower in the ANC government. It is  prudent, therefore, that an attempt be made to chart the power  design of the ANC alliance, as led by man-in-the-middle  President Nelson Mandela.    -- Ramaphosa shouldered the primary responsibility of  negotiating the new dispensation on behalf of his party. He was  second on the ANC list after Mandela and as such was the natural  choice for first executive Deputy President. However, the  riddle remains. Ramaphosa accepted his current post in the ANC  in 1991 on the workers' ticket. He was then general secretary of  the powerful National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] which formed  the bulk of COSATU membership.    -- Naidoo once intimated in an interview that he was the  person most employers loved to hate. And he was depicted in  some newspaper cartoons as the devil incarnate, complete with  horns. It was, after all, COSATU that designed the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]. Therefore,  argument is that the RDP was watered down considerably before  being accepted. This indicates trade unionists, or workers, in  the alliance were being pressured down for pushing hardline  economic policies. The fact of the matter is that COSATU  bolstered the ANC election campaign when it agreed to fight the  poll under its banner. There are other pertinent factors to the  ANC power design, namely, the ANC's internal wing during its  twilight years in exile.    -- The United Democratic Front [UDF] held the movement's  banner, especially bringing to a head the country's politics in  the mid-1980s. While it is not surprising that important former  UDF leaders Popo Molefe and Patrick Lekota were nominated for  premier posts, it becomes clearer that this sector of the  broader ANC movement was being appeased, or accommodated, in the  power design.    Molefe is premier for the Northwest province, while Lekota  heads the [Orange] Free State parliament. The two men were  instrumental in resistance campaigns, which saw them being  jailed in the marathon Delmas Trial in the aftermath of the 1984  anti-high rent unrest in Vaal Triangle townships. The argument  goes even further.    -- The appointment by Mandela of aging former ANC  secretary-general Alfred Nzo to the post of Minister of Foreign  Affairs has been met with wide criticism. Debate surrounding  his appointment, albeit political, emphasises another attempt to  accommodate the ANC's former exiled leadership in the cabinet.  Charismatic Thabo Mbeki, executive Deputy President-elect,  falls in this category even though he was favoured for the  Foreign Ministry portfolio. Dr Pallo Jordan was the obvious  choice for Minister of Information as head of the ANC's  department of information and publicity.    -- Then there is the ANC's "old guard" -- Mandela's men, so  to speak. Here one refers to the Rivonia trialists, but the  only conspicuous appointment is that of Govan Mbeki as Eastern  Cape premier. Poignantly, if workers within the ANC alliance  were to ally themselves with the Ramaphosa-Naidoo cabal -- which  is not formal, perhaps not yet -- a powerful anti-ANC party on  the workers' ticket could emerge. But it is Ramaphosa who will  be in focus post-May 10. He has yet to explain why he  "requested" not to be in the cabinet as Mandela announces his  men and women in government in Pretoria tomorrow. It is also  widely believed Ramaphosa turned down the offer of Foreign  Minister after he failed to become Deputy President.    Another argument, however, is that although he did a fine  job  as NUM general-secretary there is a view among the ANC youth  leaders that he was not really in "the struggle" because he  negotiated with management in the comfort of boardrooms.  Indeed, as the celebrations end and after Mandela has  reluctantly sipped the ugly-smelling stuff called champagne at  the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Cyril Ramaphosa and Jay Naidoo  will be the men to watch.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / NZ poll called as growth improves THE NEW Zealand Reserve Bank expects 'steady, sustainable non-inflationary growth' of more than 2.5 per cent over the next two years, it said yesterday. Its six-monthly economic forecast was issued shortly before Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, called a general election for November 6. An opinion poll last night showed the National Party government with an eight point lead in popularity over the opposition Labour party. Mr Bolger said the Reserve Bank's report was proof the economy was in good health. In New Zealand, the bank's six monthly statements are considered as important as the budget, given its independence from political interference in setting monetary policy with the goal of low inflation. The statement was welcomed in the financial markets with sharp falls in interest rates and a further rise in the value of the New Zealand dollar. Mr Grant Spencer, the bank's chief economist, said it would remain wary about inflation 'which always has upside potential when an economy is in recovery mode.' Gross domestic product is expected to grow 2.6 per cent in the year to next March, and 3 per cent in the 12 months to March 1995. Underlying inflation is projected to fall from 1.6 per cent in the year to June 1993 to 1.1 per cent in the year to March 1994.</p>

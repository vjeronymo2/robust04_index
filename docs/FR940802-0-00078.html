			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Amendment 9 and the proposed rule were received from three individuals. Two of the commenters objected to Amendment 9 and the proposed rule and the third supported them. Specific comments and responses follow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One person stated that the red snapper endorsement and trip limit provisions and the reef fish permit moratorium are not cost effective and should not be extended. The commenter's objections are based on the contention that a red snapper individual transferable quota (ITQ) system will not be implemented. The commenter also stated that the trip limit provisions and moratorium are based on erroneous and unverifiable data indicating overfishing of red snapper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The reef fish permit moratorium was implemented on May 8, 1992, for three years, to prevent continued speculative entry into the fishery while the Council considers other reef fish effort management alternatives, including an ITQ system. The red snapper endorsement and trip limit provisions, first established by emergency action, were continued through 1994 under Amendment 6 to prevent the occurrence of an extremely short season and a ``derby'' fishery as occurred in 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council has not yet determined if an ITQ system should be implemented. The proposed voluntary landings data collection was suggested by vessel owners, operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit, and historical captains who were interested in learning of their possible preliminary shares for planning purposes. This information will help fishermen determine their most likely level of participation in an ITQ system, if adopted for the fishery. The Council, upon receipt of the data collected and analyzed under Amendment 9 and after receipt of public comments from affected parties, will decide whether to proceed with an ITQ or other effort management system and the current target date for implementation of January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conditions in the fishery that led to implementation of the permit moratorium and the red snapper endorsement system will remain until a more comprehensive program is in place to limit fishing effort in the red snapper fishery. The Council anticipates that the reef fish fishery, particularly for red snapper, would be unnecessarily disrupted if the moratorium and red snapper endorsement provisions expire before implementation of an effort management system. The Council also recognized that such provisions should not be continued indefinitely. Accordingly, the Council determined that the permit moratorium and red snapper endorsement system should be extended through December 31, 1995, or until such an effort management system can be implemented, if before that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning the validity of the scientific data that indicates that red snapper are overfished, all such data undergo extensive scientific review and verification prior to NMFS's assessment of the status of the resource. The best available information continues to indicate that red snapper are overfished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The first commenter also objected to the proposed data collection as duplicative and wasteful. The commenter believes that: (1) NMFS already has obtained landings data as part of the red snapper endorsement process, and (2) the requested submittal would allow fraudulent landings records to be used to increase a person's share if an ITQ system is implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants for a red snapper endorsement on their reef fish vessel permits submitted data only to document the specified landing threshold of 5,000 pounds in any 2 of 3 qualifying years. In contrast, the data collection proposed under Amendment 9 covers all red snapper landings information for the period when data are readily available (1990&hyph;1992). This collection will provide the Council with a complete data base upon which to establish any effort management system; because this collection covers the full three years for which good data exists, it will avoid the need for additional collections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning fraudulent reporting, the data collection provisions are designed to minimize that possibility. Dealer records and trip receipts must definitively show the species known as red snapper and the vessel's name, official number, or other reference that provides a way of clearly identifying the vessel. Dealer records must contain a sworn affidavit by the dealer confirming the accuracy and authenticity of the records, under penalty of law. Accordingly, NMFS disagrees with the comment and supports collection of data under these safeguards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The first commenter also objected to the proposed submittal of data by persons who believe they are historical captains. The commenter characterized those persons as employees who do not share in the losses sustained by the vessel owner and therefore should not be entitled to participate in an ITQ system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After review of testimony and recommendations of the Council's Ad Hoc Allocation Advisory Panel, the Council determined that historical captains should be considered for fishing privileges under a red snapper effort management system, as well as vessel owners and operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit. NMFS believes that collection of these data will provide the Council with the information needed to determine if those persons warrant inclusion in an effort management system as being developed under Amendment 8. However, comments on allocation to historical captains are outside of the scope of Amendment 9 and therefore are not addressed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The second commenter objected to the share agreement time period specified in &sect;641.10(a)(2)(i). That section specifies that a share agreement must have been in effect from at least November 6, 1989, through 1993. The commenter claimed that the Council intended that a historical captain fish solely under a share agreement only through 1992, and that the final rule should be revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> SCHVANEVELDT HAS THE FINAL WORD  </P> <P> Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt triumphantly chewed his gum and displayed rare  emotion Saturday night in the winner's circle at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> The usually stoic conditioner had won the Champion of Champions quarter horse  race with Dash For Speed for an unprecedented fifth time but this one was  special.  </P> <P> Schvaneveldt, a 56-year-old Idaho native, did not become the all-time leader at  Los Alamitos by second-guessing his program. Despite two disappointing efforts  by Dash For Speed before the $250,000 race, Schvaneveldt calmly maintained that  nothing was wrong and his confidence never wavered.  </P> <P> "It's a great feeling," said an animated Schvaneveldt. "This one is greater  because this mare was beaten twice, and everybody said she was done and we  shouldn't have brought her back.  </P> <P> "She's been training good all the time but didn't get away in her last two.  Nothing was wrong with her but it was hard to convince her owners she was just  losing her back end.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of pressure but pressure doesn't bother me. I like pressure.  </P> <P> "I never changed one earthly thing since I got her this summer. When you go to  changing, you get beat!  </P> <P> "I think this is the toughest field they've assembled but when she breaks in  front, it takes a good horse to beat her."  </P> <P> Said co-owner Bobby Blakeman, "Blane's got to be the king. He can get a horse  ready for a race like this better than anybody."  </P> <P> Added jockey Kip Didericksen, "I told the pony boy going to the gate that I was  the winner. I loped her one lap around a week ago Friday, and it was the best  she ever tracked. She's just been going good, and I liked the hole she drew  (No. 7) and the way the race set up."  </P> <P> Although she was the top money-winner in the lineup and was being trained and  ridden by meet leaders, Dash For Speed was dismissed at 8-1, the  seventh-longest price in the extremely competitive 10-horse field.  </P> <P> Texan Blakeman, who owns the mare in partnership with Colorado cattleman Tom  Bradbury, said Dash For Speed has been retired and will be vanned to his  253-acre mare care center 40 miles from Ft. Worth this week.  </P> <P> "We're going to let her be a mommy," said Blakeman, who hopes to select a daddy  this month.  </P> <P> The owners enjoyed the best of both worlds with her this year, racing her in a  bid for world champion honors while a recipient mare carried her first foal  after an embryo transplant in April.  </P> <P> The practice is illegal in thoroughbred or standardbred racing but common in  the quarter horse industry. The foal, by Streakin Six, is due in March but Dash  For Speed will carry her own future foals.  </P> <P> Blakeman credited a medicine to correct a thyroid deficiency in helping her as  both a racehorse and mother.  </P> <P> "She had no energy and her metabolism was down so we gave her the powder the  last two weeks to get her count back up," Blakeman said. "We had a hard time  getting her in foal at the beginning of the year too. We gave her the powder  and right away got an egg."  </P> <P> The American Quarter Horse Assn. will send out ballots to its 63-member racing  committee in early January to determine the world champion.  </P> <P> "I hope we have the good fortune of being chosen," Blakeman said after the  mare's 22nd victory in 30 starts.  </P> <P> "I like that she's won 10 Grade I stakes, three more than anybody else. She has  won three Grade I races this year, and has career earnings of $1.2 million  without ever winning the All-American Futurity. She set a track record winning  the Anne Burnett and a stakes record winning the Los Alamitos Championship this  summer. And she got rid of the myth that she could only win in New Mexico and  couldn't run at night."  </P> <P> History leans in Blakeman's favor. Eleven of 18 winners of the Champion of  Champions have gone on to be named world champion, including five of the last  six.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos' off-track business continues to grow. Canterbury Downs in  Minnesota and Les Bois Park in Idaho joined the network last month.  </P> <P> "The Capital District of New York, with 53 locations, should be next," James  Smith, executive vice president of the track, said.  </P> <P> "After that, we'll look to Montana and Mexico. When we hit $710,000 off-track  on Breeders Classic night (Nov. 17), I thought that would be high for the meet.  But we've gone over $750,000 since, and it looks like we'll hit $800,000 soon.  </P> <P> "We have 50 satellites now and will have 100 within two years," Smith said.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Notes  </P> <P> Los Alamitos officials are trying to stage a $100,000 winner-take-all match  race between quarter horse Griswold and thoroughbred Valiant Pete on Jan. 11 or  12. Griswold set a world record of :44.07 for 870 yards this month. Valiant  Pete set a world mark of :49 1/5 for 4 1/2 furlongs (990 yards) this year.  Griswold, Gold Rush Derby winner Genuine Article and Breeders Marathon Classic  winner Six Figures are expected to head the lineup Friday in the $25,000  Katella Handicap at 870 yards.  </P> <P> Russell Harris, tied for sixth in the trainer standings with 13 victories, may  be in limbo for several weeks, since stewards barred him from entering horses  last week. A urine sample on Mighty Dasher, which finished fifth in the 10th  race Nov. 8 when Harris trained him, tested positive for cocaine. Harris  requested that the second part of the split sample be sent to another lab, in  this case Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Stewards said they will schedule a  hearing when they obtain the result. Harris' previous record is clean.  </P> <P> Harness driver Billy Myer, who died in Delaware last week at 74, won the  American Trotting Classic at Hollywood Park in 1970 and '72 with Dayan. He also  won several major stakes in the 1960s with star pacer Romeo Hanover. . . . Dare  You To, runner-up in the American Pacing Classic at Los Alamitos and  fourth-place finisher in the Breeders Crown Aged Horse Pace, will become the  first North American horse to compete in New Zealand's grueling Inter-Dominion  Championship in March.  </P> <P> Trainer Lee Roy Heidelberg, who saddled runner-up Tee Roy Reb in the Champion  of Champions, managed a farm for actor Robert Mitchum in Atascadero from  1972-79. . . . Trainer H.L. Hooper, whose favored Heisajoy was bothered by  chain-reaction interference and finished sixth (placed fifth), refused to make  excuses after the Champion of Champions. "The mare was the better horse  tonight," said Hooper.  </P> <P> Trials are scheduled tonight for the $500,000 Golden State Futurity, the  richest race of the meet, Dec. 29.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS LEADERS  </P> <P> Through Dec. 15  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.78IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C"

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 10 (BTA) -- The main parliamentary  forces today met to decide their positions on the planned  cabinet changes. Government spokesman Raycho Raykov does not  believe that the changes will be discussed this week. The prime  minister has yet to confer with the main parliamentary forces  supporting his government. There will be no drastic changes in  the cabinet's policy, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of  Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev, speaking at a  working lunch today with the ambassadors of the 12 European  Union [EU] member countries and the three applicants for EU  membership: Austria, Finland and Sweden.    The ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) reiterated  the stance on the government it took in early April. "The BSP  wants, as much as possible, to see the creation of conditions  for the country's stabilization, for overcoming the unfavourable  tendencies in the economy, the social sphere and international  monetary and financial relations," BSP deputy floor leader  Krasimir Premyanov told a news conference. "There are still no  reasons to revise our policy line," said Vladimir Topencharov,  member of the party leadership.    According to Mr. Premyanov, the BSP has not yet received  adequate guarantees that keeping Valentin Aleksandrov as  minister of defence in the cabinet would ease tensions in the  Bulgarian Army. Speaking to reporters today, Mr. Osman Oktay MP  of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS)  described as a "satisfactory option" the prime minister's  supervisory function with respect to the "power" ministries. In  a telephone interview on Bulgarian national radio on Sunday [8  May], Prime Minister Berov indicated that there will be no  changes in the Ministry of Defence.    According to officially unconfirmed reports, incumbent  Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov may be nominated for a  deputy prime ministership. There are plans for three deputy  prime ministers. One will be in charge of the financial and  economic team of the government and of foreign debt matters,  another deputy prime minister without portfolio will oversee the  reform processes and especially the progress of land reform  (Prime Minister Berov already nominated Associated Professor  Rumen Gechev for this job), and a third one will deal with the  social sector and no changes are expected on this count,  government spokesman Raycho Raykov told reporters today,  obviously referring to incumbent Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev.    The government may well resign en bloc if parliament does  not  pass the moved amendments to the Privatization Act and a  Bankruptcy Act, Mr. Matinchev told foreign diplomats today,  according to the government spokesman. This is not a  government's whim or wish to dictate terms but conditions set by  the international financial institutions, Mr. Raykov emphasized.    Approval of the cabinet changes will require an affirmative  vote of more than half of the MP's present and voting.  Interviewed on national radio this morning, the leader of the  Alternative Social Liberal Party (affiliated to the New Union  for Democracy, a parliamentary faction formed by expellees and  defectors of the Union of Democratic Forces -- SDS) Nikolay  Vasilev said that the union will not take part in the vote on  the cabinet changes. The Rally for Democracy (another faction  of SDS expellees and defectors) will most probably refuse to  support the structural and personnel cabinet changes proposed by  Prof. Berov, according to Rally deputy leader Ruslan Semerdzhiev.    DPS spokesman Yunal Lyutfi said yesterday and today that  when  the changes are put to the vote, the government will get less  support than in previous such votes. Personally, he believes  that the government deserves one more chance. The DPS top  leadership held a meeting today. Mr. Oktay told reporters that  according to information which the movement has, the Chairman of  the Committee of Tourism Prof. Emil Lozanov already has  resigned. He also said that according to the DPS there are  unclear questions concerning the future structure of the  Committees of Tourism and Forestry. The government spokesman  said that the stand on the Tourism and Forestry Committees has  yet to be finalized. The structural changes matter more than  the personnel ones, as far as the DPS is concerned, Mr. Oktay  emphasized.    "The situation surrounding the government is getting more  disturbing by the day," said SDS leader Filip Dimitrov after a  meeting of the Union's top leadership. In his words, there is  already public awareness that the government is unfit to perform  its functions and bear responsibility. "The obvious  impossibility to achieve understanding on the cabinet changes,  which delays their introduction before parliament, makes the  picture in the country only gloomier," Mr. Dimitrov went on to  say. He did not specify the actions which the Union is planning  to take in the coming days when Prime Minister Berov is expected  to table the cabinet changes. According to Mr. Dimitrov, on  Wednesday [11 May] the majority will be forced to have a say on  the union's draft resolution to censure the Government's  economic and financial policy. The SDS will hold a national  conference on Saturday and Sunday [14-15 May]. At it, the union  may decide to boycott parliament.</p>

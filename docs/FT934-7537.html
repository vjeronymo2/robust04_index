			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Number of strikes falls to record low THE POOR international image of Britain as a strike-prone country is waning. The latest labour dispute figures of the Department of Employment suggest that Britain has nearly attained the low levels of industrial conflict enjoyed by Switzerland and Sweden. The latest provisional total of strikes released yesterday by the government reveal that only 16 strikes took place in September, the lowest number since such statistics began a century ago. In the 12 months to this September, 188 disputes took place. Only 8,000 working days were lost in September as a result of strikes, the smallest total recorded in official statistics since December 1937. As many as 622,000 working days were lost due to strikes up to last September. That is more than the 526,000 lost working days recorded for the same period to September last year, but it represents the second smallest figure since official figures began in 1893. The cumulative total of workers involved in disputes which began during the 12 months to this September was 241,000, with only 3,000 in September alone. The 12-month figure is higher than the 154,000 recorded for the previous period to September 1992 but still represents the second lowest figure since 1934. The latest comparative strike statistics for last year, published by the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation, suggest that Britain lost far fewer working days from strikes in 1992 than Germany, France and Italy, its main European competitors. Only paradigms of industrial harmony such as Sweden and Switzerland recorded much lower figures for lost working days.</p>

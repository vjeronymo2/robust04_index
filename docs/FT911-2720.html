			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Rolls-Royce and BMW venture to develop aero engines BMW Rolls-Royce, the recently founded joint venture, plans to spend DM1bn (Pounds 338m) by 1996 developing a family of aircraft engines aimed at the regional airliner market, and may build a factory in eastern Germany. Mr Albert Schneider, chairman of BMWRR, said yesterday a new plant - accounting for part of the DM1bn investment - would be built to manufacture the engines, whose core prototype, the BR700, is due to be developed by 1993. A decision on the site would be taken by the middle of this year, and BMWRR was likely to choose eastern Germany. Rolls-Royce is thought initially to have favoured a British site. BMWRR has been negotiating with Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, to build an aerospace factory in the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds the city of Berlin. Mr Schneider said: 'The launch of the BR700 core is a major step for the new joint venture company and will help strengthen the European aero-engine industry.' The new factory will provide about 1,000 jobs. BMWRR, founded as an autonomous joint venture last July, has one factory at Oberursel, near Frankfurt, producing small aircraft engines. This will be expanded and also produce parts for the new engines. Mr Schneider said the company aims for annual sales of DM1bn by the year 2000, with the new engines accounting for about 60 per cent of sales. It faces stiff competition in the emerging regional airline market - estimated to be worth about Dollars 50bn (Pounds 29bn) in the next 20 years  -from Daimler Benz, which has linked its jet engine subsidiary Motoren-und-Turbinen Union with Pratt and Whitney, the jet engine unit of United Technologies Corporation, the US high technology company.</p>

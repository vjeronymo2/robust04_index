			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Nutritionists offer a la carte menu: How the recommendations clashed with the industry's taste / Salt consumption 'should be reduced by third' Trying to help the public to choose foods for a healthier diet seemed to the doctors and nutritionists who wrote yesterday's report on prevention of heart disease to be simply a practical extension of years of work. Little new science is revealed in the report by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (Coma). The once-a-decade review of cardiovascular disease and ways to prevent it largely reiterated previous findings. The new step, though, is to identify the sort of trade-offs the public could make to achieve widely agreed targets on consumption of fat and other food types. A portion of steamed white fish, for example, would save 33g over a portion of deep-fried fish. But when news of the committee's initiative leaked this summer, large sectors of the food industry mounted a heavy lobbying campaign against it. To many manufacturers it seemed like an attempt to dictate the nation's diet. Worse, it seemed like an attempt to single out products unfairly. Why cut biscuits, for example, when you could achieve the same reduction in fat consumption by eating less cheese? It also seemed to steer consumers away from highly processed foods towards fruit, vegetables and other products closer to the farm gate. United Biscuits, Cadbury Schweppes and Tate &amp; Lyle were but three companies who with their trade body,the Food and Drink Federation, vigorously protested to the government. 'I was completely taken by surprise,' said Professor Michael Marmot, Coma chairman and head of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London's medical school. 'We agree with previous committees on what constitutes healthy eating,' he added yesterday. 'We are very careful not to say which were 'killer' foods. But we are offering people a choice. If you eat a dozen biscuits a day you have to trade off by reducing something else.' He hopes the Department of Health, through its Nutrition Task Force and other bodies, will disseminate the report's recommendations to the public. Through such education he hopes consumers will modify their eating habits. The department tried to defuse the row yesterday. Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, said the government's policy remained the food consumption targets identified in 'The Health of the Nation,' the health strategy laid out in a 1992 white paper. Moreover, the food guidelines issued yesterday were only an attempt to express the overall change needed in the nation's diet to meet those targets; and people were free to pick and chose from the list to meet the consumption targets. Food manufacturers seemed broadly to accept the approach except the salt makers. Mr Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the Food and Drink Federation, said that as consumers' awareness and tastes change, companies were likely to adapt their products, Already some 70 per cent of Wrigley's chewing gum and 40 per cent of Coca Cola's drinks are sugar-free. City analysts suggested that given the sort of trade-offs people could make within the committee's guidelines, it would be hard to assess how consumption patterns would change. Tate &amp; Lyle, for example, might lose on sugars but gain on other sweetners while Associated British Foods could lose on cakes but gain on breads. However, change is slower in the UK than in some other markets. For example, Cadbury Schweppes makes a sugar-free, own-label chocolate for J. Sainsbury, the largest UK supermarket chain. But it offered it only because the retailer wanted it. United Biscuits has already responded to US consumers. More than 20 per cent of its output in the US consists of fat-reduced and fat-free biscuits as against 5 per cent in the UK. Nutritionists point out, however, that there is a crucial difference between companies creating new, premium-priced niche products such as reduced-fat biscuits, and reducing fat, sugar and salt in their main products. The latter approach is a more direct attempt to affect what people eat and nutritionists are planning to keep up the pressure on companies to adopt it. Heinz is one of the few companies to make reductions across a range of main products. Over the past eight years it has reduced the sugar content of its baked beans by 22 per cent and has cut salt.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CUTTING DOWN: WEEKLY FOOD CONSUMPTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average household comsumption National Food Survey in 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Grams/                            person/week  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dairy              Milk               1960ml    11 pints (50% semi-skimmed)              Cream               260ml    7 tablespoons              Cheese                115    2-3 sandwiches              Eggs                   60    1 egg Meat &amp; fish              Beef &amp; lamb           210    2 portions              Pork &amp; poultry        300    3 portions              Other meats           440    7 portions              Fish                  140    1/2 portion oily fish Fats              Butter                 40 &gt;  Spread for 21 slices              Margarine              80 &gt;              Low-fat spreads        50    Spread for 7 slices              Vegetable oils         50    4 1/2 tablespoons              Other fats             25    1 1/2 tablespoons Fruit &amp; Vegetable              Fruit                 930    10 1/2 pieces              Potatoes              900    14 egg-sized potatoes              Potato products       170    1 medium portion chips              Vegetables           1130    14-21 portions Bread              Bread                 750    21 slices (50% wholemeal)              Cakes &amp; biscuits      290    21-28 biscuits Cereal              Breakfast cereal      130    7 bowls              Other                 285    7 pasta/rice servings Sugars              Sugar &amp; preserves     200    42 teaspoons              Sugared soft drinks 720ml    2 cans              Chocolate Sweets       35    1 small bar                                     15    3 boiled sweets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average household comsumption Coma recommendations  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Grams/                            person/week  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dairy              Milk               2140ml    75% semi-skimmed              Cream               130ml    50% reduction              Cheese                 60    1-2 sandwiches              Eggs                   60    1 egg Meat &amp; fish              Beef &amp; lamb           210    Leaner meat              Pork &amp; poultry        300    3 portions              Other meats           220    50% reduction (30% less                                           sodium)              Fish                  190    1 portion oily fish Fats              Butter                 20 &gt;  Spread for 10 1/2 slices              Margarine              40 &gt;              Low-fat spreads       120    Spread for 17 1/2 slices              Vegetable oils        100    100% increase              Other fats             10    50% reduction Fruit &amp; Vegetable              Fruit                1290    14 pieces              Potatoes             1260    21 egg-sized potatoes              Potato products        80    1 small portion chips              Vegetables           1690    28 portions (30% less soduim) Bread              Bread                1130    31 1/2 slices (7 slices                                           wholemeal)              Cakes &amp; biscuits      145    7-14 biscuits Cereal              Breakfast cereal      130    7 bowls              Other                 285    7 pasta/rice servings Sugars              Sugar &amp; preserves     190    35 teaspoons              Sugared soft drinks 360ml    50% reduction              Chocolate Sweets       30    3/4 small bar                                     15    3 boiled sweets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Coma  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

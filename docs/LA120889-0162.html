			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHE FINDS SWEET SUCCESS WITH CHOCOLATES  </P> <P> Six years ago, Leigh Saucer, owner of Azhmere Chocolatiere in Dana Point, knew  very little about making chocolate and even less about running her own  business. But Saucer has since gained a reputation for her ability to depict  almost anything in chocolate -- a talent she says comes from being entirely  self-taught.  </P> <P> "No one ever told me what I couldn't make out of chocolate," she said. "Since  it was all new to me, I wasn't afraid to try something different."  </P> <P> To celebrate the incorporation of Dana Point last year, Saucer designed molds  to depict the entire city in chocolate -- resulting in a miniature replica,  three feet by three feet, that included a chocolate harbor with the landmark  tall ship Pilgrim cast in chocolate too. The scene included chocolate  hillsides, streets, houses with miniature electric lights and a chocolate  "Welcome to Dana Point" sign.  </P> <P> For the holiday season, Saucer is making hollow chocolate houses with white  chocolate snow on top. The recipient's name and address can be stenciled on the  house to give the gift a personal touch. She also makes a chocolate Christmas  card with the sender's greeting engraved or stenciled in white or dark  chocolate and a solid chocolate Christmas tree surrounded by presents and a  solid chocolate toy train. Prices for specialty items range from $30 for the  chocolate houses to $125 for the Christmas trees.  </P> <P> Saucer, who lives in Laguna Beach, said she entered the chocolate business "by  way of mistakes, messes and miracles."  </P> <P> In 1978, Saucer left her position as director of instructional TV at KOCE-TV in  Huntington Beach to become national director of children's TV and educational  services for the Public Broadcasting Service in Washington. There she became  disenchanted with children's programming and eventually decided to leave the  field -- "but I had no idea where to go or what to do."  </P> <P> Saucer decided to return to the home she still owned in Laguna Beach and tried  to transform it into a European-style bed-and-breakfast inn. But the endeavor  was unsuccessful, and one day she phoned a friend for consolation and wound up  being invited over to make chocolates.  </P> <P> "She thought it would cheer me up," she said. "I didn't want to go. I hated the  idea. But I went anyway."  </P> <P> Saucer presented the results of her afternoon's activities to a friend later  that evening when they got together at a local restaurant to celebrate his  birthday.  </P> <P> "That was the only gift I could afford to give him," she said. "But he was an  entrepreneur type. Everything he touched turned to gold. He loved the  chocolates and told me that I should start my own business. I didn't have a  better plan, so I decided to give it a try."  </P> <P> Saucer set out to perfect her recipe and struggled for hours in her kitchen,  melting chocolate over bowls of hot water in the sink.  </P> <P> "I needed to learn how to form and temper chocolate. I wanted the candies to  have a distinctive shape. I worked and worked and couldn't get it right.  </P> <P> "One day I just threw the spoon down in disgust and walked off. When I came  back later and picked up the spoon again, I realized that I had inadvertently  discovered the proper wrist action needed to shape the chocolates. But then I  had to figure out how to do it again."  </P> <P> Through continued trial and error, Saucer developed a product line and set out  to persuade local specialty shops to sell her candies.  </P> <P> "The only sales experience I had was selling vegetables at a produce stand when  I was a kid growing up in Nebraska," said Saucer, who is 46. "But Linda Brown  at St. Ives in South Coast Village offered me some pointers on packaging and  became my first distributor."  </P> <P> The present site of Saucer's candy kitchen is what used to be the office  portion of a former Weyerhaeuser Co. greenhouse complex overlooking Dana Point  Harbor. The surrounding greenhouses are still leased to nursery owners, and  Saucer's operation seems a strange juxtaposition among the large white  structures coddling exotic orchids and palm trees.  </P> <P> But true chocolate lovers know that 18th-Century botanist Linnaeus was inspired  to name the cacao plant Theobroma, which means "food of the gods," Saucer  noted.  </P> <P> And it is a heavenly aroma that wafts from Saucer's kitchen when production is  in full swing. Her mass-produced line of chocolate candies and novelty items is  also made here and distributed under the name Beach Cities Chocolates to  specialty stores throughout Southern California. (Her handmade chocolates are  sold mostly by telephone or mail order.)  </P> <P> But Saucer retained the handmade Azhmere line to preserve what her favorite  author, Willa Cather, referred to as "that intimate quality of things made  entirely by the human hand."  </P> <P> She came up with the name Azhmere after having a dream in which she found  herself back on a TV sound stage being asked to think of a word that meant  quality and luxury. In the dream, Saucer replied "cashmere," and a voice told  her to "drop the C."  </P> <P> This month, Saucer and her staff are prepared to work almost round the clock  during the Christmas rush to transform 11,922 pounds of chocolate into  truffles, turtles, liquor balls, chocolate Christmas cards and personalized  figurines.  </P> <P> Then Saucer plans to take a week off after Christmas to rest and prepare for  her next project: making 2,000 miniature chocolate replicas of the new San  Diego Convention Center for its grand opening dinner in January.  </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television The chaps in ITV who succumbed to the feminist demagogues in the 80s and took Benny Hill off the air because he was 'sexist' must have felt a little silly come the 90s and Hill's growing international esteem. He is now seen in the US and much of Europe as one of the world's great clowns, so ITV is quietly slipping him back on the air. The Benny Hill Show (8.30) is the first in a new series of 'compilations from past shows' . . . well, yes, repeats, but it is one step towards sanity, and no doubt the ratings will be enormous. C4's arts magazine, Without Walls (9.00), offers a promising two-part programme. Michael Dibdin goes for Agatha Christie in the 'J'accuse' slot, claiming that she perverted the form of the British crime novel, and in 'Reel Secrets' the qualities of horror movies are discussed by Robert McKee. Last week the BAFTA award for best arts programme went to this series for McKee's excellent piece on 'Citizen Kane'. BBC1 starts a new drama series called Resnick: Lonely Hearts (10.00) which, we are promised, is all about police detectives. Where do the broadcasters get these astoundingly fresh ideas?</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH;  </P> <P> DANA POINT;  </P> <P> WATER CONSERVATION SESSION PLANNED  </P> <P> Dana Point, which was mildly hit by a South Orange County water shortage last  summer, will be co-host of a session Wednesday to help educate the public on  how to conserve water through wise landscaping.  </P> <P> The Xeriscape Conference will start at 7 p.m. at the Dana Hills Tennis Center,  24911 Calle de Tennis. The conference, also hosted by the Capistrano Bay Parks  and Recreation Department, is free and open to the public. Free brochures will  be distributed.  </P> <P> Among the speakers will be Cal Poly Pomona professor Robert Perry, a landscape  specialist in the university's architecture department.  </P> <P> "Water in South Orange County is a precious resource," said City Councilwoman  Ingrid McGuire. "In Dana Point, all of our water is imported. This conference  will pull together all the thoughts and ideas on using less water in gardens or  parks or landscapes. It's certainly the way more water can be saved because in  most households, more than 50% of the water that is used is water outside of  the house, for such things as gardens and washing the car and hosing down the  driveway."  </P> <P> Dana Point felt a water shortage that hit Tri-Cities Municipal Water District  in July and August. The district provides water to all of San Clemente and to  the Capistrano Beach area of Dana Point.  </P> <P> San Clemente imposed voluntary water cutbacks during the water shortage, but  Dana Point did not have to restrict water usage.  </P></p>

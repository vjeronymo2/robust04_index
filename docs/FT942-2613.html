			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / ITV quits race to televise lottery ITV yesterday withdrew from the contest to televise the National Lottery - blaming the Independent Television Commission's interpretation of the rules. The withdrawal may have involved an element of face-saving; Camelot, the consortium which won the right to operate the National Lottery, had made clear it would probably prefer to work with the BBC. It is holding detailed talks with the corporation and an agreement is expected by the end of this month. ITV put together a comprehensive package to try to win the high-profile broadcast. It included the promise of promotion for the lottery throughout the ITV system, making top ITV stars and shows available for the draw, a two-year contract, a payment of more than Pounds 2m and the promise to share exclusivity with independent local radio or even BBC radio. However, ITV could not meet one of Camelot's specifications. In addition to the main multi-million pound lottery draw on Saturday evenings, Camelot wants a mid-week show with winners of scratch-card prizes taking part in a quiz show with big winnings. The commission ruled that ITV must retain editorial control - meaning that it must be able to choose the contestants. Mr Andrew Quinn, ITV Network Centre chief executive, said yesterday: 'ITV made a very attractive offer to Camelot, and we are naturally very disappointed that ITC regulations prevented us from proceeding further.' The timing of the ITV announcement, before an agreement with the BBC has been signed, could affect the terms of the deal. ITV is still expected to cover the results of the lottery - which is due to be launched in November. As soon as the winning numbers are chosen they could be broadcast along the bottom of any ITV programme on at the time.</p>

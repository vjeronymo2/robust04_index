			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Proposals issued for venture trusts Investors in the venture capital trusts, announced in the November Budget, will be allowed tax relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, under proposals in a government consultative document published yesterday. The document suggests the trusts should be taxed and structured in a broadly similar way to investment trusts. It proposes that 80 per cent of trust assets should be in unlisted trading companies. Not more than 15 per cent of the assets should be in any one company or group of companies.</p>

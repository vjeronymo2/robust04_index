			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Regional divide marks Malawi poll: Lack of policy differences has changed the contest Nearly half Malawi's children are stunted by malnutrition, according to the government's own figures. Seven out of ten women cannot read. Nearly half a million families live on farms of less than an acre (less than 0.5ha) and earn less than Dollars 50 a year in cash and kind. This is the grim reality of the 'least developed' tag conferred by the UN on a country that ranks among the 15 poorest in the world. It is a reality that has received little attention on the hustings during Malawi's first multi-party election campaign, because the contenders barely differ on what to do about it. Yesterday Malawi's parliament approved an interim constitution on the eve of today's parliamentary and presidential elections that many analysts believe will bring an end to 30 years of domination by the ailing President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, believed to be in his mid-90s, and his Malawi Congress party (MCP). The interim constitution curtails the sweeping and absolute powers enjoyed by President Banda and was worked out by an all-party panel earlier this year after opposition parties, banned since 1966 in a crackdown on dissent, were legalised. President Banda's grip on power was evident when the MCP chose him as its presidential candidate, despite his infirmity. But public impatience with his dictatorial ways have showed up in the final days of the campaign, when his rallies have drawn smaller numbers of supporters than those of the opposition. A small, land-locked country with negligible industry and an overwhelmingly rural population, Malawi has relied since independence in 1964 on rain-fed subsistence agriculture and cash-crops: tobacco, tea and sugar. This will not change in the short term, although diversification into low-volume, high-value crops is being encouraged. In 1990, Mr Banda's government adopted a 'growth through poverty reduction' strategy of allowing smallholders a share in the lucrative, export market for Burley tobacco, previously dominated by large estates. Gradually the economy has been liberalised through the reduction of import barriers, divestment and privatisation of para-statals and the lifting of foreign exchange controls. All of this, the government believes, will enhance efficiency, boost exports and attract foreign capital. The opposition agrees. Two years ago, when trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, leader of the opposition Alliance for Democracy (Aford), was imprisoned for his advocacy of political pluralism and donors imposed an aid embargo to press for 'good governance', political change seemed inevitable and Mr Chihana the likeliest man to take the helm. Now President Banda's MCP has accepted change, albeit grudgingly, and is struggling to graft a new, democratic identity on to its 'Four Cornerstones' of Unity, Obedience, Discipline and Loyalty. One consequence is that Mr Chihana has lost the political initiative and probably, with it, his chances of the presidency. For lack of policy differences has, for many voters, turned the election into a contest between the regions. Aford is associated with the north, the MCP with the centre, and Mr Bakili Muluzi's United Democratic Front with the south. If people vote along regional lines, Mr Muluzi will win, because the south is the most populous. Ethnically complex regional distinctions were embedded in the early colonial period when British missionaries developed the best schooling in the north, and consolidated the south's commercial orientation, which itself stemmed from early Arab influence. Censuses in the Banda era did not acknowledge tribal differences, merely dividing the population into Africans, Asians and a diminishing number of Europeans. Yet the north-south divide has remained marked with persistent jockeying for regional advantage. When President Banda was invited back to Malawi in 1958 to lead the independence movement, after many years in the US, Britain, and Ghana, he, as a native of the centre, was the compromise candidate between better-known contenders from north and south. Since then he has favoured and developed the centre, building a new capital city there and making its language, Chichewa, an official, national language alongside English. Mr Chihana could probably have transcended the regional divide by endorsing the wage demands of striking private and public sector workers who brought the country to a standstill last September. But his 'trade unionist' label is deceptive. If he was ever drawn to 'African socialism', Mr Chihana is no longer. He not only embraces the market but is committed to an austerity period to check the inflationary pressures of devaluation, Aford's political secretary and chief ideologue, Mr Mapopa Chipeta, identifies the future goal as 'developing a dynamic, indigenous, capitalist class'. Such talk echoes the first days of African independence, reflecting the extent to which economic power in Malawi has remained in the hands of President Banda and the family of his consort, 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira, through their ownership of the enormous Press Group of companies, long managed by British and South African expatriates. That capitalism needs popularising and Africanising is also exactly what Mr Muluzi and other UDF leaders believe. Moreover, several of them, as medium-scale entrepreneurs frustrated by Mr Banda's grip on the economy, can convincingly claim to be prototypes of the new capitalist class. It is this class which will most clearly benefit from economic liberalisation in Malawi. Mr Muluzi, as representative of it and of the south, seems most likely to take the presidency, particularly if memories of repression obliterate the MCP vote in the centre, and despite his own long association with the MCP in the past. But any new government will face two big problems. With regional divisions exposed by the campaign after a long period when unity was enforced through repression, it will not be easy to maintain national cohesion. Nor will it be easy to explain to impoverished Malawians that democracy alone is no guarantor of prosperity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Malawi: thirty years of Banda  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Infant mortality (per '000 live births)                        143.0 Access to safe water (per cent of population)                   55.0 Child malnutrition (per cent of children under 5)               60.0 Illiteracy (per cent of population age 15+)                     58.8 Secondary enrollment (per cent of school age population)         4.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Malawi Election: Key Facts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eligible voters - 3.7m of population of 9.7m Polling on Tuesday for election of president and for expanded 177-seat parliament  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main parties:  -Malawi Congress Party (MCP) led by President Hastings Banda  -United Democratic Front (UDF) led by businessman Bakili Muluzi  -Alliance For Democracy (AFORD) led by trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana  -Malawi Democratic Party (MDP) led by political scientist Kamlepo Kalua  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The leaders of the four main parties are standing in the presidential poll Results expected on Thursday New head of state and government to be sworn in on May 27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

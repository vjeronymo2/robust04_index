			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic ahead of forecast with Pounds 1.57m Quadramatic, the specialist engineering group which came to the market in July, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.57m in the six months to September 30, slightly above the flotation forecast of Pounds 1.46m. The shares, floated at 123p, yesterday closed 2p higher at 161p. Mr Tony Gartland, chairman, is a deal maker who in the eighties expanded FKI, the electrical engineering group, along with Mr Jeff Whalley. Mr Gartland said the order book was 12 per cent higher than last year's levels, and prospects remained favourable. Turnover was Pounds 13.2m to September 30, which will become the recently formed group's year-end. Earnings per share were 5.1p and the final dividend is 1p. Quadramatic comprised a coin-handling and optical business when it came to the market, but last month placed more shares in order to pay Pounds 11.3m for two high-technology instruments businesses. Mr Gartland, who has promised to expand the group by acquisition, said he now had the three core areas on which he could build - coin-handling, optical and industrial instruments. His immediate priorities were acquisitions to fill excess factory capacity at the group's Oldham base, which makes coin-handling equipment, and to expand the optical and instruments businesses. Coin Controls International accounted for 78 per cent of group sales in the six-month period and made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.2m). In the last year, Coin's sales improved by 26 per cent as it strengthened its position in UK leisure machines and US pinball machines. Combined Optical Industries, which moulds plastic optical products, accounted for 22 per cent of group sales and made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 160,000). Mr Gartland said: 'The group will continue to seek appropriate strategic acquisitions which will be earnings-enhancing and we have identified a number of promising opportunities, which will support the group's growth plans.' The chairman said the recently acquired instruments businesses had considerable potential for further growth. Datapaq supplies thermal monitoring systems, while Automatic System Laboratories makes calibrating equipment for laboratories.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Congressman Reinaldo Cervini has pointed out that  the VAT is a regressive and unconstitutional measure that must  be reformed.    [Begin Cervini recording] Measures, such as price controls,  just seek to please the people for the time being. If there was  really a serious interest in controlling prices, the correct  thing to do would have been to regulate bank interests as well  as the costs of electricity, telephones, and transportation. In  addition, measures should have been taken to control the prices  businessmen pay for Central Bank bonds, and this would then lead  to a just control of prices.    What is being done now will bring negative consequences for  the national producers. The measure is strictly to please the  people, but it is not being handled properly. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri said in a press conference here today that the  dispute between Iran and the UAE should be resolved mutually and  others have no right to interfere in the matter. The speaker  was referring to a recent remark by the Saudi king who sided  with the UAE in its dispute with Iran over the island.  Nateq-Nuri said Iran was committed to the accord signed in 1971  between Iran and the emir of Sharjah [Al-Shariqah] on Abu Musa  Island.    He said Iran had only heightened security at the island  after  arresting a spy around the island and that this had made the UAE  officials unhappy. He said bilateral talks should continue to  resolve the minor disputes between the two countries, in order  not to provide the "aliens to engage in mischief." The  negotiations on the matter had been halted by the United Arab  Emirates, he said.    About Iran's relations with Egypt and foreign minister's  imminent visit to Cairo, he said Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati will visit Cairo to attend the upcoming meeting of the  Non-aligned Movement (NAM). On possible talks between  Iran-Egyptian foreign ministers on the sideline of the NAM  meeting, he said there were no restrictions on holding talks  between the foreign minister and his counterparts from Egypt or  other countries. On the obstacles in the way of improving  Tehran-Cairo relations, Nateq-Nuri said the main stumbling block  was the spread of the spirit of Islamism in Egypt that the  Egyptian officials wrongly attribute to the Islamic Republic of  Iran.    On Iran's foreign debts, the speaker said the amount of the  debts was no problem to Iran in light of its huge natural  resources. He said that most of the countries of the world are  debtors, but, the big powers magnified Iran's debts due to their  hostile attitude towards Iran.    On the Middle East peace process and the probability of  resolving tension between Syria and Israel, he said Iran's  relations with Syria were too solid to easily worsen. In the  meantime, he said, "we recommend the Syrian officials not to  damage their political prestige because Syria will get nothing  from the Zionist regime".    About import of the U.S. goods and if they would leave any  cultural impact, he said there was no room for concern regarding  the arrival of certain American products such as Coca Cola.  Because, he said, "our Islamic and national culture is too  strong to be affected negatively by such minor issues."    On the Iran-Iraq relations, he said numerous issues still  remained to be solved including the UN Security Council  Resolution 598 and the issue of Iranian prisoners of war (pow)  as well as the issue of pilgrimage to the holy places in Iraq.  The officials of the two countries intend to meet and settle  the issue, he said.    On the priorities to be given to the second five-year  development plan by the Majlis, he said the Majlis places  emphasis on social justice, restructuring the adminstrative  system, reducing reliance on oil revenues and reviving the  pricing mechanism.    On the Saudi ban on holding the special ceremony of  "antipathy towards atheists," he said despite the harassment  done by the Saudis, the incident was unlikely to result in break  off of diplomatic relations due to the two countries being  neighbours and because of the interests of the world of Islam.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: London International Mr Nick Hodges of London International is almost certainly right to claim that the group had to dispose of its photo-processing business if it was not to end up disposing of itself. But the restructuring announced yesterday is not necessarily the end of the story. Even after the rights issue, gearing will be nearly 80 per cent and LIG has little chance of trading its way out of debt. It will have to sell some more peripheral businesses, but to avoid earnings dilution it will have to find buyers willing to pay reasonably full prices. LIG's other task is to raise the return on its condom business which had a disappointing year thanks to a catalogue of difficulties such as destocking by Italian pharmacies. It is unlikely to meet its target of a 15 per cent margin for a year or two, but there is a chance its new polyurethane condom could unlock both higher margins and increasing market share. In that case LIG should easily manage earnings of around 8p by 1996-97 and its shares look good value at yesterday's closing ex-rights price of 80p. Equally, if the current management falls short of its margin target, the strength of LIG's Durex brand and its surgical gloves business may tempt someone else to have a go. The photo-processing business was a trap for any unwary predator. Now it is gone, LIG is more vulnerable. Based on the current market valuation and including debt, LIG would still be worth only around 1.2 times sales after the restructuring. That looks affordable even to a predator willing to pay a substantial premium for control.</p>

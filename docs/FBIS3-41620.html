			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva: ``On the Brink of Military </F> Conflict'']    [Text] In the autumn of 1991 thirty-nine Polish  supertrawlers burst into the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk,  a small ``pentagon'' of the neutral waters, 325 miles long and  62 miles wide, surrounded from all sides by the marine economic  zone of Russia. The Polish ships were followed by nine large  South Korean trawlers and almost the entire Chinese fishing  fleet. Somewhat later fishing ships from Japan, Panama, Bulgaria  and Ukraine appeared. A wild revelry began in that part of the  Sea of Okhotsk. Reluctant to observe the elementary  international fishing regulations, foreign fishermen set to  clearing out the wealth of the northern sea.    At first the Far Eastern fishermen, before whose eyes all  this illegal activity occurred, accepted it as some absurd  incident, without the slightest doubt that the Russian  government and the President would put an end to the pilfering  and the plunderers would be made to clear out shortly. In  keeping with the moratorium on fishing in the central part of  the Sea of Okhotsk, announced by the Supreme Soviet of the  Russian Federation, local fishermen have stopped fishing and  returned to their native port. However, our Supreme Soviet is  not regarded as an authority by foreigners.    The poaching, unprecedented in world practice, has been  going  on for two years. Dozens of seiners (there were some months when  they numbered 90) barbarously catch pollack in the area and  everything that gets into the nets--herring, salmon, saury,  flatfish, halibut, crabs and mollusks. Disregarding appeals and  warnings from the Russian side (from fish-protection bodies and  scientists) foreigners catch pollack in places which have always  been regarded as forbidden areas, i.e., at the wintering  congestions of this species and spawning grounds, undermining  the existence of the pollack population. In fact, they take only  the back of pollack used for ``Suremi'' stuffing and roe which  makes 35 percent of the total catch. The rest is considered as  waste and is thrown into the sea, which is now polluted beyond  measure. According to experts, the foreign fleet catches 1.5  million tons of pollack a year in the area. This is considerably  more than permitted rates. The Sea of Okhotsk is doomed to  ecological disaster, Far Eastern fishing companies will be  ruined and fishermen will lose their jobs.    The neutral zone mentioned here covers only three percent of  the total area and for numerous large-tonnage trawlers does not  suffice. It is no wonder that now and again they find themselves  in our economic zone, especially since boundaries cannot be  drawn at sea. However, most of them pass into the prohibited  zone intentionally. Well aware that Russia's economic zone is  poorly guarded nowadays, and that our frontier-guard and fishing  protection bodies face difficulties with fuel (patrol ships are  laid up), they also raid Russian territorial waters. The  poachers are rarely detained. But even those detained get off  with a trifling fine, which fails to compensate the losses  incurred by our country as a result of foreign poachers.  According to the most optimistic calculations, Russia annually  loses about $700 million because of raids by foreign fleets.    Russia's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly given explanations  on this score from which it follows that there is no solution to  the crisis in the Sea of Okhotsk, that the sea is unprotected  and we have no rights to oppose the foreign plunderers.    But there are other seas in the world where, as in the Sea  of  Okhotsk, the zone allocated to international fishing is an  insignificant part of the total area and is surrounded by the  200-mile economic zone of the coastal state.    Controls imposed by the coastal states are very strict and  serve to regulate foreign fishing in neutral waters. For  law-breakers there are sanctions that can ruin even the most  prosperous fishing companies. Violations of the law are rare  there.    The situation on the Sea of Okhotsk has become strained to  the utlmost. Insulted by the government's inaction and the  impunity of robbers, Russia's fishermen are arming themselves.  The frontier guards, too, suggest to change legislation and to  give permission to open fire on poacher ships caught fishing in  our waters. At its recent session the Council of the Far Eastern  Association of Economic Cooperation offered to declare the area  where foreign ships are deployed, a zone for launching ballistic  missiles. It was also suggested that foreigners be turned out of  the ``pentagon'' with the help of the Pacific Fleet warships,  and only after that to find a juridical substantiation for these  actions. Scientists recalled that in the past century there were  similar problems with seal furs. The seal was on the brink of  extinction. To prevent this Russia and the USA sent warships to  the area to protect the environment from poachers.    P.S. The latest news: foreign warships began to enter the  free zone to protect their ``fishermen.'' It looks as if the  dramatic situation in the Sea of Okhotsk has reached its peak.  The outcome is yet to be seen.</p>

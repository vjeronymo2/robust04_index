			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has been  tasked with forming a government in the [southern] Democratic  Republic of Yemen [DRY], has stated that all the members of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau, including those  outside Yemen, were consulted before the decision to proclaim  the establishment of the DRY was made.    In an interview with AL-WASAT in London, al-'Attas said that  while he was in the United States for medical treatment, he held  consultations with many of his colleagues in the Political  Bureau, including Salim Salih Muhammad, YSP assistant secretary  general and Presidential Council member, whose name was not on  the list of 16 members against whom arrest warrants were issued.    Al-'Attas, whom 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih dismissed as prime  minister when the situation deteriorated, said that the decision  to go back to the pre-unity state of affairs was dictated by the  facts on the ground. He said: War has dealt unity a blow and  secession is a way to extricate Yemen from its dilemma. The  return to the political formula that preceded unity is a  preventive measure to save Yemen from fragmentation. Secession  represents part of our efforts to introduce Yemen into the 20th  century. Perhaps it is an advanced step to save the elite,  which calls for the establishment of a state of institutions and  law, to enhance the concept of political pluralism, and help  modernize the state.    By affirming that he consulted all YSP Political Bureau  members before the announcement of the secession, al-'Attas  seems to be closing the door, if temporarily, in the face of  Sanaa's attempts to sow a rift within the YSP by inviting  northern leaders within the YSP -- like Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man,  Jarallah 'Umar, Yahya al-Shami, and Ahmad al-Salami, who all are  YSP Political Bureau members -- to hold a dialogue. Al-'Attas  said: All such reports are mere rumors that show just how much  the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Reform Grouping  wish to divide the YSP. This has been their major concern since  the proclamation of unity. In the early months of unity, they  disseminated reports about the existence of the intransigent  Fattah line within the YSP, which later proved to be all rumors  that northern intelligence organizations propagated. He said  that reports that Jarallah 'Umar has left Aden for the north is  not true, as Jarallah 'Umar has been nominated to assume one of  the ministerial portfolios in the new DRY government.

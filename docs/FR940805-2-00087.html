(BNI), Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN), Santa Fe Pacific Corporation (SFP), and The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) (collectively, applicants) filed a notice of intent indicating that they will file an application seeking Commission approval and authorization under 49 U.S.C. 11343&hyph;47 for: (1) BNI's acquisition of control of and merger with SFP; (2) the resulting common control of BN and Santa Fe by the merged company; and (3) the merger of the two railroad entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 29, 1994, BNI and SFP have agreed that SFP will merge with and into BNI in accordance with Delaware law. The merger is subject to certain conditions, including Commission approval. During the pendency of the Commission's review of the application, BNI and SFP, including their carrier subsidiaries, will continue to operate as independent companies, each headquartered in its current city and operating under the direction of its current board and management. Upon Commission approval, SFP will be merged with and into BNI, which will be the surviving company and will change its name to Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Each share of SFP common stock will be exchanged for 0.27 of a share of newly issued BNI common stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the merger of BNI and SFP, the merged company will directly control both BN and Santa Fe, and the operations of the two railroads will be fully integrated pursuant to that common control. Applicants also are seeking authority to merge the two railroad legal entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will use the year 1993 for purposes of their impact analyses to be filed in the application. Applicants anticipate filing their application approximately 3 to 4 months after the July 8, 1994 filing of this Notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that this is a major transaction, as defined at 49 CFR 1180.2(a), as it is a control and merger transaction involving two or more class I railroads. The application must conform to the regulations set forth at 49 CFR Part 1180 and must contain all information required therein for major transactions, except as modified by any advance waiver. The carriers are also required to submit maps with overlays that show the existing routes of both carriers and their competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By petition also filed July 8, 1994, applicants sought a protective order to protect confidential, highly confidential, and proprietary information, including contract terms, shipper-specific traffic data, and other traffic data to be submitted in connection with the control application. A protective order was entered in a decision served July 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also on July 8, 1994, applicants filed a petition to establish a proposed procedural schedule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission seeks comments now on applicants' proposed procedural schedule. Applicants' proposed procedural schedule is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants also state that they intend to seek a waiver of the Commission's regulations governing the filing of directly related applications in order to permit the filing of any related abandonment applications up to 31/2 months after the filing of the primary application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to submitting an original and 20 copies of all documents filed with the Commission, the parties are encouraged to submit all pleadings and attachments as computer data contained on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette which is formatted for WordPerfect 5.1 (or formatted so that it can be converted by WordPerfect 5.1). The computer data contained on the computer diskettes submitted are subject to the protective order attached to the Commission's decision served July 15, 1994, and is for the exclusive use of Commission employees working directly with review of substantive matters in this proceeding. The flexibility provided by such computer file data will facilitate expedited review by the Commission and its staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Tighter bankruptcy legislation welcomed Bankers and consumer groups are welcoming changes to the US bankruptcy code that slipped through Congress in the closing days of the session last week, writes George Graham in Washington. The legislation makes the first substantial changes to US bankruptcy law since 1978, and is viewed as partially redressing a balance that had swung too far in favour of the debtor. Once the measure has been signed into law by President Bill Clinton, court proceedings will be speeded up by the imposition of a 30-day time limit for courts to rule on requests for an automatic stay, which allows a debtor to avoid foreclosure on property when filing for bankruptcy. The bill would also seek to prevent debtors from extending their bankruptcy hearings. It would give creditors the right to appeal against any extension of time granted to a company to file its bankruptcy reorganisation plan. For personal bankruptcies, the lower limit for filing for Chapter 13 protection - a procedure which shields a debtor while allowing time to work out a repayment plan - would be raised from Dollars 450,000 to Dollars 1m.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Property: Confusion in the country - The uncertainties hitting the market for period houses A degree of anarchy has spread across the shires as the owners of period properties run into a problem: the absence of a single national country-house market. Each urban area can have enough property stock and activity to produce, at the least, a plausible set of comparables. Not so country homes; the only former vicarage in the village, or its sole Georgian manor, has no direct equivalent to which the owner, agent or prospective buyer can turn for an up-to-date market rate. The result is a riot of unrelated asking prices. Country agents normally get around the problem by making it their business to know what is available county-wide. Regional knowledge can then be applied to each sale. Owners can be shown similar properties that have sold at one price level and failed to sell at another. But, in the aftermath of the roller-coaster price pattern of the past few years, that flow of information has been disrupted. News of sales activity has been both patchy and uncertain. Country home-owners have been staying put because of the uncertainties. Inevitably, therefore, a higher-than-average proportion of country-house sales has been special cases where owners have had compelling reasons to move. Price comparisons drawn from those sales do reflect present levels - but they are not levels in which many other prospective vendors are interested. The shelves full of glossy magazines carrying country-house sale advertisements can no longer be relied upon to give an accurate flavour of values. Advertised asking prices may represent good, moderate or bad value - depending on whether the vendor has listened to the sales agent's advice or the other way around. There is no sure way of telling. In this period of sales blight, Savills' prime country residential property index comes into its own. Because notional valuations are made on an unchanging base of 600 period country properties, the index is not affected as badly by the lack of actual sales evidence as are price guides based on sales or mortgage advances. Taking 1979 as a starting point, and the 100 base for the index, Savills had recorded a doubling of country-house values by the mid-1980s and a further doubling between 1985-89. Subsequent reductions have seen the index fall from a three-year-old peak of 447.6 to 351.4. That is a 21.5 per cent drop in values nationally - and a reduction of more than 25 per cent in the notional re-sale value of a country house in the home counties. Savills recalls that demand for energy-hungry country houses was at a low ebb in the 1970s but that 'the 1980s was the decade of the country house.' A mix of rising incomes, easy access to loan finance and new wealth released by company flotations, plus the 'nostalgia boom' and its associated desire for country living, 'conspired to create the perfect environment for country-house sales.' What of the 1990s? Savills' index, plus clear anecdotal evidence from country property agencies, suggests a market that is far more cost-conscious and will remain so in the foreseeable future. Quality of property is a major element. Savills' Yolande Barnes notes 'a marked polarisation, with properties that are in very good condition attracting such interest as there is in the market. Anything that has anything remotely wrong with it  .. no-one wants to know.' While a division of the market by size is less easy to prove, it is accepted as a fact by country agencies. The grand, 'trophy' properties, bought in the 1980s to display what often was new wealth, are fast becoming an embarrassment to agents. Million-plus country homes became commonplace at the end of the 1980s; they are a much rarer breed now. There is a similar return to values based on accommodation, rather than image, all down the country-house price scales. No-one is trading up. If the runes for the 1990s are being read correctly, few people will want to trade up in the foreseeable future, either. That leaves the higher-priced 'status' houses out on a limb but does not suggest any long-term lack of buying interest in more modest, family-scale country properties. Buyers in the 1990s can get the life-style they want, cheaper and as easily, in a five-bedroom house as in a 10-bedder with stone lions on the gateposts.</p>

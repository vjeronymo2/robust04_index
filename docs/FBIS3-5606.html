			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Last installment of an article by Political Bureau member </F> Vu Oanh: "Great National Unity in the New Situation and Tasks"]    [Text] For overseas Vietnamese, we must help develop their  capabilities through the exploitation of results attained in the  renovation at home. Efforts must be made to diversify our  international relations activities. The overseas Vietnamese is  an important force that can introduce our country to the nations  of the world.    We must on the one hand, organize overseas Vietnamese and  urge them to help propagate our market economy and promote  tourism in Vietnam in their country of residence. We must also  invite scientists and business management specialists to visit  our country (on various occasions and in various forms,  including the possibility of joining our state agencies).    We must strive to create favorable conditions for overseas  Vietnamese to visit their homeland and invest in production and  business at home for their benefit and that of the nation. There  are some sectors and localities where residents have a large  number of relatives living abroad. In this case, efforts should  be made to set up a liaison committee or an association of  relatives of overseas Vietnamese to keep them well informed  about state lines and policies, while conveying their relatives'  aspirations to mass organizations or the administration.  Efforts must be made to encourage relatives of overseas  Vietnamese to further their studies or work abroad.    The state should do its best to protect the interest of  overseas Vietnamese in accordance with international law, while  encouraging them to strengthen unity, help one another, and  uphold national prestige.    2. Efforts must be made to broaden democracy while  maintaining social discipline.    Under our current politico-social system, the party leads,  the state manages, and the people are masters. Thus, all powers  belong to the people.    In exercising their powers, the people are building the  state  apparatus through general elections. On the other hand, they  have the obligation of participating in formulating state laws,  monitoring activities of the state, serving the nation, and  living and working in accordance with the law. This is the  dialectical relationship between representative democracy and  direct democracy. This relationship helps broaden democracy,  while strengthening social discipline.    We must live and work in accordance with the law. However,  the law alone cannot resolve all issues in the daily life, which  is full of complicated social problems. As a result, while  formulating various laws we must develop our social mechanism  and promote the people's rights to autonomy in managing the  family, ward, village, and community activities to improve their  daily life and to settle social issues through social contracts.  At the grass-roots level, we should set up a conciliation  council to help the chief of the village or ward, the people's  committee, and mass organizations to resolve issues. This  council should be composed of people with good educational  backgrounds and who are trusted by the people.    To broaden democracy and strengthen law and discipline,  there  must be consistent efforts to disseminate state laws widely.  Efforts must also be made to attach importance to disseminating  the law on civil and human rights so that people will realize  their obligations. At the same time, this is to arm the people  with the knowledge to fight civil and human rights violations.  Essential efforts must be made to clearly specify the authority  and responsibility of heads of state agencies in accordance with  the principle that the more authority an officer holds, the more  responsibility he must bear. We must strive to oppose the  usurpation of power and uphold the principle of checks and  balances of power and responsibility. We must make more effort  to study, perfect, and revise the law on electing and appointing  heads of state agencies to overcome negative phenomena such as  formalistic democracy, arbitrariness, and disorganized freedom.    We may exercise national power by convening a national  congress comprising of authorized delegates with a good  background, who are trustworthy, and who represent the people's  strata, nationalities, and religious groups to discuss the most  important national issues. This will be like the Dien Hong  Congress under the Tran Dynasty or the special political  conference of President Ho Chi Minh during the war against the  U.S.    3. Efforts must be made to overcome prejudice,  discrimination, and hatred among the people and to look to the  future to strengthen national unity and uphold the spirit of  mutual trust for the sake of national independence and freedom  and happiness of the people.    The achievements of our renovation have helped us to  effectively implement the market-based multisectorial economy  under state management and to diversify our diplomatic  activities. It is natural that we must advance further to  establish the great national unity bloc in the new situation and  tasks to strengthen unity among the masses in a more profound  and far-reaching way.    It is necessary to say that the Vietnamese nation has a  great  social structure comprising various strata, nationalities, and  religious groups living both at home and abroad. Although they  come from different backgrounds, have different levels of  education and capabilities, and different tastes and  experiences, they originate from Vietnam, a nation with a  longstanding and heroic history. The enemy's war of aggression  that caused untold misery and loss to Vietnam has imbued in the  heart of all Vietnamese the spirit of patriotism and pride in  their fatherland. At present, our country is enjoying new  opportunities while facing numerous ordeals affecting our  national fate and destiny.    As Vietnamese, we all want our country to grasp  opportunities to overcome difficulties, poverty, and  backwardness and develop itself into a prosperous nation with a  due position in the world community. None of us want our  country to remain underdeveloped forever. Therefore, the  above-mentioned goals must be included in the great national  unity policy. Let's share similarities and accept differences.  Let's try to get rid of prejudices, complexes, and hatred and  work toward the goals of building a beautiful country both for  the present and future generations. To this end, we must, first  of all, promote the spirit of genuine concord, equality, and  mutual respect. Let's avoid criticism, disparagement, and  harsh treatment and renounce attempts to eliminate one another.  It is necessary to respect the people's beliefs and protect  their places of worship. It is important to keep the components  of the great national unity bloc within the people's mastership  system. If there are different political beliefs, let's sit  down and talk in a sensible and reasonable way. Let's exercise  dictatorship only over those who betray the country or violate  the law and let's make sure that their cases are tried according  to set court procedures. Leading officials in charge of state  agencies, mass societies, and front organizations must be  selected through truly democratic elections and must include  people who have ethics and talents and who truly represent the  masses.    4. It is necessary for the Vietnam Fatherland Front to shift  its duty from national liberation to national defense and  construction, bearing in mind the need to give priority to  socioeconomic development tasks. From 1994 till the end of the  20st century, we must focus on the following four key tasks:    -- Motivating all individuals, families, and the entire  people to make personal efforts to overcome poverty and  backwardness, effect changes for the better, and compete against  and cooperate with one another in the spirit of fairness.    Steps must be taken to promote the multisectorial economy  based on the market mechanism and under state management. It is  necessary to effect economic restructuring in the direction of  industrialization and modernization and in keeping with efforts  to expand, diversify, and multilateralize diplomatic relations.    -- Paying due attention to the human resources development,  regarding the human factor not only as the target of but also  the motive behind the formulation of socioeconomic development  programs and public utility projects to benefit the country and  people. It is necessary to make due efforts to broaden  democracy, implement social justice, and ameliorate the people's  intellectual background and living conditions. Steps must be  taken to improve the quality of cultural, educational, and  public healthcare services. Effective measures must be adopted  to implement the population activities and family planning  program.    -- Creating preliminary conditions and opportunities for  everyone to overcome poverty and backwardness and enrich  themselves and society. These goals can be reached through the  granting of the land use rights to peasants and the application  of the share-holding system to workers. It is necessary for the  banking system to intensify the mobilization of funds to grant  sufficient loans to the people to increase economic activities.  Long-term incentive measures must be worked out to make all  economic sectors have a sense of security while investing  talents and capital in production and business activities. It  is important to encourage all individuals and families to enrich  themselves and help make the country powerful and bring about  justice and civilization in society through the movement to  eliminate hunger and reduce poverty.    It is necessary to motivate the people to participate in the  campaign against corruption, smuggling, the production of fake  goods, and other negative phenomenon in society. Greater  attention must be paid to charity work, humanitarian activities,  and the movement to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty.    Vigorous efforts must be made to step up educational  activities and improve everyone's cultural and professional  knowledge. Regular refresher courses must be conducted to help  the people improve their scientific, technological,  professional, economic, cultural, and educational backgrounds.    It is important to promote the cultural quintessence of the  nation and combine this move with efforts to learn from the  cultural heritages of mankind. Prompt steps must be worked out  to gain access to modern science and technology. Measures must  be taken to preserve and restore cultural relics as well as  oppose the depletion or pollution of the environment.    -- Greater attention must be paid to the consolidation of  the  all-people national defense network and the people's security  system.    The above-mentioned tasks have been initiated and directed  by  party platforms, directives, and resolutions as well as by state  laws and regulations. All those legal documents cannot generate  practical results unless we take into account the strength of  the great national unity bloc. The Vietnam Fatherland Front  plays an important role because it solicits the views of the  people and incorporate them in the formulation of party policies  and lines as well as state laws and regulations.    IV. Consolidating and broadening the Vietnam Fatherland  Front.    The Vietnam Fatherland Front is a political alliance which  serves as a venue for mass organizations and representatives of  people of all walks of life and different social classes, ethnic  groups, and religions to unite action on a voluntary basis. It  also serves as the political basis of the people's  administration and is directed by the Communist Party of Vietnam.    All those components form an overall network of party  leadership, state management, and people's mastery under the  political system of our regime. They share one thing in common,  namely to work toward the goals of national defense and  construction. Each component is part and parcel of an overall  structure but plays a separate role and generates a different  result.    1. In its capacity both as an affiliated organization and a  managing organ, the party cannot consolidate the front's  structure or develop its role as a genuine mass society unless  it observes truly democratic principles governing its leaderhip  and refrains itself from impositions or taking over the work of  mass organizations.    The party exerts its leadership through its platforms and  lines and policies as well as through the power of persuasion  created by the examplary conduct and vanguard role of party  organizations and party members in the front. It is necessary  to fully respect the independence and self-rule of the Vietnam  Fatherland Front. The party may introduce its platforms and  lines and policies to the front or recommend party members to  join the front's management but is not supposed to give  instructions to the front or have party members joint the  front's management without going through democratic elections.    It is necessary for cadres and party members to clearly  realize the importance of the front-related policies and tasks.  Efforts must be made to avoid incorrect views, especially the  bad practice of belittling front-related work, and the evils of  prejudices and narrow-mindedness. Steps must be taken to  overcome the situation in which party officials resort to  imposition in assigning cadres to take charge of the front  without checking if their qualifications meet work requirements.  It is important to formulate proper policies toward cadres in  charge of the front. Efforts are needed to overcome  shortcomings and weaknesses, thereby improving the party's  leadership over the front a step further.    2. It is necessary for state agencies to fully understand  and  institutionalize the duties and rights of the front, so that it  can act as a firm political basis of the people's  administration, and most importantly, can participate in the  process of forming elected organs, drafting legal documents,  managing socioeconomic activities, and overseeing the operations  of state organs, elected government officials, and state cadres  and employees. It is necessary for state agencies to go out of  their way to join hands with front committees at all levels in  ensuring strict implementation of the Constitution and laws and  regulations.    3. It is important to consolidate the Vietnam Fatherland  Front and broaden its organizations and activities. This is for  it to serve as an effective venue for rallying people from all  walks of life in the great national unity bloc, where everyone  can show demomstrate their power and express their aspirations  and where members of the affiliated organizations can achieve  unanamity of action and help the administration in resolving the  internal disputes among people, implementing democracy, making  improvements in society, looking after and protecting the  legitimate interests of people of all walks of life, and  building and safeguarding the administration as well as  overseeing its activities. The front is dutybound to take part  in socioeconomic management, help with the implementation of  socioeconomic development and national security and defense  tasks, and motivate mass organizations to participate in the  struggle against corruption, smuggling, and other social vices,  thereby contributing to strengthening relations between the  people and the party and state.    The front operates in the spirit of consultation, democracy,  equality, sincere cooperation, mutual respect, and unanimity of  action with all affiliated organizations under a common action  program.    Plans must be worked out to consolidate the front committees  at all levels, bearing in mind the need to improve the quality  of leading cadres. It is important to see to it that more  trustworthy and highly-competent individuals representing people  from all walks of life and different ethnic groups, religious  beliefs, intellectual backgrounds, and business circles join the  front and form a highly motivated collective, which is endowed  with cultural quintessence, wisdom, talents, and high resolve  and which typically stands for the vitality of a country now  moving toward progress.    The front committees at all levels play a key role in  coordinating action among the front's affiliated organizations  and administrative organs at the same level and in launching a  motivation campaign to win the hearts and minds of senior  citizens, notables, intellectuals, industrialists, businessmen,  hilltribes, religious leaders, and Vietnamese residents abroad.    As far the consolidation and broadening of the front's  organizations and activities are concerned, it is necessary to  focus on both grass-roots and central level establishments and  step up the front's public relations.    4. The relations between the VFF and the party and state are  built upon the common goals of making the people rich and the  country powerful as well as of bringing about justice and  civilization in society. They follow a two-way course of  action, namely the leadership and its objects. Moreover, they  are based on the principles of equality, consultation, dialogue,  and constructive criticism.    The endeavors to consolidate the great national unity bloc  and the National United Front are strategically important to the  overall political system and necessitate the common efforts of  all echelons and sectors. It is necessary to first disseminate  the contents of this resolution to all party organs, state  agencies, front organizations, and mass societies.    We are convinced that the Political Bureau's Resolution on  Great National Unity and Consolidation of the National United  Front will create an atmosphere of concord, mutual trust,  enthusiasm, and national pride among people of all walks of  life, social classes, ethnic groups, and religious organizations  at home as well as among Vietnamese residents abroad, and also a  new strength for the goals of making the people rich and the  country powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization  in society come true.</p>

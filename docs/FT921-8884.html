			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Observer: In the kisser On this, St Valentine's day, Observer is happy to pass on some hints from 'Snogging - a beginner's guide to the art of kissing'. For a start, amateurs should realise that a kiss which speaks volumes is seldom a first edition, and a flirt is a woman who thinks it's every man for herself. And if you tell your lover 'I love you terribly' you run the risk that he/she may agree with you. Moreover, those of a certain age should remember they can keep their teeth out of the way by slipping them in a pocket. The book, which lists the pros and cons of inviting your first date to share a pew with you in church, is published by HarperCollins Religious Publishing. Observer is gob-smacked.</p>

Trklja: "Tarle: For Us, Krajina Is Zanzibar"] </F>   [Text] What are the chances for 300,000 Serbs expelled from  Croatia to return to their homes, if there are any chances at  all?    The Association of Refugees and Exiles in Yugoslavia has  sent  a letter to United Nations General Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali  in which the refugees and exiles request that he help facilitate  their return to their homes. Zvonko Tarle, secretary of the  association, commenting on this new request and on real  possibilities for such an initiative, points out that dilemmas  exist concerning the resolution of the refugee problem. Namely,  the issue of refugees can be resolved by means of so-called  humanitarian relocation or return of refugees.    This association is opposed to the relocation of the  population and insists on the creation of the conditions for the  return of the people to their own homes. Tarle says that Serbs  from Croatian towns do not feel that the republic of Serbian  Krajina [RSK] is their own mother state, that they did not fight  for it, and that, on the other hand, Yugoslavia, where they have  found a temporary residence, does nothing about their return to  Croatia.    "For many Serbs from the cities, Krajina is just like  Zanzibar. This is understandable, because for someone who had  lived in Zagreb or Rijeka, Knin or Glina are rather remote. We  cannot obtain a passport because the authorities send us to the  RSK offices. Yugoslavia sacrificed 300,000 Serbs from Croatia  for the legalization of the RSK, and none of us want to live  there," Tarle says.    The return of Serbs to Croatia is an issue of exceptional  importance because, as Tarle says, Serbs would become  participants in political life there. "Tudjman wants the Croats  to return to the RSK. Recently a delegation even went to  Butrus-Ghali to insist on this, and no one ever mentioned this  issue to the officials on our behalf," secretary of the  Association of Refugees and Exiles says.    "Refugees from Bosnia have similar problems," Tarle says,  adding: "These people who fled to Yugoslavia are not army  deserters. They simply did not want to participate in the bloody  civil war. At the same time they do not want to join some  single-nationality state of Karadzic's, they want to return to  the Bosnia they once knew and in which they lived. The majority  of refugees from Croatia, about 80 percent, came with the first  wave in 1991. Many got used to life here, but they want to be  able to travel to Croatia and want arrangements for their return  to be made. We do not have specific data on the number of  refugees who wish to return to their homes, but we have  conducted polls which indicate that the majority favor such an  option."    "For example, all 7,000 exiles from Dubrovnik wish to return  there, and it is the same with the 10,000 Serbs from Rijeka, and  at least 60 percent of the 30,000 Serbs from Osijek want to  return to their homes," Zvonko Tarle points out.    "Certain differences exist among the refugees from Croatia.  Refugees of the former Yugoslav Army officer type who lived  there for 10 to 15 years should be distinguished from the Serbs  whose families had lived there for 200 to 300 years and whose  roots are there," Tarle says.    Zvonko Tarle warns that the Croatian assembly will soon,  maybe even today, pass the law on the expropriation of the  property of people who fled. Thus, the property of all the Serbs  who left Croatia will actually be taken away. Even before this  law, the practice of transforming the Serbian people into a  minority had been underway in Croatia. Namely, if a Serb in  Croatia obtains citizenship papers he becomes a citizen of that  state and his status, instead of that of a people, becomes that  of an ethnic minority. "All of this is well-known," Tarle says,  "but Yugoslavia up to now did not insist on these issues  anywhere in the world and did not do anything in order to  protect the rights of Serbs in Croatia. This is how it was also  in Slovenia. Yugoslavia did not show by any gesture that it was  interested in its citizens and their property, and former Prime  Minister Panic even recognized Slovenia," Tarle says.    Answering the question whether it is not too early to speak  about a return to Croatia while the war is still going on and in  circumstances when Serbian churches, like the one in Karlovac,  continue to be demolished, Tarle says that the association does  not support the return of refugees and exiles but the creation  of conditions for their return. In his opinion, there will be no  final peace in this territory as long as all the Serbs do not  return to Croatia and the Croats to the republic of Srpska. He  believes that the most recent explosion and destruction of the  church in Karlovac was not an act of the Croatian Government but  of Croatian extremists. "Such acts are not in the interest of  the government there, and it condemns them. Even Cardinal  Kuharic, who recently invited Serbian priests to return to  Croatia, condemned such an act of vandalism. Metropolitan Jovan  remains in Ljubljana and is not even thinking of going to  Zagreb, although I think that he would be safe in Zagreb, and  the people there would protect him with even tanks if that were  necessary," Tarle say.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool prices for wool at recent auctions have been almost static. After dipping very slightly when sales were resumed after Easter the Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator has stabilised at 577 cents a kg. This is said to be around 100 cents below the level needed for woolgrowers to be persuaded to maintain output and forecasts at present indicate a further decline next season. The absence of any clear direction in the market as the selling season draws to its close in June is causing quiet trading throughout. The recession is showing slight signs of lifting in the severely affected sectors.</p>

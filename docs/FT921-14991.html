			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Justinian: A code to control chat lines Codes of practice in support of self-regulation of the service industries continue to sprout. The most recent covers the provision of premium rate telephone services, such as those described as 'adult entertainment' and so-called 'chat lines' for children. The code is produced by ICSTIS, the independent committee which supervises telephone information services, and comes into force on February 1. This new updated code raises the hoary issue of whether statutory control by governmental agency is preferable to self-regulation, so as to maximise consumer protection while allowing the service provider the greatest freedom to provide a commercially viable product. Almost 20 years ago the UK's Office of Fair Trading, which is statutorily authorised to encourage trade associations to prepare codes of practice for guidance in safeguarding and promoting the interests of consumers, and to give its imprimatur to approved codes, recognised that codes had the greatest utility in areas which are ill-suited to statutory control. It singled out for mention codes which were especially adept in improving the standard of services, which it said could not readily be achieved by legislation. The acid test is the ability of the supervisory body generally to set the appropriate standards to which the regulated are required to conform while at the same time operating an effective system of sanctions to punish those in breach of the code. The new code prepared by ICSTIS is broadly divided into two parts: provisions which lay down the permissible limits of the contents of communications; and measures covering the type of advertising designed to encourage the use of such premium rate services (the number of calls total a staggering 6m a week, although the rapid increase during the late 1980s flattened out last year). Much of the public complaint over the content of these services has focused on the so-called 'adult entertainment' features (though these are declining in popularity). The code restricts these services to certain prefixes (0898 in the case of British Telecom), which users on digital telephone exchanges will be able to bar access to, free of charge. By the mid-90s all but a few remote areas of the UK will be on digital dialling, enabling a majority of subscribers to opt out of the so-called pornographic services. This step forward has been widely welcomed by the public and sections of the telecommunications industry. Other new measures protecting consumers relate to children's services. Some of these services last for several minutes and are hence expensive. Children may not sufficiently appreciate how much their calls are costing, often to the consternation of their parents who have to foot the bill. Such services will now be subject to a maximum call length of 7.5 minutes, after which the call must be terminated. Advertisements for children's services, moreover, will be required to state the maximum potential cost of any call. ICSTIS will be monitoring this new provision to gauge its effectiveness. Supervision of the advertising of premium rate services has been an important concern for ICSTIS. Information on prices is not always given; when information is provided it is often insufficiently legible. Advertising of sex lines in certain popular national newspapers has been curbed as a result of a significant ruling last summer by ICSTIS, which declared that the majority of such advertisements were unacceptably offensive. The code has one important advantage over its predecessor: it incorporates many of the provisions of the British Code of Advertising Practice (BCAP), which were previously included only by cross reference to BCAP. The BCAP is supervised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which was itself created in 1962 as a direct response to the threat of statutory control over the advertising industry. Its survival without government interference speaks well for self-regulation, particularly since it is not entirely independent of the industry. The chairman of the ASA is appointed from outside the industry and at least half its members must have no connection with the industry. ASA members drawn from the industry itself are supposed to serve in their individual capacity and not as representatives of any sectional interests. By contrast, ICSTIS contains no-one connected with the service operators. The chairman* is appointed by the network operators in consultation with the director-general of Oftel, the overall industry regulator. The chairman appoints eight other members in consultation with the network operators. Normally a regulated industry finances its regulatory body. ICSTIS, however, is financed by the network operators. These operators, while sharing the income from the premium rate services with the service providers, do not themselves supply the actual information services and are therefore not subject to the provisions of the code. The other special feature of ICSTIS is that it cannot be faulted in theory for being toothless. If there is a serious breach of its code, ICSTIS can recommend to the network operator that the guilty service provider should no longer have access to the lines allotted to it by the network operator. Each service provider has a clause in its contract with the network operator requiring compliance with the code of practice. Any adverse adjudication by ICSTIS, and appropriate recommendation, constitutes a breach of contract. The author is chairman of ICSTIS</p>

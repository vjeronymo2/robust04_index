			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Five-party Thai coalition formed THAI politicians at the weekend forged a five-party coalition that is preparing to form a government and name Mr Chuan Leekpai, leader of the Democrat party, prime minister after the king opens parliament today. The coalition includes the four 'angel' parties opposed to military involvement in politics and business - the Democrats, Palang Dharma (Moral Force), the New Aspiration party, and Solidarity - and the Social Action party (SAP). The SAP was part of a short-lived coalition favouring the armed forces during the political crisis in May when troops killed at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of Bangkok. But its leaders dithered during the conflict and it is regarded as an acceptable coalition partner by the other four. The five parties have 207 seats in the 360-seat House of Representatives, but the coalition is still likely to be fragile. Democrat MPs are concerned that the NAP will be wooed away by the pro-military parties, and at what they see as the unpredictable ambitions of Mr Chamlong, the devout Buddhist Palang Dharma leader who led the street protests. Mr Chuan's Democrat party won the most seats in the general election a week ago, and Democrat members of parliament said yesterday they would choose the ministers of finance, agriculture and industry and the prime minister. The Palang Dharma party is expected to name the new ministers of foreign affairs and transport and communications. Mr Chamlong's party was given the transport and communications portfolio - a source of corrupt earnings from commission payments in previous administrations - because of his reputation as an anti-corruption campaigner. On the foreign policy side, Palang Dharma is expected to reduce Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and Burma's military junta.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Weakness in stock index futures was faced by a stubborn cash market that refused to be led downwards, Christine Buckley writes. One derivatives trader speculated that a buy programme may have shored up the cash market, which has recently often fallen prey to the many swings of the June contract on the FT-SE 100. Directionless trading dogged June, with much of its fall over the session attributed to ticking down by independent traders. Institutions were said to have kept to the sidelines. This week's lack of economic data is deepening the apathy. For most of the day, June traded at a substantial discount to cash although in a fairly narrow range. The contract fell to its lowest level early in the session when it touched 2,983, although it rallied to reach its intraday high of 3,014 only a little later. However, after mid-morning the contract found few friends and drifted, often downwards, for much of the session, closing at 2,998 and trailing the cash market by nearly 9 points. Volume was thin at 13,070 contracts. Options had an uneventful day, with just 20,913 lots dealt. Index options were a prominent part of the activity as investors looked for hedging positions. The FT-SE 100 option traded 10,685 lots. The most traded stock option was Guinness at 1,005.</p>

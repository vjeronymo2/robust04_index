While we are deepening reform,  opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development,  we should also pay attention to maintaining a stable social,  economic, and political environment. We should make efforts to  advance reform and development in a stable environment. We  should realize a stabilized society in the long term through  reform and development, thereby maintaining strong momentum in  Tibet's reform, opening up, and economic development.    Reviewing Tibet's achievements in economic development last  year, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: We must integrate the CPC  Central Committee's policy decisions with Tibet's actual  situation, correctly recognize and handle the relationship  between long-term and immediate interests, extensively mobilize  and organize the masses of people to contribute to reform, and  carefully make plans for launching and carrying out various  reform measures. At the same time, we must pay close attention  to agricultural and animal husbandry production to strive for  another harvest in this year. We must focus on processing  industry, foreign trade, tourism, and village and town  enterprises; continue to do a good job in the construction of  infrastructure in transportation, energy, communications fields;  and vigorously improve the investment environment. As long as  we follow the CPC Central Committee's plans and work in a  down-to-earth manner, we will be able to close the gap between  Tibet and other better-developed regions and create a brand new  image for ourselves that will impress the entire nation.</p>

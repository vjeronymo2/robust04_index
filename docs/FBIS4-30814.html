			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 30 (TANJUG) -- The inflation has for  three months been nearly at zero in Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro), which in 1993 set the world record with its  annual inflation rate of 116 trillion per cent. The inflation  rate in May was 0.3 per cent down from April, Mirjana Rankovic,  deputy general manager of the Federal Bureau of Statistics said  on Monday. This has primarily resulted from a further decline of  retail prices of manufactured goods. Prices of agricultural  produce have increased 20.5 per cent and those of services 1.8  per cent, she said. In the past month most of the prices have  been stable or have slightly declined, but the statistics has,  nevertheless, registered an increase in prices of some products.  There has been a record-high increase of the price of carrots --  88 per cent -- and apples -- 69 per cent. This is a seasonal  price increase and its stabilization is expected with a better  supply of these goods in markets in the weeks to come, Rankovic  said. The retail prices dropped 6.7 per cent in May and 0.4 per  cent in April. The living costs were 0.9 per cent down on April,  although the food costs, which largely influence them, increased  3.6 per cent. However, this was counterbalanced by a 4.2 per  cent decline in the prices of clothes and manufactured goods.    Rankovic did not want to make any estimates regarding the  inflation rate in the months to come, but she confirmed that the  weekly monitoring of prices showed that food prices are  stabilizing and that there is a further decline in the prices of  manufactured goods. In late January, when the record-high  inflation rate of 313 per cent per month was registered, the  Yugoslav Government began the implementation of the programme of  monetary reconstruction and economic recovery. The new economic  measures have curbed the growth of price and recovered  production, which was on the verge of a breakdown because of the  international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in late May 1992.</p>

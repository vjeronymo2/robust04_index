			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GREECE;  </P> <P> EX-PRIME MINISTER ELECTED HEAD OF STATE  </P> <P> The Greek Parliament elected elder statesman Constantine Caramanlis as the  fifth head of state since democracy was restored in 1974 after a military  dictatorship.  </P> <P> Caramanlis, 83, a six-time prime minister and former president, won 153 votes  of the 299 cast. He needed a simple majority to be elected to a five-year term  in the largely ceremonial post of president. In the first round of voting  Monday, he fell short of the required 180 votes. Caramanlis was Greece's first  prime minister after a 1967-74 military dictatorship, overseeing the return to  democracy and establishing the presidency after holding a referendum that  abolished the monarchy.  </P></p>

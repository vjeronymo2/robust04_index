Nevertheless, the NATO  summit two weeks ago has set decisive signals with its  Partnership for Peace initiative, Ruehe said at a security  policy conference in Berlin on Monday [24 January]. [passage  omitted]    Polish Deputy Defense Minister Jerzy Milewski demanded a  "political shield" for his country against external threats.  The agreed Partnership for Peace was "good for tomorrow, but  not good enough for today." The existing threat was less of a  military than of a political nature, and had arisen after the  fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the old Soviet  Union. Hence, Poland was also seeking less military than  political support. Integrating his country into NATO would, in  Milewski's view, not in any way be directed against Russia.  With reference to Moscow's fears of encirclement, he said it  was impossible to see how Moscow's security depended on Poland  or Estonia. [passage omitted]</p>

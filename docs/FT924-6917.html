			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / France seeks new Bosnia conference FRANCE said yesterday it was seeking another international conference at foreign minister level to give fresh impetus to moves to solve the crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The meeting would involve all the parties to last August's international peace conference on Yugoslavia in London, notably the 12 European Community countries, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, as well as all the former Yugoslav republics and neighbouring countries. The initiative, which is being worked out in co-operation with Italy, is intended to complement, not to compete with the work of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the Geneva peace talks on Yugoslavia, a French foreign ministry spokesman said yesterday. The spokesman listed the issues which the French government wanted the conference to address as minority rights, the division of Bosnia into regions, the containment of military clashes, the eventual demilitarisation of the republic, and the possibility of a widening of the UN's role beyond peacekeeping. A group of six prominent former world leaders, including two US ex-presidents and a former British prime minister, yesterday called for urgent international action to find a solution to the Bosnian problem and to provide assistance to Bosnian refugees. In a joint statement, the leaders said the world was witnessing in Bosnia 'a replay of one of the darkest eras of modern history: the invasion of one sovereign nation by another. It is the attempted genocide of people who have lived in peace and tolerance with their neighbours for centuries.' The declaration was signed by former US Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, Baroness Margaret Thatcher, Mrs Jeane Kirkpatrick, former US ambassador to the UN, General Alexander Haig, former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and US Secretary of State, and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, former UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>

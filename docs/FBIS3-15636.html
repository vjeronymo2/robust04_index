The situation in the republic continues to deteriorate and  has approached a state of crisis. The growth of crime, which is  threatening the formation and development of our young republic,  is particularly disturbing. The negative impact of the shadow  economy is increasing, discipline and order are declining,  organized crime is growing everywhere, and firearms are being  used for criminal purposes increasingly often. An emergency  situation, which demands the adoption of radical measures, has  taken shape in Crimea.    All this is keeping the republic on edge, evoking people's  alarm and disquiet, creating an atmosphere of unmanageability,  and engendering irresponsibility and an impermissibly airy,  nihilistic attitude toward the laws and state discipline.    Questions of ensuring elementary order based on conscious  discipline are taking precedence today in order that everyone  might have confidence in the present and the future, that there  might be sufficiency, and that people might cease to fear for  themselves and their nearest and dearest. Everyone who performs  his duty conscientiously should be sure that he is under the  protection of the law and the president.    Today I appeal to you, my electorate. Your assistance in  desisting from ill-considered political steps and unreasoned  actions, which could destabilize the situation even more. Your  assistance in helping the law enforcement authorities and in  creating volunteer formations to safeguard public order and put  a stop to law-breaking, primarily at the place of residence and  employment.    The current dangerous crime situation cannot be altered  without there having been a fundamental change in the attitude  of the outfits of enterprises, the population of cites,  settlements, and villages, and of the entire community toward  this matter, which is of vital importance to all. A system of  measures of moral and material encouragement of the community  for participation in law enforcement activity and the utmost  assistance to it on the part of the law enforcement authorities,  enterprises, and organizations is being created to this end.    It is essential that all citizens with unregistered weapons  immediately turn them in to the internal affairs authorities and  that, if necessary, a decision be made on the question of  whether to register them or not. Measures in accordance with the  Criminal Code of Ukraine will be applied in respect to persons  who possess weapons illegally and who continue to store them.    I appeal to the law enforcement authorities, primarily  militia officers, who are at the forward edge of the fight  against crime. The majority of you are conscientiously  performing your professional duty to the people, worthily  mounting guard of the interests of the state, and protecting the  citizens' rights and liberties.    At the same time, the activity of many internal affairs  authorities does not correspond to the demands made of it. The  struggle against embezzlement, profiteering, hooliganism, and  the increased manifestations of organized crime is failing to  produce the due results. Hundreds of criminals, among whom there  are many who have committed serious crimes, remain at liberty,  which is a stern reproach to the professional honor of the  militia officers.    Unfortunately, complacency and an uncritical attitude toward  the results of their activity are being displayed by some of  them, and rudeness, indifference, and extortion are being  tolerated. We need to emphatically rid ourselves of such  officers and to preserve the purity of the militia ranks.    While displaying attention to and concern for law-abiding  citizens, militia officers must be implacable toward  transgressors. Their actions in respect to law-breakers must be  precise, competent, and legitimate.    Let the criminals know that their every unlawful action will  be emphatically cut short and that, should they resist,  authorized weapons, the right to use which has been broadened  for militia officers as of late, will be used against them.    The president and government of Crimea will, in turn, do  everything necessary to provide the city and district internal  affairs authorities as quickly as possible with motor transport  and other facilities necessary in the work of crime prevention  and detection.    I appeal to the employees of the news media and the corps of  journalists that they develop the all-around and truthful  coverage of problems of the fight against crime, actively  uncover the causes of negative manifestations, and contribute to  the molding in the public of a respect for the law, the enhanced  authority of the employees of the militia, the court, the public  procurator's office, and other law enforcement authorities, and  propagandize the positive experience of the public formations in  the prevention of law- breaking.    The government and law enforcement authorities of Crimea and  the population of the republic have sufficient forces for  cutting short by decisive and firm actions the orgy of crime and  ensuring legality and firm law and order.    Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea    No. 76, 2 March 1994, Simferopol.</p>

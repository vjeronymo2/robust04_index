			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Yeltsin presses on with election plan PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday vowed to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn, even if this meant violating the constitution, in a bid to break the deadlock over political and economic reform. Under the existing Soviet-era constitution which Mr Yeltsin wants to replace, parliament cannot be dissolved until it completes its present term in 1995, or unless the Congress of People's Deputies, the full parliament, amends the constitution accordingly. 'If deputies cannot take the decision, the president will take it for them,' he told a meeting of provincial television executives in Moscow. Any decision to pursue new elections without parliament's consent would be unconstitutional. But Mr Yeltsin and his supporters increasingly feel the benefits of doing so would outweigh the risks. One aide suggested that the most painless way of removing the parliament would be to issue a presidential decree calling new elections after a quick plebiscite to show public support for the idea. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the parliament, dismissed Mr Yeltsin's statement as a groundless threat. 'There are threats which send shivers down people's spines,' Mr Khasbulatov said in a live television broadcast billed as an address to the people of Russia yesterday. 'In these conditions, do not be alarmed, we will protect you using the force of laws and the constitution.' Mr Vladimir Isakov, parliamentary vice-chairman, said any bid to bypass parliament on elections would be Mr Yeltsin's 'swan song'. 'Yet again he is ignoring the will of the people and taking the path of a coup d'etat,' he told Postfactum news agency. Despite being elected under the old Soviet regime and resisting radical reforms, most deputies claim to be defending democracy, while trying to hang on to their seats. Mr Yeltsin, fearful of creating a precedent for unconstitutional acts, has so far sought to pressure parliament into dissolving itself to make way for a new parliament more suited to a nascent, post-communist market economy. As he spoke yesterday, the Supreme Soviet, or standing parliament, also raised the heat in the fight with the president. It adopted a draft law which, if approved by a Congress session now scheduled for November, would give it ultimate decision-making on the government's composition. Last month, it attempted to block the mass privatisation programme and passed a budget with a huge deficit, which Mr Yeltsin said yesterday was designed to destroy Russia's financial system. Continuing a counter-attack on economic policy, he announced he had instructed the government to stick to the budget rejected by parliament. 'Under no circumstances will I sign this budget law,' he said. 'If implemented it would mean the collapse of the Russian currency system, the destruction of the rouble and the undermining of Russian statehood.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The new representative of the Ukrainian president in  the Crimea Valeriy Gorbatov believes that "the mission of good  will" and the work aimed "at prevention of any hearths of  tension in our difficult time" are the main goals of his future  activity. In his interview with the agency Interfax-Ukraine on  Saturday he expressed hope that he would be able to help to the  peoples of the Crimea and Ukraine "to become closer."    Valeriy Gorbatov, aged 39, was appointed to the post of the  Ukrainian president's envoy in the Crimea on March 31. On March  27 he was elected deputy of Ukraine's Supreme Soviet from the  Crimea. Until that time he was head of the agricultural firm  named after N. Krupskaya in the Crimea's Nizhegorsk region.    In Gorbatov's words, he intends to build his relations with  the Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov "on friendly terms because  we do the same thing."    "If he needs my experience and knowledge to implement the  Crimea's economic policy I would not refuse from my  participation," declared Gorbatov. At the same time he  underlined that there are "enough clever and intelligent people"  who are working in the Crimean government now.</p>

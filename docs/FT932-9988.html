			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cambior sees rise in gold output CAMBIOR, the international gold producer, estimates its output will rise 75 per cent to 620,000 ounces this year, with its new Omai project in Guyana on stream. Mr Louis Gignac, president, said gold would remain the Canadian group's top priority and estimated an average price of USDollars 360 per ounce for the rest of 1993. The company would also, however, be diversifying into base metals. Cambior, which is also a major producer of niobium, used in steel production, is spending CDollars 17m (USDollars 13.4m) on gold and base metals exploration this year, half in North America and half in Mexico and Chile. First-quarter profit amounted to CDollars 876,000 or 2 cents a share, down from CDollars 3.9m or 13 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 75m against CDollars 44m. Gold output rose 29 per cent to 107,000 ounces. Mr Gignac said profits would revive in the rest of 1993 as operating costs declined and gold prices stabilised.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Metro Radio doubles to Pounds 1.65m Strong turnover growth and control of operating costs helped Metro Radio Group, the USM-quoted radio station operator, report pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 797,000 to Pounds 1.65m for the six months to end-March. The outcome was struck on turnover up by 26 per cent from Pounds 8m to Pounds 10.1m. The interim dividend, which is raised from 1.5p to 2.25p, is covered nearly three times by earnings per share of 6.48p (3.13p). Advertising revenues were up 39 per cent nationally, and 27 per cent overall. The company attributed this to greater economic confidence and radio's growing credibility as an advertising medium. The company said the second half had begun strongly and it expected the full year to show significant growth. However, because national advertising revenue began improving in last year's second half, directors said it would be unrealistic to expect the full year to show such large percentage rises as the interim results. Cashflow resulting from the growth in profitability in recent months has enabled the group to reduce its medium term loan from Pounds 1.9m at end-September 1993 to Pounds 1m at March 31. A further Pounds 500,000 will be repaid on May 31 and Mr John Josephs, managing director, said he expected the company would have no borrowings by the year end. Metro, which operates seven independent radio stations in north-east England and Yorkshire, said it intends bidding for one of the two new London FM licences.</p>

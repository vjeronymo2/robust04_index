			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Home price drop 'steepest since 1990' The biggest monthly fall in house prices for almost four years occurred last month according to figures published yesterday by Nationwide, the second-largest building society. The average price of a home declined by 2.9 per cent to Pounds 53,918 last month compared with August. This represented the biggest monthly fall since prices dropped 3.7 per cent in October 1990, said the society. Monthly movements in house prices have fluctuated wildly this year as confidence among buyers has remained fragile. Prices in July and August rose 1.8 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively following a 0.7 per cent decline in June, according to Nationwide. The underlying movement has generally been flat, said the society, adding: 'House prices now look likely to end the year little changed from 1993, although experience will vary widely according to local conditions.' Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, is expected to confirm this trend when it publishes its monthly house price index tomorrow. Halifax's survey is likely to show very little movement in prices between August and September. Neither society expects to see much change in a generally subdued housing market as a result of the rise last month in interest rates of half a percentage point. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide chief executive, said: 'The recent relatively small rise in interest rates should have no material effect on house sales. 'We continue to expect a renewed strengthening of the market based on still excellent affordability and the wider economic recovery.' He added that the decline last month was due partly to 'a correction following a rise over the previous two months'. Mr Davis added: 'As we have said consistently, a single month's figures need to be seen in context. It leaves the overall trend of stability in prices this year broadly unchanged.' According to Nationwide, house prices on average rose by 1.4 per cent during the 12 months to September. Halifax is expected to show a very slight decline in prices over the same period.</p>

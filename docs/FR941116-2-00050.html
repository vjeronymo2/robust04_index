The hotline provides the public with access to the most current information on FDA advisory committee meetings. The advisory committee hotline, which will disseminate current information and information updates, can be accessed by dialing 1&hyph;800&hyph;741&hyph;8138 or 301&hyph;443&hyph;0572. Each advisory committee is assigned a 5-digit number. This 5-digit number will appear in each individual notice of meeting. The hotline will enable the public to obtain information about a particular advisory committee by using the committee's 5-digit number. Information in the hotline is preliminary and may change before a meeting is actually held. The hotline will be updated when such changes are made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> MEETINGS: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The following advisory committee meetings are announced:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date, time, and place. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  December 1, 1994, 9 a.m., and December 2, 1994, 8:30 a.m., Parklawn Bldg., conference rms.

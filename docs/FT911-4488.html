			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Property Market: Rise in yields has gone too far THE property market 'offers an opportunity not seen since the late 1950s', says James Capel, the broker, in a recent investment strategy report, writes Vanessa Houlder. The crux of its argument is that the record-breaking rise in yields has gone too far. 'Yields on anything but the very limited number of prime properties are so high that, for a small injection of equity, the investor has positive cash flow,' it says. Property is now cheaply priced not only compared with its own historic pattern, but against other asset classes, it adds. Relative property, bond and equity yields, the relative growth of rents and dividends, and the relative volatility of property since the late 1970s are cited as evidence. Admittedly, rents are now falling, which means that the rents paid by tenants are higher than those obtainable on the open market. The recession could create a series of tenant defaults. But the Capel report suggests yields have over-compensated for this risk. 'A buyer of a portfolio of retail property yielding 10 per cent could suffer nearly 50 per cent defaults and be unable to re-let before breaching the mean yield of the last 14 years,' it says. These arguments carry weight and indeed, there is a rough consensus in the industry that yields have gone out far enough. The problem for would-be buyers is lack of good-quality, high-yielding property on the market, as sellers have held back in the hope that yields would improve. Nonetheless, it is questionable if property values will ever revert to their historical patterns. At a seminar organised by County NatWest this week, speakers argued that the industry - with the exception of the industrial sector - is undergoing a sea-change. Mr Russell Schiller of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors, said the retail sector was experiencing fundamental changes, because of the growth of out-of-town retail parks. Shoppers were rebelling against the tedium of the high street - pointing to poor rental prospects in the town centres, which account for most of the institutions' retail assets. Mr Geoff Marsh of APR, which specialises in office research, said the oversupply that followed planning deregulation in the 1980s meant the 1990s could be a decade of dereliction. 'The numbers are heavily on the side of the occupier,' he said. 'It is not just another cycle. It is a new game.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Suman Chattopadhya] </F>   [Text] Dhaka, 29 December -- It is not known how the  Indian commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, currently  visiting Bangladesh will describe his experiences in Dhaka to  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. During his two-day visit to Dhaka  to attend the Joint Economic Commission [JEC] meeting it has  become clear to Mr. Mukherjee that Bangladesh is not willing to  reach any understanding with India on any issue unless the  problem relating to the sharing of the waters of the River  Ganges is resolved. At present Dhaka's only appeal to Delhi is  to resolve the water issue. It is not willing to discuss any  other bilateral issues with Delhi until the Ganges water issue  is resolved.    The representatives of Bangladesh did not raise the water  sharing problem during the JEC meeting held in Dhaka as this  issue does not come within the purview of the commission.  However, this issue figured prominently during the talks which  Mr. Mukherjee had with Bangladeshi leaders outside the JEC  meeting. The Ganges water issue came up for discussion and  dominated virtually all of the hour-long meeting which Mr.  Mukherjee had with Prime Minister Khaleda Zia in Dhaka on  December 28. The prime minister requested the Indian minister  to see for himself the damage caused to Bangladesh due to the  nonavailability of the Ganges waters. She urged the Indian  minister to take a personal initiative for a speedy resolution  of this issue. Similar sentiments were voiced by other  Bangladeshi leaders when Mr. Mukherjee called on them.    The problem relating to the sharing of the Ganges waters  with  India is a major issue in the politics of Bangladesh. Because  of it, the ruling party is reluctant to extend its hands of  friendship to India until the problem is resolved. A close aide  of the Bangladesh prime minister has said that if the BNP  [Bangladesh Nationalist Party] Government is unable to reach an  honorable settlement of the water dispute with India before the  next general elections, then the party will have to face bitter  criticism from its opponents. It would be harmful for the BNP  to accept the proposals given by India on other issues before  resolving the water dispute. The next general elections in  Bangladesh will be held after two years.    Due to this unwillingness of the government, none of the  proposals given by India during the JEC meeting, which concluded  in Dhaka on December 29, were accepted by the Bangladesh  delegation. The proposals which were given by Pranab Mukherjee,  who led the Indian delegation to the talks, include: 1) signing  of a border trade agreement to prevent illegal trade; 2) signing  of a motor vehicles agreement to ensure smooth movement of goods  from each other's country by road; 3) the provision of transit  facilities to India for the transportation of goods to its  northeastern states through Bangladesh. Apart from the above  proposals, India also proposed the setting up of two working  groups to resolve various matters relating to trade and use of  the common border. Though extensive discussions were held on  these proposals at the JEC meeting, the Bangladesh side later  declined to accept any of them.    The joint press conference at the end of the JEC meeting was  addressed by the Bangladesh foreign minister, Mustafizur Rahman,  and the leader of the Indian delegation, Pranab Mukherjee. At  this press conference the two sides announced that they had  decided to reduce the trade gap between the two countries. With  this end in view, the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of  India will import 150,000 tons of urea fertilizer from  Bangladesh during the next fiscal year.    It may be mentioned that the relationship between India and  Bangladesh is not likely to improve unless both the countries  decide to change their current stand. It is the undeclared  policy of Bangladesh that it will not negotiate with India on  any issue unless the Ganges water problem is resolved. India's  position is that the relationship between the two countries will  improve after a consensus is reached on various outstanding  issues. Given the prevailing situation, the Indian Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao is likely to visit Dhaka soon. This  visit is likely to take place at the end of January or early  February.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] The rift between Britain and China over the issuing  of new passports for Hong Kong people looks set to deepen, with  Beijing reluctant to lobby other countries for easier visa  arrangements.    The Hong Kong government has proposed that China lobby more  than 70 countries for the permanent abolition of visa  requirements for holders of the Hong Kong British National  (Overseas) (BNO) passport and the future Special Administrative  Region (SAR) travel document.    But a senior government official has revealed that Beijing  has shown reluctance to hold talks with other governments on the  issue. Beijing has yet to discuss SAR passports, despite  numerous requests for talks on the matter by Britain over the  past 12 months. And approaches by the British government have  been met with silence. But the Hong Kong government fears that  China's indifference to the latest request for co-operation  could result in future difficulties for Hong Kong people.    At present, 71 countries waive visa requirements for BNO  passport holders. However, there is no guarantee that the  arrangement will continue beyond 1997 as Hong Kong people will  be regarded as Chinese nationals and may hold both passports.    "The British side's proposal is based on goodwill, aiming to  secure freedom of travel for the people of Hong Kong, which is  enshrined in the Joint Declaration and essential for Hong Kong's  continuous prosperity in future," said a government official.  However, a Chinese official said Beijing was unlikely to  cooperate with the request because China viewed visa abolition  agreements with foreign governments for SAR passport holders as  an issue to be dealt with exclusively by Hong Kong's future  sovereign power.    China has not yet made any unilateral efforts to hold talks  with foreign governments on recognition of SAR passports or visa  arrangements. But it is understood that Western governments  could categorise the SAR passports in the same manner as normal  passports issued by Beijing.    Among the countries that currently waive entry visas for  short stays for BNO passport holders, only Thailand, South  Africa and Poland have formal written agreements with the Hong  Kong government. Another 10 countries that have visa abolition  agreements do so as an extension of similar agreements with  Britain. It is still not clear whether such agreements will  remain in place after 1997.    The ten countries are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,  Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland, San Marino, Argentina, and  Liechtenstein. The issue will be discussed again at a meeting  of team experts of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the  end of the month, but arrangements will not be made without  Beijing's co-operation.</p>

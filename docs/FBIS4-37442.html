			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, has received an important message  from French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe. Juppe  stressed France's determination to support the Kurdish people in  their fair struggle for democracy and legitimate rights within  the framework of Iraqi national unity and implementing Security  Council Resolution 688, which was originally proposed by France.  He also noted that he now has better understanding of the  Kurdish cause after reading the documents that Talabani  submitted to him during their meeting in Paris in April.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: UN weighs new measures THE United Nations Security Council held urgent consultations yesterday in an atmosphere of deepening crisis as members weighed new measures in response to the Bosnian Serb rejection of the Balkans peace plan. As a first response, the Council was expected to approve a resolution designating Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde and Tuzla 'safe areas' which would be patrolled by UN troops. These would be similar to the operation being conducted by Canadian forces in Srebrenica. However, the Third World countries sponsoring the proposal made it clear that the measure would be inadequate in itself. There were again calls for what one delegate termed 'surgical military intervention' by an international force. Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, who led a Security Council mission to Bosnia last month, speaking in his role as the non-aligned members' spokesman, called the safe areas proposal symbolic and a minimal response to developments in a deeply troubling situation. 'These new elements should force the international community to act in a much more affirmative way,' he said. The use of force was 'looming' because the past inadequacy of UN measures had only encouraged Serbian intransigence. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, and the US were in sharp disagreement last night over who should control an expanded UN military operation that might eventually be authorised by the Council. In a working paper for members, he insisted that political and strategic direction must come from the UN through himself. Washington is demanding that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation be in command. Russia is willing to provide troops but supports Mr Boutros-Ghali on the issue of UN control. France also wants a UN-directed force, not simply one with UN blessing. The working paper calls for up to 70,000 troops, at least 20,000 of whom would be Americans, for the largest ever UN military operation. American Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the Nato commander in southern Europe, has been mentioned as the likely commander. If Mr Boutros-Ghali's proposals prevailed he would report to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian foreign minister, who is the UN special representative, succeeding Mr Vance. Mr Boutros-Ghali last night refused to accept that the Bosnian Serbs had spoken the last word on the peace plan. Negotiations must continue 'to overcome current difficulties', he said in dismissing suggestions that the Vance-Owen proposals were now moribund if not dead.</p>

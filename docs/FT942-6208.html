			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Zapatistas to vote on 'final' peace accord The leaders of Mexico's rebel Zapatista Army of National Liberation say that they have finished consultations on the government's proposed peace agreement and that their supporters will now begin voting on the accord. The rebels began internal consultations after the government proposed a 32-point peace plan at the beginning of March, but these were suspended after the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential candidate, on March 23. They resumed at the end of April. The government promised in its peace offer to redistribute land in the southern state of Chiapas, where the rebels launched their rebellion on New Year's Day, and implement potentially far-reaching judicial and social reforms in the state. It also said it would give increased protection and rights for the Indian population. Although the agreement did not directly meet the rebel demand for national democratic reforms, such concerns were simultaneously negotiated with opposition parties. While the Zapatistas are not expected to break a ceasefire in place since early January, most observers doubt they will accept the peace offer without conditions. Rebel leaders have been suspicious of the government's willingness to implement the accord, and have previously indicated they will not approve an agreement at least until this August's presidential election, as a way of maintaining pressure on the government to hold fair elections. The vote on the agreement by rebel supporters will take place in the region of southern Chiapas under Zapatista control. It is expected that the voting process will take some time, and no date has been fixed for a final result. The Zapatistas claimed that the vote would be 'free and democratic' but have now closed the territory under their control to the press and outside observers. Democratic Congressman Robert Torricelli says he sees no quick end to the uprising in Chiapas and warned it could spread, Reuter reports from Mexico City. The New Jersey representative said on Monday the problems of poverty and corruption that produced the uprising in Chiapas existed elsewhere in Mexico and this could lead to more violence.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farmers expected to break seed limit FRENCH FARMERS are likely to have exceeded their grain, oilseed and proteinseed area limit and be forced to set aside an even larger portion of their land next season, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We're probably heading towards an excess, although it's difficult to know for sure,' an agriculture ministry official said. Definitive figures are expected in early August when farmers' applications for European Community direct aid payments are registered. According to ministry projections, France is likely to have exceeded by 322,000-483,000 hectares its 1989-91 reference area of 13.522m hectares, which was set as a limit under the EC's new farm system. EC members decided last May to shift the focus of their Common Agricultural Policy from price support to direct aid to farmers in an effort to cut their huge surpluses of food. The grain, oilseed and protein-seed excess is likely to be made even worse next season as more farmers choose to join the scheme. Only 539,000 farmers sent their applications for direct aid instead of the 745,000 expected, an official said.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadier dollar, bond rally end equity slide Wall Street US stocks ended a three-day slide yesterday as the dollar steadied and the bond market rallied, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.80 firmer at 3,724.77, after dropping more than 103 points since last Friday morning. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.75 better at 453.09. New York SE turnover was a moderate 251m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite recouped 1.35 at 433.22 and the Nasdaq composite, battered in the previous session amid a sell-off in computer-related issues, recovered 3.95 to 712.74. The dollar again set the direction for stocks. Yesterday the tone was positive, as the US currency steadied, finishing New York trading at Y101 a day after dropping below the Y100 mark for the first time since World War II. The bond market, concerned about the likelihood of an early move to higher interest rates, was relieved, and Treasuries rallied after a long drop. Meanwhile, investors cast an eye towards Capitol Hill to glean hints about monetary policy from Mr Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony. Although the Federal Reserve chairman revealed little, his appearance had a reassuring effect. His appearance coincided with the release of the Fed's Beige Book summary of economic conditions, which found a moderation in growth and no reason to be concerned about inflation. However, a profits warning issued by Sun, the energy group, called attention again to the impact of higher rates on corporate earnings. After the energy group said it expected to break even in the second quarter, its share price was marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 . Tesoro Petroleum made a rare appearance on the New York SE's most active list after filing for an offering of 5.35m new common shares priced at Dollars 10 3/8 . The stock added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 11 3/8 in heavy volume. The previous session's three big losers stabilised yesterday. Caterpillar gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 102 5/8 after falling Dollars 4 1/4 a day earlier. But SG Warburg downgraded the issue, citing risks related to a strike by the United Auto Workers. Ouaker Oats crawled Dollars  5/8 lower to Dollars 72 5/8 . Its share price went into a Dollars 8 1/4 tailspin after Nestle deflated investors' hopes that it would launch a takeover bid for the food group. Lotus Development, whose profits warning had prompted Tuesday's flight from technology issues, dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8 , adding to a 28 per cent decline in the previous session. However, relative calm returned to the sector, and several leading stocks rebounded smartly. On the Big Board, Compaq climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33, Micron Technology recovered Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 and IBM put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 62. Silicon Graphics gained Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 21 3/4 after announcing the formation of a product development venture with AT&amp;T Network Systems.</p>

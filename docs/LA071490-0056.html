			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NO BUDGET MEANS NO PAYCHECKS  </P> <P> The state budget impasse continued to hit home in Ventura County on Friday as  paychecks were withheld from 110 local Caltrans workers and from about 40  employees of area legislators.  </P> <P> Unlike the rest of the state work force, Caltrans maintenance employees and  those who work for lawmakers are paid twice a month, so their mid-July checks  were held up by the stalemate over a new budget.  </P> <P> Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain split over how much to cut programs  and increase taxes to balance a $50-billion budget even though the legal  deadline for approval was June 30. Of all state employees, the state  Constitution allows only elected officials to be paid without a budget.  </P> <P> At the Ventura road maintenance yard on Friday, workers grumbled as their  payday came and went without a check, Caltrans Regional Manager Bruce Dyar  said.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of employees living from payday to payday, so some of them are  going to be hurt," Dyar said. "I was just told about a couple getting ready to  leave on vacation this weekend and had to cancel."  </P> <P> Dyar, whose workers patch roads and tend the plants along rights of way, said  he had seen no slowdown by employees. "I've heard some unhappy talk, but they  seem to be going ahead with their work the same as usual," he said.  </P> <P> Along a roadside in Moorpark, where a California Department of Transportation  crew was routing traffic around an overturned diesel rig Friday afternoon,  worker Martin Sanchez discussed the Legislature's inability to approve a  budget.  </P> <P> "I think it stinks," he said. Sanchez said he was expecting a $900 check Friday  morning, but instead was told to go to work in 95-degree heat without his pay.  "What are you going to tell the mortgage company when they ask for their  money?" said Sanchez, as he waved traffic past the accident.  </P> <P> Sanchez's co-worker Joe Arnold said lawmakers "are playing political games with  the people's money." Arnold, a 22-year state worker, said he was unable to make  his $2,000 monthly house payment this week because he did not receive $1,200 in  pay as expected.  </P> <P> Dyar and his workers were especially critical of the Legislature adjourning for  the weekend without resolving its differences on the budget and forwarding a  spending plan to Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "If the legislative people went home today . . . that's one of the sorriest  things they could have done," Dyar said. Most of his workers gross $1,500 to  $1,700 a month and need to get their checks on time, he said.  </P> <P> Employees at state lawmakers' offices in the county seemed to accept the  impasse in better spirits.  </P> <P> "As long as we receive some type of paycheck by the first of August, there's  really no need for us to panic," said John Theiss, 29, an aide to Assemblywoman  Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). Theiss is single and earns about $28,000 a year.  </P> <P> Yet, he said, he talked to Wright about the problem on Thursday.  </P> <P> "I told her not to come home unless she had our paychecks," Theiss said. "She  said, 'I think you're going to have to wait.' "  </P> <P> Wright, who came home anyway, said the delay is a shame and dared not predict  when a new budget will be approved.  </P> <P> "It's the leadership," she said, explaining why negotiations did not begin in  earnest until after July 1. "It's a case of who blinks first, and neither side  has blinked yet."  </P> <P> But constituents are blinking, said aides in state Sen. Gary K. Hart's Ventura  office and in Assemblyman Jack O'Connell's Oxnard office. Both offices have  received calls from many people concerned about the delays and possible cuts in  programs, the aides said.  </P> <P> "Certainly we take this as part of the job," said Jeff Bowling, an O'Connell  representative. "But it doesn't affect us nearly as much as people cut off from  Medi-Cal and other types of assistance."  </P> <P> The poor in Ventura County continue to receive most services provided under  state programs, such as medical assistance and welfare payments. But had it not  been for county approval of an emergency $2.4-million loan on Tuesday, 8,000  welfare families would not have received their mid-July checks.  </P> <P> Hardest hit locally have been hundreds of low-income workers who care for about  1,350 disabled and elderly people in their homes. Those workers -- often family  or friends of the disabled -- have gone without pay for two weeks.  </P> <P> County social workers say the workers' calls for assistance are becoming  increasingly desperate. Shirley Bush, head of the in-home services program,  said her offices are getting about 150 phone calls a day from the workers.  </P> <P> "The frustrated phone calls are still coming in," Bush said. "We're not able to  give them a time line. They tell their landlords that the money's coming, but  they can't say when. And neither can we."  </P> <P> Making the wait worse, Bush said, is the knowledge that when a budget is  finally adopted, it almost certainly will include some cuts in the in-home  program.  </P> <P> "We have people," Bush said, "who live worse than some dogs, and nobody seems  to want to help them. Until it affects you personally, I don't think you  realize the degree to which these people are hurting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RELATED STORY: A29  </P></p>

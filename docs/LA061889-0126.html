			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCRD REFUSED TO BOLT DOWN SODA MACHINES;  </P> <P> MARINE KILLED 8 MONTHS AFTER BOTTLER WAS DENIED ACCESS TO RECRUIT DEPOT  </P> <P> A soft-drink machine that toppled onto and killed a 19-year-old Marine in San  Diego last July was not bolted down because mid-level officials at the Marine  Corps Recruit Depot had refused eight months earlier to do so, The Times has  learned from documents obtained through the U. S. Freedom of Information Act.  </P> <P> Although an investigative report appears to lay blame for the accident on the  victim, who had been drinking, the report also shows that officials at the base  were aware for nearly two years before the fatality that Marines were tipping  the vending machines.  </P> <P> Two vending machine tip-overs injured Marines at the depot in 1986, and a year  later the Navy began bolting down its machines nationwide. Navy and Marine  publications during that time also carried warnings about the problem.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the recruit depot's safety committee discussed and then set aside  the idea of bolting down the machines in November, 1986, because of concern  about damaging the 1920s-era buildings at the base, the investigation by Marine  1st Lt. Mark J. Griffith concluded.  </P> <P> Then, in late 1987, eight months before the fatal accident, "an unknown  individual or individuals" refused to allow workers from the vending company to  bolt down the machines, Griffith's report says.  </P> <P> Representatives of Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of San Diego were turned away  "because of the fact that the historical value of the buildings prevented them  from anchoring any type of permanent bolts or studs into the floor or to the  walls," according to a statement to the investigator by Lt. John T. Wolfe,  assistant merchandise manager for the Marine Corps exchange system at the MCRD.  </P> <P> The decision was made despite the fact that the buildings' interiors have been  updated into offices with carpets, ceiling tiles and other changes since their  construction in 1921.  </P> <P> Griffith said in his report that the lengthy interval since the denial  prevented him from determining who was responsible for the decision not to bolt  the machines. Disciplinary action was "neither warranted nor contemplated," he  wrote.  </P> <P> However, even a week after the fatal accident, permission to bolt the machines  was again denied by the depot's facilities division, and was granted only after  the commanding general was notified of the denial by investigators, said Maj.  Jerry Broeckert, public affairs officer at the depot.  </P> <P> On July 31, 1988, nearly two years after the base safety committee first  rejected the idea of securing the machines, Pvt. Michael R. Carlson lay  groaning beneath a half-ton soft-drink machine in an MCRD recreation room. The  machine had fallen onto him after he tipped it forward to coax out a soft-drink  can.  </P> <P> Carlson died on the operating table two hours later at the Navy Hospital in San  Diego. Liver lacerations caused massive internal bleeding, according to the  accident investigation.  </P> <P> The accident added Carlson to the list of people, many of them in the military,  who have been crushed by falling machines during the past several years. A U.  S. Army physician reported 47 accidents, 11 of them fatal, on overseas bases  since 1985. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission knew  of seven fatalities and 10 injuries by April, 1988, but it regards the figures  as incomplete.  </P> <P> Teen-agers and college students are other likely victims. A year ago, a  15-year-old boy suffered two broken legs when a machine fell on him at Palomar  Community College.  </P> <P> The commission announced in April that Vendo Corp. of Fresno had agreed to  modify the model of soft-drink machines whose design appeared to have  contributed to the spate of accidents. In February, the secretary of the Navy  ordered that by the end of the month all soft-drink machines on Navy property  would have to be secured to prevent tipping.  </P> <P> Even before that order, however, the Navy and the Marines were aware of the  nationwide problem.  </P> <P> The Navy Safety Center warned of the problem in a 1986 publication. In  November, 1987, the San Diego naval command sent out a notice that, because of  similar incidents at military bases nationwide, the Navy Exchange Service had  ordered all its soda machines secured. The exchange service manages food and  other retail services for the Navy, but not the Marines.  </P> <P> The investigation of Carlson's death emphasizes that the November message about  securing the machines came from Commander Naval Base San Diego, whose messages  are "not controlling over the Marine Corps Recruit Depot." The Marine Corps is  under a separate command structure from the rest of the Navy.  </P> <P> The message was received by the commanding general's office at the MCRD and was  treated as an information message and sent on to all commanders and staff  members, said Broeckert, the depot's public affairs officer.  </P> <P> Asked why no action was taken to solve a known safety problem, Broeckert said,  "A lot of times it takes a tragedy before something happens."  </P> <P> He denied that the communique's underlying concerns were ignored because the  message was not binding on the Marines, or that there was a lack of urgency  concerning the problem.  </P> <P> "We teach two things from the beginning: accomplishment of the mission and  safety of the troops," Broeckert said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, when the contractor that supplies soda machines for both San  Diego Navy bases and the MCRD tried to address the safety problem, it got  nowhere. Using the San Diego naval commander's order as authorization, Pepsi  Cola Bottling Co. sent workers to the recruit depot in late November or early  December, 1987, to secure the machines, according to the investigation report.  </P> <P> The workers were turned away by unidentified Marine officials because of  concerns about damaging the buildings' historical value, the report says.  </P> <P> Broeckert said that, while it is now apparent that property damage was being  given too much weight over safety, base officials were merely trying to protect  federal property. He compared it to how a homeowner might react if the supplier  of a home water cooler suddenly showed up with a drill ready to fasten the  cooler to the kitchen floor.  </P> <P> "You'd probably ask some questions. That's probably the process that went on  here," Broeckert said. "Obviously, that wasn't the right answer, because since  then we did it . . . based on safety concerns."  </P> <P> The original buildings at the MCRD were built in 1921 and designed in Spanish  colonial style by the same architect, Bertram Goodhue, who designed many of the  distinctive buildings in Balboa Park, said George Kordela, curator of the MCRD  Command Museum.  </P> <P> They were followed by a World War II building boom of less significant  structures, and then others, he said. But in many cases, an effort was made to  match the style of the original, giving the depot's mustard-color buildings a  distinctive, unified look of red tile roofs, decorative arches and stone  adornments.  </P> <P> Federal law requires military installations to consult with state authorities  whenever they plan modifications affecting the historic characteristics of a  building, said Dorene Clement, a state historian who works with that program in  California. However, if a building's interior already has been extensively  changed, further changes there are not considered to affect its historical  characteristics, she said.  </P> <P> Within two weeks of the accident that killed Carlson, Pepsi Cola renewed its  offer to bolt down the machines at the MCRD, the investigation found. "The  offer from Pepsi Cola to secure its machines to the decks and/or bulkheads  should be accepted," the report says.  </P> <P> After yet another denial of permission by the facilities division, all machines  were bolted down within two months of Carlson's death, Broeckert said. The  bolting was done at the order of the commanding general at the time, Maj. Gen.  Donald Fulham, he said.  </P> <P> The investigative report's account of Carlson's accident paints a picture of a  troubled, homesick young Marine who was within a month of being discharged from  the service because of adjustment problems.  </P> <P> Witnesses said Carlson, of Ishpeming, Mich., drank too much at a Camp Pendleton  beach picnic the Sunday he was killed. Other Marines had to put him into his  bunk after the group arrived back at MCRD about 7:30 p.m., the investigative  report says.  </P> <P> Carlson napped for about an hour, then asked a friend to go with him to the  depot's bowling alley to get a pack of cigarettes.  </P> <P> That was the last anyone saw of Carlson until a loud crash awoke Pfc. John G.  Zilbert as he lay sleeping on a couch in the Building 2 West recreation room.  It was about 8:40 p.m., and Zilbert saw that the soft-drink machine had toppled  over.  </P> <P> Zilbert and two Marines who were passing by the room rushed over to help.  </P> <P> "I jumped up and turned around, and saw someone had apparently pulled the Pepsi  machine over and it had landed on top of him," Zilbert told the Navy's  investigator. " . . . I could see his chest, approximately from his shoulders  up, that was not under the machine. He was saying he couldn't breathe, for us  to get it, the machine, off, that he was hurting, and that it, the machine,  took his money. He repeated that several times while we were lifting the  machine off of him and while we . . . were waiting for the ambulance."  </P> <P> Thirty minutes later, Carlson was at the Navy Hospital in Balboa Park, still  conscious and talking but complaining of severe abdominal pain, witnesses said.  Within minutes, however, doctors had to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation and  give him seven pints of blood because of internal bleeding.  </P> <P> He was taken to the operating room 48 minutes after arriving at the hospital,  and died there 36 minutes later.  </P> <P> Before the accident, it had become common knowledge at the depot that, if the  machines were tipped and rocked, one could receive a soft drink without paying,  Marines at the depot told the accident investigator. This was also used as a  solution when coins were inserted but the machine failed to dispense a soda.  </P> <P> It was that trait of 111,000 Vendo machines made between 1982 and 1985 that led  to the Consumer Product Safety Commission action in April. Nationwide, the  machines are to be equipped internally with a plastic device that makes free  sodas impossible. Warning stickers are also to be placed on the outside of the  machines. At the MCRD, all machines are bolted to the floor, but they bear no  safety stickers.  </P> <P> At the time of the accident, some doctors within San Diego County's system of  trauma hospitals expressed concern that Carlson's life could have been saved if  he had been taken to a civilian trauma hospital for specialized emergency care.  Trauma centers at UC San Diego Medical Center and Mercy Hospital and Medical  Center are closer to the Marine depot than the Navy hospital.  </P> <P> However, Carlson's injuries were so severe that he would have had only a  slightly better chance of survival at a trauma center, said Dr. Steven  Shackford, trauma center director at UCSD Medical Center. Shackford, a former  Navy surgeon, said he had reviewed the medical details of the Carlson case at  the Navy's request.  </P> <P> Currently, San Diego military personnel who have sustained traumatic injuries  go to the Navy Hospital, unless the accidents occur off base. However, Marines  who are seriously injured at Camp Pendleton frequently are airlifted to San  Diego trauma units instead of the Navy Hospital, Shackford said.  </P></p>

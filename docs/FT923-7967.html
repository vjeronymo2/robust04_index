			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Glynwed half-year profits rise 48%: Buoyant result contrasts with lower trend among other engineering groups GLYNWED International, the diversified UK engineering group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in half-year pre-tax profits and a clear indication that dividends will not be cut. The result contrasted with the trend of lower earnings among other industrial groups in the West Midlands, the traditional heart of the UK engineering industry. Glynwed's share price rose 13p to 196p on the results, valuing the group at more than Pounds 400m. Glynwed's pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.4m in the first six months of 1992 were 48 per cent higher than in the 1991 first half. This translated into earnings per share of 4.96p, compared with 3.65p this time last year. The rise in Glynwed's fortunes owed more to cost-cutting and reductions in its interest charges than to demand for its products in recession-hit Britain, where it does 70 per cent of its business. The stock market had feared that Glynwed would cut its interim dividend. In fact, for the fourth successive year, Glynwed held it at 4.15p. Mr Gareth Davies, chairman, said Glynwed would earn enough this year not to have to follow last year's experience of dipping into reserves to keep up payments to shareholders. 'We should be able to cover the dividend,' said Mr Davies. This implied that, again as in the past three years, the final dividend would be 11.65p. He said that in order to cover the dividend Glynwed would need to earn Pounds 36m in annual pre-tax profits. 'Profits will be well ahead of those for 1991,' he added. However, output of Glynwed's consumer and building products, its plastics, copper tubing, engineering steels and metals services were at best flat and sometimes lower than in the 1991 first half. 'We have no expectation of anything other than slow recovery,' said Mr Davies. Turnover during the 1992 first half, at Pounds 458.5m, was Pounds 47.5m less than in the same period last year, although that is partly explained by the sale of three businesses. However, the sale of these business reduced borrowings by Pounds 12m. This, and the reduction of capacity to match expected low demand, led to a small increase in the operating profit to Pounds 21.5m from Pounds 20m. Further financial gains from lower costs and higher productivity are expected to show in the second-half. Details, Page 14</p>

Hata told a regularly scheduled news conference that Japan  will continue using various channels to persuade North Korea to  allow iaea experts to perform complete inspections at key  nuclear sites.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is expected to encourage  China to urge Pyongyang to accept full international inspections  during a visit to Beijing over the weekend. China is regarded  as having more sway over North Korea than any other country.    Speaking to members of his cabinet, Hosokawa said he expects  to see various developments over the next week amid a flurry of  regional diplomacy, according to government officials.    "I will be visiting China, and South Korean President Kim  Yong- sam will visit Japan and China," he said.    On Monday, the IAEA is to hold a special meeting of its  board  of governors to formally assess its inspections of North Korea's  nuclear facilities.    If the IAEA meeting declares North Korea in breach of  nuclear  safeguard accords, the matter would be referred to the UN  Security Council, which might impose economic sanctions on  Pyongyang.    The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog said earlier this week  that Pyongyang barred a team of its inspectors from carrying out  "important measures" at a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon,  which the IAEA regards as a nuclear reprocessing plant.    Western countries have long been suspicious that North Korea  is developing nuclear weapons. Pyongyang denies the allegations.</p>

Oliviu Gherman, chairman of PDSR,  reiterated in that context the program-like principles  (observance of the Constitution, of the republic as form of  government, and of the non-enforcement of the restitutio in  integrum principle,) which the PDSR means to be truthful to.  The role of the recent meetings at Cotroceni, Ioan Solcanu  stressed, is to gather a picture of the political, economic, and  social situation as seen by the other parliamentary parties.  PDSR, Solcanu added, will not give up the portfolios of defense  and national security, foreign affairs, and the interior if a  mixed government is formed.    Ion Solcanu admitted that the people's living standard  declined over this year of PDSR rule, which was the reason of  erosion of the government's popularity and credibility. At the  same time, he said that although the government took a string of  unpopular measures, engaged by the previous governments and  imposed "by the seriousness with which it approached the  continuation of the process of reform, it however neglected its  own public image." He considered it necessary that the  government should be given between 30 and 60 minutes a week on  the air with the national television, in order to be able to  correctly inform the population.</p>

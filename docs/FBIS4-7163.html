			<p>BFN     [Text] Burmese authorities agreed yesterday to free 30  Thais from Rangoon's notorious In Sein prison, following two  days of top level border discussions, First Army Region Lt Gen  [Lieutenant General] Chettha Thanacharo said yesterday.    The prisoners, whose sentences ranged from 10 to 15 years,  are to be released unconditionally and immediately, he told  reporters.    There are some 350 Thais in In Sein, most of them fishermen  and loggers caught in Burmese territory, according to the Thai  Ambassador to Rangoon, Wirasak Futrakun.    Chettha was close-mouthed on progress on other issues during  the Thailand-Burma Regional Border Committee meeting, which  finished in Bangkok yesterday.    But he said Burmese officials showed a "good attitude  towards  solving border disputes through official channels and that  prisoners of both countries would be treated humanely."    Chettha added that Major General Khet Sein, who is heading  the Burmese delegation to Bangkok, also agreed to look into the  case of nine Thai fishing trawlers which went missing recently  in the Andaman Sea and showed up later in Rangoon.</p>

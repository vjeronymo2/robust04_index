			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Life on the Rialto - Common Markets THERE WOULD be no prizes for guessing that the market in Venice is one of the world's loveliest. It is just by the Rialto bridge on the opposite side of the Grand Canal to St Mark's. Its stalls shelter under a collection of medieval and renaissance arcades. It can be maintained that the scene of the early morning market at the Rialto has remained substantially unchanged since the early 17th century. Near the bridge are fruit and vegetable traders with their heaps of courgettes complete with delicate yellow flowers and those baby artichokes (castraure) so beloved of the Venetians. Treviso red lettuces provide a splash of contrasting colour to the bundles of green asparagus and the white stalks of Swiss chard. The meat market reveals a healthy interest in offal - and not just the famous calves' liver but cows' udders and a dozen different sorts of tripe. The butchers make up pretty skewers of meat called spiedini with chunks of aubergine between the flesh and pile them next to bright yellow chickens and guinea fowl. Fish is the most dramatic display. Lobsters, scampi and razor-shells lie alongside big-bodied spider crabs. There is tunny and sword fish, skate and scorpion fish, tiny soles and mullet, cuttlefish and dried cod in the form of stoccafisso and baccala, gurnard and sea bass still buckled in rigor mortis, live eels and strange, pea-green fish a few inches long. These are sold live with the gills still quivering in the morning sunlight. From the cheese stalls Venetians buy the usual staples of Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino but also local cheeses such as the crumbly Asiago, Baita from Friuli and a seasoned mountain cheese called Montagio. The bakers' shops, with their olive breads and chunky cakes, are the last relics of Venice's prosperous spice trade. An amber-coloured ring was filled with dried figs and nuts. Dried fruit and nuts represent the tradition of Austrian imports, which go back to the years when Venice was part of the Habsburg Empire. At carnival time Venetians eat as many Krapfen or doughnuts as the Viennese, and there is also the Kranz and the Venetian strudel (heavier and richer than the Austrian equivalent). In the smartest shops you may even find sachtertorte.</p>

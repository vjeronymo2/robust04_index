			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Laurent Gbagbo, secretary general of the Ivorian  Popular Front [FPI], who had been silent since the death of  President Houphouet-Boigny, broke his silence yesterday at a  news conference at Assonvon Hotel, Yopougon district, Abidjan.  Addressing the national and international media, the FPI leader  touched on the current political, economic, and social problems  facing our country. These include the devaluation of the CFA  franc and its effects--whether good or bad--on us all; the  political transitional period following the death of the first  Ivorian president; some sections of our country's Constitution,  especially the point concerning the succession issue; as well as  other topics such as the election issue. Now let us listen to  Laurent Gbagbo reaffirm his party's stand on Article 11 of the  Constitution.    [Begin Gbagbo recording] The FPI is definitely against  Article 11. It is against the current application of the  article. It is against Article 11 today and tomorrow. It is  also against the ideology on which Article 11 is based.  Republican power is not given out in hereditary manner. Power  should be won and regulations must be defined for the conquest  of power. There is something fishy about the fact that the  authorities, after the 1990 events, rushed to rearrange this  Article 11, so we must stand against it. We opposed it, we are  still opposed to it, and we will still be opposed to it in  future. [end recording]</p>

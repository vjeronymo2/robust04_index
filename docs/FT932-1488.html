			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria launches record Swiss franc offering THE REPUBLIC of Austria yesterday launched the largest offering to date in the normally tranquil Swiss franc bond market The SFr1bn seven-year deal, launched by Swiss Bank Corporation, is part of a broader effort to improve the liquidity of the Swiss franc market by creating trading benchmarks. The aim is to attract more overseas institutional investors, who have usually avoided the market because of its poor liquidity record. 'The deal prompted international interest,' said one banker. 'The prospect for liquidity is good compared with the Swiss government bond market, which remains underdeveloped.' An official at SBC said that the deal might be reopened, to provide extra liquidity, if Austria needed further funds. The deal was unswapped. In the Eurolira bond market, which has expanded rapidly in the last few months and is benefiting from the efforts of Italian banks to trade the market more actively, the European Investment Bank added a further L300bn to its L700bn of five-year bonds launched earlier this month, bringing the total size of the deal, ahead of the settlement date, to L1,000bn. It is the first deal to reach that size since the EIB and other supranational and Italian borrowers lost their tax-exempt status last year. Although interest in the Eurolira market is developing swiftly, and the availability of large liquid deals is likely to draw the attention of both borrowers and investors, the market may find it difficult to attract many borrowers able to issue in large size, due to a lack of arbitrage opportunities. The EIB has a natural demand for lira, because it will onlend the unswapped lira funds raised through the L1,000 bn Eurobond. Although the initial L700bn issue has rallied nearly 1 1/2 points since its launch earlier this month, on the back of renewed interest in lira bonds, the deal suffered somewhat when the market fell due to renewed political uncertainty yesterday. At the end of the day's trading, the deal was quoted at 101.20, just inside full fees of 1 3/4 points. Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered the ratings of the Province of Quebec and Hydro-Quebec to A+ from AA - , revising the outlook from negative to stable. The province's growing debt burden was cited as a key factor. S&amp;P has assigned an investment grade rating of BBB - to the Republic of Colombia's recent Dollars 125m Eurobond issue due 1998. Colombia is the only Latin American country except Chile to be awarded an investment grade rating by S&amp;P. The rating reflects the country's 'long-standing record of prudent economic and financial management, economic growth and uninterrupted servicing of foreign debt.'</p>

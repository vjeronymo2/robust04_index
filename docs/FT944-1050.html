			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Observer: High scorer Few of the names in the cabinet-in-waiting of Brazilian president-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso ring many bells outside the upper reaches of the Amazon, least of all that of the new 54-year-old secretary for sport, Edson Arantes do Nascimento. His family call him Dico, but most know him as Pele, probably still the world's most famous sportsman. Pele hasn't kicked a ball in earnest since October 1977, when in New Jersey he appeared both for New York Cosmos and his long-standing Brazilian club, Santos. But Cardoso clearly has other reasons than soccer for giving Pele a government post. Next year will be another shaky one for Brazil's economy, so Cardoso will be grateful to have at least one public official whose salary won't be a crucial issue. Pele is Croesus-rich, this year alone raking in an estimated Pounds 15m from product endorsement deals from companies such as Pizza Hut and Mastercard. His business interests include dairy and fish farms, as well as a radio station. Maybe that's why Cardoso chose him - to bankroll his fellow government ministers. 'Edson - can you spare me a moment tomorrow to discuss the national debt crisis . . . ?'</p>

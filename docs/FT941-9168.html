			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Openness helps nuclear mediator - David Buchan on French interest in radioactive waste research labs It is hard to imagine anyone in most of northern Europe volunteering, even lobbying, to have a nuclear waste research laboratory built underneath them. Yet that is what some 30 French local authorities did, and a shortlist of four has just been chosen by France's 'nuclear mediator', Christian Bataille. On the shortlist presented by Bataille to the government last month are two sites in the east (Meuse and Haute Marne), one in the west (Vienne) and one in the south (Gard). After studying their geology for two years, the government will choose two in which to sink underground research labs, costing around FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) each, a step towards a possible decision around 2006 on an eventual nuclear waste storage site. The 56 reactors that generate nearly 80 per cent of France's electricity also produce more than 4,000 cu m of waste a year, of which 200 cu m (about the size of the average private swimming pool) is of long-lived and high radioactivity. At present, this is piling up in a temporary silo at the Cap La Hague reprocessing plant near Cherbourg. The French Greens have recently unveiled their 'Nuclear - Let's Get Out of It' campaign, which will particularly target the four possible waste research sites. But, overall, Bataille's shortlist decision has attracted nothing like the outcry accompanying similar moves in the 1980s. Then the experts of France's Agence Nationale pour les Dechets Radioactifs (Andra) drew up a list of 28 possible sites on purely geological grounds and then selected four. There was such opposition that by 1990 the government halted the plan. The problem was passed to parliament where Bataille, a socialist deputy, in alliance with parliament's Scientific and Technical Evaluation Office, was instrumental in the passage of France's first nuclear waste law in 1991, covering research into elimination and storage of waste. Bataille was subsequently named 'nuclear mediator' in the quest to choose the two underground lab sites. He tried a novel approach: 'We put out a tender for anyone who wanted such a laboratory in their area, and we got positive replies from 30 local authorities,' says Bataille. He was most surprised by the interest from Roubaix, a heavily populated town near Lille in northern France. Why was the reaction in 1993 so different from that in the late 1980s, given broadly unchanged public support for nuclear power? Bataille admits that one reason was money; the 1991 law rewards any community hosting one of the underground labs with FFr60m a year in aid over 15 years. But this, he says, is not an enormous sum, amounting to the cost of a few kilometres of highway. More important was the fact that any storage decision is now clearly for the next century. Earlier, communities were given the impression that if they accepted a laboratory they would probably end up with a permanent waste storage site on the same spot. In the event, Roubaix and 19 other local authorities failed the necessary geological test of having 'soil that is compact, impermeable and without flaws'. In choosing the final four, Bataille said he was largely guided by the fact that their Conseils Regionaux voted unanimously for the laboratories. But this political consensus was not shared by all at a more local level. Nonetheless, Bataille claims his open method of public consultation has vastly improved the climate of opinion. 'What frightens people are decisions taken secretly,' he says, 'and until recently the French nuclear industry has been secretive, particularly the chief regulatory body, the Commission a l'Energie Atomique with its military origins.' By contrast, he commends the country's nuclear power operator, Electricite de France, for its openness. Bataille is considered a nuclear stooge by the Greens. 'I certainly believe that nuclear power is important in giving cheap electricity to France, just as gas is a strategic interest to Russia or oil to the Middle East,' he says. 'But I don't represent any lobby.'</p>

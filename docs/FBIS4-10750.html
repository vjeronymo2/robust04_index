			<p>BFN     [Text] Carlos Blanco Oropeza (New Majority-Change 90), the  vice president of the Congressional Budget Committee, has  reported that Armed Forces and National Police salaries will,  like education and health sector salaries, be increased by 100  soles.    Most of these disbursements will be covered by financial  reserves that total more than 2.3 billion new soles. Some 840  million new soles of the national financial reserves have been  allocated to fund the salary policy.    Some 215 million new soles were allocated for school  expenses, Christmas bonuses, and other labor obligations. He  reported that more than 1 billion soles have been set aside for  salaries.    With regard to the date when the salary increase will be  granted to Armed Forces and police personnel, Blanco said the  executive branch must decide.    He said the Budget Law originally contemplated the increase  on two different dates: The first 70 new soles in February and  the remaining 30 new soles in August.    Regarding the first three-month balance of the National  General Budget, Blanco said the committee must wait for an  Economy Ministry report before commenting.</p>

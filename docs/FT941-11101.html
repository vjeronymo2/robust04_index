			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Books: A life of foreign affairs - The skill and camaraderie of correspondents abroad WHO STOLE THE NEWS? by Mort Rosenblum John Wiley Pounds 16.95, 299 pages BANANA SUNDAY by Chris Munnion Wm Waterman (Box 5091, Rivonia, 2128, S Africa) R70, 443 pages NEWS FROM THE FRONT by Sandy Gall Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 344 pages LAST OF THE PIRATES by Samantha Weinberg Jonathan Cape Pounds 16.99, 256 pages The trade of Foreign Correspondent has always sounded dashing and dangerous and romantic - as sometimes it is; certainly it used to be - but it also has its surprising aspects. For instance, you would expect it to be intensely competitive: yes, it is, but there can be no profession in which there is so intense a camaraderie, so much mutual support, such pride in the achievements of your supposed rival, such alacrity to help a colleague. That may be a consequence of the difficulties and the dangers, which may also help explain why it is a profession awash with laughter, jokes and nostalgic reminiscence, to go with the booze and the boredom, the airports and the expense account, the bullets and the dysentery, the affairs and the alimony bills. Mort Rosenblum's Who Stole The News? is about foreign news coverage and is infuriating because it is written for an exclusively American audience; its argument is therefore seriously unconvincing to Europeans. Rosenblum is a senior and extravagantly experienced correspondent for the Associated Press and he believes that the reporting of international news has deteriorated to a dangerous degree. He blames television: 'For all of its flash and promise, much of our coverage of news from beyond our borders is hardly better than it was in the days of Morse code. Television lets us watch the volcano erupt; it does not show the lava as it is overheating, while there is time to react . . . Most Americans are shown generalities, simplicities and vast empty spaces, a parody of the real world beyond their borders.' That may be true of the US land mass just as it is no doubt correct that two-thirds of Americans depend on TV for their news and more than one-third read no newspaper at all. Rosenblum describes himself as a dinosaur and is nostalgic for earlier, happier times. But this is polemic - very readably so  -and it infuriates because it admits no cosmopolitan dimension or corrective, which is surprising in an author who has been editor of the International Herald Tribune. The fact remains that people who need or wish to follow overseas affairs are still served by newspapers which have over the past generation developed a considerable range and depth of international news and analysis, even as the TV newscasts have become more domestic and banal and the local papers more parochial. Chris Munnion, the Telegraph's Africa correspondent for many years, is particularly good on the importance of peer-group camaraderie to foreign correspondents. It is easy to understand its function in Africa in the 20 years after de-colonisation for the men (and, slowly, the women) whose job was to fly from one disaster to another in constantly frustrating and often terrifying circumstances. In Banana Sunday Munnion is writing about the OAHs, the 'Old Africa Hands' - he finishes in 1980 - and makes proper acknowledgement to Evelyn Waugh's Scoop. He achieves the rare feat of describing a great deal of bloodshed while remaining very funny - the anecdotes never stop. Like Rosenblum, he is nostalgic for the old days of battered Remingtons and the absurdly abbreviated prose of cablese, and he is nervous of the new world of laptops and TV crews. My justification for reviewing a book not yet available internationally is that I might persuade a London publisher to take up this gem of the genre. Munnion is an irredeemable male chauvinist and his political attitudes make him a typical resident of the Transvaal (not to add a stalwart of the Telegraph). All the famous stories are here, and many that I had forgotten. As, for example, when the hacks challenged each other in their adolescent and well-lubricated way to get a by-line into a British national paper from Banana - a port on the Congo River - datelined 'Sunday'. It eventually appeared in the Daily Mail from Peter Younghusband, but was held over for a day - so it appeared as 'Banana, Monday'. Sandy Gall, that most laid-back of our TV newscasters, features in Munnion's pages and has himself produced another volume of memoirs, News From The Front. He takes up the tale in 1977 and focuses on Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Gulf war and his personal obsession, Afghanistan. There is next to nothing about news-casting because he evidently rates his life as a correspondent much higher: it is smooth, urbane, not profound, but these are the qualities of a successful newscaster. The funniest page is a bitchy put-down of Kate Adie. For her first book, Last Of The Pirates, Samantha Weinberg ventures into an obscure backwater of the post-colonial world - the recent history of the Comoro Islands, scattered between Madagascar and the east coast of Africa, a French protectorate since the mid-19th century. Mercenaries seem to be out of fashion at present - except in Bosnia - but in the 1960s they were all over the front pages. In the Congo, Bob Denard was second in notoriety only to 'Mad Mike' Hoare. Denard finished up in the Comoros, where in the 1980s he ruled the roost and was responsible for two coups. Ms Weinberg has been investigating these years, in particular the matter of who shot President Abdallah in 1989; this required her to track down Denard in his enforced retirement near Johannesburg. Her task is readably and convincingly achieved and will gratify the tiny minority which has an interest in Indian Ocean islands, but one cannot resist the feeling that this is parish pump stuff. The French have followed this topic more closely than we, and this book is not going to tell them much. Here, then, are four foreign correspondents, of different age, sex, experience. It is said that several thousand of the breed are preparing to fly to South Africa for the April 27 elections. Two things are certain: the ANC is going to win, and some of those journalists are going to get themselves killed. But, as someone famously said of the profession, it is better than working.</p>

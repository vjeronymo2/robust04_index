			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The verdict on Goode IT IS NO fault of Professor Roy Goode and his pension law review committee that their report comes 20 years too late. But the extent of the delay, and the needless misery inflicted on pensioners by the Maxwell affair and other scandals, does mean that any failure to implement the specific recommendations to deal with abuse rapidly would be inexcusable. The document is far from radical; yet there is a suitably hard edge to some of its regulatory proposals. Nobody will be wholly satisfied with this weighty blueprint for a new legislative framework. But the complexity of the subject and the conflicting interests at stake together imply that some disappointment is probably inescapable. The first test of the report is whether it offers adequate protection for present and future pensioners against crooks like Robert Maxwell. No system of protection can ever be foolproof, but the basic building blocks are here, including fitness tests for trustees, minimum solvency requirements, a compensation scheme, whistleblowing powers for trustees and professional advisers, and a new regulator with substantial powers of investigation and enforcement. Building blocks, however, is the appropriate description, for the solvency rules, though accompanied by a tight timetable, are pitched at a very modest level in relation to current practice in most funds. As for compensation, it may be realistic to exclude losses arising from mismanagement, as opposed to fraud, theft and misappropriation. But the problem with many recent scandals has been the difficulty of proving fraud or mounting legal action to obtain redress for possible breaches of trust. Much will hinge on intelligent parliamentary draughtsmanship. The more difficult test relates to concern about a perceived lack of balance in pension schemes between the differing and sometimes conflicting interests of employers, employees, pensioners and so-called early leavers. On the issue of ownership and control Professor Goode predictably gives the whip hand in final salary schemes to the employers; and it is not clear that his recommendations for minority employee representation on trustee boards are proof against the whistleblowing employee representative being intimidated or sacked. What is clear is that the committee is prepared to pay only lip service to the interests of pensioner trustees and no service at all to early leaver trustees. Yet it is these two groups that have tended to lose out in contentious cases over the use of pension fund surpluses; and the report's excuses for leaving them in the cold are flabby. Perhaps the greatest source of discontent on the part of pension scheme members has been to do with the loss of pension rights through inflation, a worry that has been exacerbated where employers have clawed back surpluses from the pension fund without making good much of the erosion, in real terms, of the rights of the various categories of member. While seeking to tighten the rules on clawbacks, the committee is not prepared to insist that past inflationary losses should be substantially mitigated before the company can take surpluses into profit; and its members were unable to agree on indexation of pensions in payment. The final test of the report will lie in whether the ensuing legislation constitutes a deterrent to the maintenance of final salary pension schemes. There are a number of sound housekeeping measures which may be administratively burdensome, but in the central areas of compensation and minimum solvency requirements Goode has erred on the side of the employer. In the longer run any decision to abandon traditional occupational pension provision will be dictated by larger factors, such as the government's assault on the funds' tax privileges. The government must not allow its ideological distaste for a paternalistic form of pension provision to stand in the way of protection for 11m present and future pensioners.</p>

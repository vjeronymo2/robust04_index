			<p>BFN     [Text] South Africa will not immediately join organizations  such as the Preferential Trade Area [PTA] of East, Central, and  Southern Africa, and is to provisionally put the emphasis on  individual neighboring countries. The chief executive of the  Development Bank of Southern Africa, Mr. Andre le Grange, said  at a seminar in Nairobi, Kenya, that South Africa was perturbed  by all these institutions, and that it would pursue bilateral  agreements with states. Before the elections, the 22 member  states of the PTA expressed the hope that South Africa would  play a major role in the area devastated by civil wars and  famine. However, the Central Bank of Kenya and other business  leaders have labelled regional integration as a dream.</p>

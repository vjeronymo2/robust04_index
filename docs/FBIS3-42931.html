			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Lavrov, deputy minister of foreign </F> affairs of the Russian Federation: "Bombing in Bosnia?"]    [Text] The Bosnian conflict--extremely serious and  dangerous in and of itself--is acquiring an additional critical  aspect in connection with calls for outside intervention  involving the use of force. This concept has already been  advanced repeatedly by certain Western and developing countries  in response to the demands of Bosnian Muslims. In all instances,  the threat to use force has been directed at the Bosnian Serbs.    The subject of "air strikes against the Serbs" has once  again  become a central topic. After the January session of the NATO  Council declared the readiness of the alliance to use air power  in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia's State Duma appealed to it.  The mass media have treated the NATO decision entirely  superficially, detaching it from the history of the issue.  Intentionally or not, this leads to inflamed passions and  incorrect conclusions, including with respect to Russia's  position and the role of the United Nations.    Here is the history of the issue. Russia has never supported  the use of military methods to resolve the problems of the  crisis in Yugoslavia, especially through intervention involving  the use of force by the world community against one of the  Bosnian sides. When such proposals came rushing into the United  Nations, Russia insisted on a more well-considered and balanced  approach toward all participants in the conflict. As a result,  the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council  permitting use of force in Bosnia and Herzegovina contain rigid  criteria and restrictions. First of all, actions of force are  possible only in three cases: if an attack is conducted against  a convoy carrying humanitarian assistance (Resolution 771,  August 1992); if one of the sides violates the no-fly zone in  the airspace over Bosnia (Resolution 816, March 1993); or if one  of the conflict participants directly hinders the UN Protection  Force, Yugoslavia from carrying out its mandate in the security  zones (Resolution 836, June 1993).    Secondly, all United Nations documents clearly establish  that  coercive measures may be used against any side guilty of actions  prohibited by the Security Council, not just against the Bosnian  Serbs. Thirdly, in all decisions, we are talking only about the  threat to use force--its direct application requires special  supplemental procedure involving the participation of the  secretary general of the United Nations and members of the  Security Council.    Fourthly, the Security Council has invited UN member states  and regional organizations to undertake "all necessary measures"  to facilitate the implementation of resolutions, but has  stipulated one steadfast condition: Such measures may be taken  only "under the direction of the Security Council" and "in close  coordination with the secretary general of the United Nations  and UN Protection Force, Yugoslavia."    In August 1993, NATO responded to this proposal. The North  Atlantic alliance declared that it was prepared to participate  in operations related to the conduct of air strikes in  accordance with a United Nations Security Council resolution and  under its direction, i.e., strictly within the framework  established by the international community.    Now the question of bombing has resurfaced in the January  NATO Declaration. But the leaders of the alliance state in this  document that they are prepared to conduct air strikes only  under the direction of the Security Council. Thus, there have  been no changes in NATO's fundamental position since August of  last year. It is another matter that the time of emergence of  this new declaration is difficult to consider an apt choice. Its  underlying anti-Serbian message clearly did not further the  normal course of the Geneva negotiations among the parties in  conflict, although it did not prevent the Serbs and Croats from  affixing their signatures to a bilateral agreement. Once again  the Muslims have convinced themselves of the illusion that  someone will support them with force. To a certain degree the  readiness to conduct air strikes also contradicts the  propositions voiced at that same session of the NATO Council  concerning a peaceful settlement to the conflict.    Russia shares the UN position in the Bosnian crisis. The  "Blue Helmets" command headquarters in Bosnia and Herzegovina  has already stated many times that in the event air strikes are  inflicted, an escalation of combat operations may follow. All  peacemaking forces in the former Yugoslavia will find themselves  under direct threat.    Nonetheless, the decision of the NATO Council shows once  again that an answer must be found to the question of how to  further develop United Nations cooperation with regional  organizations. Precedents in this regard already exist. The  United Nations Security Council adopted resolutions in support  of peacemaking efforts of the Organization of American States in  Central America and the Organization of African Unity in Liberia.    This same experience can be applied to the task of  maintaining peace in the territory of the former USSR, where the  United Nations could cooperate with CIS mechanisms in matters of  maintaining peace. The necessary legal base for this has been  established in the Commonwealth: Agreements have been reached on  collective peacemaking forces and groups of military observers.  In accordance with decisions of the Ashkgabat summit meeting  which took place last December, the CIS requested that the  United Nations afford the Commonwealth UN observer status.    All in all, this experience must be studied and more precise  criteria drawn up based on it with respect to how regional  organizations can settle conflicts through peaceful means.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday [2  March] adopted a government agreement for approving a  European-U.S. joint venture for the construction of a uranium  enrichment plant in the United States. This facility is to be  built and operated by private companies. According to a  government spokesman, the plant is supposed to be built in  Louisiana.    The German-British-Dutch company Urenco is involved in the  project. The goal is to slightly enrich uranium in the plant by  using the so-called gas-ultracentrifuge method, which is already  being applied by Urenco. The fuel rods are intended for  light-water nuclear power plants on the U.S. market.    The framework agreement adopted by the Cabinet ensures that  the operation of the facility will observe the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty on the nonproliferation of weapons-grade  material and that the safety measures of the International  Atomic Energy Agency are taken into consideration. According to  the spokesman, the facility is exclusively intended for the  peaceful use of nuclear material.</p>

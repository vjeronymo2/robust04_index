			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Letter: Time for UK to stop jeering from sidelines Sir, It was high time for David Marsh's thought-provoking piece, 'Caught out by the turning tide' (April 8). But I'm not too convinced that German unification, though often cited as the culprit, is the fundamental problem. Sure, this has led to German interest rates, both short and long, remaining high at a time of cyclical downturn in output and demand - but only because of what the Bundesbank considers excessive fiscal expansionism by Bonn (justifiably when you consider current German inflation). It need not have been so had Bonn evolved a more thought-out policy towards unification. But this is like saying that the Germans, who panic when confronted by anything so organisationally imperfect as the former East Germany, should not be German. The crisis in western Europe stems more from the simple fact that a cheap labour area has opened up to the east. This is akin to flying China over by helicopter and dumping it on top of the formerly frozen communist world the other side of the Berlin Wall. There are few west European industries that are so non-labour intensive that they can compete with the wage costs in east Europe. These are well below the equivalent of DM5 a month, compared to DM40 in west Germany, and around DM30 elsewhere in the EC, according to the IW Institute of Cologne. Perhaps it is time for west Europeans to realise how uncompetitive they have been. Perhaps it is time to wake up to the world's real challenges - environment, famine, Aids, underdevelopment - and begin to confront them in a more responsible manner. One thing Britain has to realise in this whole equation is that it is no use getting out the paddles and rowing off toward the US. Britain may be separated by water from the Continent, but its industries face precisely the same challenges. It is high time, therefore, for the UK government to cease jeering from the sidelines and construct policies, not separate from, but in common with its European partners.

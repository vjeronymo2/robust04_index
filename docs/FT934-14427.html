			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: In case of stagflation, dig out my flares - London JUST AS the Paris fashion shows were abandoning 1970s nostalgia this week, the markets seemed to be rediscovering it. The coincidence of two sets of statistics - falling manufacturing output and slightly rising inflation - brought back memories of one of the 1970s' ugliest coinages: stagflation. When, simultaneously, prices are rising and economic activity stagnant, the government is hog-tied, able neither to ease monetary policy (because of inflation fears) or to tighten it (because that could turn stagnation back into recession). Of course, in the 1970s the level of inflation was much higher. Still, the markets saw enough of a worry in the figures to push the FT-SE 100 index down, and long-term interest rates up, immediately the figures were announced. By the end of the day, however, nostalgia had run its course. The FT-SE 100 closed down only 13.8 points, to 3,071.2, and the yield on 15-year gilts rose from 7.13 per cent to 7.15 per cent. Investors had decided that a government as unpopular as this one would have no problem solving the stagflation conundrum: easier money would win out over fears of inflation, giving the markets the further cut in base rates they are expecting by the end of the year. By the end of the week, stagflation appeared even less of a threat. Thursday brought fresh figures, this time showing a continuation of the six-month trend of falling unemployment. Although they were accompanied by threatened job cuts at British Aerospace and other engineering firms, the figures seemed, on balance, to paint a picture of a hesitant recovery rather than one than switching into reverse. On Friday, as blue skies appeared over the City for the first time in weeks, the stock market finally cast off its mid-week fears, although they lingered still at the long end of the gilt market. The FT-SE 100 index closed at 3,120.8, a new peak. The FT-Actuaries All-Share index, which has been lagging behind recently, also achieved a new closing record, 1541.91. But the yield on 15-year gilts edged up further, closing at 7.17 per cent, up from last week's 7.13 per cent. There is another lesson to be drawn from the week's statistics. The chart compares unemployment and stock market performance in this recession and the one at the beginning of the 1980s. It illustrates the way the economy appears to have undergone structural changes in the past decade. The unemployment figures rose more quickly this time round but, once they had peaked, they fell much more decisively. In the early 1980s, unemployment levelled off; the sustained fall came much later in the cycle. A decade ago, the stock market made a brisker move upwards once the markets started anticipating recovery: the FT-Actuaries All-Share index nearly doubled between 1981 and 1983. This time, the rise in equities was capped initially by Britain's membership of the ERM; once that was over, a sustained rally set in, taking the index up by something less than half. The question is whether the stock market rally has fully run its course, now that the trend in unemployment is clearly on the way down, or if there is much further to go, as in the early 1980s. That will, partly, be decided by the speed with which companies are able to rebuild their profit margins now that the worst of the domestic pressures are behind them. Here, Ian Harnett, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, offers an interesting insight. He points out that part of the recent worry about a faltering recovery stems from the slowing volume of retail sales, a trend likely to show up again in next Wednesday's figures. People have paid much less attention, he says, to the fact that the value of retail sales has continued to accelerate. 'What has happened is that retailers, after seeing rises of close to 6 per cent in turnover, have decided that fighting for market share at the expense of their margins is pointless.' One industry where the tension between volume and margin has been most pronounced was in the news this week: the drinks business. There was disconcerting news from two of Britain's leading spirits houses: United Distillers, owned by Guinness, and International Distillers &amp; Vintners, owned by Grand Metropolitan. The news from UD was that Crispin Davis, its managing director, was departing by mutual agreement; the news from IDV was that it was losing US distribution rights to one of the most successful brands of recent years, Absolut premium vodka. Behind each story lies a common theme. Because people are, by and large, drinking less, the industry's salvation lies in making them drink better, wooing consumers to posher brands at much fatter margins. The policy at has been a roaring success at Guinness, contributing to the company's role as stock market darling in the late 1980s. Still, such a strategy is arguably harder to sustain in a recession when consumers lose their enthusiasm for premium pricing. At UD, Crispin Davies - who has a background in fast-moving consumer goods at Procter and Gamble - appears to have had less faith in the strategy's inviolate nature than his boss, Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman and chief executive. UD recently has been cutting some prices, a policy clash that seems to have prompted Davis's departure. At IDV, there has been no such disagreement, merely a struggle with Seagram over the rights to Absolut - a sign of how serious the battle for premium brands has become. Investors certainly took the announcement seriously: the Absolut contract is thought to be worth Pounds 30-40m a year in profits and the group's shares dropped 4 per cent on the day, closing on Friday at 400p, down 20p on the week before.</p>

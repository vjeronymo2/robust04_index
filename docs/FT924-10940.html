			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price to close paper mill ABITIBI-PRICE, the Canadian newsprint group, is closing its Thunder Bay division newsprint mill, Reuter reports from Toronto. The mill in Thunder Bay, Ontario, has a capacity of 170,000 tons per year and has been idle since March 1991 because of poor newsprint markets. Abitibi said it did not expect the mill to reopen.</p>

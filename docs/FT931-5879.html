			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Trinidad strike call over firings TRADE UNIONS in Trinidad and Tobago are hoping a planned general strike will force the embattled government to cancel the sacking of thousands of workers from three state-owned utilities. The strike will compound the problems of Mr Patrick Manning, the prime minister, in keeping the struggling oil-based economy from foundering. The date for the strike is being kept secret by the unions. 'We are not going to indicate any date,' said Mr Errol McLeod, president of the National Trade Union Centre, an umbrella for organised labour. 'We wish only to announce that a general strike is very much in the offing if there is no softening of the government's position and if there is no adjustment to their economic programme.' Thousands of government workers protested in the streets last month after Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, said extensive retrenchment in the public sector was inevitable.

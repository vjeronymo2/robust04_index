			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESENTING PHOTOGRAPHERS  </P> <P> Regarding "These Austrian Hills Look Too Good to be True," Sept. 16: The author  touches briefly on the "bustling little city of Gmunden" but he doesn't mention  that to reach Gmunden, one must travel through Ebensee, located in one of the  loveliest regions in the world.  </P> <P> Ebensee was one of 60 sites of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex.  </P> <P> In 1946-47, my unit did time there and also south of Salzburg searching for  suspected Nazi criminals and escaped POWs. Please be forewarned that many  locals show resentment to photographers at death camp sites.  </P> <P> VAL RODRIGUEZ  </P> <P> Signal Hill  </P></p>

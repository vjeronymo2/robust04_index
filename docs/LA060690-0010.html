			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> PROPOSITION A;  </P> <P> MONORAIL PROPOSAL LEADS 2 OTHER PLANS IN FIRST RESULTS  </P> <P> A proposed futuristic monorail line along the Ventura Freeway across the San  Fernando Valley was proving by far the most popular of three rail plans in an  advisory referendum Tuesday, with about a third of the vote counted.  </P> <P> Results of the vote could bolster the thus-far largely unsuccessful drive to  build support for a monorail system linking the East and West Valley.  </P> <P> Running second, with about half as many votes as the monorail plan, was a  proposed light-rail line in a shallow trench along the Southern Pacific  railroad's Burbank Branch right of way from North Hollywood to Warner Center --  a plan that consistently has drawn the wrath of homeowners living along the  tracks.  </P> <P> In third place was the plan approved two months ago by the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail  subway westward from North Hollywood to Van Nuys.  </P> <P> The Metro Rail extension, which also would utilize the railroad's Burbank  Branch right of way, has the support of elected officials, business leaders and  homeowner group leaders.  </P> <P> A fourth option on the ballot -- no rail line at all -- was drawing substantial  support, leading all alternatives but the monorail plan.  </P> <P> The referendum, the first time that voters have had a say in the seven-year  debate over what kind of rail line, if any, to build in the Valley, was  conducted in an area that includes the San Fernando Valley, Glendale, Agoura  Hills, Calabasas and Westlake Village.  </P> <P> When they voted in March to endorse the Metro Rail extension and reject  monorail and light rail, commissioners, who control all rail construction  spending in the county, said they could not wait for the advisory vote to  choose between the three plans.  </P> <P> Proposition A was placed on the ballot by county supervisors at the behest of  Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who hoped that a strong vote for his slowly dying  monorail plan would persuade the commission to substitute it for the Metro Rail  extension.  </P> <P> In the two years since he unveiled the monorail proposal, Antonovich has had  difficulty drumming up support for the idea.  </P> <P> Most officials say they are wary of introducing a third rail technology to the  county -- in addition to the Metro Rail and ground-level light-rail systems  under construction -- and that they still consider monorail to be experimental  in this country, although several short lines operate in Japan.  </P> <P> Advocates of the cross-Valley Metro Rail extension have become alarmed in  recent weeks at the possibility that a surge in support for a monorail system  could threaten years of coalition building on behalf of their plan.  </P> <P> Until the warring parties came together on the Metro Rail plan, homeowner  groups and business leaders had battled for years over what kind of rail system  to build in the Valley.  </P> <P> Business leaders insisted that the only affordable system that would relieve  the Valley's traffic woes was a light-rail line in a shallow trench along the  Southern Pacific railroad's Burbank Branch, from the planned Metro Rail  northern terminus in North Hollywood to Warner Center.  </P> <P> Homeowner groups vehemently opposed that plan, saying above-ground trains would  disturb residents of the single-family homes that line almost half the right of  way.  </P> <P> Business groups eventually abandoned their insistence that a line go all the  way across the Valley, and agreed to back a line to the San Diego Freeway with  the stipulation that travelers be able to transfer to express buses bound for  the West Valley.  </P> <P> Even as late as Monday, proponents of the Metro Rail extension and monorail  dueled over the question of cost.  </P> <P> Antonovich has maintained in recent weeks that a review by his office indicates  that a 16.5-mile elevated monorail line from Universal City to Canoga Park  could be built for less than $1.1 billion -- or about $65 million per mile.  </P> <P> By contrast, the estimate for the 5.6-mile Metro Rail extension from North  Hollywood to Van Nuys is $1.1 billion, or about $195 million per mile.  </P> <P> The third plan that was on Tuesday's ballot, the 14.1-mile light-rail line from  North Hollywood to Warner Center, would cost $1 billion, or about $70 million a  mile, according to Antonovich.  </P> <P> But the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission staff, in a letter  released late Monday, contradicted Antonovich's claim.  </P> <P> Neil Peterson, executive director of the commission, said that even though the  commission has reduced its cost estimates for monorail by $200 million, the  futuristic system would still cost $1.6 billion -- half a billion more than  Antonovich has said.  </P> <P> The commission staff has not completed its study of cost-reduction proposals  for monorail, Peterson said.  </P> <P> Still under evaluation are Antonovich's proposals to eliminate from the  commission design three subway segments, totaling 3 1/2 miles, at the freeway's  most congested points -- between De Soto and Canoga avenues, at the  intersection with the San Diego Freeway, and in Studio City.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Italians are lured towards the big sell-off: The launch of a long-awaited privatisation drive For millions of Italians, the face of privatisation will be a former Miss USA, wearing a double-breasted suit and tie. The lady from Credito Italiano, the state-controlled bank kicking off Italy's first big sell-off, may become as familiar as the 'Sid' of British privatisations. Tomorrow sees the start of the international roadshow for Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth biggest bank. Two weeks later, the shares will be priced, with placing begining on December 6. The L10bn (Pounds 4m) advertising budget - directed through the press rather than television - highlights the scale of the task. Italy is going through political convulsions caused by the corruption scandal and the prospect of elections next year. Meanwhile, the earnings outlook for banks is extremely gloomy because of recession. Credito Italiano is heavily exposed through its traditional emphasis on lending to big companies - it is one of the five biggest lenders to the struggling Ferruzzi group. The advertising campaign must also raise public awareness of other privatisations. In February 1994, the treasury plans to float up to 30 per cent of the financial services group, Istituto Mobiliare Italiano. Soon after, Iri, the state holding company which is selling the 67 per cent Credito Italiano stake, will dispose of its 57 per cent interest in Banca Commerciale Italiana, another big bank. By the end of next year, flotations should be concluded of the Ina insurance group and the Enel electricity generating authority. In 1995 Stet, Italy's state telecommunications group, is to be fully privatised after re-organisation. Later investors may get a first taste of the state's lucrative oil and gas activities after Eni's restructuring. It is not clear how much Italy's treasury, struggling to bring down one of the world's biggest budget deficits, will make from the sell-offs. Officials are wary of issuing forecasts, and next year's budget omits privatisation income. Credito Italiano should net about L2,000bn. Receipts from IMI depend on how much is sold. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said this week it would be 25-30 per cent. That is twice as much as first forecast and implies proceeds of about L1,500bn. Estimating the income from BCI is more difficult, as it depends on whether the government will accept the creation of a 'hard core' of institutional investors, grouped around Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank. Depending on the premium for control, analysts reckon Iri's shares could be worth L2,400bn. Next month's start to privatisation ends a tortuous process begun in 1992 by prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato. Much of the work during his government's term of office was technical, including steps to change the public entities into joint stock companies and cut a swathe through layers of party placemen on many of the boards. Among the obstacles were ingrained party political patronage and MPs' fear of plant closures in their constituencies. Trade unions were far from supportive in view of likely redundancies. Ideologically, privatisation was no certain vote winner. But public acceptance for sell-offs, pushed ahead by the present government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was undoubtedly reinforced by the groundswell of support for change provoked by the corruption scandal. Privatisation has now reached 'the point of no return', according to Mr Barucci. But ministers are still crossing their fingers that the first deal goes well. The Milan bourse remains thin by the standards of London or Frankfurt, although turnover has surged this year because of new laws forcing banks to deal on the bourse and introducing computerised screen-based trading. But while daily volumes have risen almost tenfold from the lows of summer 1992, Milan often remains dependent on fickle foreign investors. Attempts to boost domestic investment in equities through new legislation have so far had little effect. A long-awaited law to create private pension funds, which could revolutionise institutional share buying, has so far failed to produce a single taker. Measures put forward in 1992 to stimulate private equity purchases using tax breaks have run aground because of a ministerial wrangle about the fiscal consequences. Such setbacks explain the stress being placed on preparing the market, with daily full-page advertisements featuring Credito Italiano's smiling lady. Her face will not just launch a deal, it should also condition Italian investors to expect a thousand more.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTDOWN TO FLOTATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Privatisation                     Lead                   Size of stake*/ candidate            Adviser      managers     Timing    estimated value  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Credito Italiano     JP Morgan    Credito      Early     67%                                   Italiano,    Dec       L2,000bn                                   Goldman                                   Sachs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Istituto             CSFB         IMI, SG      Early     35-30% Mobiliare Italiano                Warburg      Feb 1994  L1,500bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banca Commerciale    JP Morgan    BCI, Lehman  Mid       57% Italiana                          Brothers     April     L2,400bn                                                1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ina                  Schroders    IMI, BCI,    Early                      Fox Pitt     Credito      June      NA                      Kelton       Italiano,    1994                                   San Poalo,                                   Goldman                                   Sachs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Enei                 Kleinwort    NA           By Dec-                      Benson                    ember 94  NA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eni (energy side)    NM           NA           1994-95   NA                      Rothschild  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Stet                 NA           NA           1994-95   NA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Ordinary shares  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

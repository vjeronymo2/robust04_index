			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> HARRIS' LAWYERS FILE FOR COURT HEARING  </P> <P> Lawyers for Robert Alton Harris argued in a fat brief filed with the U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals that the condemned murderer is entitled to a full  fact-finding hearing on his claim that mental disorders drove him to kill two  teen-age San Diego boys. Defense lawyers Charles M. Sevilla and Michael McCabe  claim that their 37-year-old client suffers mental disorders that drove him to  kill impulsively.  </P> <P> Yet, they said, evidence of these disorders was not presented to the jury that  sentenced Harris to death for the 1978 murders of Michael Baker and John  Mayeski, both 16, in order to steal their car for use in a bank robbery.  Prosecutors described Harris' claims as "ridiculous" and urged a three-judge  appellate court panel to reject his challenge.  </P></p>

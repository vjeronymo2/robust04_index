			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK sees Bonn 'retreat' on beef Germany said yesterday it was now seeking a European solution to its row with Britain over stronger measures to stop the spread of 'mad cow' disease. Last month it had threatened to take unilateral steps, including a ban on beef and veal imports from Britain. 'Germany wants action at Community level,' German farm minister Jochen Borchert told a meeting of EU farm ministers. Mrs Gillian Shephard, British agriculture minister, told reporters: 'To that extent it is clearly a retreat by the Germans, as at one stage they were saying they would take unilateral action.' But earlier Mr Borchert said if the EU approach failed, Germany would have to look at the matter again. He urged the Brussels Commission to present fresh proposals to combat 'mad cow' disease by the next meeting of EU farm ministers at the end of May.</p>

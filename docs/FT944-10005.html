			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A long ride on a steam engine - Four boys became captivated by an ironworks in the 1960s. Clive Fewins visits the company they founded Engineer David Hodgson will never forget the 45 long minutes he spent locked in the catacombs of Kensal Green Cemetery in west London. There were coffins as far as he could see in every direction. His memory of the experience is even more vivid because he had a bad cold at the time but had to suppress all his sneezes. A service was in progress in the chapel directly above him and he feared that some of the congregation might rapidly join the dead below if they heard sneezes emerging from the depths. Such a sound could easily have been heard, for in place of the hydraulic catafalque that conveys coffins through the floor to their final resting place there was a large void. The catafalque lay awaiting restoration in Hodgson's workshop in the Derbyshire Dales and his task in the catacombs was to examine the condition of the machinery that operates it. Cemetery regulations dictated that he should be locked in the catacombs while carrying out his work. Hodgson runs the northern arm of Dorothea Restorations, a company that specialises in engineering conservation work. Standing near the half tonne catafalque structure in the Dorothea workshop at Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire are several other monoliths from Britain's industrial past. They include Locomotion - a 20-year-old replica of the engine that pulled the first passenger trains on the Stockton to Darlington railway, an 1838 steam engine that used to haul baggage trains on the Liverpool to Manchester line and a 100-year-old industrial diesel engine undergoing an overhaul for its owner, Hull City Museum. Dorothea had its origins in Bolton in the mid-1960s when four 16-year-old schoolmates found themselves captivated by the huge engines, steam hammers, heat and flames from the country's last working wrought iron works. 'To us it was the most exhilarating atmosphere. In our lunch hours and after school we got to know the men at Walmsley's iron works who used to let us help them and even drive the steam engines,' said Hodgson, 45. The four - the others were Roger Lees, Chris Topp and Ted McAvoy - all went off to different universities, but kept in touch. When they graduated three years later, they remained convinced that their mission was to conserve and preserve parts of Britain's industrial and architectural heritage that they saw fast disappearing. Three found jobs in different parts of the country and pooled some of their wages to support Lees, the only mechanical engineer of the four, who was starting up Dorothea. The name came from a huge slate quarry in north Wales. On their meanderings the four had discovered a fine old Cornish beam engine there. Although it had not worked for more than a decade the engine was still in reasonable order and the management was happy to let the four work on it at weekends, while Lees remained on site during the week. The idea was that the engine should form a means of attracting visitors to tour the quarry, which was suffering hard times. But the quarry closed and a development company bought the site with the intention of turning part of it into a holiday complex. One of the main attractions was to be a small industrial museum centred around the steam engine. That scheme fell through, but the experience left the four with enough confidence to set up a company doing what they had always wanted to do: restoring old machinery and engines. With the aid of a Pounds 300 overdraft from Lloyds bank, Dorothea Restoration Engineers came into being in 1974 after the four had gained further experience at the infant Ironbridge Gorge Museum and the North of England Industrial Museum at Beamish near Newcastle-on-Tyne. The four had no base; they met and worked at whatever site or project was employing them at the time. The work mainly involved horizontal, mill and winding engines, but in 1975 they were joined by Geoff Wallis, a mechanical engineer whom they had met working at Ironbridge. His origins were in Bristol and he rapidly established a western base, concentrating on architectural restoration work based on wrought and cast iron. The same year the others rented a former candle-wick mill at Kettleshulme in Cheshire. It served as a cheap operating base while business grew, especially from the clutch of industrial museums that followed Ironbridge and Beamish. By the time Dorothea established a third base - a rented blacksmith's workshop in Buxton - there were 20 employees. In 1976 they extended the overdraft to Pounds 2,000 and bought a workshop in Bristol for Pounds 25,000. The current 6,000 sq ft Bristol works was bought for Pounds 137,000 in 1987. It is responsible for 60 per cent of the turnover of just over Pounds 1m and is the base of 12 of the 23 employees. In the late 1970s Dorothea moved its northern base from Kettleshulme to a rented 2,000 sq ft engineering works at Whaley Bridge, near Macclesfield. By then the company had four sites and 70 employees, and turnover was about Pounds 250,000. But it was all too much. 'Administration was a nightmare, we had chronic cash flow problems, and the business was still run by a committee,' Hodgson said. 'We had left the civilised world of museums for the harsh realities of the construction industry, where we faced all the problems of the sub-contractor. But we had always been self-financed and we were determined to stay that way.' They succeeded. In 1980, Topp volunteered to leave - he remained a director  -and to run the smithy as a separate business, working closely with Dorothea when the occasion arose. This relieved the company of one of the four sites and some of the pressure. The four then appointed David Maiden, an architect who had joined them, as a director and and gave him a free hand. He put Hodgson in charge of the works at Whaley bridge, while McAvoy continued with the potentially very profitable business of making reproduction cast iron street furniture at Buxton. 'From being on the point of collapse we turned Dorothea round. The exercise served us in good stead for the leaner years of the late 80s and 90s,' Hodgson said. In 1984 the company accepted an outside consultant's report, and the street furniture and new architectural metalwork sections split away completely. Topp, Maiden and McAvoy departed to be directors of the new company of Dorothea Ltd, and eventually sold out to an engineering conglomerate. Hodgson, Lees and Wallis became directors of Dorothea Restorations Ltd. So it has remained. For the past 10 years, in spite of the vicissitudes of the building trade and cutbacks in museum funding the northern and southern works have combined to make a modest 2 per cent profit. 'It's never huge - but we survive,' said Hodgson. 'Amazingly we have always stayed in profit. In recent years there have been no redundancies. The keynote has been steadiness and gradual reinvestment - especially in staff.' Later this year Dorothea is dipping its toes into continental Europe for the first time; the company is attending a trade fair in Amsterdam. It is also tendering for a number of prestigious jobs, including some replacement ironwork for the Albert Memorial. Hodgson is hoping to be able to add this to a string of jobs they have completed for clients such as The National Trust, English Heritage, the Royal Botanic gardens at Kew and the Palace of Westminster. The four original Bolton schoolboys are still the best of friends. McAvoy runs an aluminium fabrication company near Whaley Bridge and undertakes work for Dorothea on occasions, as does blacksmith Topp. 'Its nice to think that after all these years and many ups and downs we are still firm friends,' Hodgson said. 'We all like to think we were pioneers back in the 60s of the industrial and architectural heritage conservation movement, to which, in our own ways, we are all still highly committed.'

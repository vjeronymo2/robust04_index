			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria  ended their meetings in Istanbul, Turkey, yesterday. The  meetings were held within the framework of the periodic  discussions held by these countries to study the situation in  Iraq's Kurdistan.    The final statement issued stressed the following points:    1. Iraq's territorial integrity.    2. Opposition to any foreign interference in Iraq's affairs.    3. The need to lift the economic siege imposed by the regime  on Iraq's Kurdistan and the south.    4. Iraq's compliance with all UN resolutions.    If we put aside what was discussed behind the scenes during  the meetings, we see that the three ministers' emphasis on the  issue of lifting the economic siege of Iraq's Kurdistan and the  south is a positive step toward understanding the sufferings of  the Iraqi people in general and of our Kurdish people in Iraq's  Kurdistan in particular.    Our Kurdish people have stressed through the parliament and  regional government the need to compel the Iraqi regime to  comply with the international resolutions imposed on it by the  United States. The brother officials in Turkey, Iran, and Syria  should realize that Saddam Husayn and not the Kurdish people is  the reason why Iraq and the countries of the region remain  within the whirlpool of conflicts that have exhausted the  region's peoples and governments. Therefore, efforts must be  made to save the Iraqi people--Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, and  Assyrians--from the evils of the Baghdad dictatorial regime.    The time has come to put an end to the doubts about our  Kurdish people's democratic experiment. The neighboring  countries have to understand that recognition of the Kurdish  people's national legitimate rights within a democratic and  pluralistic Iraq is the guarantee for protecting the country's  territorial integrity and for sparing it any foreign  interference in internal affairs.    Action in any other direction will not be in line with the  principles laid down by the new world order for dealing with the  problems of the persecuted peoples looking for liberation. Our  Kurdish people in Iraq do not intend the democratic experiment  to result in anything but legitimate rights.</p>

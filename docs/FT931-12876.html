			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Banks welcome survey of lending practices HIGH STREET banks yesterday welcomed the results of the Bank of England's survey into their lending practices to small businesses, which was promised by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. They could hardly do otherwise because the survey found that they had passed on the whole of base rate cuts to borrowers. The survey of seven high street banks with 4.1m accounts among businesses of less than Pounds 10m annually found fees and charges had grown by an average of just over 5 per cent since June 1991. But it found average margins hardly changed in the same period. Although the inquiry was expected to exonerate the banks of holding on to the value of base rate cuts, the lack of any overall margin widening was a surprise. The Bank found margin rises had averaged below 0.5 percentage points. Total lending to small businesses fell from Pounds 45bn to Pounds 43.6m over the period. There was a 3 per cent fall in the amount of lending linked to base rates and a 15 per cent increase to Pounds 6.3bn in fixed rate loans. About a third of facilities had been increased, and a quarter reduced. The Bank found most banks had passed on the 4.5 percentage point rate cut in the period within two or three days of each cut. For firms with up to a Pounds 1m turnover, average margins were between 2.3 and 4.2 per cent, while for those between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m turnover they were between 1.8 per cent and 3.8 per cent. The banks - Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds, Midland, TSB, Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland - had shifted firms of above Pounds 1m turnover from the lowest margin band of between 0 and 2 percentage points above base. Those in the lowest band had fallen from 56 per cent to 35 per cent over the period. Overall, 61 per cent of base-rate-related accounts saw no change in margins. Margins widened on 30 per cent of accounts, about half by less than 0.5 per cent, and they narrowed on 9 per cent. 'Seven out of 10 customers seem to have received the full benefit of base rate cuts or more,' the Bank found. On fees and charges, the survey found that the average increase in income was just over 5 per cent. This compared to inflation of 4.2 per cent over the period, and a 7 per cent fall in the customer base from 4.4m in June 1991. The Bank comments on a 'more thorough-going attitude' to charging. There was a strong divergence in fee charging. Two banks saw fee income fall by a little less than the customer base, while increases in revenue for the others ranged from 4 per cent to 22 per cent. The Bank says that tariffs are reviewed annually. The Bank found that a number of banks issued local managers with guidance on target margins. In two cases the target minimum was increased by 0.5 per cent and in one, a bank reduced its targets. About two thirds of all small business accounts were in credit, and the average amount borrowed for firms with a turnover below Pounds 1m is just over Pounds 20,000. A one percentage point change in interest rates thus benefits or penalises the average small business by about Pounds 200 per year. Bank Lending to Small Businesses. Bank of England. Free</p>

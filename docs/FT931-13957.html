			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: Currencies over the worst The French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt - all weak recently in the European exchange rate mechanism - seem to have surmounted the worst of the currency storms. Partly reflecting the D-Mark's decline against the dollar, the three currencies have recovered from their lows. Although the French franc, in particular, could be a hostage to political tensions in the run-up to the March parliamentary elections, immediate pressure for another ERM realignment has diminished. However, all three countries, suffering from very high real interest rates and facing poor growth prospects, are counting the costs of standing up to speculative pressures. FT writers assess the cost of staying the ERM course.</p>

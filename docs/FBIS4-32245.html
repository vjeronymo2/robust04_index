			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.P.: "The Situation in the Grain and Meat </F> Industries; We Await a Correction"]    [Text] This year we will continue to feel the effects of  the breakdown in animal husbandry in 1993. A growth in meat  production is not expected until the beginning of next year. The  situation in grain processing is also difficult.    During the first three years of economic reform, we  harvested  27-28 million metric tons of grain each year. Grain and grain  product prices remained relatively stable until early 1992.  Despite the fact that growth indicators of these prices were  half the rate of inflation, this had no definite negative effect  on this sector, primarily due to the size of turnovers (hog  production rose, and large quantities of grain were imported).    In 1992, grain production dropped to 20 million tons, and,  at  the same time, during the course of one year, their prices  almost tripled. The following year brought an increase in grain  production (to 23.5 million tons), while the size of animal  production dropped. A state of relative price and production  stability developed. Present grain prices are about 15 percent  lower than in the spring of last year. Experts in the Agency for  Agricultural Marketing (ARR) are forecasting that, after the  1994 harvest, they will drop still more.    Domestic consumption demand has little effect on the  stability of the grain market. It remains at a steady 115-120 kg  per capita per year. The growth rate of grain product prices is  not only lower than the rate of inflation, but it is also lower  than the price growth of grain itself. An additional factor that  helps to maintain this situation is the rather high (82.2  thousand tons in 1993) import of flour.    The fact that prices of grain and grain products are not  keeping up with inflation is responsible for the steady  reduction in the processing margin. The stability of grain  prices between harvests means, in turn, that almost no advantage  is being taken of the seasonal differences between them. The  storage margin category (with fixed costs rising greatly and  warehousing costs varying) is almost disappearing. The State  Grain Elevators (PZZ) are not able to make a profit at this time  and thus accumulate funds for either development or turnovers.  Nor did they have these funds previously when, on principle,  they were not enterprises created for profit. However, as a  result of decisions made on higher levels, they were entangled  in investment ventures and thus encumbered with high credit  payments. Their debt, by virtue of this, is approximately 90  billion zlotys [Z]. Nor does the PZZ benefit from any credits in  grain procurement. The debt attributed to this totals Z250  billion.    The process of ownership transformation in the grain-milling  industry was preceded by the breakup of the PZZ into smaller  units. At this time, there are 105 state enterprises (including  18 limited-liability companies) and two State Treasury stock  companies. A few enterprises were privatized, and four are in  the process of bankruptcy.    As ARR experts have determined, acceleration of the process  of restructuring this sector is very difficult (a postinspection  report from the Supreme Board of Inspection confirms that the  situation in this industry is complicated by overall economic  conditions as well as some internal neglect). It will have to  wait (there is no great interest in this industry, either by  foreign or domestic investors) for a comprehensive program of  universal privatization. But general transformations in this  industry will not proceed rapidly if comprehensive  debt-reduction is not instituted.    Regeneration of basic herds in animal husbandry is a  long-term measure (since the last harvests a growth in the  number of animals has been recorded). An increase in meat  production cannot be expected until the beginning of 1995. This  year, production will continue to fall. It is anticipated that,  compared with 1993, there will be 17 percent less pork, 10  percent less beef (50 percent less compared with 1990), and  almost no lamb or mutton for general consumption (the number of  lambs is steadily shrinking--at this moment, there are  approximately 800,000). In such a situation, obviously we can  expect a growth in prices, an increase in import, and a decline  in export.

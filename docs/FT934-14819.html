			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (3): Where entente cordiale reigns - European co-operation UNLIKE other, higher profile, issues over which the UK and the rest of the European Community have been at odds, standards is one corner where both sides are positively effusive about each other. They insist they are both vital to the users of standards with their joint future secured by the premium that industry places on flexibility and the need for consensus in drawing up standards. At the European level, most standards are set by CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, while electrical products and telecommunications have their own organisations - CENELEC and ETSI. CEN groups the national standards bodies of the 12 European Community member countries and the six members of the European Free Trade Association. A further seven countries, mainly from eastern Europe have affiliate status, with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic currently applying for affiliation. The committee attempts to avoid duplicating the work of other organisations, so where possible its standards are based on national or international ones. They carry the EN (European Standard) prefix. The British Standards Institute is at such pains to stress its enthusiasm for its European counterparts that its literature starts with an apology for its name: 'BSI might easily be imagined as a bastion of insular nationalism. Perish the thought. Standards are as international as the markets they serve, and BSI's outlook has always been towards world markets to promote the acceptability of the UK exports and imports on which we depend.' The BSI Kitemark is perhaps the most widely known UK seal of approval and is awarded, or licensed, by BSI to companies which produce goods to accepted national or international standards. Both BSI and CEN dismiss worries that one side may be redundant in the three-tiered global standards structure which has bodies at the national, European and international level. Relations are so cordial that BSI says its London headquarters can be regarded as the offices of their European counterparts and the UK is often at the forefront of demands for new standards from Europe. 'The UK has got the image of being a slightly reluctant European, but in terms of standards we are not. The UK is the quickest to establish European standards as part of the national standards framework. The UK consistently tops the league in this,' says Ms Patricia O'Rourke, BSI's senior press officer. The UK's desire for European standards is not born out of idealistic Euro-enthusiasm: 'The feeling is that if you don't get involved, somebody else is going to set the standard, set the agenda,' she adds. The role of the European committees has been vastly expanded by the spate of directives produced to establish the community's internal market initiative, many of which use standards to spell out their requirements. The community has been trying to reduce technical barriers to trade since 1969 but the attempt initially foundered in a bog of technical details which had to be constantly updated. In 1973, the Low Voltage directive took a different approach which limited legislative harmonisation to essential requirements published in the directive and then entrusted the preparation of supporting technical specifications to standards organisations. This new approach was adopted by the Community in 1985 and these days most directives for goods and services are produced in this way. With legislative differences outlawed by directives, considerable scope exists for the voluntary harmonisation. This is essentially a marketing challenge to suppliers to influence, but ultimately to meet, the preferences of 'home' customers throughout the community without legal hindrance. Yet at first glance, the European level looks the most vulnerable to redundancy. Ms O'Rourke says the need for European standards, however, is driven by pragmatism and the community's special need for standards to support its single market: 'I think it is a question of scale and timing. When you are creating a national standard, we get all the interested bodies together. 'This can mean as many as 30 or 40 bodies represented on a committee. We even had one committee of 60. When you have a European level you have all the European countries involved and you have got to come to a consensus. 'When you are working on an international level you have more people involved and it takes longer to produce.' BSI says it takes an average of two years to produce a UK standard, four years in Europe and more than six years internationally. She adds: 'Also the EC has its own timetable of standards required by the internal market.' She points to the electro-magnetic compatibility directive. This was implemented last year to ensure that electrical products do not interfere with each other, heading off potential disasters such as televisions interfering with life support machines in hospitals. The directive relies on a number of standards to elaborate its requirements. CEN says it enjoys a fruitful and productive relationship with all its members, including BSI: 'Troubled though the UK's position in Europe may be in certain respects, the European standards scene, which spans the Community and other European trading agreements, has seen a huge shift towards co-operation in drawing up standards to support directives and the UK is playing its due proportionate part as one of the biggest member states,' says Mr Stewart Sanson, head of information. 'These new approach directives will typically contain the essential requirements for health and safety. All the rest of things can be handled by voluntary standardisation and verification.' CEN, which was set up in 1961, admits it was a far smaller operation before 1985: 'The work was not very big. But in fact there was significant work going on, with European standards for safety of lifts and safety of toys. 'Standards were created in the low hundreds. It was just an extremely small secretariat of about 10 people,' says Mr Sanson. He also points to the need for a European standard setter to achieve consensus more quickly than at the international level, but argues that in the end industry will decide where the appropriate standards should be set: 'International consensus is sometimes particularly difficult to achieve with more than 130 countries. 'Other parts of the world have more technical differences than exist between European countries; for example, in the US voltage is very different.' He says CEN members have a much stricter attitude to the adoption of standards: 'If the standard is voted for by CEN it has to be adopted and implemented as a national standard. Countries in the rest of the world do not have to adopt global standards.'</p>

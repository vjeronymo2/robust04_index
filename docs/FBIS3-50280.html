Above  all, we think that their relevance also depends on their  sponsors' obligation not to stray from the bounds defined in  them in the future.  <H5>  A General Point of View (Introduction) </H5>   The members of the local self-administrations, town and  village mayors, and parliamentary deputies--the elected  representatives of Hungarians in Slovakia--publish the following  point of view from their assembly in Komarno on 8 January 1994:    Following the political changes after November 1989,  Hungarians in Slovakia manifested their support for political  pluralism, parliamentary democracy, and the execution of the  principle of self-administration in two parliamentary elections  and in the elections to local representative bodies.    The Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Egyutteles  coalition currently has 14 deputies in the National Council of  the Slovak Republic. These movements highlighted as a priority  task in their election programs improving the legal status of  Hungarians in Slovakia. There are 5,000 Hungarian deputies and  roughly 400 Hungarian mayors in town and community  self-administrations.    According to the 1991 census, more than 600,000 inhabitants  with Hungarian as their mother tongue live in Slovakia--that is,  11.5 percent of the total population. Members of the Hungarian  community make up the majority in 437 towns and villages and  account for 10-50 percent of the population in another 85 towns  and villages. These 522 towns and villages are located in a  continuous--compact--territory along the southern border of the  Slovak Republic. Almost 98 percent of the Hungarians in  Slovakia live on this territory and account for almost 70  percent of the population here. Apart from this, there is a  sizable number--1,000-20,000--of Hungarians in another four  cities.    The sociological surveys that have been carried out  regularly  since October 1990 indicate that a high percentage of the  Hungarian population in the Slovak Republic supports  parliamentary democracy. Compared with the rest of the  population, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are less characteristic  among the Hungarians, and they also display the greatest  tolerance toward other people. The attitude of Hungarians  toward Slovaks is positive, and the sociological surveys show  that the Slovaks who live among them feel the same.    The participants in the assembly want in the future to  enhance the community of Hungarians in Slovakia, and also the  territories where Hungarians and Slovaks live together, on these  foundations. The participants in the assembly realize that the  basis for social peace, development, and human affluence is a  peaceful relationship, regulated by law, between members of  different nationalities. This is a prerequisite for ensuring  that structural changes in policy and the economy take place as  quickly as possible in Central Europe and that the countries of  this region can integrate themselves into the European Union.    Following the collapse of the communist system, the citizens  and governments of the former communist states, as well as the  whole of Europe, face new tasks: creating a new system for  security and stability in Europe that would make it possible to  forestall local and regional conflicts and also creating the  basic prerequisites for expanding European integration toward  the former communist countries.    The Central European region is, among other things,  characterized by biased attitudes and pent-up tension that could  result in tragic conflicts. We will do all we can to ensure  that such a conflict does not break out in the Carpathian basin.  However, it is necessary to point out that it is also essential  to deal with the ethnic problems here.    In Slovakia, which gained its independence in 1993, this  means that it is necessary to establish relations between  Slovaks and Hungarians on new foundations. In the interest of  this, it is necessary to create a new system for relations  between Slovaks and Hungarians and to adopt new laws. The  measures adopted by the government so far have contributed to  worsening mutual relations. The new system of relations should  strengthen the basic pillars of democracy: the system of  self-administrations, a law-governed state, and a  constitutional-legal status for the ethnic communities.    The participants in the assembly therefore express their  point of view on three fundamental issues.   <H5>    The Constitutional and Legal Status of Hungarians </H5>   The participants in the assembly assert that the Hungarian  population in Slovakia, despite some repression and pressure  under the totalitarian regime and after World War II and other  attempts to ethnically homogenize the population, has maintained  its ability to express again its political subjectivity, to  organize its community, and to preserve the original settlement  structure on the territories where it has lived for thousands of  years as an autochthonous community and, in most cases, has also  formed the majority of the local population. Proceeding from  this, the Hungarian population in Slovakia defines itself as a  national community resolved to struggle to ensure that, apart  from the individual rights that should pertain to everyone, its  community rights are recognized and that its status as a  community is enshrined in the Constitution.    At the same time, they proceed from the UN resolution  according to which the right of individuals and collectives to  preserve their own identity is one of the basic human rights.  Their conviction that political and cultural  self-identification and self-determination within the framework  of the state is a basic right of the Hungarian national  community is inherent in this.    The participants in the assembly proclaim the following: For  the development of the ethnic Hungarian community in Slovakia,  it is essential that:  --In places where Hungarians account for at least 10 percent  of the population, they can use their mother tongue, orally and  in writing, in contacts with state bodies or, as the case may  be, in public administration and have a right to the designation  of public areas and to public information in Hungarian.    --In places where Hungarians make up the majority of the  population, Hungarian is the official language alongside Slovak.    --The Slovak Republic signs and ratifies the European  Charter  on Regional or Minority Languages.    --The representation of Hungarians in state bodies and  public  institutions corresponds to their number.    --The Hungarian community receives a fair allocation from  the  state budget or, alternatively, from the budget for  self-administrations in accordance with its size.    The participants in the assembly proclaim that Hungarians in  Slovakia, proceeding from the principle of civic equality:    --Want to establish the Slovak Republic along with the  Slovak  people as an equal community.    --Want, in accordance with the draft constitutional law  prepared by deputies from the Hungarian coalition, to express  their political subjectivity via their own representative bodies  that will evolve from democratic elections.    --Demand, in the interest of maintaining their own identity,  the recognition of a special legal status for the territory  where a considerable number of Hungarians live.    The participants in the assembly express their conviction  that one of the fundamental elements of equality is thorough  adherence to the principle of mutuality. This means that, in  regions, towns, or communities in which members of one  nationality or inhabitants with the same mother tongue are in  the minority, they have a legally guaranteed right to an  education in their mother tongue, a right to use their mother  tongue, and the right to acquire and disseminate information in  their mother tongue. As far as these rights are concerned, the  given community should have the right of agreement in relation  to the regional self-administration and the state  administration. This means that it should not be possible to  make a decision on these issues without the agreement of this  community.    The participants in the assembly proclaim that implementing  these principles within the Slovak Republic, an equivalent  status for the Hungarian national community and the Slovak  nation with respect to its state-forming capacity and the  application of rights serves to bolster the statehood and  territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic and to create a  democratic law-governed state.  <H5>  The Jurisdiction of the Self-Administrations </H5>   The participants in the assembly realize that one of the  basic pillars of a law-governed state is a system of  self-administrations equipped with broad powers; this is a  framework in which citizens have an opportunity to  democratically express their will and to oversee the  implementation of their interests and respect for human rights  and freedoms.    The participants in the assembly state that the rights of  the  self-administrations in the Slovak Republic are inadequate. The  development of the self-administrations comes up against  obstacles, their rights are deliberately curtailed, central  power is being increased to the detriment of the  self-administrations, and the bodies of the state administration  are being given superiority over them. The chapter in the  Slovak Constitution on territorial self-administrations  (Articles 64-71) contains only general statements. These  principles may thus manifest themselves in a completely  distorted manner both in laws and in practice.    The participants in the assembly consider it essential that  the powers of the self-administrations be unequivocally defined  by law--that is, that a territorial system be created within  whose framework a self-administration's bodies will run their  affairs by utilizing the predominant part of the taxes according  to the values produced on the given territory and will guarantee  the democratic self-regulation and self-administration of the  local population.    In the interest of this:    1. The Slovak Republic should sign as soon as possible the  agreement on affiliation to the European Charter on Local Self-  Administrations. The basic ideas behind it are as follows:  increasing democracy, decentralizing power, subsidiarity, and  the sworn and public acceptance of undertakings by the  contracting parties.    2. The declaration on affiliation to the European Charter on  Local Self-Administrations should contain at least 20 points  from Article 12, among which should feature the following--to  us--important points:    --Article 2, enshrining the rights of the local  self-administrations in the Constitution and laws.    --Article 3, Paragraph 1, dealing with the overwhelming  majority of public issues at a local level.    --Article 4, Paragraph 3, the body that is territorially  closest to the citizen should be responsible for dealing with  public matters.    --Article 4, Paragraph 4, complete and exclusive authority  for the local bodies.    --Article 5, the unchangeability of the  self-administration's  borders without the agreement of the population.    --Article 8, Paragraph 1, supervision of the activity of  self-administrations should be regulated by law.    --Article 9, Paragraph 2, the appropriate financial cover  for  their activity in harmony with their powers.    --Article 10, Paragraph 1, the right of the  self-administrations to form associations.    --Article 10, Paragraph 2, the right of the  self-administrations to join international associations.    --Article 11, protection of the free execution of rights  should be guaranteed by the courts.    3. In the interest of legal certitude, the following should  be itemized in the Constitution: the system of  self-administrations, their jurisdiction and authority, or,  alternatively, their unalterability by means of other legal  norms.    4. The following should be expressed in the Constitution in  detail: the system of self-administrations, their jurisdiction  and authority.    5. Before the implementation of the new system for the  country's territorial-administrative division, it is necessary  to create, in accordance with Chapter 2, Article 64 of the  Slovak Republic Constitution, larger territorial units, on the  basis of a voluntary association of self-administrations, that  will come under the jurisdiction of the future territorial  self-administrations. At the same time, it is necessary to  respect Council of Europe recommendation No. 1201.    6. In harmony with Chapter 3, Article 4 of the European  Charter on Local Self-Administrations, it is necessary to  constitutionally outline the complete and exclusive powers of  the self-administrations. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee  that these powers cannot be curbed by regulations from central  or regional bodies.    7. In the interest of decentralizing power, rationalizing  the  state administration, and increasing responsibility beneficial  to the public by transferring power from state administration  bodies to the self-administrations, it is necessary to bring  administration closer to the citizen and to expand the  constitutional authority of the self-administrations, especially  in the spheres of education, culture, health care, public  safety, and the environment.    8. It is also necessary to coordinate the material,  economic,  and financial conditions necessary for the self-administrations'  functioning with the powers and responsibility of the  self-administrations. All of the property and real estate  located in the community should be ceded to the local  self-administration in cases where the owner is not known.    From the point of view of establishing a democratic legal  order, legal certitude, and a law-governed state, we consider it  expedient--respectively, executable and necessary in the  interest of stability--for the National Council to adopt laws on  the self-administrations with a three-fifths majority. In the  case of the self-administrations of the (ethnic) minorities,  they should be guaranteed the right to veto the execution of  rulings that are disadvantageous to them, since so-called  numerical democracy, by its very essence, cannot guarantee the  widespread execution of the interests of those in the minority.   <H5>    The Administrative Reorganization of Slovakia </H5>   The assembly participants take the following as their point  of departure:    --The state forms the framework for the realization and  protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms.    --The territorial and administrative arrangement in the  country should be based on an integral system of the execution  of public administration, and the most important elements of the  arrangement are the following: a decentralized state  administration, economy of the administration, and service to  the principal interests of the citizens.    The assembly participants believe that the present system of  public administration in the Slovak Republic conforms to neither  the European requirements nor the requirements of the local  population because it is uneconomical and heavy-handed, with an  overgrown bureaucracy; the decisionmaking process is very  complicated; and its powers are not clearly defined. The  distribution of power among the bodies of the state  administration and the local self-governing administrations is  not rational. The system of territorially integrated state  administration authorities with definite powers conflicts with  local interests. The government has been planning a  reorganization of the public administration system since 1990.  Attempts at decentralization were initially made within the  framework of this plan. Today, however, the centralization  tendencies, which serve the interests of the central power, are  again gaining in prominence.    The assembly participants declare the following:    1. The proposal made by the government does not suit most  local self-governing administrations in Slovakia. For the  Hungarian community, this plan is unacceptable, in addition to  the general objections, because the region inhabited by the  Hungarian community would be divided into five administrative  sections, and that would result in a complete marginality of the  Hungarians, which in turn would render a solution to the actual  problems impossible. This would facilitate organized  assimilation.    2. When constituting administrative regions and bodies of  state administration in the country, it is necessary to build on  the principle of legal security guarantees and a two-tier system  of public administration.    3. The new public administration structure must be formed,  while respecting the principle that public affairs should be  managed by a body that is territorially closest to the citizens.  In present-day Slovakia, this means that, in addition to the  self-governing administrations, the first tier of the state  administration should be constituted on the territory of the  already existing (or similar) domains of the state  administration. The first tier of the state administration  should receive all such administrative powers as needed to deal  with all official business in the given region, including the  transfer of powers from the present authorities with specific  powers. Concurrently, it is necessary to close down the present  district offices of the state administration.    4. When creating the second tier of the administrative  regions and bodies of the state administration, it is necessary  to build on the principle that they are to be constituted within  the framework of the territorial units that arose by a voluntary  integration of the (local) self-governing administrations.    5. The reorganization of the territorial arrangement and the  state administration should respect the fundamental interests of  the Hungarian national community:    --That its region of habitation is not divided among several  constitutional units, in which the Hungarian community would  become a marginal minority, without any chance of promoting its  interests, and would not have the opportunity to participate in  dealing with matters that concern it.    --Such a constitutional arrangement is acceptable for the  Hungarian national community, as long as it does not assume the  position of a minority (in terms of strength) in the territories  on which many of its members live.    --That Article 11 of Recommendation No. 1201 by the  Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council be observed in  the territorial and administrative reorganization, according to  which:    In the areas where the members of ethnic minorities live in  significant numbers, they have the right to special a legal  status or to local or autonomous bodies of public  administration, which correspond to the historical and local  specific features of the given community and are in harmony with  the legislation of the given state.    The legitimacy of these demands is confirmed by the  following  data:    According to the 1991 census, the cities and villages  populated by members of the Hungarian national community in  Slovakia can be put into three categories:    a) Majority regions: cities and villages in which Hungarians  form at least 50 percent of the population. There are 432  cities and villages with 437,727 inhabitants of Hungarian  nationality in this category.    b) Minority regions: cities and villages in which the share  of Hungarians is over 10 percent but less than 50 percent.  There are 90 cities and villages (the Hungarians live in a  relative majority in five of them) in this category, with 83,125  inhabitants of Hungarian nationality .    c) Regions in which Hungarians live dispersed: cities and  villages in which the share of Hungarians does not reach 10  percent but their absolute number exceeds 100 people. There are  28 cities and villages (the number of Hungarians is 39,519) in  this category, while, in four cities (Bratislava, Kosice, Nitra,  Velky Krtis), 1,000-20,000 Hungarians live.    The assembly participants propose the following:    1. The second-tier public administration should conform to  the territorial entities that emerge from the voluntary  association of the cities and villages of categories a) and b)  (majority and minority regions).    We believe that there are two feasible solutions:    a) To form one homogeneous territorial administrative  entity--region: from the territory below Bratislava as far as  Kosice, and then, after a short interruption, southern Zemplin  and the area between Uh and Latorica (Medzibodrozie). There are  511 cities and villages in this area with a population of  824,946, of which 507,073 are Hungarians (61.46 percent).    b) To form three administrative entities--regions: from  Bratislava to Sahy: population of 526,620, of which 331,704 are  inhabitants of Hungarian nationality (66.11 percent), 250 cities  and villages--southern Zemplin and the area between Uh and  Latorica: population of 58,985, of which 45,576 are inhabitants  of Hungarian nationality (77.27 percent), 53 cities and villages.    The Hungarian linguistic island below Nitra should form a  special territory (first tier administrative region) formed of  18 communities with the Hungarian population 12,895 (51 percent  of the total) strong.    2. At the offices within the framework of the first- and  second-tier administrative units with special powers, formed  according to the aforementioned principle, the law should  guarantee the possibility of dealing with official matters in  both languages orally or in writing.    3. From the vantage point of the authority and powers, the  system of institutions in the framework of the territorial and  administrative entities should be compatible throughout  Slovakia. The territories inhabited by Hungarians or by members  of other national minorities, however, should form an exception  and have special legal status.    The assembly participants consider it necessary that the  aforementioned principles and views be implemented in the  territorial and administrative reorganization of the country.  It would contribute to the reinforcement of the inner stability  and social peace.  <H3>  The Possibilities for the Economic Development of the  Self-Administrative Regions </H3>   The structural changes in the economy and the transition to  a  market economy have highlighted the economic differences between  the individual regions. During the past four years, some  regions have found themselves in a severe economic crisis and  have major problems with unemployment.    The area of South Slovakia inhabited by Hungarians is also  among these regions. The unemployment level here far exceeds  the nationwide average and, what is more, districts with a  Hungarian population are among the areas with the highest level  of unemployment.    According to the official figures, the level of unemployment  in Slovakia on 31 October 1993 was 13.8 percent. However, on  the same date, the unemployment level in the Dunajska Streda  District was 20.1 percent. It was 19.2 percent in Galanta; 21.0  percent in the Komarno District; 20.8 percent in  Kosice-Environs; 15.5 percent in the Levice District; 19.0  percent in the Lucenec District; 17.5 percent in the Nove Zamky  District; 23.7 percent in the Rimavska Sobota District; 21.3  percent in the Roznava District; 19.0 percent in the Trebisov  District; and 19.8 percent in the Velky Krtis District.    One of the main reasons for the economic problems in  territories with a Hungarian population is the one-track  branch-by-branch structure [jednostranna odvetvova struktura].  The economy of this territory is determined by agriculture and  by the services linked to it, to a degree, by the food industry;  all of these are considered to be crisis branches. The  one-track branch-by-branch structure of the economy in these  territories is the result of Czech economic policy during the  First Republic. In addition to this, in the 1950's--at the  beginning of Slovakia's industrialization--only rarely were  industrial enterprises founded on these territories and, from  the ecological point of view, the new plants mostly had an  negative impact. Plants such as, for example, the Duslo  chemical plant in Sala, the paper plant in Sturovo, the nuclear  power plant in Mochovce, the hydroelectricity plant in  Gabcikovo, or the heating plant in Vojany.    Responsibility for the economic stagnation or, rather, the  economic decline on these territories is borne by the  Czechoslovak state and the Slovak political leadership. To  rectify these mistakes, it is necessary for these regions to  become regions with an independent administration. In this way,  their population will finally have an opportunity to control the  economic development of their own region in accordance with  their own economic policy, and, at the same time, they will also  be responsible for it.    Autonomy for the self-administrative regions is relative; it  may exist within broad limits: from a formal  self-administration to a factual self-administration, which  means the possibility of independent decisionmaking in important  issues affecting life within the given region. Of course, the  aim is to achieve factual autonomy--that is,  self-administrations in the broadest sense of the word,  self-administrations in which there are great opportunities to  develop the economy, politics, culture, education, and ecology  on the territory of the given region.    It is necessary to emphasize: If, on the territories with a  predominantly Hungarian population, we demand the creation of  regions with their own self-administration, this does not mean  that we would want to isolate ourselves from the Slovak economy.  What we intend by the better utilization of what we have and  the comparative advantages of the individual regions is to  strengthen the national economy of the whole of Slovakia.    From the economic point of view, the creation of these  regions is important because it makes it possible:    --To draft and implement regional programs and concepts for  economic development that accept and utilize the comparative  advantages of the individual regions and lead to the elimination  of the current one-track branch-by-branch structure.    --To attract foreign capital and organize foreign  development  programs.    --To sign agreements on regional cooperation with regions in  the country and outside it.    --To introduce regional and local taxes as a backup for that  apportionment of state taxes it is possible to utilize for  regional development.    --To utilize financial sources (funds) provided from the  state budget for the development of the given region.    It is particularly necessary to mention the institutional  possibilities for regional economic development. These are:    --Regional chambers of trade and industry.    --Regional specialist associations.    --Regional banks and insurance companies.    --Regional institutions for economic development (offices,  agencies).    Regional economic development can only be successful if we  understand that this is a long-term process and we approach it  accordingly, if we implement it with commitment, if the  organizers are personally interested in it, if it is based on  discovering and using the internal potential and comparative  advantages of the regions, and if the development strategy is  adapted systematically to potential and needs.    An organic element of the political and economic changes at  the moment is the redivision of Slovakia into administrative and  self-administrative units. In the new territorial division, it  is unnecessary to proceed in accordance with the principle of  divide et impera, but it is necessary to create viable units so  that the whole--the country--is also enhanced. This aim may be  achieved by creating regions while taking into consideration  historical traditions, natural regional units, and economic  potential so that the energy of sound local patriotism, the  cohesive strength of the inhabitants of the given region, and  their endeavor for self-realization, their instinct to establish  their right to existence, and their desire to achieve success  are all utilized.</p>

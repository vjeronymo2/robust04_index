			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.6(c) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The only change made in this subsection was a reference to the previous subsection. It provides that a recipient seeking a waiver under &sect;1607.6(b)(1) must demonstrate that it has made diligent efforts to comply with the client board membership requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.6(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This new provision was added to require that as a condition of granting a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) of this section from the requirements of &sect;1607.3, the president shall require that the recipient receiving the waiver have a policy body to establish and enforce policy with respect to the LSC grant. This waiver provision might apply, for example, to an organization that is not principally a legal assistance organization but gets an LSC grant for legal assistance activities. The organization would be able to set up a policy board similar to those established for several of the Delivery Systems Study programs during the late 1970's, to govern the activities covered by the LSC grant. The Board intends that such a waiver would be given only in very unusual circumstances. Such a policy body would need to comply with the appointment and membership requirements of &sect;1607.3 and the meeting requirements of &sect;1607.4(a), and its members would be subject to the compensation prohibitions of &sect;1607.5. The Corporation wanted to make clear that a policy board is not merely an advisory committee with limited authority to recommend policy to the recipient's governing body. By definition, such a policy board would be required to have full authority to formulate and enforce policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or contract, although it may not necessarily have any policy-making authority with respect to the recipient's non-LSC funded activities. This provision requires the president to determine the powers and responsibilities of the policy body that are necessary to carry out its responsibilities with respect to setting policy for the LSC-funded activities. Because the scope of the powers and responsibilities of such policy bodies might be different than those of grantees not covered by the waiver, the reference in the proposed rule to &sect;1607.4 has not been retained in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Deletion of Section 1607.7&blank;Compliance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The compliance section of the current regulation is no longer applicable, because it refers to the changes that were made in the regulation in 1983. None of the revisions would require programs to change anything about their board structures in order to come into compliance, although they would permit programs to make numerous changes and still remain in compliance with the regulation. Therefore, the Corporation deletes the provisions on compliance. The Corporation will insure compliance with the new regulation in the same manner that it insures compliance with the other regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1607 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Legal services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, LSC revises 45 CFR part 1607 to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1607_GOVERNING BODIES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 1607.1&blank;Purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1607.2&blank;Definitions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1607.3&blank;Composition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1607.4&blank;Functions of a governing body. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1607.5&blank;Compensation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1607.6&blank;Waiver. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 2996f(c); Pub.

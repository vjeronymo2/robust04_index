			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Phone-in interview with Mate Cranic, Croatian deputy prime </F> minister and minister of foreign affairs, by unidentifed  correspondent, from Geneva; from the "Picture vs Picture"  program -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] Good evening, Mr. Granic.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Correspondent] Could you briefly summarize the strenuous  day  that you have had today. Shall we start with your Bonn meeting?    [Granic] Maybe it is necessary to say that the day before,  President Tudjman decided to inform some of the most important  and influential European countries about our policy and problems  that we faced during the negotiations in this very sensitive  phase of the talks on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  search for a lasting peace. The Bonn meeting passed in a  friendly atmosphere in the course of which we informed Minister  Kinkel about our standpoints in detail and also about all the  problems that exist at the moment in our negotiations with the  Muslim side. I think that they showed full understanding for  our stands.    [Correspondent] After that, you left for Rome where you had  talks with your counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta,.    [Granic] Right. Ten days ago, I paid an official visit to  Italy. At that time, we discussed not only bilateral relations  in detail, but also the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  reintegration of UN-protected areas into Croatia's legal system.  I briefed Minister Andreatta about all the problems and  difficulties of this phase of negotiations, but also about the  successes. As you already know, as it has most probably been  made public, General Roso and General Delic have signed a  cease-fire agreement. On the other hand, we have had intensive  talks on finding a permanent peace between the Muslims and  Croats and permanent solutions within Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of  course, between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia.  Likewise, we got several interesting suggestions, we believe  that Italy will be able to considerably influence the position  of the United States at this moment.    [Correspondent] Maybe it will be interesting to hear some  details of the Vatican talks with Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran.    [Granic] As you know, I also paid a visit to the Holy See  where I was received by the holy father. I had long talks with  Cardinal Sodano and Monsignor Tauran about all problems,  particularly about all the humanitarian problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the suffering of the population, and also  about political solutions. On that occasion, we received  several very useful suggestions, and I conveyed some messages  from President Tudjman to the holy father. That was a very  useful and friendly meeting. At this moment, permanent  communication with the Vatican is very important to us.    [Correspondent] My colleague, Jozo Curic, told me earlier on  the phone that you had a phone conversation with your Austrian  counterpart, Foreign Minister Alois Mock.    [Granic] Minister Mock is a great friend of Croatia, but  also  of the Muslim side. This is very favorable in this phase of  negotiations. He was interested in obtaining first-hand  information about the current situation. Of course, he is  constantly ready to help both sides, and I think he will be able  to offer considerable help in this phase of negotiations.    [Correspondent] Can you give us an overall assessment of all  these meetings today. Actually, what have the commentaries on  the latest Russian initiatives, and the stepped-up U.S.  involvement in this area been like?    [Granic] Globally speaking, there have been positive  assessments of America's heightened interest in restoring  permanent peace and, of course, reaching a lasting solution  between the Croats and Muslims. But on the other hand, in all  the meetings our hosts expressed understanding for the stands of  the Republic of Croatia.    [Correspondent] And in conclusion, please tell us about your  participation in the session of the Commission for Human Rights  in Geneva tomorrow. What are you going to speak about?    [Granic] I will speak about the observance of human rights  in  the Republic of Croatia and openly about problems that we have  faced over the past three years, about missing persons, about  all the problems of war and suffering, and also openly about all  other problems in connection with human rights, about the  protection of human rights.    [Correspondent] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for replying  to our call despite the strenuous day that you have had.    [Granic] Thank you.</p>

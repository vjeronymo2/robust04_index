			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Go-ahead for Lufthansa sale The German government's privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline, is set to go ahead at the end of this month, according to Dresdner Bank, which is co-ordinating the international and domestic offerings. The government's timing coincides with a radical turnround in Lufthansa's fortunes which has resulted in a doubling in its share price from a low of DM97 in January 1993 to a high of DM223.80 last month. The shares closed at DM207.50 yesterday. The company said last month that it expected to make an operating profit this year and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would resume dividend payments for the first time since 1989. The government intends to reduce its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent by not participating in a forthcoming rights issue, Dresdner said. The 3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up will be sold to investors in Germany and abroad, excluding the US. Lufthansa has decided not to place shares in the US under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act, in order to limit the risk of excessive foreign ownership which could jeopardise its flag carrier status. However, US investors are likely to be included when the government disposes of the rest of its shareholding, which is scheduled to take place before the end of 1995. The new shares are likely to be priced at a slight discount to the prevailing market price. If investor demand is sufficiently buoyant, the government also intends to sell up to 2.1m existing shares which would reduce its stake in Lufthansa to 36 per cent. Dresdner Bank has drawn up a large syndicate of domestic and international banks to ensure a wide placement of the shares. Kleinwort Benson and NatWest have been appointed as senior sellers of the UK and Ireland tranche, SG Warburg and UBS are senior sellers for the rest of Europe tranche and CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley are senior sellers for the rest of the world. The publication of the preliminary circular yesterday launched a packed pre-marketing period, with roadshows scheduled in Frankfurt, Paris, London and Zurich. The book-building process begins on September 19 and will close 10 days later with the setting of the price and the allocation of the shares.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F> 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Mu'ayyad; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Mu'ayyad] In your  opinion, where is the Yemeni crisis heading and how can it be  brought to an end?    [Basindwah] I think certain elements of the party  responsible for touching off the crisis will insist on  maintaining it. They could have ended it when they got most of  their demands. However, perhaps they want to remedy the  situation, and perhaps they want more. Therefore, I expect the  crisis to last for a long time, until it turns into an internal  party dispute. Then, there will be a relaxation.    [Al-Mu'ayyad] Will this relaxation prevent a military  explosion?    [Basindwah] The crisis could get worse and then abate again.  Some limited military clashes could also take place. At worst,  there might be individual assassinations. I can say for sure,  however, that there will be no civil war or separation.  Separation means war, and no one wants war in Yemen, unless God  deprives sane people of their reason. Separation is a crime;  civil war is a dire catastrophe.    [Al-Mu'ayyad] It has been argued recently that a federation,  rather than a merger of unity, is the only way out of the crisis  and the guarantee to prevent separation. Is this an objective  view?    [Basindwah] With due respect to those who promote this view,  I think that federation is the first step toward fragmentation  and disunity. In addition, why do we need federation when we  are one unified people who share the same origin, religion, and  language. We do not have ethnic, religious, or native-language  minorities. Let alone the fact that we have coalesced in one  melting pot of long struggle, generation after generation, in  view of our sense of unified national belonging. Yemen is one  country, not two; one people, not two. The best evidence of the  unity of land and people is that we used to view the north as  one part, the south as another. We never regarded them as two  countries or states, even when each of them was a separate  state. In addition, why call for a confederation when the  accord document stipulates that the country should be divided  into regions, each enjoying local government.    [Al-Mu'ayyad] Do you expect a new government to be formed to  implement the accord document and restore order?    [Basindwah] This might happen if the crisis continues  unabated.    [Al-Mu'ayyad] What about the mediation efforts being made by  Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE]?    [Basindwah] Their good offices are continuing. Ambassador  Badr Hammam, the assistant foreign minister and envoy of the  Egyptian president, has continued his meetings in Sanaa and Aden  since his arrival in Yemen on this his third visit. Perhaps the  purpose of his visit is to gauge conflicting views and determine  points of agreement to crystallize a plan for reaching an  agreement before calling any meeting. [passage omitted]    [Al-Mu'ayyad] Has a date been fixed for a meeting between  the president and the vice president, and when do you expect it?    [Basindwah] The reason why the leaders in Cairo and Abu  Dhabi are in no hurry to invite the president, his deputy, and  Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping,  is because they want to make sure it will succeed, lest its  failure should lead to more frustration on the part of the  Yemeni people and the Arabs. There is no doubt, however, that  Egypt and the UAE can help us overcome the crisis and heal the  rift in the relationship between the parties of the ruling  coalition. [passage omitted]</p>

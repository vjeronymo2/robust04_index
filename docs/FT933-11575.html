			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Fyodorov fumes at 'senseless' action MR BORIS FYODOROV, the Russian deputy prime minister and finance minister, yesterday vowed to fight to annul the central bank's 'useless and unjustified' decision to withdraw all pre-1993 roubles. He demanded the resignation of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman. In an uncompromising tone, Mr Fyodorov repeated several times that 'there is one person who is guilty: that is Victor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko; his actions are senseless, even I would say stupid. Not one economist or one banker in the whole civilised world would take a decision like this'. He said western officials were 'extremely concerned' about the central bank's action. 'Only two weeks after we returned from the Tokyo summit (at which Dollars 44bn foreign aid was pledged to Russia's reform) this decision is taken. This again tells the whole world that we are an untrust- worthy partner. There were calls to suspend aid to Russia,' he said, hours after returning from Washington where he had talks with US officials and financial institutions. Earlier yesterday the praesidium of the Russian parliament declared it was cancelling the bank's decision. It said all limits for changing old money into new had been scrapped and that all trading outlets had to accept pre-1993 banknotes. However, Mr Fyodorov yesterday dismissed the parliament's announcement, saying that the president must abolish the bank's initial decision. On Monday, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, moderated the bank's announcement by raising the limit of notes to be changed from Rbs35,000 to Rbs100,000 and extending the time within which old roubles could be exchanged. In a separate decision, the praesidium also cancelled Mr Yeltsin's decree sacking Mr Viktor Barannikov, the security minister, fired for corruption and failure to react promptly to attacks on his border guards on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. The parliament said the dismissal 'violated legal norms'. Mr Fyodorov admitted he had no way of exercising leverage on Mr Gerashchenko or the bank itself since it was constitutionally under the control of parliament. The finance minister said that Mr Yeltsin had not been told of the bank's move in advance. Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, yesterday was reported as calling for a strong protest to be lodged by the Group of Seven industrial countries. His suggestion, however, was vetoed by the G7 foreign ministers, including Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, who felt it would be counter-productive. The International Monetary Fund also issued an unusually public criticism of the recall, and of the Russian central bank's failure to notify the Fund in advance. 'The lack of consultation with the IMF at a time when the IMF is supporting a stabilisation and reform programme in Russia with resources under its systemic transformation facility is regrettable,' an official said.</p>

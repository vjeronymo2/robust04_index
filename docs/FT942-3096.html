			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: CSO constantly seeks to enhance seasonal adjustment procedures Sir, We were pleased to see your interest in seasonal adjustment of statistical series - a highly technical subject, but at the same time one of great importance in the analysis of economic and other data ('Easter's moveable feast dishes statisticians', June 7). The topic is one to which we devote a lot of attention both in considering the merits of alternative systems and in deciding how best to use options available in the X-11 system we have adopted. In our continuing search for improvements, we have engaged the help of Dr Estelle Dagum, an expert of international repute, to advise on seasonal adjustment procedures. David Wroe, deputy director, Central Statistical Office, Great George Street, London SW1P 3AQ</p>

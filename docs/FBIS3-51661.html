The "contras" are betting on the lack of a quorum  to prevent voting on the articles that are to be revised. A  total of 293 congressmen will have to be present in order to  approve an amendment.    Deputy Jose Fortunati (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul State], PT  leader in the Chamber of Deputies, said that "we are going to  request that the quorum be verified whether we favor or reject a  motion, because we are against a revision of the Constitution."    The PDT admits that it will vote in favor of a motion if the  revisionists are able to get the 293 deputies and senators to  make up a plenum.    The two parties indicate that this week, at least, there  will  not be a quorum. If there is a quorum they are going to ask for  a postponement, on the basis of the argument that the quorum is  illegitimate with the participation of the congressmen who are  involved in the budget mafia.</p>

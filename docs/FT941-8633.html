			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Quadrant placing for acquisition Quadrant Group, the photographic and video products supplier, yesterday announced the acquisition of Yewlands Engineering from Carlton Communications and a placing and open offer to raise about Pounds 4.1m. Consideration for Yewlands is Pounds 2.66m in cash on completion and, under the terms of a subscription agreement, Carlton has agreed to pay Quadrant Pounds 2.16m in cash on completion. Some Pounds 1.6m of that will be by way of a non-interest bearing loan note, repayable in March 1996. The balance, of Pounds 560,000, will be by way of subscription for 1.6m new shares in Quadrant at 35p, which Carlton will hold for at least two years. The placing and open offer, underwritten by Hambros, is of up to 11.7m new ordinary shares on a 1-for-2 basis at 35p. Proceeds will be used for the acquisition and to reduce indebtedness of the enlarged group. Yewlands is a maker of precision engineered components mainly for the aerospace industry. It made profits of Pounds 800,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 10.9m in the year to September 30.</p>

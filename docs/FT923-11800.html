			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Change in UK rebate outlined THE European Commission yesterday put forward options which could slightly reduce Britain's future rebates on its EC budget contributions, but stressed it was for the Council of Ministers to decide. Since 1985, Britain has received back each year two-thirds of the net difference between what it pays in and what it gets in return. The Commission is not proposing any change in this 66 per cent rebate but suggests a possible modification to how the gap is defined. This rebate is paid in recognition of the fact that Britain, with slightly less than average EC income per head, makes the second largest gross revenue contribution while getting relatively little EC money back in the form of price support for its small agricultural sector. The current system could be maintained, the EC executive says, in which case the level of the UK rebate, expected to total Ecu2.27bn (Pounds 1.6bn) this year, 'would remain roughly the same in constant Ecu figures', despite the planned growth in the EC budget over the next five years. The Commission proposes two possible modifications. Any changes would have to be decided by unanimity, thus giving the UK a veto. One is to take out of the calculation of Britain's net budgetary gap whatever the UK pays into the cohesion fund proposed for poorer countries. This would reduce the rebate, though not by very much, EC officials said. The second possible change would be to reduce the share of the UK rebate shouldered by Germany, which makes by far the biggest net contribution (Ecu9bn this year) to the budget. Bonn is already excused one third of its share of the UK rebate, and is pushing for a further reduction. Such a change would not necessarily reduce the UK rebate, provided other countries were willing to take up Germany's reduced contribution to it. But their readiness to do this is far from clear.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shakil Sheikh] </F>   [Text] Islamabad: MNA [Member of the National Assembly]  Asif Ali Zardari will proceed to Banghdad on February 9 as prime  minister's special envoy to make arrangements for the release of  three Pakistanis who have been sentenced to jail in Iraq.    During his three-day visit, Zardari will be accompanied by  Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan and Bashir Riaz, a former  press spokesman of the prime minister.    According to informed sources, the special envoy will  deliver  a written message of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn for the release of two armed forces  personnel, employed by the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and  one civilian.    All of them had lost their way and strayed into the Iraqi  territory during the Gulf war and the Iraqi authorities awarded  six to eight years sentences to them.    Utilising this first hight-level Pak-Iraq contact since the  Gulf war which resulted in total devastation of Iraq, Pakistan  is sending 10 to 14 tons of life-saving drugs, worth Rs[rupees]  2 million in a special C-180 flight as a special humanitarian  gesture to the Iraqi people. The same plane will also carry the  delegation.    High level official sources told 'The News' that the  delegation would remain in Baghdad from February 9 to 11.  During its stay the delegation will hold meetings with  President Saddam Husayn and several other Iraqi government  leaders in an apparent bid to remove unnecessary tritants in the  Pak-Iraq relationships including the imprisonment of the three  Pakistanis.    It is learnt that spadework for the Zardari-headed  delegation  has already been done. A C-130 aircraft is being loaded with  life-saving drugs the list of which was said to have been  provided by the Iraqi authorities.    Foreign Office sources say that the Zardari mission will  prove a great success as it will secure release of the  Pakistanis and would also help remove irritants between the two  Muslim countries, besides reactivating traditional relations  between Pakistan and Iraq.    Earlier, communicaitons exchanged between the two countries  revealed that Iraqi leadership is pleased and deeply touched by  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's gesture in nominating her  husband as special envoy. Pakistan's ambassador to Iraq had  already held lengthy deliberations with Iraqi Foreign Secretary  Abdul Jabbar Al-Douri.    The Iraqi response to a request from Pakistan for the  release  of its three nationals is reported to be 'highly encouraging'  Iraqi government has also shown its eagerness to welcome the  Pakistani special envoy on his arrival in Baghdad. Iraq also  views it as 'welcome opportunity for dialogue' at a high level.</p>

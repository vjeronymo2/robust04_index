			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus takes 24.9% Vox stake Vox, the German satellite television group that went into liquidation in April, received a lift yesterday when Canal Plus, the French subscription television group took a 24.9 per cent stake. Canal Plus has negotiated the same terms as Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which took a 49.9 per cent stake in the channel in July, according to sources. Neither group has paid anything for the stake nor taken on any of the estimated DM450m (Dollars 290m) debts of the channel since its was launched at the beginning of last year by Bertelsmann, the large international media group and other German partners. Canal Plus and News Corporation will invest in the future of the channel and make their programming expertise available. Mr Marc Tessier, Canal Plus executive vice-president for corporate development said yesterday the company had become an investor in Vox 'because it's a good partnership - Murdoch, Bertelsmann and ourselves'. Vox, which has to provide news and current affairs as a condition of its licence, was billed as 'television for university graduates'. The advertising-financed channel managed to get only an audience share of about 2 per cent although it is available to 73 per cent of the German population through cable, satellite and by broadcast on terrestrial frequencies. Canal Plus which runs subscriptions channels in France and with partners in Spain, Germany and Africa, has never invested in advertising-funded television. 'We felt that it was worth making an exception in the case of the German market,' Mr Tessier said. In spite of the difficulties of the channel, it is believed there were other potential bidders, including Viacom, owners of MTV Networks and GS Capital Partners, an investment fund run by the US securities house Goldman Sachs. Canal Plus had advantages in such a competition. The French group is an investor with Bertelsmann in Premiere, the German subscription television channel and in July signed an agreement with Bertelsmann to development jointly new pay television channels for Germany and other European markets. After a number of Vox investors pulled out Bertelsmann was left with more than the 24.9 per cent stake it was allowed to hold because of its other German TV interests. The stake which has gone to Canal Plus was being held in trust until a buyer was found. Mr Tessier emphasised last night that Canal Plus was not holding the shares on Bertelsmann's behalf.</p>

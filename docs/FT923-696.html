			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Markets with exotic appeal - Once ignored, now they are in demand EMERGING markets are one of the investment fashions of the moment. Hitherto ignored areas such as Latin America suddenly are attracting international investors. There can be some disagreement about what constitutes an emerging market, but these countries are found mainly in south-east Asia, Latin America and southern parts of Europe. Their attraction is that economic growth tends to outstrip that of the industrialised world, while their economies are being liberalised and opened up. As Fund Research puts it in a new report: 'Although emerging markets account for 13 per cent of the world's GNP, and perhaps 80 per cent of the world's population, their market capitalisation is only 6 per cent of total world capitalisation and they probably represent only around around 0.5 per cent of institutional investors' total portfolio holdings.' For the private investor, the only real way of tapping the potential growth of these markets is via a unit or investment trust. These fall into three categories of fund; single country, regional and global. Single country funds offer the riskiest ride. The markets can be very illiquid, with managers able to buy only a few shares. In Colombia, for example, 82.5 per cent of the market's capitalisation at the end of June consisted of just 10 stocks. If a unit trust manager is forced in such markets to sell shares to meet redemptions, he might have to accept fire sale prices. This will affect performance adversely. And whereas an investment trust manager can escape these problems, the investor in such a fund can be faced with the alarming swing from premium to discount. Many single country funds, listed in London but based offshore, have had particular problems with discounts. A recent analysis by Olliff and Partners shows that the average discount in the sector is 35 per cent. Regional funds offer the investor some protection against these problems but are not immune. A region's markets can rise and fall together, even if economic performance is not in sync. Fund Research says: 'Falls across Latin American countries have given the appearance of a correlated decline, whereas this effect was exacerbated by a general withdrawal of hot money from overseas investors.' The Latin American Investment trust was the best performer of all investment trusts in 1991, but is down by 18.6 per cent over the year to September 1. Global funds should, in theory, offer less volatility. While the individual markets are highly volatile, research seems to indicate that a basket of such investments is no more risky than a mainstream stock market such as the UK. A basket of stocks should offer a better return, too. Now, alarm bells ought to sound whenever someone claims they can achieve a higher return at no extra risk. But enthusiasts claim emerging markets are 'inefficient, allowing you to pick up attractive assets at bargain prices. On the other hand, a global fund manager has an enormous range of countries and potential investments to analyse. The sheer scope of the task could be defeating. So, returns can vary enormously. There are six emerging market investment trusts, of which the best performer over three years was Templeton, with an impressive 70.4 per cent. But the worst performer, New Frontiers Development, lost 28.1 per cent. Among unit trusts in the field, the best performer has been Prosperity Emerging Markets, which is second in the international growth sector over five years with a rise of 27.6 per cent. But private investors should remember that any equity investment involves risk and should be entered only for the long term - which means at least five years. Most experts would agree that emerging markets should represent only a small proportion of a private investor's portfolio.</p>

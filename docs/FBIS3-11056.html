			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, today  analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of  Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the  common border area between the two countries for the purpose of  preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal  Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug  trafficking, and the projections of Mercosur [Common Market of  the South].    Sanchez de Losada today arrived in Argentina on an official  48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on  plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on  investment promotion and guarantees.    President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received  the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's  military section.    After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan  Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of  state the keys to the city.    During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez  de  Losada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is  the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally  in Argentina.    He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very  important,  and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we  will be able to stop this problem."    As for the possibility that Bolivia will join Mercosur, the  Bolivian president said: "We want to come close to Mercosur  because we are part of the Amazon Basin," adding that "our  future depends on exchange with the region's countries."    After making these statements, Sanchez de Losada departed  for  Alvear Palace Hotel, from where he headed to Casa Rosada, where  he held his first working meeting with Menem.    After the meeting in Government House, the two presidents  went to San Martin Palace, where Menem held a lunch in honor of  his guest.    The Bolivian president had anticipated that during his visit  to Argentina he would talk with President Menem about subjects  like illegal immigrants, Mercosur, cholera, and the canalization  of the Pilcomayo River.    Sanchez de Losada said Argentina is, for Bolivians, "almost  a  second fatherland; one is always very connected with this  country and thousands of Bolivians currently live in Buenos  Aires," which determines "a relation of vital importance for us."    When asked whether the subject of illegal Bolivian  immigrants  will be discussed, he said "that will be one of the subjects we  will discuss" and added that they will also discuss the  canalization of the Pilcomayo River, which is "one of Bolivia's  major concerns."    "The Pilcomayo River is dwindling away and it is important  for Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina," he said.    Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Losada said:  "It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the  Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international  community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is  something we cannot stop."    He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what  is  going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing  exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Reporter Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] All human activities -- and foreign policy decisions  are human -- are subject to error. This obvious premise leads us  to a thorough analysis of the foreign policy we have implemented  for more than three decades. We can say that Cuba has never been  mistaken about the cardinal principles that rule its behavior in  relation to other nations, states, or governments. Among these  principles, as a basis of its policy, we can mention a respect  for truth regardless of circumstance.    Over the past few days, on 10 and 11 February specifically,  certain incidents took place around the U.S. Interests Section  in Havana, incidents of which our people are well aware, that  seek to create artificial tension in an effort, through  manipulation, to counterbalance the growing acceptance by  international public opinion, governments, and institutions of  the obvious truth that the blockade against our country is  unjust, immoral, and not good for anyone's legal interests; that  it is an obsolete expression of the Cold War, of arrogance,  intransigence, and intolerance on this, the eve of a new  century, and is a special challenge for all of mankind. This  same behavior reflects the biased, unjust, and often  extortionist attitude of imperialism toward human rights.    Cuba has extensively revealed all details as well as its  interpretation of the incident without any sign of arrogance,  but on the contrary, with the composure and firmness with which  it acts in this and other more tense, more complex  circumstances. Cuba reasserts that the incidents reported and  publicly analyzed by JUVENTUD REBELDE in its Sunday issue are a  faithful reflection of the truth.    It is not by fomenting violence, by violating the security  of  diplomatic or consular offices, or others of similar status,  that differences or conflicts are solved, nor do we contribute  to international peace and security. Cuba honors its  commitments, and faithful to the principles followed by Marti,  respects the truth.    The facts are well known. Those, once against caught  redhanded, responsible for these actions should reconsider their  serious misconduct. If they believe they are even partly right,  they should have no fear of admitting their ideas within the  framework of equality and mutual respect with which  international relations treated. On the contrary, they should at  least have the sense of decency to remain silent, because in  this case as in others, silence implies consent.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Foreign Affairs: Wake up, Europe - The EC is once again famous for its internal divisions and its failure to develop coherent international policies Three or four years ago it was great to be European. People from other continents treated you with respect, interest, even envy. Americans and Japanese asked earnestly about '1992', meaning the completion of the single market. One could reassure them, with just a whiff of noblesse oblige, that their fears of 'fortress Europe' were largely groundless, while privately hugging oneself with pride at the thought that they actually cared. And then there was all the excitement about change in the east. The collapse of east European communism was widely attributed to the contrast between its conspicuous economic failure and western Europe's success. East Europeans were eager to join or re-join the 'Europe' to which they felt they belonged - the one represented and symbolised by the European Community. Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be European was very heaven. Alas and alack. The picture is different now. It has become quite embarrassing to be European at a gathering such as the one I attended last week, the biennial 'Atlantic Conference' organised by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, bringing together Europeans and North and South Americans. Believe it or not, this is 1992 and the single market is about to be completed. But that no longer seems to count for much. The EC is once again famous mainly for its internal divisions and its consequent inability to do anything constructive in relations with the rest of the world. German unification, mismanaged economically for lack of political courage, has imposed deflation on the whole of Europe at a time of recession. The European Monetary System, from which realignments had been effectively phased out as a step towards a single currency, has contributed to rigidity at a moment when flexibility is needed, and two currencies have fallen out of it. The Maastricht treaty, intended to transform the EC into an economic and political union, has instead led to acrimony both between member states and within them. Differences among member states and within the European Commission are generally held responsible for failure to conclude the Uruguay Round trade talks, and for the possibility of a trade war between the EC and the US. Worst of all, western Europe has failed conspicuously to respond to the challenge of events in the east. I was invited to the conference to present a paper on the theme 'Western Europe looks east: what role in central and eastern Europe?'. What could I say? I presented once again my argument for a strategy aimed at extending the EC gradually eastwards by opening it up to all those states which can realistically aspire to associate with western Europe rather than with Russia, and at developing friendly relations between this whole area and the zone to the east of it within the framework of a pan-European security structure, based on Nato and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). In other words, an 'ever closer union' of Europe from Dublin to Lublin, within a broader security zone from Vancouver to Vladivostok; in economic terms, an integrated single market within a European free trade area. I ran through my programme of economic, military, institutional and political measures aimed at realising this ambitious scheme, and found that they went down better than I expected - especially the idea that the various things being done for eastern Europe should be brought together in a multilateral, Marshall Plan-style 'joint recovery programme', which would give recipient states an incentive to overcome their differences, and so give private investors greater confidence in the economic and political environment. Some constructive modifications were suggested. It is vital, I was told, not to appear to treat Ukraine as 'a Russian problem', because a Russo-Ukrainian conflict could be the most dangerous for the rest of Europe. Even within the narrower Europe a distinction needs to be made between economic issues, where the EC has to take the lead, and military ones, where a US role, through NATO, continues to be vital. And a distinction needs to be made between north-central Europe and the Balkans. The former is already the scene of promising economic and political developments and has hope of qualifying for EC membership around the end of the century. In the latter the only immediate issue is halting and preventing war. Unfortunately all this is based on a false premise. Western Europe is not 'looking east'. Not only has the EC not developed a strategy along the lines suggested, but its capacity to develop any strategy at all seems to have collapsed. Instead of finding ways to embrace and stabilise the countries suddenly released from communism, it has watched impotently while bitter ethnic and national conflicts resurface and degenerate into spreading violence. Here, too, the EC's internal divisions have caused paralysis and have been exacerbated as member states blame each other for the disasters in former Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, the influx of refugees exacerbates social tensions and stimulates the rise of xenophobic extremism at home. No European leader has set out clearly for his electorate the nature of the opportunities and dangers which events in the east have produced for western Europe. As a result, it seems that none now has the authority to demand the sacrifices required from domestic vested interests, notably the farming and other producer lobbies, which oppose the opening of the west European market to the most competitive east European products: coal, steel, textiles and food. To outsiders, western Europe presents a remarkably unattractive spectacle as 1992, supposedly its year of glory, draws to a close. We look like selfish children squabbling among ourselves, ignoring the problems of neighbours who, for the most part, are much worse off than us. At last week's conference, one US speaker condemned the 'appalling lack of leadership and will' which Europe has shown in response to the Yugoslav crisis, while a South American referred to 'a degree of autism', an insistence on repeating the same answers to radically new and different questions. It looks increasingly likely that Maastricht, even if the right answer, is the answer to the wrong question. At the core of the treaty is monetary union, based on a plan drawn up before the events of 1989-91 transformed the whole geo- political context, and of dubious relevance to the new and urgent problems in the east. Tacked on to it is the idea of a common foreign and security policy, which is indeed what the EC needs but which the treaty as signed would hardly make any easier to produce. But having got this far it would certainly be better to ratify the treaty and move on to more important business. As it is, the EC looks all too likely to spend another year discussing the decision-making process when what is needed is some actual decisions.</p>

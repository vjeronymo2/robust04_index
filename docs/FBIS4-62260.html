			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Germany by L. Ogorodnikov and V. </F> Kondratyev; from the "Ostankino" newscast]    [Text] [Ogorodnikov] The second day of the Russian  president's visit to Germany started in the German Government  guest house in Petersberg, a Bonn suburb, with meetings with  Rudolf Scharping, Social Democratic Party chairman and prime  minister of Rhineland-Pfalz, and Johannes Rau, minister  president of North Rhine-Westphalia.    [Kondratyev] Both politicians aspire to the highest posts in  the state. Rau has chances of replacing Richard von Weizsaecker  as federal president as early as 23 May and Scharping is  aspiring to the post of Helmut Kohl himself in October of this  year. This meeting, apart from a discussion of topical  political problems, undoubtedly gave the Russian president the  opportunity to get better acquainted with the way the mechanism  of interrelations between the ruling parties and the opposition  functions in a democratic state.    [Ogorodnikov] Two hours later Boris Yeltsin and Aleksandr  Shokhin held talks with Theo Waigel, chairman of the Christian  Social Union and federal finance minister. The head of the  German Finance Ministry said that the problem of Russian foreign  debt was discussed -- it is assessed at 87 billion German marks  -- and also the possibilities of changing the mechanism of  granting Russia new credits. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister  Shokhin said that an accord has been reached on Germany granting  a 500 million [currency not specified] preferential loan for  purchasing railway cars from the former GDR. A big question  mark hangs over many other projects, inasmuch as Russia does not  intend to settle in hard currency or oil and is offering in  exchange deliveries of military equipment, in particular MiG-29  fighter aircraft. Officially Bonn's attitude to this an  approach is fairly skeptical.    The military theme was also discussed in Petersberg today.  Defense Minister Grachev stated this in an interview with the  Ostankino TV company; he provided a few details of the  discussion of the August ceremony between the leaders of the two  countries.    [Kondratyev] At this point the official part of the stay in  Bonn has been completed. A program is beginning which could be  described as lightweight. The point is that Helmut Kohl invites  those to whom he wants to show his special liking to  Rhineland-Pfalz, the region of his birth. There, in a cozy  litte restaurant and in the chancellor's private residence,  partaking of Kohl's favorite dishes, the statesmen are  continuing the conversations begun in Bonn.    [Ogorodnikov] These meetings, rare and unusual in West  German  politics, and the heightened marks of attention must show, not  so much, as they put it here, the male friendship between  Yeltsin and Kohl as the fact for Russians that Germany regards  Yeltsin as the guarantor of market reforms and that warnings  alleging that after the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Germany the German leadership will turn its back on Russia and  will not take it seriously are unfounded. Yeltsin himself, in  turn, who is in every possible way demonstrating his good  relationship with the chancellor, said that he believes in  Helmut Kohl, in his honesty and decency. The process of the  genuine reconciliation of the two great peoples after the  withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces will enter a new era.</p>

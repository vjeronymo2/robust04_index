The two politicians discussed the serious tensions  between Skopje and Athens, which even exacerbated after the  imposition of the Greek embargo. Kinkel expressed understanding  of the attitude of the FYROM not to negotiate under the pressure  of the Greek embargo, the Foreign Ministry announced after the  meeting. However, it is important to prevent another increase  in the tensions and to also show understanding for the Greek  worries regarding territorial claims against the neighboring  province of Macedonia "by clarifying the situation."    Gligorov, who privately attended a European forum in Bonn  for  three days, stressed his readiness for negotiations without any  preconditions at a news conference on Wednesday [16 March].  However, it is out of the question to comply with Greek wishes  for bilateral talks on the name of Macedonia used on both sides  of the border, because no results have been achieved in the past  two years. Now an overall package for this internationally  recognized FYROM must be presented at the negotiating table,  Gligorov pointed out.</p>

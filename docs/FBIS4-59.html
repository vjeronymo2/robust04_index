			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [31 March] the  imposition of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu would be  perceived as an invasion and would render free and fair  elections impossible.    He said the declaration of an emergency proved the  constitutional process was flawed, adding it marked another  "chapter of oppression".    Troops pouring into kwaZulu would be seen as an "invasion".    "We'll see it as an invasion especially if... soldiers and  army tanks will be rolling in here. It looks like an invasion...  as if we're being forced by the barrel of a gun."    Interviewed at a Durban hotel after a telephone conversation  with State President F.W. de Klerk, who announced the state of  emergency on Tuesday [as received] morning, a solemn Mr  Buthelezi said he was "not happy with it at all".    "I would understand his actions if he... considered  postponing elections for a month or so," said Mr Buthelezi.    "I can't see how elections can be free and fair under a  state  of emergency."    "I told (Mr de Klerk) it was embarrassing," he said,  explaining he was surprised at the declaration before next  week's summit meeting between himself, Mr de Klerk, African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini.    "It's sort of humiliating. People won't understand it on the  ground," he said.    "I believe tanks will be rolling in, coming from all over,"  he added.    Mr Buthelezi said the emergency appeared to be a "form of  duress for those of us who don't want to participate".    "I think this vindicates the point the IFP made: that the  constitutional process was flawed... that's why we could not get  our people to participate (in elections).    "Everything that has happened completely justifies our  stance  and it vindicates us."</p>

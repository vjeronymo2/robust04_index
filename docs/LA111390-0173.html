			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGING YOUR MONEY;  </P> <P> IN CLOSING;  </P> <P> ALL THIS TALK ABOUT MONEY . . .  </P> <P> There was a time, not long ago, when it was still taboo to talk about money.  The subject was right up there with race and class: pervasive, but unfit for  polite dinner con versation.  </P> <P> Then something happened. Things changed. And what I wanted to know was, when  did it become OK to talk about money? Stranger still, how on earth did it come  to seem mandatory?  </P> <P> The answer turns out to have nettlesome implications. Like any right-minded  moralist, I abhorred the Reagan-era obsession with precocious wealth and  corporate success. BMWs give me emotional hives. Suspenders are the devil's  plaything. All this talk of money makes me shudder.  </P> <P> I still hate the acquisitive mentality. But I've come to believe that all the  talk is something else again. I've come to believe the talk is -- dare I say  it? -- a very good thing.  </P> <P> The reason is simple. When nobody talked about money, there were really two  kinds of people: those with so much dough it didn't need discussion, and those  with so little there was nothing to discuss.  </P> <P> Things are different now. An awful lot of people have a little money. Sure, the  Reagan Administration made the rich richer at the expense of the poor and  middle classes -- in some ways, with their complicity. But even if the  concentration of American wealth has never stopped increasing, a huge middle  class somehow sprang up.  </P> <P> This vast bourgeoisie is a relatively modern product of everything from estate  taxes to World War II to a nation increasingly made and descended of  extraordinarily motivated immigrants.  </P> <P> Significantly, the investment opportunities of this middle class have exploded.  </P> <P> Through mutual funds, the smallest savers have access to investment  opportunities previously restricted -- by tradition, fees and secrecy -- to the  rich. An article in this newspaper recently explained how someone with $1,000  could easily assemble a diversified portfolio reaching from Treasury bills to  gold. Another reported that money managers catering to the very rich don't  particularly outperform funds open to any Joe or Jane Saver right off the  street -- good news to the 23 million households investing in mutual funds, up  400% in just a decade.  </P> <P> Not only does this help make capital markets efficient. It also makes them more  democratic. What we have witnessed, in fact, in accelerating fashion since the  Depression and with steps backward only in the 1980s, is the increasing  democratization of money in America -- something we all favor in principle but  don't always like in practice.  </P> <P> Telling people not to talk or think about money is like telling slaves to wait  for heaven in the afterlife, or schoolteachers not to form unions. The stupid  fact is that money is indispensable, not only to survival but for the leisure  to create laws, art and so forth. Civilization would dry up without the stuff.  The miracle is not that we talk about it. It is that, for so long, we didn't.  </P> <P> So when did all this change? My friend Joe Nocera, who is writing a history of  personal finance, pinpoints a single year. In 1972, he notes, the money market  mutual fund was born, which enabled the average saver to earn an unregulated,  market return, and what was then Time Inc. created Money magazine, which  "brought money out of the closet."  </P> <P> The forces that got us all talking about money are manifold. Joe's favorite is  inflation during the Nixon and Carter years. With prices and interest rates  going haywire, these became a subject of obsessive concern. John Updike's  "Rabbit Is Rich" captures the period beautifully.  </P> <P> A related factor is the enormous increase in real estate prices in the past  couple of decades. The deregulation of bank interest rates played a role, as  did the astonishing bull stock market.  </P> <P> The growth of personal credit was equally astonishing and important. Trusty old  M1, the favorite money-supply measure of Econ 1A, was nearly destroyed as a  meaningful figure by money market funds and a zillion credit cards. Remember  the old saw about the tidal wave that might result if everyone in China jumped  off a chair simultaneously? Well, imagine what would happen to the velocity of  money if every middle-class American whipped out the plastic in his pocket and  simultaneously charged it to the hilt. All of us now have the power to create  money; we're like walking Federal Reserve Banks.  </P> <P> Let's not forget women. The democratization of money included jobs for them,  and increasingly, equal pay for equal work. Except for the odd paradox that all  these new workers may have contributed to a price structure that makes two  incomes seem mandatory, more women have become masters of their own finances.  And since money is, to an unfortunate extent, destiny, they were suddenly  masters of a lot more.  </P> <P> Good for them. Good for everyone. If we have to hear a lot of boring talk about  money, well, personal freedom is not without its modest price. Anyone who  thinks we overlook the Bronte sisters because we're obsessing over money is  crazy. Being poor certainly won't help Johnny read, success in school being  correlated to family income. More important, shutting up about money won't make  anyone better off.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Arts: Warning, music can damage your health - Muscle strain, alcoholism and stress-related illnesses are afflicting British orchestras Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast, to soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak, said Congreve. But it can have the opposite effect on the player. The pressures of finding and keeping work in music, maintaining tough practice regimes and keeping anti-social hours can have serious implications for the physical and psychological health of a professional musician. Cast an eye over the orchestra at the next concert you go to. Look at the strings and pity the poor viola player: a questionnaire circulated recently among the string players in the major orchestras showed that 80 per cent of viola players suffer from upper limb disorders. Many, because they usually sit in front of the brass, have damaged hearing from years spent in the firing line. Brass players have their own serious (and common) problems, usually to do with the embouchure. Players in their thirties and forties often experience inexplicable and hard-to-cure muscle control difficulties which make it hard to reach the higher notes. Look at the soloist: so severe is stage fright for 15 per cent of orchestral musicians that they routinely take beta-blockers to steady the hands when performing. In every symphony orchestra, an average of four members will be fighting alcohol dependency, acquired in an effort to drown stage fright. Dr Ian James, a consultant physician and clinical pharmacologist at the Royal Free Hospital in North London, runs the performing arts clinic there. He holds one session a month, which is consistently overbooked and currently has a three month waiting list. Most of the cases he sees, if not directly related to 'nerves', are exacerbated by the psychological pressures of the job. Clearly, worries over funding, the threat of mergers and closures and changing standards of orchestral playing are not helping: 'Musicians can't afford to wait for treatment. They work in a competitive environment and will not take the night off for fear of losing their place. They live in a closed community, practising by day and playing by night.' A helpline set up earlier this year by the British Performing Arts Medicine Trust (BPAMT), which Dr James helped found, takes up to half a dozen calls per day from musicians with occupational health problems. The majority of these calls are from people suffering from muscle pain in the wrist, shoulder and fingers. Upper limb pain, sometimes inaccurately referred to as RSI (repetitive strain injury), is a common problem, especially among string instrumentalists, guitarists and pianists. Dr James believes the causes of musculo-skeletal disorders in musicians have as much to do with technique and anxiety as the repetitive nature of say, violin playing (six hours practice a day is the average for string players) or the working environment. Pit orchestras, such as the English National Opera, have special problems, elbow room being in short supply. Surprisingly, Dr James does not prescribe rest and splints for upper limb pain but is more likely to suggest corrective measures for bad posture - the Alexander technique or the Feldenkrais method, for example. He will also try to find the cause of muscle tension: incorrect technique, or anxiety are likely causes. 'But don't stop playing - play to the point of pain every day,' he advises. Upper limb pain is not confined to stressed out professionals, however. Alex Scott, administrator of the BPAMT, is concerned at the number of young musicians and students who seek counselling through the helpline: 'We encounter talented teenagers who are forced by parents and teachers to practise too long without a break. Apart from the direct physical implications of playing so much, it means that the youngster is not doing other exercise or satisfying other social needs.' But it is the professionals who suffer most for their art. And with too many musicians chasing too few jobs, most are reluctant to take their problems to management or campaign for better working conditions. 'Concert schedules are particularly demanding in the UK,' says Dr James, 'Compared to European orchestras, ours play twice as many concerts but have a quarter of the rehearsal time to get it right. If a musician can't withstand that kind of pressure then they're out.' Often, the anxiety is contagious. Dr James has found instances of a new, dynamic principal joining an orchestra whereupon the rank and file of the same section immediately succumb to musculo-skeletal disorders. 'Similarly, we recently found that a group of young sufferers coming to the clinic had the same tutor in common - and he himself had a problem with muscle pain too,' Dr James says. Patients contacting the BPAMT or attending the performing arts clinic are assured confidentiality and will benefit from more specialised knowledge and sympathy than a GP can offer. But Scott says that increasingly health authorities are refusing to pay for extra-contractual referrals to special clinics like Dr James's and the trust is examining ways of overcoming this reluctance. Classical musicians employed by the major orchestras have a better chance of specialist consultation though. The trust, backed by the Musicians Union, has recruited a network of 35 volunteer doctors and now each orchestra has two specialising doctors assigned to it. The trust also takes the lead in promoting better workplace conditions. Noise induced deafness among brass players and percussionists is a prime concern, especially in the confines of a pit orchestra. The trust is undertaking research work to design an ear protector which excludes damaging frequencies without impairing the ability to play. But it is stress, and its physiological manifestations, which beset the majority of professional musicians at some time. 'The pyschological pressures faced by professional musicians have become enormous,' says Dr Kenneth Lewis, who is attached to the LSO on a voluntary basis. More secure than most, the LSO is a happy orchestra he says, but still he attends to a string of stress-related problems - from asthma and difficulties with circular breathing to fingers made slippery with anxious perspiration. 'The question all musicians ask themselves each night, is 'will this be my last job?'' Dr Lewis says, 'and that affects both their playing and their health.'</p>

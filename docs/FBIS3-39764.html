			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis left this  morning on a working visit to Germany. Mr. Mikhailidhis will  hold talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel and other  members of the government. The main topics of the talks will be  the latest developments in the Cyprus issue and Cyprus'  application for accession to the European Union. Mr.  Mikhailidhis will also meet with former German foreign minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher.    In a statement at Larnaca Airport, Mr. Mikhailidhis referred  to the first phase of the proximity talks, saying that we cannot  say that any progress has been made. He added: Consequently,  we did not move at all.    However, Mr. Mikhailidhis noted that it is premature to say  that we have been reached a deadlock. He added: We should give  every chance to the UN Secretary General's representatives to  hold meetings with their contacts. The next meetings will be  very critical, he said, and it will become obvious from the  beginning whether there are any prospects or not. Mr.  Mikhailidhis further noted: We want to cooperate in  implementing the [confidence-building] measures but we do not  want to enter a useless and endless dialogue, and that is what  will happen if we leave critical issues pending.    Responding to a question on whether the United Nations will  submit new ideas in the next phase of the talks, Mr.  Mikhailidhis said: As is natural, after experiencing two  meetings at which there was substantive disagreement on the  critical issues, the UN Secretary General's representatives will  seek ways to put the entire process in motion and it is possible  that they will proceed with recommendations and advice  addressing these issues.</p>

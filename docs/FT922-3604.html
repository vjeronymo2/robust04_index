			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on tram funding TOWNS and cities hoping to install modern tram systems similar to that recently opened in Manchester have been told by the Transport Department that their plans will have to wait. They have been been given advance warning by Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, that the autumn public-spending round will contain no money for any new schemes to go ahead in the next financial year. The principal victim of the crack-down will be the West Midlands, which had hoped to get the go-ahead for Line One of the Midland Metro from Birmingham to Wolverhampton. Midland Metro had already received Pounds 4.5m in government grants for preparatory work on the line, and felt confident that the government would give it the money to start construction next year. Other towns and cities facing postponement of their projects are Nottingham in the east Midlands, Leeds in West Yorkshire and Croydon, Surrey. The planned Sheffield supertram system in South Yorkshire, however, will proceed as planned because construction has already started. Mr Freeman's announcement of the cash freeze on new tram projects is an early indication of the pressure which spending ministers will face in this year's spending round. There are fears in the public transport sector that rail, bus, tram and underground projects will be squeezed to preserve the Transport Department's Pounds 2bn-a-year roadbuilding programme.</p>

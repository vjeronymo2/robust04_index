			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Taking a laid-back attitude to marketing - Airsprung Furniture turns in 8% increase to Pounds 2.5m despite 'fierce competition' Airsprung Furniture, the UK's second-largest bed manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits by 8 per cent from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 2.5m in the half year to September 30. Turnover grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 33m with operating profit rising to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 2.2m). Earnings per share improved to 6.41p (5.91p) and the interim dividend is increased to 1.7p (1.575p). Mr John Pierce, chief executive, said: 'There has been some of the fiercest com-petition we have seen for some while, with no help from the economy and everybody slugging away for market share.' Since the start of the recession, and despite the weakness of the housing market, rising sales have resulted in an increase in the company's workforce from 1,200 to 1,550 over the year. After Silentnight, Airsprung sells the most beds in Britain, with about 15 per cent of the Pounds 350m market. Its relative anonymity, compared with Silentnight and smaller companies such as Relyon, is a consequence of its strategy to let the retailer do the marketing. 'We don't believe in branding - it is the retailer who controls what the customer buys,' said Mr Michael Coppel, joint chairman. 'We divert all marketing and support to the retailer. Brand imaging would cost us Pounds 2m a year and someone has to pay for it.' The strategy avoids an expensive advertising contest, which would not increase the overall market. Beds are a 'distress purchase' - nobody buys one until it is essential. Despite severe competition at the quality end of the market, Airsprung's bedding sales were up by 12 per cent in the half-year. But profits suffered in the upholstery division - which accounts for nearly a third of group sales - because of squeezed margins and bad debts. There was a profits improvement in the smaller pine furniture division. Airsprung, with its origins dating to the 19th century, is still 42 per cent owned by the family of Mr John Yates, grandson of the founder, but has only had a full listing since 1991. In management changes this summer, Mr Coppel became joint chairman, with Mr Yates and Mr Pierce succeeding Mr Coppel as chief executive. Mr Mark Hudson, small companies analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'It is not run as a family fiefdom; it is run as a very professional public company.' The company, based on a 28-acre freehold site in its home town of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, has expanded in recent years by acquisitions of such businesses as Duckers, the pine furniture maker, and Gimson &amp; Slater and Bymacks, the upholsterers. The subsidiaries are given as much autonomy as possible. Mr Coppel said: 'We won't buy a company if it doesn't have good management - which we retain.' 'The subsidiary management is like the board management - very conscious of costs, quality and servicing the customer and, if you get all that right, you've got a very successful company. ' As part of the control of costs, staff are trained to have at least two skills, so that if work is slack in one area they can transfer to another. Stocks of finished goods are not held, but made to order, with MFI supplied with its own-label beds in nine days. This year, Pounds 1m has been spent on a distribution centre at Trowbridge. Given that there can be no rapid increase in the bedding market, Airsprung seeks to grow by improving market share and further acquisitions. It wants to be less dependent upon bedding and expand its upholstery and pine divisions, although upholstery is vulnerable to the low-cost of entry into the market. 'It is a constant battle which has a depressing effect on prices,' Mr Pierce said. The manufacture and retailing of beds and furniture is, however, undergoing a similar restructuring to the food industry, favouring larger companies with national distribution. 'The industry dynamic is towards the players who can deal in volume and can make the capital investment that is required to be cost efficient,' Mr Hudson said. 'The small companies will increasingly become niche players supplying niche retailers.'</p>

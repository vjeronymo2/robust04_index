			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY ENDS ITS SUMMER CONCERTS WITH -- LITERALLY -- A BANG  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony closed its summer series on Saturday with a Tchaikovsky  evening marked by grace, good humor and a few theatrics. And, oh yes, there was  some stylish music as well.  </P> <P> Some of the lighter moments of the event, at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre,  were intentional: John Santana, late of KFAC (or should that be of the late  KFAC?), announced that there would be a much-beloved mystery guest conductor  for the introductory "Star-Spangled Banner." It was he -- and he was a lusty  leader at that.  </P> <P> Some of those lighter moments were not intentional: overzealous applause  between the second and third movements of the "Sleeping Beauty" suite prompted  the entire Huntington Beach Concert Band to emerge prematurely for the "1812"  Overture that was to follow.  </P> <P> Conductor Toshiyuki Shimada good-naturedly turned them back, then signaled the  audience to expect two more movements from the ballet piece.  </P> <P> The ensemble was frequently infected by Shimada's energy, and in the ballet  suite and the "1812" Overture in particular, it paid heed to his commands for  expression.  </P> <P> Occasionally, however, the ensemble did not heed their conductor's indications,  allowing, for instance, a tubby string accompaniment to overshadow Leanne  Becknell's elegant oboe solo in "Capriccio italien."  </P> <P> Oddly, Shimada was not consistent in his demands for expression. In the opening  Allegro of the Piano Concerto in B-flat minor, he failed to persuade the  orchestra to match the expressive level of soloist Leonid Kuzmin.  </P> <P> Kuzmin executed the crowd-pleasing chordal passages with bravura and elan, and  he seemed to take much more enjoyment in the music than did his more sober  colleagues.  </P> <P> The microphone arrangement also conspired against advantageous balance in the  concerto. As on previous occasions this summer, a microphone was aimed directly  into the piano, permitting it to dominate at all times. In the second movement,  every twitter in the piano overshadowed solos within the orchestra.  </P> <P> The "1812" Overture, plumped up with the band, cannons and fireworks, left the  9,138 attendees literally shaking in their seats.  </P></p>

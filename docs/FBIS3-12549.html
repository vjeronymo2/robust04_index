AL-AHRAM warns that the coming stage might witness further  tension in the territories and that extremist elements on both  sides will get involved. Israel must show more flexibility in  handling the circumstances if it wants peace and if the region  is meant to see that peace in the foreseeable future, it says.    The paper calls on the Israeli Government to confront the  Israeli terrorism with the same enthusiasm and firmness with  which it confronts what it terms terrorist operations by  Palestinians. The paper adds that the Israeli settlers'  terrorism has exceeded all bounds.    AL-AKHBAR says the Israeli Government will be unable to wash  its hands of the blood staining them. The Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre will remain a sign of disgrace that time will not  erase, no matter how hard Israel tries to absolve itself of the  responsibility, the paper says.    It adds that the Israeli Government's insistence on refusing  to disarm Jewish settlers--despite all the crimes and those that  will take place--reflects how Israeli officials belittle the  lives of the Palestinian people, the legitimate owners of the  land.    AL-AKHBAR adds that the UN Security Council is asked to send  an international team to investigate this massacre, uncover its  real motives and circumstances, and determine the extent of  Israeli army involvement. The Council must also send  international troops to protect the inhabitants of the occupied  Palestinian territories to avoid a recurrence of such a heinous  crime, the paper stresses.

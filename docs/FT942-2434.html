			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Natural gas to double market share by 2010 Natural gas is forecast to more than double its share of the electricity generating market in western Europe to 20 per cent in the next 15 years at the expense of coal, oil and nuclear power. The International Union of Electricity Producers and Distributors (Unipede) forecasts that gas growth and increased efficiency in power production should lead to a 15 per cent fall in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of electricity between 1990 and 2010. Demand for power is also likely to grow more slowly as fuel efficiency measures take effect. Unipede puts the annual rise at 1.8 per cent between 1990 and 2010, against 3.4 per cent in the previous two decades. Growth will be considerably more marked in southern Europe than in the north. Unipede's forecasts are published today as more than 1,000 mainly European delegates meet in Birmingham, England, for the union's week-long triennial conference. The growing use of natural gas has been prompted by economic and environmental considerations. In most countries power stations fired by combined cycle gas turbine technology produce cheaper electricity than new plants using coal and nuclear power energy. Unipede forecasts that nuclear power's share of the market will fall from 34 to 31 per cent between 1990 and 2010. Coal is predicted to suffer the biggest decline, from 37 to 29 per cent, and oil to drop from 10 to 6 per cent. Gas is expected to rise from 7 to 20 per cent. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 43 per cent during the two decades. Within the overall increase, the share of domestic and agricultural sectors is expected to remain at about 25 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. The share of demand from services is expected to rise from 22 to 26 per cent but industrial consumption is forecast to fall from 44 to 40 per cent. Although there is currently a surplus of electricity generation in western Europe, Unipede expects the total to grow by about a fifth from the current 500 gigawatts.

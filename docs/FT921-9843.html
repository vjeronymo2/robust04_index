			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Royal Bank may sell Charterhouse - Merchant banking no longer considered a core activity THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland may sell all or part of Charterhouse, its merchant banking subsidiary which wants to expand on the continent. Royal Bank bought Charterhouse in 1985 and has invested a total of about Pounds 200m in it, but merchant banking is no longer regarded as a core activity. Mr George Mathewson, recently promoted to chief executive of the Royal Bank, said yesterday this view had come out of the restructuring announced in late 1990. To enable Charterhouse to pursue its ambitions on the continent, 'there may be a change of ownership structure'. But this should not be seen as putting the merchant bank up for sale. He stressed that Royal Bank did not need to sell to bolster its financial position. 'We have the second strongest balance sheet in the UK banking sector.' Charterhouse, which is London-based, has retained much of its autonomy. 'That's the secret of its success,' he said. In the restructuring it was kept separate from the group's corporate and institutional banking division. Mr Mathewson said Charterhouse had proved a good investment. The idea of bringing in a continental partner was not based on any failure. In the year to September, the merchant bank contributed Pounds 38.5m to group profits before provisions of Pounds 428.7m. Its share of the Pounds 359.5m charged for bad debts was Pounds 18.6m. Net of this, Charterhouse's total of Pounds 22.3m was down from Pounds 48m the previous year. Its continued profitability contrasts with TSB's experience with Hill Samuel, although since TSB bought the merchant bank for Pounds 777m just over four years ago, it has lumped in with it all of its lending to companies. Mr Victor Blank, chairman and chief executive of Charterhouse, said the sort of partner being looked for was a big bank in Germany or France. It already had development capital and other activities in Spain, Sweden, France, Germany and Italy. The new move could involve the partner taking a stake - not necessarily a controlling one - or buying it outright. Alternatively a joint venture might be set up, although Mr Mathewson said it was highly unlikely that any more money would be invested by Royal Bank. While there have been 'a couple of exploratory discussions' in the past, no negotiations are currently taking place. To buy the merchant bank, Mr Blank said he did not know whether the multiple of capital would be '1, 1 1/4 or 0.8. We're in recessionary times and there aren't many buyers around.' Such a multiple would be based on Pounds 187m of disclosed capital plus 'some hidden reserves'. Before the recession, in November 1989, Deutsche Bank paid Pounds 950m for Morgan Grenfell, which made Pounds 57.2m pre-tax profit that year. After a 19 per cent profit fall in 1990, Morgan Grenfell said its returns were measured not by the Pounds 950m purchase price, but by the Pounds 350m of capital in it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Alexey Bukalov, Alexey </F> Golyayev, Ivan Ivanov, and Sergey Startsev]    [Text] Rome January 27 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin ended talks with his Italian counterpart  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Thursday [27 January] by signing a  package of bilateral agreements, including a statement of the  Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Italy.    At a news conference after the talks, the Russian and  Italian  premiers expressed satisfaction with the state of bilateral  ties, stressing that both countries have big potential for their  development in the future.    Ciampi said he was pleased to hear from his Russian  counterpart that there will be no backtracking on reforms in  Russia. He admitted that Russia is facing certain difficulties  which are inevitable on the way towards a free market economy.    Chernomyrdin said that the upcoming G-7 summit meeting to be  held this coming summer and to be attended by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin should begin the transformation of G-7 into G-8,  at least on a political level.    Both prime ministers had discussed various aspects of  cooperation with international organisations, including the  European Union and NATO, paying special attention to the  Partnership for Peace programme. The sides also focused on  bilateral trade and economic relations between Italy and Russia,  prioritising cooperation in power engineering and oil and gas  production.    "As for Italy and Russia, our business is going pretty well.  Italy is our second largest, after Germany, trade partner in  Europe. We have signed such contracts with it, of which not  every country can boast. For example, a contract with the group  ENI to modernise gas pipelines in russia is estimated at about 2  billion U.S. dollars. In return, Italy will receive extra six  billion cubic meters of gas annually," Chernomyrdin said.    Ciampi told ITAR-TASS that Italy supports reforms in Russia,  stressing that the boosting of energy production and energy  exports are vital for the Russian economy.    Speaking about Russia's position on the Bosnian settlement,  Chernomyrdin said that this topic had not been discussed during  the talks. He pointed out to Russia's desire to settle the  conflict in the Balkans as soon as possible by using "civilised  political methods." "In this respect the positions of our  countries are close," the premier said.</p>

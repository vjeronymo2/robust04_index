			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: Diary of a French civil servant - David Marsh questions the memory of President Mitterrand's right-hand man VERBATIM by Jacques Attali Fayard, 958 pages PRECISION, shrewdness, ability to concentrate on essentials: one would expect to see a combination of all these characteristics in a top civil servant. The same attributes, coupled with a head for figures, might be found in a president of an international development bank. And they would surely be necessary qualifications for a writer who attempts to explain a tortuous period in European history. When Jacques Attali, former senior adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, now president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), publishes a diary of the first five years (1981-86) of the Mitterrand era, the reader might, therefore, expect a feast of insight. There is, indeed, plenty of information, spread over 958 pages. We read transcripts from summit meetings, blow-by-blow tales of Elysee Palace in-fighting, and President Mitterrand's views on life, death and Margaret Thatcher. The president is always strikingly well-informed about world affairs. Ronald Reagan, for instance, tells Mr Mitterrand in a letter on March 23 1983 about the strategic defence initiative ('Star Wars') programme. Mr Attali neglects to say that Mr Reagan also let a few million others into the secret in a televised address that very same day. The fare has the appearance of sumptuousness, but the trail of left-over political souffle from the top tables at which Mr Attali has supped (and taken notes) is often disappointingly thin. Where Mr Attali shows precision, his procession of details tends to ramble. And where he seeks to demonstrate shrewdness, the effect is undermined by question marks over whether he has got his facts right. The most interesting parts of the book have much relevance to current French events: the tale of 1982-83 wrangling in the Socialist party over the government's battle to keep the franc in the European Monetary System. In other areas, however, there are far too many misspellings of foreigners' names, especially Germans. It is not unusual for a senior functionary to bring out an inside view of the bastions of power. In 1991, Horst Teltschik, Mr Attali's opposite number in the Bonn chancellor's office, published a day-by-day account of the scramble towards German reunification. Mr Attali's Verbatim, however, is in a class by itself, for three reasons. First, the book is foolishly pretentious. Mr Attali, who for a decade guarded the entrance to the president's office, writes in the preface that he saw it as his 'duty' to print a historical record of Mr Mitterrand's actions. A sequel is in store: this is just Volume One. Mr Attali gives his personal guarantee of accuracy. 'I was the only person to hear many of the remarks which I relate here, and my word thus stands alone against all denials.' Curiously enough, within a few days of the book's release, four former French ministers queried different parts of Mr Attali's account. The second lacuna applies to Mr Mitterrand. Irritatingly, though perhaps understandably, Mr Attali avoids fleshing out his portrayal with the detail that would enable readers to penetrate the presidential mask. Mr Mitterrand is quoted in abundance, always on matters on which he is wholly right. Mr Mitterrand's powers of prediction were on display back in 1981, when, according to Mr Attali, he told Chancellor Helmut Schmidt that the Soviet Union would collapse before 1996. When the Soviet empire actually started to tumble, between 1989 and 1991, Mr Mitterrand seemed curiously taken by surprise. That was, presumably, simply an example of the wily old fox trying to throw observers off the scent. Mr Attali has caused a stir by including some opaque Mitterrand reflections delivered to the author and Nobel prize winner Mr Elie Wiesel, who complains he was reserving them for his own book. With artistic licence, Mr Attali records the remarks as being made several years before they were uttered, on the grounds that they related to matters on which the president does not change his mind. Mr Mitterrand is asked, for instance, about his boyhood: in passages of endless variety, he describes how he was a lonely youngster who liked country walks. With promising material like this to work on, it is small wonder Mr Wiesel's own book has been a long time in the making. The third reason why Mr Attali's tome is remarkable relates to the author's present functions. Civil servants who write memoirs - provocative, amusing or revelatory - generally do so after retiring from public office. Mr Attali's account appears while he is halfway through a four-year term as head of an international bank funded by taxpayers. Civil servants are not journalists. Mr Attali's eagerness to lift the lid on life in the fast stream can hardly increase anyone's desire to tell him anything in confidence. Does Jacques still take his jotter whenever he jets off to Azerbaijan, ready eventually to reveal the inside story of his struggles on the eastern front? At least, if further Verbatims are in the making, we can rely on Mr Attali one day to tell us what really happened in the EBRD audit committee.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Comic strip cesspools, used as metaphors for humiliation, and tattered  crocheted toys that whittle away at society's sexual role playing make up the  recent handiwork of artist Mike Kelley. Weird yet amazingly familiar, his  drawings and objects nag at the human conscience by using things from everyday  life rather than the realm of high art. In his hands, the Sunday funnies and  all the stuff grandma ever knitted the kids for Christmas become part of a  larger narrative. It's a raucous conversation packing a truck load of  disappointment in the human condition.  </P> <P> Kelley clothes his moral dissatisfaction in an irreverent Benny Hill attitude  that takes aim at all sorts of structures of supposed superiority. Even the  whitened sanctuary of the gallery is not immune. This exhibit is hip deep in  thrift shop bargains. The floors and walls are littered with used, handmade  stuffed toys roughly sewn and bound together in a "Manly Craft" parody of the  womanly arts. The brutality of the gesture forcibly confronts social attitudes  towards masculinity, craft, play and sex. In Kelley's art every hand-stitched  memento comes with an emotional edge of controlled violence rather than  romantic nostalgia.  </P> <P> Kelley's hokey, tattered materials return art to the immediacy of the real  world just as the cartoon drawing's irreverence uses art to question the value  of human life and the nature of dignity. Part of the enjoyment of his work is  that it deals so intelligently with vital issues of ethics and morality -- even  if they do come wrapped in a Hefty cinch sack like a muttering street person.

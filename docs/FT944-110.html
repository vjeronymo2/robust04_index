			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper ends with a flourish The London Metal Exchange copper contract finished 1994 with a flourish in yesterday's shortened trading session. The three months price touched a 5 3/4 -year high of Dollars 3,032 a tonne before ending at Dollars 3,022, up Dollars 10 from Thursday and about 75 per cent on the year. In ignoring a second successive rise in LME warehouse stocks and resisting the temptation to indulge in an end-of-year sell-off the copper market encouraged hopes of fresh highs being reached in the first half of 1995, before increased supply begins to hit the market in the second half. 'We remain very friendly towards copper for another four or five months,' brokerage house Merrill Lynch, told the Reuters news agency. Aluminium ended virtually unchanged on the day, despite news of another big fall in LME stocks, but traders predicted that the market could build on its 74 per cent 1994. They warned, however, that the longer term prospects for aluminium prices depended on whether producers maintained the production cuts implemented under the 'memorandum of understanding' agreed early this year. A second-half price surge put the nickel market into the frame in the 1994 LME stakes. Ending just short of the Dollars 9,000-a-tonne resistance area the three months delivery position registered a 69 per cent rise on the year; and dealers thought any substantial retracement was unlikely while uncertainty persisted about Russian shipment levels. In contrast, the gold market ended a disappointing year with a fall towards its Dollars 382-a-troy-ounce support level. Early hopes of a decisive break through the Dollars 400 barrier persisted for much of the year in spite of repeated disappointments. But analysts were yesterday keeping a low profile on prospects for 1995. After seeing the price end in the middle of its Dollars 370-Dollars 395 trading range, and down about 3 per cent over the 12 months, most were content to point to the Far Eastern demand underpinning the market, without seeking to encourage any bullish hopes. In terms of its overall price gains the London Commodity Exchange's robusta coffee market has been London's star performer in 1994, nearby positions ending with net rises of about 135 per cent. But at Dollars 2,822 a tonne the second position was more than Dollars 1,200 off the nine-year peak to which it was driven by the two damaging frosts and a subsequent drought that hit Brazil's growing regions in the third quarter. A post-Christmas rally was trimmed back yesterday morning when end-year book-squaring lopped Dollars 54 off the March delivery position. LCE white sugar futures were marking time yesterday at the end of a year that saw nearby positions surge 44 per cent to 4 1/2 -year highs. At Dollars 405.20 a tonne the May delivery price was about Dollars 10 off the peak, however, and there was concern that a big decline could ensue when US investment funds decided to take their money elsewhere. The uptrend that attracted the funds into this market was prompted by successive scalings down in production forecasts and expectations of big purchases by China and Russia. But London broker C. Czarnikow said recently that these countries would probably stay out of the market until well into next year, and the International Sugar Organisation warned that present high prices could 'dry up physical demand from the price-sensitive importers which account for the lion's share of the world sugar trade.'  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium        -16,850  to  1,674,650 Aluminium alloy      -40  to     30,480 Copper            +4,525  to    301,850 Lead              -3,775  to    343,425 Nickel              -444  to    148,392 Zinc              +2,900  to  1,185,200 Tin                 -250  to     28,105  --------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, Dec. 22 (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)  said today that he is expecting a response from the United  States to DPRK's new proposal over the disputed nuclear issue.    He told reporters that the two countries were in contact on  Monday [20 December] in New York and the DPRK had put forward a  new plan in view of the U.S. suggestion proposed on 10 December.    The spokesman, releasing no details of DPRK's proposal, said  nevertheless that it was ``reasonable'' and would  ``satisfactorily help solve the nuclear problems on the Korean  peninsula.''    The DPRK and the U.S. have failed to reach any agreement  during their regular ``contacts'' throughout December.    Meanwhile, the United Nations Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali is reportedly traveling to the DPRK on Friday  following his visit to the Republic of Korea.    He is the first UN chief to visit DPRK in the past ten years  and is expected to hold talks with DPRK leaders on the  deadlocked nuclear issue.</p>

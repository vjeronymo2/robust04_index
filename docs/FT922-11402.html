			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Food &amp; Drink: A Bordeaux worth watching - The little-known Cotes de Francs IN ALL but name, the Cotes de Francs are part of the Cotes de Castillon plateau, a mere six miles to the north of Castillon-a-Batailleon on the Dordogne. To the east they look across to the Dordogne department. On the west lies the satellite St Emilion commune of Puissegin. With only 500 hectares of vineyards, 20 estates, a small 40 member co-operative, and an average production of 20,000 hl, it is nearly the smallest of the Bordeaux AC districts centred on red wine. There are only three villages, almost hamlets: Francs, St Cibard and tiny Tayac. Until recently there was a fourth, Les Salles, which included the prominent Ch Belcier, owned by the Massif insurance company; but in 1989 Castillon secured the right to drop the word Bordeaux from its label, Les Salles joined it, and Belcier voluntarily followed it. A mistake, say some of the Francs growers - who tend to regard themselves as a little superior to their neighbours. Yet the Cotes de Francs came to the fore only recently. Although an ancient vineyard area, it suffered the same near-oblivion as the Cotes de from the phylloxera era. Its appellation, Bordeaux Cotes de Francs, was granted in 1967, when it chose to retain Bordeaux on the label in the belief that, in the ever-growing world of wine, association with Bordeaux established a certain identity. Although similar to Cotes de Castillon wines, with the same clay-limestone soil and Merlot-Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon vine composition, there is rivalry between the two. Whereas the much larger Castillon is content to be included, by the Conseil Interprofessionel in Bordeaux, as one of the Cotes group such as Bourg and Blaye - one class up on generic Bordeaux  - Francs claims that it is remote from these bigger districts, and that its wines are different. (This is certainly true.) It says it is really part of the Libournais. Traditionally it was, with wines similar to St Emilion, as in adjoining Puissegin. In time, it hopes to persuade the authorities to accept this alliance. Nevertheless, the development of the Cotes - described by one vineyard proprietor as 'the last revolution in Bordeaux' - has been unusual, a state of affairs mainly set down to the distinguished Belgian wine merchant family of Thienpont. The head of the family, Georges Thienpont, had bought in 1924 the leading Pomerol estate of Vieux Ch Certan, still owned by the family. In 1946 his son, also Georges, bought a large mixed farm in St Cibard, and in 1980, on the clay-limestone plateau, he planted 30 ha of the common blend of 50 per cent Merlot, 30 per cent Cabernet-Franc and the rather large percentage of 20 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon in the hitherto neglected vineyard of Puygueraud, which is now run by his son, Francois. This was followed, in 1984 - by planting in the same village  - 10 ha of La Claverie and, in Francs in 1988, 5 ha of Charmes-Godard - both of them in the hands of another son, Nicholas. Moreover, in 1985 Francois Thienpont persuaded two of his friends, Dominique Hebrard, son of the former director of Cheval-Blanc, and Hubert de Bouard, son of the owner of Angelus also in St Emilion, to buy for a modest sum the large, ancient semi-ruined Chateau de Francs and its ill looked-after vineyard, planting 30 ha of Merlot (60 per cent) and 20 per cent apiece of the two Cabernets. The cellars have been restored, but the boarded-up chateau awaits a buyer. Finally, the migration from St Emilion was followed by Patrick Valette, whose father owns Pavie, to 11 ha of La Prade vineyard in St Cibard. So a good deal of viticultural experience has been injected into the tiny district. (It is only fair to add that excellent wine is also made elsewhere here: for example in Moulin-la-Pitie and Massau, while the co-op produces a superior, pal-matured Duc de Seignade brand) Another speciality of the Cotes is an AC which includes white wines, sweet as well as dry, neither of which is allowed in the Cotes de Castillon nor, of course in the large St Emilion area. So far, only Francs and Charmes-Godard have produced a dry white wine, for the Semillon and Muscadelle grapes. The 1990 was the first vintage produced in very small quantities: aromatic, oaky wines of considerable body and flavour, very much on the lines of the 'new wave' dry white Bordeaux. The sweet whites, only to be expected in very fine years, will be awaited with considerable interest. The red wines are deep in colour, often rich on the nose, and concentrated on the palate: real mouthfuls of wine. The leading vintages are '83, 85', '86, '88 and '89. When in bottle, the '90 may well be exceptional. Puygueraud is what the French like to call the 'locomotive' of the district. It's reputation began with the '85, although, surprisingly, its '83, (from only three-year-old vines) was remarkably successful. The vintage probably at its peak is the '85. Of the wines I sampled on my recent visit, the '86 of Francs (its first proper vintage) had lots of body, and so did the '88, along with Moulin-la-Pitie and Puygueraud. The La Prade '89 had an elegant nose and long flavour, though the Francs, because of its prolific Merlot, was softer. The '89 is now widely on offer there but, like the '88, is not to be opened for at least another two or three years, because they both are quite tannic. On British lists, the Cotes de Francs are even rarer than the Cotes de Castillons; few Bordelais or British merchants visit them in any depth. But with the high-flyers of the Medoc, and St Emilion increasingly expensive, demand should rise for the relatively inexpensive, stylish Cotes de Francs wines - although with nearly half still sold in bulk to the Bordeaux trade, and thus losing its identity in blends, there is some way to go. Much will depend on the enterprising immigrant proprietors. On lists now, Stokes Fine Wines, London, SW9 (tel:071-582-9265) offer Francs '88 at Pounds 84 a case; Tanners of Shrewsbury (0743-232400) have Lauriol '88 at Pounds 4.28 a bottle; Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark, London SW8 (071-736-7878) list La Prade '89 (Pounds 55.80 a case); and Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester (0206-764446) offer La Prade '90 ex-cellars when bottled, at Pounds 43.92 a dozen - a duty-paid price of about Pounds 66 a dozen bottles.</p>

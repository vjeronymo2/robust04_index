			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Trying hard but could do better, says World Bank: Report for the 1990s calls for overhaul of the legal system and significant reforms in other areas For nearly a decade Mexico has been the model pupil of the World Bank, following its advice on economic policy and receiving in return subsidised loans of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year, more than granted to any other middle-income country. The bank played a crucial part in Mexico's decision to join Gatt in 1986, the restructuring of its external debt in 1989, and the redesign of environmental policy two years ago. Bank economists were powerful and successful advocates of the liberalisation of Mexico's agriculture sector. The bank has now prepared a restricted circulation report on the economic challenges Mexico faces in the 1990s. While largely praising economic policy to date, the bank calls for a sweeping overhaul of Mexico's legal system and important reforms in the labour and financial sectors, environmental policy, and provision of public infrastructure. The bank is worried about Mexico's slow economic growth and low savings rate, which it believes makes its economy over-dependent on foreign capital. It concludes that the high current account deficit and modest improvements in productivity 'raise concern about the sustainability of economic growth'. The low economic growth is largely attributed to the 'substitution of foreign goods for domestically produced goods'. This it believes is a result of the low competitiveness of Mexican companies, partly because their old technologies have become obsolete and new investment has replaced existing capital stock rather than adding to it. Specifically, the bank calls for further economic reform in four areas to remove constraints on economic growth. The report is highly critical of Mexico's legal system, concluding that 'weaknesses in the commercial law framework and the mechanism for the resolution of disputes constitute important constraints to private sector development.' The report recommends new laws on secured transactions, which would make it easier for banks to take possession of property when a borrower has defaulted. Such a reform should lower Mexico's high financing costs, a principal complaint of Mexican companies. The bank says 'the resolution of disputes through the courts is a lengthy, costly and unpredictable process'. It blames this in part on an 'unacceptable level of competence and integrity of the judges, especially in the local court system'. Suggestions for reform are vague, but include a national training institute for judicial personnel and the establishment of an authentic civil service in courts at state and federal levels. It proposes reforms to encourage the provision of binding private-sector dispute resolutions. The bank says Mexico faces two key labour challenges - increasing the quality of its work force, and establishing a flexible labour market. On the first, the report says the problem 'is the low and disparate quality of the educational system, and especially of basic education'; the failure of Mexican companies to train workers sufficiently holds back productivity growth. Mexico's labour market is regulated by antiquated labour law that makes it costly to dismiss workers, exhorts companies to promote according to seniority rather than ability, and makes it difficult to move workers between jobs, the bank reports. However, the bank says the main problem is not exactly the law but agreements companies have reached with unions. The law allows for some flexibility, but how much depends on the ability of management to win concessions from the unions. On infrastructure, the bank approves of the government's move to let the private sector build and finance toll roads, electricity plants, water systems and provide telecommunications, but is critical of the way the policy has been carried out. The bank calls for more competition, or regulation where that is not possible, in the provision of infrastructure. It says the manner in which toll road concessions have been granted needs to be improved, further deregulation and privatisation is needed in railways, and an independent regulator should be established in both telecommunications and the electricity market to prevent monopoly abuses. On environmental policy, the bank describes the government's threat of closing polluting plants as costly, ineffective and arbitrary, since it gives the government too much discretion in responding to businesses' environmental violations. Instead it says the government should rely more (as it is now doing) on mandatory fines for lack of compliance. It recommends economic incentives, such as taxes on polluting inputs and outputs and higher prices on natural resources, rather than command and control regulations, as a way of improving the environment. Overall, the World Bank says Mexico has been a pioneer in private-sector-led development, and gives the government high marks for stabilising the economy. However, it evidently believes the government still has to draw up and enforce laws that foster competition and efficiency in the private and public sector and allow benefits of economic reform to filter down to consumers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 11 Mar (DPA) -- Replying to Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori's remarks of 10 March, President  Sixto Duran-Ballen reiterated today Ecuador's willingness for  dialogue and cooperation with Peru as a mechanism to resolve  "pending territorial issues." Commenting on Fujimori's remark in  Santiago, Chile, saying "the territorial issue between the two  countries is a settled matter," Duran-Ballen said: "There are  two viewpoints on the territorial issue between Ecuador and  Peru."    According to a communique released in Quito today,  Duran-Ballen said: "Dialogue can help us attain the greatest  possible rapprochement and understanding between the respective  positions of both countries." The Ecuadoran president is in  Santiago to attend Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei's  swearing-in ceremony.    Peru says the territorial disputes between the two countries  were settled through the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, but Ecuador  questions the protocol's validity due to the special  circumstances under which it was signed in January 1942 and  because the protocol is nonexecutable as the result of its  inherent geographical errors.    Duran-Ballen and Fujimori were scheduled to meet in Lima by  late 1993, but an alleged disagreement on the agenda prevented  setting the date for Duran-Ballen's trip, which is still pending  and which would be the first one to be made by an Ecuadoran  president to Peru in the two countries' nearly two centuries of  independent existence.</p>

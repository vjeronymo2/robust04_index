			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Yeltsin takes firm line in Moscow power struggle RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin last night met his arch rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, in the first round of bargaining towards a truce in their power struggle. Mr Yeltsin suggested that he would press on with preparations for a referendum on whether the president or parliament rules the country, just in case the parliamentary speaker failed to keep his side of any bargain. The stand-off over the referendum, which is opposed by Mr Khasbalatov, will continue during two further meetings next week. Mr Yeltsin may drop the referendum proposal if Mr Khasbulatov agrees to stop trying to cut back Mr Yeltsin's powers until they are defined by a new constitution. 'There are two options, either a referendum or a new agreement between (the executive and the legislature) with strict guarantees,' he told a cabinet meeting. 'To drop one or the other would be a big political mistake.' While they met, a Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, called for a 'moratorium on inflationary actions' by the government, parliament and central bank. The cabinet yesterday adopted an anti-inflationary package, vowing to restrict money supply growth to 10 per cent a month and inflation to 400 per cent a year. He did not say whether it had the support of the central bank, which has presided over very fast money supply growth over the past year. Although Mr Yeltsin cited the ailing economy as the best reason for a deal with Mr Khasbulatov, he has been driven into a corner over the poll by both the parliament and the autonomous republics within the Russian Federation. For a start, he cannot guarantee that a referendum would ask the question he wants - do you support the president or the parliament? This is because a compromise at the Congress of People's Deputies last December did not specify what the poll would be about, and allowed both parliament and president to submit alternative lists of questions to the electorate. Parliament's constitutional committee has come up with a list of 11 obscure questions on the details of a new constitution, while Mr Khasbulatov has also proposed a 12th question on whether the electorate wants fresh presidential and parliamentary elections. A poll could also undermine the unity of the Russian Federation if leaders of Tatarstan, Yakutia, and other semi-independent republics go through with their threat to boycott the referendum. Some observers fear this could accelerate a break-up of the federation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of the definition for ``model year'' would clear up a drafting error which has existed since the last time the HIN regulations were amended in 1984. Finally, removal of the references to ``State Boating Law Administrator'' in 33 CFR 181.31(c) would allow States which use their Department of Motor Vehicles as vessel numbering and titling authorities to issue HINs to individuals building their own vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following discusses the proposed changes to 33 CFR part 181: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (a) ``Model Year'' Definition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``model year'' would be removed from &sect;181.3. Up until 1984 the regulations allowed for two methods of indicating the date of manufacture in the last four characters of the 12 character HIN. When those two formats were devised, it was the Coast Guard's understanding that the new model year would not commence prior to August. Some manufacturers complained that they wanted to vary the introduction date of the new model year from year to year, but that they were prevented from doing so by the HIN regulations which defines model year as the period beginning August 1 of any year and ending on July 31 of the following year. The Coast Guard amended the HIN regulations in 1984 to give vessel manufacturers the freedom to designate model year in the HIN as they requested. The Coast Guard amended &sect;181.25(a) to require characters 11 and 12 to indicate the model year using the last two characters of the model year such as ``84'' for 1984. However, due to a drafting error, the Coast Guard failed to delete the outdated and superfluous definition of ``model year.'' The proposed amendments would remove the definition of ``model year'' from part 181. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Incorporation by Reference <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following material would be incorporated by reference in &sect;181.4: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 3166 ``Codes for the representation of names of countries.'' International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 1073/I&hyph;1976 ``Alphanumeric character sets for optical recognition_Part I: Character Set OCR&hyph;A_Shapes and dimensions of the printed image.'' Copies of the material are available for inspection where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the material are available at the addresses in &sect;181.4. Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard will submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register for approval of the incorporations by reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ISO Standard 3166 contains two character alphabetic codes which would be used to indicate the ``country code'' in the expanded HIN. ISO Standard 1073/I&hyph;1976 prescribes shapes and sizes of alphanumeric characters for optical character recognition (OCR) systems, which means that the characters are both human and machine readable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Nineteen Character Hull Identification Number <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing Hull Identification Number (HIN) is a unique 12 character serial number required on each recreational vessel manufactured in or imported into the United States for the purposes of sale. The Coast Guard assigns the first three characters, a Manufacturer Identification Code (MIC) which identifies the manufacturer or importer; characters four through eight are a manufacturer serial number; characters nine and ten indicate date of certification for vessels subject to safety standards or the date of manufacture for vessels not subject to standards; and characters eleven and twelve indicate the model year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two serious problems involving the current 12 character HIN format. Thieves can alter an HIN and ``launder'' a stolen vessel in States with ineffective titling and registration programs. Similarly, the last four characters in many HINs are fraudulently altered as a means of misrepresenting vessels as ``newer.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As early as May 1987, the National Auto Theft Bureau (NATB), which is supported by more than 600 casualty insurance companies, recommended that the Coast Guard adopt a 17 character HIN format (similar to the format required for the Vehicle Identification Number [VIN] on an automobile) as a means of detecting and deterring vessel theft. Each VIN contains certain characters which describe features such as body style and engine type which are specific to the automobile to which the VIN is assigned. A VIN also contains a check digit which assures the integrity of the other characters in a VIN. According to the NATB and officials of the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA), the additional HIN characters would lead to increased recovery of stolen vessels and more successful enforcement efforts, thereby deterring would-be thieves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

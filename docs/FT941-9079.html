			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at The Equitable US insurer The Equitable yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 83.9m. The result showed further recovery from heavy losses in previous years, incurred on soured property and junk bond investments. In the same quarter a year ago, the company, which is 49 per cent-owned by the French insurance group Axa, reported a loss of Dollars 28.9m. The strong final quarter took The Equitable's full-year profits to Dollars 234.5m, compared with a Dollars 128.6m loss in 1992. The key to its recent successes has been the improvement in core insurance business. Excluding the impact of investment gains and restructuring charges, the insurance operations earned Dollars 116.9m last year, up from operating earnings of Dollars 46.9m in 1992. The company said aggressive cost-reduction, and a lowering of crediting rates - made possible by the low interest rate environment - were the main factors in the turnround. They helped offset higher-than-expected mortality rates in the second half of the year. Mr Joseph Melone, president of The Equitable's Life Assurance Society, singled out the success of the company's targeted insurance products. During the year, 94.5 per cent of new sales came from these lines, he said. The Equitable's investment services operations contributed operating profits of Dollars 235.9m during the year, thanks to record earnings at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street brokerage unit. Solid growth at its Alliance Capital money management firm has helped. On the investment side, the income yield on The Equitable's main general account portfolio rose from 7.46 per cent to 7.64 per cent last year. The increase was attributed to improved returns on property and equity holdings, and a shift of cash and other short-term assets to longer-term bonds offering higher yields.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Discount rate cut hits dollar THE DOLLAR fell sharply after the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 5.5 from 6.0 per cent yesterday. US President George Bush appeared pleased with the move. He said that 'this will stimulate our economy' as it climbs out of recession, and added that commercial banks are expected to follow suit with rate reductions. By the time of the London close a small but leading US provincial bank, the Southwest Bank of St Louis, had lowered its prime lending rate to 8 3/4 from 9 per cent. Economic news also tended to push the dollar down, US factory orders showing a fall of 2.8 per cent in March against a February decline of 0.6 per cent. The Chicago Purchasing Management Association Index fell to 42.1 from 45.9 per cent, ahead of today's release of the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index, indicating that the important industrial area of northern Illinois and northwest Indiana remains in recession. At the London close the dollar had dropped to DM1.7170 from DM1.7690; to Y136.30 from Y137.60; to SFr1.4490 from SFr1.4840; and to FFr5.8025 from FFr5.9650. Its index fell 1.3 to 65.9. The D-Mark improved across the board after Mr Horst Koehler, German Finance Ministry state secretary, said in Washington that he does not expect the Bundesbank to cut rates. He said this before the US move, but sentiment in Frankfurt suggests that Germany is still unlikely to ease policy in the immediate future. In London the D-Mark rose to Y79.40 from Y77.80 against the Japanese currency, to FFr3.3795 from FFr3.3720 against the French franc and to L739.65 from L738.25 in terms of the Italian lira. A senior official at the Bank of Japan indicated that his country has no plans to match the US rate cut. Earlier in the day Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japanese finance minister, said Japan has no need to change its monetary policy. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark was steady around the middle of the system. The Spanish peseta remained the strongest member and the French franc the weakest. Sterling eased to fourth from third strongest position in the ERM, trading below the peseta, Italian lira and Belgian franc. The pound improved against the dollar and the Japanese yen, but otherwise showed mixed changes. The US discount rate reduction led to an easing of wholesale rates in London, and the market was nervous ahead of tomorrow's local government elections in England and Wales. These may provide guidance on the timing of the next UK general election. Sterling rebounded 4.70 cents to Dollars 1.7240. It also rose to Y235.00 from Y230.75 and to SFr2.4975 from SFr2.4875, but dipped to DM2.9600 from DM2.9675 and was unchanged at FFr10.0025. The pound's index gained 0.7 to 91.4. In New York sterling finished 75 points higher at Dollars 1.7315.</p>

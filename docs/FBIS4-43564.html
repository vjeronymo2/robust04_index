			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe by </F> correspondent Claire Chazal, in Paris -- live]    [Excerpts] [Chazal] Good evening, Mr. Juppe. You returned  less than an hour ago from Africa. Can you tell us whether you  think the United Nations Security Council will vote on Tuesday  [21 June]?    [Juppe] [break in transmission]...oppose such an initiative.  I am confident about the first stage in establishing this  difficult and dangerous operation.    [Chazal] In any case, France cannot go it alone?    [Juppe] To stress the humanitarian and international nature  of this operation we hope to go in with others. You were saying  that I have just come back from Africa: I visited Cote d'Ivoire  and then Senegal. Senegalese President Diouf confirmed that he  was ready to establish a contingent of Senegalese troops  alongside the French ones.    The unanimous reaction among African countries--I managed to  see all our ambassadors in the region--is favorable. We are  finding support on that principle among European countries. I  hope that in the next few days we will manage to convince our  partners to join with us.    [Chazal] Could France go in even if no other European or  western country went in with her?    [Juppe] We hope that other European countries will come with  us. Italy has said that it will put itself at our disposal. In  the next few hours or days we shall exercise our diplomatic  activity to try to convince those who recognize that something  has to be done--the pictures we have just seen demonstrate  this--and that France, of course, cannot do everything by itself.    [Chazal] Concretely, once the decision has been taken, how  long will it take to send the troops, and how many men can be  sent there?    [Juppe] I am sure you will understand that I will not give  you details of a number of issues: how many men, or what the  procedures will be, for an operation which, even its aim is  exclusively humanitarian, is an operation which is putting  soldiers' lives at risk. A certain amount of discretion is  needed. So all this will be arranged if the resolution is  passed on 21 June, or 22 June at the latest, and if we manage to  get our various partners to move, I think things can move very  fast, sometime next week.    I would like to stress that we are making a lot of effort to  convince the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] that the operation is  not directed against them. This week we shall have contacts  with the Rwandan prime minister appointed by the Arusha accords,  in other words the one recognized by everyone. We also have  contacts on the ground--the person we have just seen, Mr.  Larome--who heads the crisis unit of the Foreign Ministry, is on  the ground, to try to get our humanitarian aid through. We  shall also have contacts in New York, and again in Paris, with  RPF officials.    [Chazal] If France sends soldiers to Rwanda, those troops  will likely have a difficult mission. The rebels on the ground  are hostile to the arrival of French troops. They accuse France  of having helped the regime of President Habyarimana--who was  assassinated on 6 April--for four years. [passage omitted]    [Chazal] Mr. Juppe, it is true that this mission appears  particularly difficult in this context.    [Juppe] It is difficult, but I am astonished to see the  number of lies you can read in the press about what has happened  over the past few years. France is blamed for having supported  President Habyarimana, as if he were responsible for what is  happening today. I would like to remind you of a simple fact: he  is dead. He was assassinated. Now we have the extremists, whom  he was actually holding back, and on whom he had managed to  impose the Arusha accord of July 1993--which was welcomed by  everyone as an accord for reconciliation including by the RPF;  it was thanks to him that this was done.    I think that this way of assuming the worst about France,  accusing it of being responsible, directly or indirectly, for  what is happening, is intolerable, and has nothing to do with  reality.    [Chazal] Is it too late to intervene now, several months  after the beginning of this terrible crisis? Could we have done  it earlier, or have demanded this intervention before?    [Juppe] First of all, throughout 1993, as I have just said,  we gradually brought about the reconciliation process of July  1993. Then there were French troops preparing for the arrival of  the RPF in Kigali to join the government--this has been  forgotten. This all seemed to be working. Reconciliation was  under way, power was being shared out. This assassination  happened about two months ago and threw everything into turmoil.  We reacted immediately with humanitarian aid, trying to get a  cease-fire brought about by the major states of the region, and  asking the United Nations to bring a force of 5,500 men. What  did we see? That nothing happened. That the cease-fire was not  respected, that the UN force was not coming. It was at that  point that we said to ourselves: We can't go on waiting for  these decisions to be implemented, France must set an example.    People are saying it is too late. Who has done it before us?  Who today is claiming to move faster than us? Not many people  in the international arena.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Kuat power generation company has issued a  progress report for May. In comparison with the previous months  of the current year, electricity production fell to 846 million  kWh. Nevertheless, it is more than for the same period last  year.    Owing to fuel shortages the electricity plants are running  into hardships, with most production accounted for by the Naryn  cascade, which comprises five hydroelectric power stations  working at full capacity. Two power generating units function  at the Shemyldysayskaya plant, which is still under  construction. The Republic plans to generate about 11.5 billion  kWh this year.</p>

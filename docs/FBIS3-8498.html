For the government, the adoption of the budget in a certain  sense signifies a vote of confidence in the policies it is  following. However, this vote is also an occasion for  considering certain problems and the main directions of the  government's activity in 1994.    First, one should stress that the present government was  elected by the National Assembly on 30 December 1992 on the  basis of its declared program at the time, which in its  principal directions remains in force even now, insofar as no  party or parliamentary group in the majority coalition (after  having been publicly invited to do so on two occasions in recent  months) has so far declared that it wants any adjustment to the  government program in terms of retracting or amending any of the  main directions for the national economic and domestic policies  that were formulated on 30 December 1992. In this connection I  am bound to state firmly that several statements by certain of  our opponents are completely groundless; these statements claim  that the process of restoring land titles has stopped and is  being blocked throughout the country; that certain basic  restitution laws are about to be repealed; that preparations are  being made to settle accounts with members and sympathizers of  the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], and so on. These are  propaganda ploys. The government has never considered doing  this, and will never allow such things to be done. They are  wasting their time in trying to scare people with such bugbears  as the possible restoration of the old nomenklatura to leading  posts in state service and the enterprises, the restoration of  the old labor cooperative farms, an alleged plot against private  business, a realignment of foreign policy, and an assault  against the judiciary.    Many criticisms can be leveled against the government, and  it  will accept them; nevertheless, the government is bound strictly  to observe the laws and the democratic principles of the  political system embodied in the Constitution -- the principle  of the separation of powers, preservation of human rights, and  so on, based on which a democratic political and economic reform  is being carried out in the country.    Against the background of the adopted 1994 budget and the  continuation in force of the government program of 30 December  1992, I must state that during the coming spring months the  government will concentrate its efforts in the following fields:    1. Improving the administration of state property and  privatizing this property according to the law and the specific  program approved by the National Assembly. This will be  achieved by tightening the state's requirements relating to the  existing supervisory boards of state companies by consistently  applying Council of Ministers Decree No. 17 of 1994 and directly  linking the remuneration of the board members with the financial  and economic results achieved for each quarter by the  enterprises under their supervision. A considerable number of  privatization transactions have already been initiated. In 1994  it is planned to privatize 320 state enterprises, using the  existing, mainly market methods of privatization. When the  National Assembly completes the second reading of the mass  privatization program (often referred to as the social  privatization program), which has a schedule with a deadline of  August this year, a further 507 enterprises will be privatized.  These make up almost 40 percent of the total capital held by the  existing state companies. All this will be one of the main  prerequisites for a turnaround of the national economy and  starting the economic revival.    2. The government is drafting a scheme of incentive  measures for private business (which will not have a negative  effect on the state budget and not involve any granting of  public money either directly or indirectly.)    This scheme will include a package of measures to stimulate  the domestic markets for a number of industrial and agricultural  products, measures for encouraging exports, measures to provide  low-cost credit facilities for small and medium-sized businesses  through the relevant fund formed under the international  programs that have been worked out, and so on. The measure will  be directed more toward private businesses in the production  sector, because so far those with private capital have mainly  preferred to invest their money in trade and other forms of  middleman activities, which does not help to increase the GDP.  I have often stated publicly that the government has given and  will continue to give a helping hand to representatives of  private business who, while pursuing their normal desire for  profit and furthering their personal interests, commit  themselves to sharing the fate of the people around them and  help to achieve specific tasks of nationwide importance.    3. The government is working on additional measures in the  field of social policy during the period of the structural  reform. For example, additional compensation will be provided  for consumers of thermal energy in the larger towns, in  connection with the sharp rise in the cost of this service.  Every quarter, pensions will be indexed in line with the  expected consumer price index, not according to the index of the  preceding quarter, and the state system for monitoring prices of  essential goods will be extended in scope.    4. Now that the budget has been adopted, as of today a  system of measures takes effect that is designed to free the  country from its relative financial isolation that it has  suffered until now. This will be achieved by resolving the  problems regarding the necessary payments of settlement, with a  view to finalizing the interim agreement on the foreign debt  that has already been signed, increasing the inflow of foreign  investments, providing state help for those wishing to enter new  foreign markets, and so on.    5. One of the government's main tasks will be to restrict  inflation further, bringing it down from the 64 percent  experienced in 1993 to 40-45 percent or lower in 1994, which  will be a step toward the financial stabilization of every  Bulgarian family.    I consider that all the foregoing clearly outlines the  directions of the government's activity in 1994. Some people  continue to stake their bets on a confrontational, black against  white conception of the political situation and the country's  political future. Such a primitive use of a formula that is  already outdated for Bulgaria does not lead to the development  of a stable state policy during the period of transition. I  think that, at the present political juncture and in the present  difficult economic situation, a neutral, broadly based  government of experts without any party bias is best able to  preserve political and social equilibrium and lead the country  to a brighter future.    Our government has demonstrated that it can work on a  professional basis, and it will continue to work with all the  political forces that have constructive attitudes and are able  to suggest pragmatic solutions in the general national interest  and for Bulgaria's prosperous future.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tripoli Libyan Television Network in  Arabic at 2022 GMT on 8 January begins broadcasting a recording  of a speech by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi on 5 January  to the residents of Abu Salim during his visit there.    Al-Qadhdhafi begins his speech by thanking the audience for  a  warm welcome. He says he values the courage displayed by the  masses in this area against the possibilities of confrontation  with the enemy and coping with economic sanctions. He  underlines the fact that many tribes in Libya used to boast  about how many martyrs they had given in their fight against the  Italians. Today, Libyans are facing a direct confrontation with  America and Europe. When you want to abuse someone you call him  a renegade, he says, but no Libyan family wants to bring up a  renegade.    Al-Qadhdhafi goes on to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood  and  other religious fanatics. He describes them as people who  reneged on Islam and the prophet's teachings. Foreign  intelligence agencies are behind these Islamic tendencies, he  states. The West wants Arab oil and it will do anything to get  it. During the life of the Prophet Muhammad none of these  Islamic movements existed. The Zoroastrians brought many of  their rituals into Islam in the early days of the faith --  things that are alien to Islam, he says.    There is a cold war going on today between the enemy and  Libyans, he continues. America cannot send its sons to Libya to  be killed, nor does it want to sacrifice its children on Libyan  soil. As for traitors, these are dealt with by the police and  the law, and the people set on them and burn their homes and  their farms. Treason is under siege by the Libyan people. No  one today can commit treason against the people and get away  with it, he concludes.    Al-Qadhdhafi goes on to say that the people of Abu Salim  represent the entire people of Libya from the point of Arabism,  patriotism, and other traits. The people of Abu Salim should  bring up their children the right way. The general people's  congresses are the place to make laws and to decide on many  issues. The important thing is that the people must consume  what they themselves produce and they must forget about  importing worthless European goods, he says. Libyans should  exploit all the potential they have at their disposal whether  industrial or agricultural. Every family should regard oil as  if it never existed in Libya and should therefore live without  its benefits. If the West does not want to buy Libyan oil, so  be it, he stresses. Libyans will not kneel or beg them to buy  the oil. Libyans should boycott Japanese goods because Japan  was one of the first to impose the sanctions, al-Qadhdhafi says.  Libyans fought against the Italians long before the Italians  started to export Italian goods and foods. Libyans should not  import anything from the West if the West keeps its hostility to  Libya, he concludes.</p>

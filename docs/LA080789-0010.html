			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SLIPS INTO THE MUD OF THE MAINSTREAM  </P> <P> News Item, July 27, 1989: The mayor of Atlantic City, N.J., a reformer who had  been swept into office on the heels of political corruption, was arrested for  bribery, conspiracy and official misconduct. Twelve other city officials were  also arrested.  </P> <P> "Atlantic City? Remember when we drove there in an ice storm?"  </P> <P> "No . . . yes. Pass the oranges, hon."  </P> <P> "Who runs the place if they jail the mayor and his cronies?"  </P> <P> "Pass the jam. New Jersey? You must be kidding. Some other bums. They're all  corrupt. I'm gone. Is the traffic moving on the San Diego?"  </P> <P> News Item: July 27, 1989: A Los Angeles City Council committee hears testimony  about an attempt to cover up facts surrounding a deposit of tax funds in a bank  that paid consultant fees to Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> As the '80s stumble to a close, cynicism overwhelms indignation. Isn't private  gain the name of the game throughout the land? Friends of the Department of  Housing and Urban Development are leaders in what everyone seems to be doing:  trading contacts and information for bucks. They make some calls, send a few  letters -- and line their pockets.  </P> <P> The former Florida Republican Party chairman helps steer a HUD low-income  rental project to Lufkin, Tex. Hard work, as he testified, since the HUD  headquarters is a "big building" and he "spent hours walking the halls." How  many hours exactly did he spend? One hundred, but not without compensation. In  fact, he bettered the minimum wage -- getting about $400,000, or $4,000 an  hour. This work did not divert him from his commitment to the homeless of  Jacksonville, Fla., which earned him another $100,000.  </P> <P> Everyone seems to benefit from these dealings -- at least everyone in  government. For city officials, alas, the gains are usually smaller, since the  spigots are narrower. Yet the figures bandied about Mayor Bradley seem  embarrassingly small. For $18,000 did our mayor really help direct city funds  to one bank? Surely a major metropolis like Los Angeles could do better. Where  are the HUD or Pentagon connections? Why should a Jacksonville, Fla., homeless  "consultant" humiliate Los Angeles officials?  </P> <P> We re-enter the world of that Baltimore iconoclast, H.L. Mencken; perhaps we  never left it. Mencken observed that Americans still insanely assumed that some  politicians were superior to others. "What is any political campaign save a  concerted effort to turn out a set of politicians who are admittedly bad and  put in a set who are thought to be better? The former assumption, I believe, is  always sound; the latter is just as certainly false . . . A good politician,  under democracy, is quite as unthinkable as an honest burglar." Politicians,  concluded Mencken, simply bilk taxpayers; they only seek to augment their  compensation to "all the traffic will bear."  </P> <P> We need Mencken today; he would have loved fat-cat homeless consultants and  jailed Atlantic City mayors (of the last six, four were arrested). Mencken  would have savored the spectacle of corrupt politicians swearing fealty to the  commonweal. Dissolute wheelers and dealers outraged at insults to the flag. He  would have enjoyed the tale of treasurers whiting-out documents; auditors who  cannot audit; investment officials pointing fingers.  </P> <P> But wasn't California supposed to be different, at least in myth? Wasn't this  the difference between Los Angeles and Atlantic City or Jersey City or Chicago?  The climate was milder, the land richer and the people friendlier and more  honest. In the 19th Century, visitors and settlers to California promoted a  vision of a better world; books like "California for Health, Pleasure and  Residence" (1872) by the New York journalist Charles Nordhoff and "Happy Days  in Southern California" (1898) by the Boston businessman Frederick Rindge  extolled a new and sweeter civilization.  </P> <P> Of course, it was a myth. Los Angeles was as mean and violent as any American  city. It still holds its own in poverty, racism and gangs. It is a world  capital of cranks and hucksters. Yet myths have lives of their own. If only a  myth distinguishes Los Angeles from Chicago or New York, this is something; the  myth sustains lives and hopes.  </P> <P> Bradley entered politics as a reformer pitted against the old guard, Sam Yorty.  "In Los Angeles today," Bradley stated in his 1969 mayoral campaign, "  'commissioner' has too often meant corruption. Briefings on zonings or harbors  have too often meant bribery. And civil servant has come to mean conflict of  interest." In Los Angeles today, these words still ring true. Of course, 20  years do not kill the myth of Southern California -- the orange groves, sun,  mountains, the sea, a better life -- but surely the vision is harder to grasp.  More than ever, pollution, violence and the seediness of local politics edge  Los Angeles into the mainstream of American life; that's no place to be.  </P></p>

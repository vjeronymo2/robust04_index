			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE BEDEVILS, FRUSTRATES HER CRITICS  </P> <P> It looked like the perfect setting Friday for a political flaying.  </P> <P> Democratic state Sen. Alan Robbins had finally managed to bring Roxani  Gillespie, the beleaguered Republican insurance commissioner, before his Senate  Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee to answer questions about delays  in implementing Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Robbins had also invited Gillespie's arch foe, Harvey Rosenfield, author of the  insurance reform proposition, to take part in the proceedings. Rosenfield, in  turn, brought along his close associate, Conway H. Collis, a member of the  State Board of Equalization, an insurance reform activist and a potential  candidate for Gillespie's job when it becomes elective next year.  </P> <P> Robbins noted in a news release announcing the hearing in the State Building  auditorium in downtown Los Angeles that Gillespie had canceled an Aug. 28  committee appearance "due to back pain."  </P> <P> Now, as a bank of television news camera kliegs bathed the participants in  glaring white light and reporters scribbled notes, Robbins observed, "I can  tell you from experience that going into a hearing with Mr. Rosenfield can be a  pain in the, uh, back."  </P> <P> "It's not that," replied Gillespie. "It's a generic back problem."  </P> <P> She apparently meant to say genetic. If so, it was perhaps her only slip during  the two-hour grilling. For when it was over, the imperturbable insurance  commissioner had once again managed to bedevil and frustrate her critics,  evading their questions, sometimes responding with non sequiturs and turning  their criticisms back upon them.  </P> <P> Of course, she has had practice. Gillespie, a former insurance executive, has  been under continuous criticism for alleged foot-dragging in implementing  Proposition 103 since it was passed by voters last fall.  </P> <P> Among its provisions, the measure calls for a 20% rollback of insurance rates  from the 1987 level and mandates that individual auto insurance rates are to be  determined mainly by personal driver records, limiting the weight given to the  geographical areas in which drivers live. Currently so-called territorial  factors are significant criteria in setting rates, resulting in urban dwellers  paying higher rates than drivers who live in other areas.  </P> <P> The issues were complicated in June when the state Supreme Court ruled that  insurance companies have the right to a fair return on investment. Gillespie  called Allstate Insurance Co. into the first of a series of hearings on the  fair return issue Wednesday but there was little progress. And the state  Department of Insurance has not yet issued any regulations on how individual  driver insurance rates will be set under provisions of the proposition.  </P> <P> "It has been nine months since the voters approved Proposition 103," Robbins  complained to Gillespie, whose job he had himself once considered seeking but  now says he does not want.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court stayed the matter until June, replied Gillespie.  </P> <P> "There was no stay to prevent you from thinking," shot back Robbins.  </P> <P> "Now wait a minute," the commissioner replied evenly, "if you're going to start  like that, this is not going to be a very nice hearing."  </P> <P> Both Rosenfield and Collis bore in on the commissioner -- citing a lawsuit they  had filed against Gillespie on Thursday -- demanding that the commissioner set  up a hearing to determine the elements of a fair rate of return for insurance  companies before dealing with individual firms and to begin setting criteria to  move away from the "territorial" system for driver rates.  </P> <P> Gillespie countered by calling her antagonists a "splinter group," because they  were not joined in their lawsuit by the Consumers Union, a major consumer  advocate in the case. "Apparently these folks would rather do what the  insurance companies do and sue," she said of Rosenfield and Collis.  </P> <P> She managed to reopen the debate over Proposition 103 as though it had not  passed and blamed Rosenfield with authoring a measure that she maintained will  cause an increase in rates for 70% of the state's motorists to make up for  decreases in some geographical areas.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid that what he is faced with," she said of Rosenfield, "is the  mistake he authored."  </P> <P> Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) a member of the Senate insurance committee and  another potential candidate for Gillespie's job, lending her a bit of support,  pointed out concern over a new rate structure among constituents.  </P> <P> But Doolittle added:  </P> <P> "Roxani Gillespie, rightly or wrongly, has been portrayed as the Leona Helmsley  of insurance."  </P> <P> Rosenfield and Collis replied that if the law is followed, good drivers will  receive lower rates and bad drivers higher rates regardless of geographical  areas.  </P> <P> Rosenfield pointed out in frustration that Gillespie was reviving arguments  that the voters had supposedly resolved with the passage of his proposition.  </P> <P> Robbins asked Gillespie at least seven times to explain how the Department of  Insurance will deal with where a driver lives in arriving at criteria for  setting auto insurance rates under Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Each time she evaded the question, sometimes blaming the Legislature for not  dealing with the high cost of insurance: "Because the Legislature has been  incapable of doing anything, we (the Department of Insurance) are going to have  to do it. . . . What we are trying to do is come up with something that will  protect both the people that are paying too (much) and those who are happy with  what they are paying. And I don't think we can do it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disclosure 'Shortly'  </P> <P> Later she responded: "My policy is going to be to uphold the law and somehow  find a way to protect as many people as possible. . . . The regulations will be  made public shortly."  </P> <P> Robbins: "Define 'shortly.' "  </P> <P> Gillespie: "It will be quickly."  </P> <P> She finally promised that the proposed regulations would be issued this month.  </P> <P> At the conclusion of the hearing, Gillespie hurriedly left the meeting room --  reporters trailing after her -- as she rushed to catch a plane for a meeting in  Gov. George Deukmejian's Sacramento office.  </P> <P> What about charges, she was asked, that she has exempted 184 insurance  companies from any rate regulation?  </P> <P> They are not exempted, she said over her shoulder, their rates can be set any  time.  </P> <P> But why not schedule them for hearings?  </P> <P> "They're teensy-weensy ones," she replied as she left the building.  </P> <P> And, yes, she is considering running for the job of insurance commissioner in  1990, but now, she insists, Proposition 103 is her main concern.  </P> <P> "I haven't made up my mind," she said. "Politics will just have to come second.  . . . I'm committed to doing it right."  </P></p>

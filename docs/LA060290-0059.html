			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MULTIYEAR DEAL LURES FERRY TO NBA  </P> <P> The NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers coaxed Danny Ferry back from Italy, signing him  to a multiyear contract Friday.  </P> <P> Terms of the deal were not revealed, but the former Duke star's contract with  the Cavaliers was thought to be worth at least $2.5 million a year.  </P> <P> Ferry made $2 million last season with Il Messaggero Roma in the Italian  professional basketball league.  </P> <P> Ferry played in Italy last year rather than sign with the Clippers. The  Clippers had made him the second selection in last June's NBA draft. Sacramento  took Louisville's Pervis Ellison with the first pick.  </P> <P> Cleveland got the rights to Ferry in a trade that sent Ron Harper and three  draft picks to the Clippers in November.  </P> <P> "I have a very high regard for Danny Ferry as a player," Cleveland General  Manager Wayne Embry said. "I felt that he should have been the No. 1 pick in  last year's draft, and that he would have been the first pick in this year's  draft."  </P> <P> In the trade last November, the Clippers got Cleveland's first-round picks in  1990 and '92, and a second-round pick in 1991. The Cavaliers, besides getting  the rights to Ferry, got Reggie Williams, who was later released.  </P> <P> Ferry had to advise Il Messaggero Roma before July 1 whether he would be  returning next season.  </P> <P> In four years at Duke, the 6-foot-10, 230-pound Ferry averaged 15.1 points and  seven rebounds a game. As a senior, he averaged 22.6 points and 7.4 rebounds.  </P></p>

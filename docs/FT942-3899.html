			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Yve Newbold - Desert Island Manager Yve Newbold is looking forward to her stay on a desert island. A whirlwind of efficiency in her job as company secretary at Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, she would quickly have the island organised to her liking. Her only worry is that she would settle in so well that she would find herself composing a resignation letter to her boss, Lord Hanson, on some of the electronic equipment she plans to take with her. What would you need to carry on your business apart from a fax and a phone? 'A videophone. I could call up my kids and the bank manager, or see what the traffic was like in downtown Naples. I like to be able to see people's expressions.' How would you keep your sanity? 'I would keep fit. I'd do water aerobics and wear those repulsive great big arm bands and plastic dumb-bells and swing them through the water. I'd also jog in the evening after the sun goes down.' How would you busy yourself? 'I'm assuming my brain will soften a bit. So I would do computer games. It would be better than taking back editions of the Times crosswords, which would seem totally meaningless on a desert island.' Who would accompany you? 'I have no doubt about that: I'd take my mother. She's Irish, very funny, a great mimic, and she's my best friend. She is a most superb conversationalist, we never run out of things to say. She'd be much better than taking a partner. Imagine the frigid silences you'd have over who finished the sun cream.' What would you take for food and drink? 'I could not live without my plug-in filter coffee maker. Alternatively I'd take Diet Coke. To eat I'd have something completely wicked and forbidden like bacon sandwiches. I could easily eat those every day.' Which book would you take? 'I'd have to look after my spiritual side, so it would be The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran. It's a philosophical tract: a bit Zen, although Gibran is an Arab.' And which film? 'I'm very, very fond of horses, and as I couldn't have horses on the desert island, I'd take instead National Velvet with Elizabeth Taylor. I could watch it again and again, and sob every time.' How well would you adapt? 'Quite well, I think. If I were allowed a pen knife I'd make myself a house. If birds can do it with their beaks, I could certainly do it with my two hands. I'd like the chance to develop a sense of perspective away from the mad daily rush of London life.' What would you most dislike? 'I hate blistering sun, so I'd need to take my factor 25.' What message would you send back? 'It would be to my children saying - I know this sounds mawkish and sentimental - remember I love you and I hope you are behaving yourself.'</p>

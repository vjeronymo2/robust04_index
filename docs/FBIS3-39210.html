			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes is  very happy with the NATO ultimatum reached last Wednesday [9  February]. NATO has given the Bosnian Serbs 10 days to lift the  siege of Sarajevo. According to the minister, the Serbs now have  no other choice than to retreat from their positions around the  city by 21 February. Also Belgium is prepared to cooperate with  possible air strikes, but Minister Claes says he thinks that our  country will in the first place be asked to offer logistics  support. [passage omitted]    Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes says he is not  worried about the strong opposition of the Russians. He says  that it is Moscow that is making a mistake, not NATO.</p>

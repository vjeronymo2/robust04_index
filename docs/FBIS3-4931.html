			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the </F> Workers' Party of Korea to the National Agriculture Meeting at  Pyongyang Gymnasium on 25 February, read by Vice President Yi  Chong-ok -- recorded]    [Text] The National Agricultural Conference has opened at  a time when all the party members and working people are  vigorously accelerating the general march of socialism with the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude through  single-hearted unity around the party and the leader amid the  great expectation and interest of the people and agricultural  working people across the country.    The meeting, which is being held in the significant year  marking the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist  rural theses, is a historic meeting that proudly sums up the  great victory in brilliantly implementing the tasks presented by  rural theses and demonstrates the correctness of the theses and  the vitality of our country's socialist rural economic system.  It is also a glorious meeting that demonstrates the heroic  spirit of our people and agricultural working people, who are  vigorously advancing with the revolutionary banner of chuche,  and the invincibility of socialism of our own style. [applause]    The Central Committee [CC] of the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] extends ardent congratulations to all working people and  members of three-revolutions teams movement of the agricultural  sector, and all participants who are present at the meeting with  the pride of accomplishing great feats in the struggle to  implement the socialist rural theses with ardent loyalty to the  party and the leader. [applause]    To properly solve socialist rural problems is an important  issue concerning the destiny of the socialist cause. The great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song has for the first time in history set  forth all theoretical and practical problems arising from  solving the socialist rural problems and vigorously inspired the  entire party, the entire country, and all the people to the  implementation of the rural theses by presenting the theses on  our country's socialist rural problems. He wisely led the  struggle to accelerate socialist rural construction and develop  agricultural production by personally creating the chuche-based  farming method and continuing on-the-spot guidance.    With a firm chuche-based position, our party set forth new  theory and policy to better solve rural problems in conformity  with the demand of the reality to deepen and develop socialist  construction; had the entire country seethe with the struggle to  implement the theses; vigorously carried out three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in rural  areas; and energetically led agricultural workers to achieve  ceaseless innovations in rural works by demonstrating the spirit  as masters.    Because the chuche-oriented socialist rural theses were  implemented in practice under the wise leadership of the party  and the leader [suryong], a brilliant example has been created  in solving the rural problems, and a change of the century has  been brought about in the rural areas in our country. [applause]    An ideological revolution has been vigorously carried out in  the rural areas, and, as a result, a great change has taken  place in the agricultural workers' ideological and spiritual  state and the way they work and live. Our agricultural workers  have considered loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] to  be the most valuable thing and are preparing themselves as  chuche-type revolutionary warriors who breathe and wage  struggles by following the party's intentions. Highly aware  that they are masters in the rural areas, they have been  sincerely working for their fatherland, people, society, and  group under the slogan "One for all, all for one."    The party's plan to carry out a technological revolution in  the rural areas has been carried out successfully, and, as a  result, the task to build irrigation systems in the rural areas  has been completed on a high level and the task to use electric  equipment in farming has been realized brilliantly. Great  progress has been made in mechanizing farm work and using  chemical fertilizers in farming, and, as a result, our peasants  who had to transplant rice seedlings and weed rice paddies by  hand and do toilsome work are now doing farm work easily and  efficiently.    Because the chuche-oriented farming method was implemented,  agricultural production has rapidly developed based on modern  science and technology. Because a cultural revolution was  carried out in the rural areas, agricultural workers' level of  general knowledge and their technological and cultural levels  have improved significantly, the ranks of agricultural  technicians and experts have increased, a great change has taken  place in conditions for cultural lives in the rural areas, and  the rural areas in our country have turned into civilized and  abundant socialist cultural rural areas.    Based on the new agricultural guidance system, guidance and  management on the rural economy has been improved and  strengthened endlessly; the leading role of all-people ownership  in relation to cooperative ownership has been enhanced; and, as  a result, major progress has been made in overcoming the  differences between the urban and rural areas in terms of types  of management and ownership.    Counties across the country have been built strongly and are  excellently carrying out their mission and role in carrying out  the three revolutions. They are also excellently carrying out  their mission and role as bases that link cities to rural areas.    The socialist rural theses gave our people and  agricultural workers the great honor and pride of having  pioneered the only correct road in solving rural problems and  gave firm belief in the victory of socialism to progressive  mankind and vigorously inspired them to the struggle.    In the past 30 years, our agricultural working people have  contributed greatly to the prosperity and development of the  country and to providing better happiness to the people by  blossoming new socialist living on the fatherland with a firm  belief in socialism and through devoted struggle and creative  labor.    The victory of socialism of our own style is being reliably  guaranteed because we have the most advanced socialist rural  economic system and large contingents of heroic agricultural  working people, which are being strengthened and developed every  day, upholding the leadership of the great leader and the great  party with the strong support of chuche-based industries.  [applause]    The WPK Central Committee highly appraises our agricultural  working people for achieving great labor feats in the struggle  to complete the tasks presented by the socialist rural theses  upholding the leadership of the party and the leader. [applause]    To further vigorously carry out the socialist rural  construction is an important requirement for highly displaying  the superiority of our country's popular masses-centered  socialism and successfully completing the chuche-oriented  socialist cause. All the party members and working people of  the agricultural sector should wage a more vigorous struggle to  effect a new upsurge in rural construction and agricultural  production upholding the historic letter "For the Ultimate  Solution to Rural Problems Under the Banner of Socialist Rural  Theses" sent to this meeting by the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The three  revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- is  the basic content of revolution to be practiced by the party of  the working class after the socialist system is established, and  to be continued until the construction of communism.    The basic key to win a greater victory in the socialist  rural construction is to thoroughly carry out the three  revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in  rural communities in conformity with the demands of a new higher  stage. [applause]    By deepening the ideological revolution, first of all, party  members and working people should arm themselves with a great  chuche idea and party's chuche-oriented rural construction idea  to vigorously carry out the work of revolutionizing farmers.    By strengthening the indoctrination of the chuche idea,  agricultural working people should think and act as demanded by  our party's chuche idea and chuche-oriented idea for rural  construction. They should also deeply grasp and further glorify  the proud history in which the world has began under such a  chuche ray.    Agricultural working people should become deeply aware of  the  greatness of the party and the leader [suryong] by continuously  and vigorously carrying out the indoctrination of loyalty. As a  result, they should possess the spirit -- the spirit of  endlessly following the party and the leader while sharing their  fate of life or death with the party in any difficult situations  -- as their first revolutionary trust and hold as their firm  faith the truth that our socialism, which is leading the great  party, will surely win victory by smashing any challenges and  obstructive maneuvers.    Along with this, they, by further deepening the class  indoctrination, should not forget the class stand but instead  strongly keep it all the time as they enjoy their happy life  with each passing day. Also, for a society and collective, they  should work and cooperate with each other, overflowing with a  revolutionary zeal.    By vigorously carrying out the technological revolution at a  higher level, agricultural working people should further  strengthen the material and technological foundation of the  rural economy and effect a constant upsurge in the agricultural  production. Also, they should promisingly solve the increasing  water problems by further increasing irrigation facilities and  by consolidating the operation of the already established  irrigation system and make the grand circle-style irrigation  system -- which was established in our country -- effect a  greater upsurge in agricultural production. At the same time,  they should actively accelerate field irrigation construction.    Along with this, they should properly prepare power  production bases, stabilize production, accelerate ongoing power  plant constructions, and build many small-, and medium-sized  power plants everywhere throughout the country by conducting  mass-oriented campaigns. As a result, they should more  satisfactorily meet the increasing demands of electricity from  rural communities.    Today, rural technological revolution is faced with the  major task of further enhancing the industrialization and  modernization of agriculture. In order to outstandingly carry  out the general mechanization and scientification of the rural  economy, we should produce more farming machineries of various  kinds, such as tractors, and more chemical fertilizers, highly  effective agriculture chemicals, and herbicides and send them to  rural areas.    We should further develop our socialist rural areas to  become  ideal villages to work and live in by actively expanding the  rank of technicians of the agricultural sector through a more  vigorous cultural revolution, upgrading the technological and  cultural standard of agricultural working people, who are  directly in charge of agricultural production, and by  establishing production culture and living culture.    The entire party, entire country, and all the people should  further vigorously push ahead with the struggle to complete the  historic task to turn farmers into working class, and  industrialize agriculture, while filled with pride and  confidence in achieving a great victory in solving the rural  problems. [applause]    The industry-first policy is the most correct policy that  enriches our people's dietary life and embodies our party's idea  of strengthening and developing socialism of our own. [applause]    Functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector,  who have walked along the rewarding road of socialist rural  construction while courageously overcoming severe trials and  difficulties following the leadership of the party and the  leader, should uphold the party's revolutionary economic policy  and display the sense of revolution and combat capabilities in  the struggle to implement the agriculture-first policy.    All the agricultural working people should deeply bear the  responsibility of the master who makes sure the nation's rice  granary is full and effect a great upsurge in agricultural  production by methodically and tenaciously carrying out all  farming works in accordance with the demands of chuche-based  farming method.    Guiding functionaries in the rural economy sector should  highly demonstrate the superiority and vitality of chuche-based  agricultural guidance system by embodying the demands of the  great spirit of Chongsan-ri, the methods of Chongsan-ri, and  should be deeply involved with farmers, share joys and sorrow  with them, solve their problems with responsibilities, and lead  them to implement the party's agricultural plan by setting  examples and showing practices.    With the principle that industries help agriculture and  urbanize rural areas, all masses should efficiently support  rural areas so that the party's agriculture-first policy is  thoroughly implemented. Rural party works should be more  vigorously carried out in conformity with the developing reality.    Party organizations should carry out work with human  beings and political work, firmly bond the agricultural working  people around the party, further strengthen our party's rural  bases, enhance our role in socialist rural construction by all  means, and firmly guarantee our party's leadership in rural  construction.    Based on the accomplishments already achieved in socialist  rural construction, party organizations and functionaries should  diminish the differences between industrial and agricultural  economic management standards, and correctly carry out the work  to gradually transform cooperative ownership to all-people  ownership in rural areas.    It is a proud revolutionary trait of our people and  agricultural working people to courageously overcome  difficulties and trials they are faced with and continue to  innovate, to advance toward new victories following the  leadership of the party and the great leader under the banner of  self-reliance and fortitude.    The WPK Central Committee firmly believes that all our  agricultural working people would excellently repay the party's  trust and expectation by resolutely continuing the struggle to  firmly defend and further elucidate socialism of our style under  the banner of the chuche idea while firmly uniting around the  party and the leader.

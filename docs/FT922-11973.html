			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese lender to appoint new president NIPPON Housing Loan, the troubled non-banker lender to the property sector, is set to dismiss Mr Keiichiro Niwayama, president for 20 years, as part of an effort to come to grips with its huge portfolio of bad debt. The company confirmed yesterday it would soon appoint a new president, likely to be Mr Susumu Niwa, a former executive at the Sanwa Bank who is senior managing director at Nippon. The management shake-up is symptomatic of the serious bad debt problems facing the non-bank sector, and the commercial banks that provided finance. The exact size of the problems at Nippon are impossible to gauge because bad loans need not be declared as such until a year after payment stops. The steep decline of property prices in Japan's principal cities, however, has pushed many borrowers beyond the brink. According to Teikoku Data Bank, a Japanese credit agency, loans declared bad by the eight housing loan companies to corporations which failed last year totalled Y90.7bn (Dollars 675m), although the final total is likely to prove much higher. Nippon had assets of Y3,992bn as of last September.</p>

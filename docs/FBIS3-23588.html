The servicemen from a  military unit in the city of Kremenchuk are turning to you. How  much longer are we to serve if we were drafted into active  service in the fall of 1992 for 18 months? Rumors are now  circulating that we will serve for two years."    [Signed] Respectfully, servicemen from military unit  39226.    We approached Major General Ostap Sapsa, first deputy chief  of the Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with a request to  comment on this and many other letters to the editor on this  account. We quote his answer.    "In keeping with the Law of Ukraine dated 19 November 1993,  `On Amendments and Additions to the Law of Ukraine "On Universal  Military Obligation and Military Service,"' amendments  concerning the duration of military service for soldiers,  sailors, sergeants and petty officers who will be in compulsory  military service for 24 rather than 18 months have been made to  Point `a,' Article 23. These changes occurred during the time of  service of the category of servicemen in question, rather than  upon completion of the previously established duration of 18  months, i.e. in December 1993. In the case in question, the  effect of the law concerning the extension of the duration of  compulsory military service by another six months covers this  category of servicemen who were drafted into the army in June  1992."</p>

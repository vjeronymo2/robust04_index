			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (3): Most popular refuge for funds - Switzerland ON A literal definition, Switzerland is the biggest offshore financial centre in the world. Various estimates indicate that something between one third and one half of all funds placed by investors outside their home countries are in the hands of Swiss banks. That amounts to roughly SFr2,000bn, and puts the country far ahead of places such as Jersey or Gibraltar as a refuge for funds. But the term offshore, as most people have come to understand it, is increasingly misleading when applied to Switzerland. With the exception of the canton of Zug, the country cannot be described as a tax haven. Its tax levels are not remarkably different from those in other industrialised countries, and foreigners must pay either normal taxes on their earnings from investments in Switzerland or forfeit a stiff 35 per cent withholding tax. Nor is bank secrecy sacrosanct in Switzerland. Contrary to a widespread perception, Switzerland has never guaranteed to protect criminals' money from foreign investigators. It has mutual assistance treaties with most countries and will co-operate in investigations provided that the crime being investigated is also considered a crime in Switzerland. Nevertheless, following widespread criticism of laxity in the 1980s, the government and the banking community have introduced a number of specific measures designed to prevent the country from being used by drug money launderers, insider traders and other criminals to hide their dirty money. Today, anyone seeking to put his investments in Switzerland must reveal his identity to the Swiss bank he uses. He can no longer hide behind a lawyer or trustee. And if the banker suspects that the money is tainted, he may tell the police. The Swiss federal justice department is now preparing a new series of amendments to the criminal code to make it even tougher for criminals to use the country's banks. The main element of the package will be a provision to make membership in a criminal organisation a criminal offence in itself. That means that Swiss police will be able to co-operate with their counterparts from other countries chasing members of criminal organisations, such as the Mafia. The new package will also clarify the right of bankers to tell the police if they are suspicious about a client. There has been some discussion of making it an obligation to tell the police, but Swiss bankers recoil from such a measure. 'They must understand that bankers cannot be policemen,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, an associate in the Geneva private bank of Lombard, Odier. Bankers also fight any attempt to extend Switzerland's co-operation with other governments to the area of tax. But they point out that this is not to help their clients evade tax. Rather, it is to make sure that the client's rights are not abused by foreign governments. They observe that it is not unknown, even in respectable countries, for political leaders to use their tax agencies to damage their enemies. Given this tight legal and regulatory framework, it can be fairly asked why Switzerland continues to be the world's most popular refuge for funds. Until a few years ago, part of the answer would be that the country was a rare haven of political stability and monetary propriety. But today, several other countries are at least as stable, and the Swiss franc has not performed as well as some other European currencies. Mr Georges Vergnion, chairman of Chase Manhattan Private Bank (Switzerland) in Geneva, says the country is still regarded by many people as a safe haven. Mr Vergnion points out that Chase Manhattan's private banking operations are organised in such a way that customers may have their money kept wherever it will make them feel most comfortable. And a large proportion still prefer to keep it in Switzerland. This feeling has apparently been reinforced by the decision by the Swiss people in a referendum last December not to join the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA, a widened free trade area joining the European Community and the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), would not, in fact, have had any impact on Switzerland's status as a safe haven, but bankers say many high net worth individuals were reassured by the rejection. Swiss bankers' other claims are they offer better service than private banks elsewhere at competitive costs and they achieve good investment performance for client assets. As little comparative information is published, these claims are difficult to test. But the latest results of some of the leading Swiss private banks indicate they are thriving. Consolidated net profit of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, for example, jumped 15 per cent last year to SFr68m, driven mainly by a 27 per cent rise in commissions from asset and portfolio management. Vontobel, another Zurich group, reported a consolidated net profit up 9.9 per cent in 1992 to SFr24.5m. Among foreign-controlled private banks in Switzerland, Union Bank Privee had a 16 per cent rise in net profit last year to SFr93m and Chase Manhattan's net was up 14.5 per cent to SFr13.5m.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENGINEERS WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE 1990S  </P> <P> Al Martinez' "What Makes America Work" in the "Southern California Job Market"  section and other stories about changing careers really hit home.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, I decided to change careers mostly because I wanted to do  something that gave me a sense of pride, satisfaction and accomplishment.  Today, as a lawyer who represents people who are fired wrongfully from their  jobs, I know I made the right decision.  </P> <P> I empathize with the aerospace workers worried about losing their jobs through  no fault of their own. It is hard to convey in words the depth of emotion from  a client who says, "For 25 years I was the XYZ Co. in Southern California. Now  I am nothing!"  </P> <P> As mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and the like go on, we should not  forget that those who often pay the highest price are the ones out there  pounding the pavement.  </P> <P> JOSEPH POSNER  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FIRE KILLS 19 IN ILLEGAL TAIWAN VIDEO THEATER  </P> <P> A fire killed at least 19 people Sunday in an illegal Taiwan video theater, the  flames blocking the only escape route and trapping customers in tiny viewing  booths, state-run radio said.  </P> <P> The blaze quickly engulfed the maze-like theater in Chungli, northern Taiwan,  where patrons were watching videotaped films in private plywood cubicles. Video  theaters, where customers select their own videotapes of pirated U.S. movies  for viewing in cubicles, are common in Taiwan.  </P></p>

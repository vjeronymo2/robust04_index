			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roland Bunzenthal: "Researchers Call For Change </F> of Policy for Climate Protection"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 2 Mar -- The reduction of carbon  dioxide emissions, which is essential for the protection of the  climate, cannot be achieved on the basis of the current energy  policy. This conclusion was published by the German Institute  for Economic Research (DIW) in its recent weekly report. The  Federal Government's objectives for fighting the greenhouse  effect can only be achieved through a "comprehensive bunch of  measures," particularly a "sizable" increase in the price of  fossil energy through higher taxes and rates. After all, by  taking inflation into account, the current prices of some energy  sources are hardly higher than 20 years ago.    It is Bonn's declared objective to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions in Germany between 25 and 30 percent by the year 2005  -- in relation to 1987. The DIW estimates that approximately  721 million tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted in western  Germany in 1993, which even constitutes a slight increase over  1987. In eastern Germany, however, emissions have been halved  since then and are now at a level of about 170 million tonnes --  mainly as a result of the "economic slump there."    The DIW criticizes that the "Federal Government's ambitious  objective" is inconsistent with "the activities it initiated."  While the government announced a considerably stricter  insulation regulation, it finally "only adopted a much weaker  version of it." What is missing is "a comprehensive promotion by  the state" of "measures for the economical use of energy" and a  policy of "avoiding transport and shifting transport to systems  that are more energy-efficient."    In addition, the DIW complains, the Federal Government is  not  ready to become active at a national level in anticipation of a  European carbon dioxide/energy tax. This would result in  competitive disadvantages in the short term but prevent "a major  adaption shock in the future."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment is requested concerning the proposed treatment of CTA and investee pool performance, including the definitions of major CTA and major investee pools. In particular, commenters may wish to address whether use of a twenty-five percent of futures margin or commodity premium benchmark as compared to twenty-five percent of total assets adequately reflects the relative risks of direct futures trading as compared to trading through vehicles which limit the risk of loss to the initial investment. Comment also is requested as to the definition of adverse performance, in particular, as to whether any additional benchmarks for identifying whether past performance is sufficiently ``adverse'' to warrant disclosure would be appropriate. For example, should the adverse performance definition be revised to include a one-month draw-down exceeding a specified percentage, e.g., twenty-five percent, of account equity traded pursuant to the trading program under which the CTA will trade for the offered pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Past Performance Disclosure in CTA Disclosure Documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CTA disclosure documents would be required to include the past performance of the CTA and its trading principals. The past performance of the program offered would be required to be disclosed in the full format currently required. For other programs, the CTA would be required to use the capsule format used by CPOs to present CTA past performance in pool disclosure documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Updating Past Performance Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concurrently, Rule 4.22(a) is proposed to be revised by adding paragraph (a)(4) to require periodic account statements to include the names of all of the pool's CTAs and investee pools regardless of the amount of pool assets allocated to them. In addition, to provide a ready means of presenting the performance of newly added major CTAs and investee pools, account statements would be required to include the past performance of all CTAs and investee pools that are major CTAs and major investee pools as of the date of the statements and whose performance was not previously disclosed. Use of account statements to update major CTAs' and investee pools' performance records would provide a convenient means for CPOs to amend pool performance disclosures. In the event that the pool acquired a new major CTA or investee pool whose past performance had not previously been disclosed, the CPO would be required to notify pool participants of such event and provide the relevant performance records as required by proposed Rule 4.26(c) (current Rule 4.21(b)), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  within twenty-one calendar days after the CPO knows or should know of this occurrence, whether by way of the account statement (if this would provide timely notice under the twenty-one day requirement) or by other similar means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 4.21(b) (proposed to be renumbered as Rule 4.26(c)) sets forth the requirements for amending pool disclosure documents to reflect a material change in the document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Time Period for Which Past Performance Disclosure Would be Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current Rule 4.21 generally requires past performance to be presented for a three-year period. However, the Commission is aware that some registrants nonetheless include longer performance periods in their disclosure documents for marketing purposes. The Commission believes that requiring performance to be disclosed for a period longer than three years will have the benefit of making performance disclosures more uniform and will provide a better picture of the evolution of performance over time, including positive and negative fluctuations in returns. In addition, under the proposed summary format for performance disclosure, lengthy tables to present performance data would not be required. Consequently, adoption of a five-year disclosure period would not result in any significant increase in the volume of performance disclosures. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to increase the minimum time period for which performance would be disclosed from three to five years. CPOs may continue to provide additional performance disclosures provided the performance is calculated in compliance with proposed Rule 4.25 and is included in the document following the required performance disclosures as required by proposed Rule 4.24(v) for information voluntarily provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A summary table of the proposed past performance disclosure requirements follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

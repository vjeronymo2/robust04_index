			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing told the 1994 China summit meeting that since China has  entered the new stage of comprehensively establishing its  socialist economic system, it is necessary for it to cement its  exchanges with the outside world.    About 600 people from abroad and at home attended the  opening  ceremony of the meeting, which was co-sponsored by the China  State Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems (SCRES) and  THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. Among them were Mahathir  Mohamed, Malaysian prime minister, Peter Sutherland,  director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, and  Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany.    Li Lanqing stressed in his speech that China is advancing  toward its second goal in its economic and social development  drive and establishment of a new socialist market economy.    "At the moment," he said, "the holding of this important  summit meeting will provide a multi-layer contact opportunity  for high- ranking Chinese and foreign officials, entrepreneurs  and economists to discuss economic theories and practices in the  contemporary world and China."    For this reason, he added, Chinese Government departments  related to the economy will introduce their position with regard  to the establishment of the socialist market economy, economic  development, and reform and development measures put forward  recently, so the delegates can obtain a full understanding of  today's China.    The vice-premier also gave a briefing on China's economic  situation.    In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System:  the Role of the People's Republic of China", Sutherland said  that momentous developments are taking place in China along with  the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round world trade  negotiations, and prior to the set-up of the new World Trade  Organization.    "China is to be congratulated on its most recently announced  programs of liberalization and reform, particularly those  relating to the exchange regime, taxation, state trading,  licensing, tariffs and non-tariff measures," he said.    "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world  over, including those in China, are keen to see full  implementation of these and other announced reforms.    "I clearly view most positively the prospect of early  completion of the negotiations on the terms and conditions for  China's rejoining GATT," he added.    Sutherland noted that China's ambitious program of trade and  economic reforms has contributed greatly to bringing China more  closely into line with the world trading system.    Mahathir said in his speech that an anarchic situation was  neither going to facilitate the growth and flowering of a free  market, nor help the transition from a command economy to a  market economy.    "China is right in not making a total and immediate switch,"  he said. "It is right in not simultaneously attempting a  radical political about-turn."    He also spoke highly of China's socialist market economy by  saying that "China did right in sticking to its brand of  socialist politics while espousing a version of the market  economy," because "it is apparently more successful in terms of  the economy, which is growing very fast."    Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge  of SCRES, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic  and Trade Commission, and Gui Shiyong, vice-minister of the  State Planning Commission, also made speeches to introduce  China's reform and opening drive.    Entrepreneurs from Malaysia, Hong Kong and France also spoke  at the meeting.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Gencor to reveal details of Shell deal Details of the long-awaited, Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) deal for Gencor of South Africa to buy the Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and metals operations are expected to surface this week. Gencor is already heavily involved in mining and metals in South Africa  - producing gold, platinum, coal, and aluminium among other things - and the Shell transaction, involving assets mainly under the Billiton banner, is designed to make it an equally important player on the international stage. However, negotiations have been dogged with difficulties. First, Shell insisted on an early announcement in May last year after Gencor made its unsolicited approach. Since then various deadlines have passed because untangling the assets Gencor wants from other Shell operations worldwide took more time than expected, and because of the complexities of Gencor's financing problems. Gencor originally intended to acquire the Billiton assets, which then had a book value of Dollars 1.8bn, merge them with its own operations outside South Africa as well as its R1.5bn (Dollars 410m), 50 per cent stake in Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa, and to float the new group in London. It was considering taking on a partner or partners to help finance the deal. Billiton is far from a hidden jewel within Shell. Low metals prices and restructuring charges sent its net losses to Dollars 142m last year, from a Dollars 75m loss in 1992. And during the course of negotiations two important assets were ruled out of the transaction: Shell decided to go ahead with the flotation of some of its Australian mining assets, a move being considered before Gencor's approach. These assets, including Shell's 30 per cent stake in the lucrative Boddington gold mine in Western Australia, are expected to raise about ADollars 400m (Pounds 193.2m) and Gencor said it could not match that price; Shell also put its one-third stake in the Collahausi copper project in Chile up for auction after Minorco, the cash-rich subsidiary of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, indicated it would exercise its pre-emptive rights to the holding. This was disappointing for Gencor as the USDollars 1bn Collahausi scheme is one of Billiton's better assets while the Australian operations would have provided valuable cash flow to help pay for the debt Gencor has arranged to raise outside South Africa with a consortium of banks. The Reserve Bank, South Africa's central bank, has approved outline debt arrangements as well as giving permission for Gencor to take its Richards Bay Minerals stake offshore.</p>

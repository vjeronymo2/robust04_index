			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / War warning as Ethiopia holds election ETHIOPIANS voted yesterday in the first democratic election in Africa's oldest independent nation, but a powerful political faction warned that alleged irregularities could spark a new civil war, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. About 33m Ethiopians were eligible to vote in the poll for a federal-style government. Mr Lencho Letta, vice-president of the Oromo Liberation Front, which has boycotted the elections, said soon after the polls opened that the OLF might withdraw from the transitional national assembly. 'Renewed civil war is inevitable unless the situation improves,' he said. The OLF announced its boycott last week, alleging its offices had been closed and its officials arrested by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. The EPRDF has dominated the interim government in Addis Ababa.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / LDP in struggle to pick bank chief Japan's Liberal Democratic party, the dominant member of the ruling coalition, has launched a campaign to reassert its political authority over the powerful financial bureaucracy. A senior banker and former top finance ministry official claims the LDP is trying to impose its own choice of a successor to Mr Yasushi Mieno as governor of the Bank of Japan. Mr Mieno is due to retire at the end of the year. The post is traditionally arranged in an orderly manner between the finance ministry and the central bank, which take turns to place their own candidate in the job. But this time, an element of confusion has crept into the handover of power at one of the world's most important central banks. Mr Yasuo Matsushita, chairman of Sakura Bank, has increased his lead as front-runner for the governorship, with the backing of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former LDP premier, who brought together the three-party coalition at the end of June. The LDP has been seeking to make its mark since returning to power, after a humiliating year in opposition, its first such experience in nearly four decades. Under the previous coalition government, support had been growing for Mr Yoshihiko Yoshino, president of the government-controlled Japan Development Bank, with the backing of senior finance ministry officials and of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former government's backroom strategist. Both candidates are former finance ministry officials, in deference to the fact that the present central bank governor is a career central banker. Numerous other rival candidates for the governorship are mentioned in the Japanese press, a sign of the new openness of the power struggle between politicians and the bureaucracy. Senior finance ministry and central bank officials deny that the LDP is interfering in the choice of central bank governor, which is expected to be decided by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, in November. Officially, Mr Yoshino has withdrawn from the race on health grounds and because he feared that his spoken English was inadequate. Mr Matsushita also has finance ministry support, though from a different group of officials from those who backed Mr Yoshino. What is clear, however, is that this change of governor at the Bank of Japan is less smooth and more public than usual. In another sign of the LDP's swiftness in bolstering its influence, the party has found a new job for a senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry official close to the party, who was deposed last year by the former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Miti last month informally asked Sanwa Bank to hire the official concerned, Mr Masahisa Naito, former director-general of Miti's industrial policy bureau, as an adviser. A Sanwa Bank official said yesterday Miti's request was unlikely to be refused. Japan's Foreign Minister Yohei Kono is to discuss Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council with UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali in Tokyo. Japan has expressed an interest in becoming a permanent member of an expanded UN Security Council provided the move has the backing of neighbouring Asian nations.</p>

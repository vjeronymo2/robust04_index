			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (5): Relief not without a price - Moves to reduce the debt overhang THE Ecuadorean government and most of its creditors agree on one thing: a resolution to the country's foreign debt problem will not be possible without debt relief. Ecuador's foreign debt as a ratio of gross national product is the highest among the larger debtors in South America - 120 per cent. While far below the levels of many debtor countries in Africa and war-torn Nicaragua, the ratio is higher than Bolivia's 100 per cent and double that of Peru. Because it makes only partial payments on that debt, the interest burden has in recent years been at levels comparable with most heavily indebted Latin countries at around 15 per cent of exports. Nonetheless, the country suffers from a 'debt overhang', a debt burden so high that its sheer size inhibits investment and blocks growth. The previous government's unwillingness to seek a more permanent solution to the debt problem 'has represented a high cost to the country because it has inhibited incoming capital and the repatriation of capital by Ecuadoreans', according to Mr Alberto Dahik, the country's vice-president. 'This has put the country at the margin of international capital flows that have benefited other Latin American countries after they reached agreements with their creditors,' he said. The government appears determined to reduce the overhang, and as a signal of this is starting talks with bank creditors led by Lloyds Bank of Britain in early December in New York. 'Of course we can't pay it; we need debt relief,' said Mr Dahik, who is playing an important role in shaping economic policy. The government was prepared to 'use all possible mechanisms and be flexible', he said. With the example of Mexico before them, it is now conventional wisdom in Latin American countries that the confidence effects of a debt relief deal are an essential part of an economic reform programme. But unlike in Mexico - which never missed a scheduled interest payment  - and as in other countries such as Argentina, a bank debt relief programme under the Brady plan may lead to an increase in actual debt servicing, even though scheduled debt servicing falls. This is almost certain to happen in the short-term as debt service arrears - according to the government, a total Dollars 3.7bn of an overall Dollars 12.3bn debt - are tackled. This in turn is likely to lead to a lively internal debate about the merits of raising debt servicing levels. The government has already said it intends to devote 38 per cent of its 1993 budget to debt servicing, compared with 25 per cent this year. Apart from clearing arrears and tackling internal opposition, bankers say there are other difficulties facing a government which they believe genuinely wants to deal with the debt issue. With a bank debt of roughly Dollars 4 1/2 bn of principal and Dollars 2 1/4 bn of interest arrears, the government may lack finance for so-called 'enhancements', the guarantees to the concessional bonds which banks agree to take in exchange for their debt. These enhancements are usually made up of funds from the international financial institutions - the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank - together with other resources a government can pull together from its own reserves. The government is embarking on talks with the IMF on what may be a two-year standby loan, expected to be agreed early in the new year, after which World Bank and IADB funds may fall into place, and a rescheduling from the Paris Club of creditor governments may take place. However, reserves with which to finance enhancements are not large. After falling earlier this year to near crisis levels, they have since increased four-fold to Dollars 750m. Indeed, the fall in reserves appears to be why the government has not been able to make an interest payment to banks since July. The government has in recent years been paying, in intermittent payments, Dollars 140m a year to banks - equivalent to 25-30 per cent of that falling due. The lack of a payment since July has probably contributed to a fall in the price of the bank debt in the secondary market to around 27 cents on the dollar. The price peaked in the low 30s in mid-year amid expectations that the incoming government would rapidly move to settle its foreign debts. The low of about 15 cents was reached in 1990.</p>

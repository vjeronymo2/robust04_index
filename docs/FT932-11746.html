			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Palace tours 'priced too low' OFFICIALS at Buckingham Palace have made a marketing blunder by pricing its entrance charge at Pounds 8 when the market would sustain almost twice that, says the English Tourist Board. Mr Mike Richardson, the board's marketing director, said: 'It's drastically under-priced. They should be charging Pounds 15 for adults. This is going to be a bonanza and also a field day for ticket touts, because at Pounds 8 there will be room for margins.' Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday that it would open to the public for the first time. It will be open for eight weeks from the second half of August each year until the end of 1997. Tourist industry executives said they expected the scheme would prove so successful that it would continue indefinitely. Mr Richardson added: 'There are millions of people out there who want a slice of the royal family and this is the only way they can get it. They must have been scared about accusations of ripping the public off. But they needn't be worried about that because the public will want to pay a premium for the best.' The tourist industry estimated yesterday that the palace's maximum capacity per day would be 10,000 visitors, giving a possible total of 600,000 this year. A number of important technical aspects - such as whether there will be advance tickets or if people will be expected to queue - were still unclear yesterday, though the palace had set up an information line for inquiries. Yesterday the palace declined to comment on any aspect of its marketing policy concerning London's latest attraction. It said Thursday's announcement 'was the beginning and now everything will be gone through in detail to be ready for opening in the second week of August'. Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Saturday August 7 will be the first day the general public will be allowed to visit.</p>

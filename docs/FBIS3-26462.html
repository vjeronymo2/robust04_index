			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030) and </F> XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- This year, China will  reform its mode of customs supervision and administration by  introducing a comprehensive customs inspection system and a  corresponding reform of the system of customs processing.    Addressing a national conference of customs directors on 30  January, Qian Guanlin, director of the PRC General  Administration of Customs, said: The focus of customs operation  reform this year is to introduce the customs inspection system.  Customs will expand the time and space of supervision and  control by basing its import and export supervision and control  on enterprise control and accounts auditing in order to  facilitate passage at ports and points of entry, to make  supervision and control more scientific and effective, and to  better suit the expansion of opening up to the outside world and  the development of an export-oriented economy.    He pointed out: It is necessary to change the traditional  concept of regarding the customs simply as a "gatekeeper" and to  change the traditional mode of over-concentrating manpower,  material resources, and means of supervision and control on the  handling of passage at customs in ports and points of entry --  which involves only a narrow and small space and a short  duration of time.    It is obvious that the old mode of supervision and control  can no longer meet the needs of the rapidly developing  situation: In 1993, the volume of import and export goods under  the supervision and control of customs nationwide amounted to  347 million metric tons, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1992;  customs also inspected the luggage of 100.05 million inbound and  outbound visitors, an increase of nearly 9.7 percent over 1992.    It has been learned that the General Administration of  Customs has received State Council approval to establish an  inspection department to exercise unified control over and to  coordinate customs inspection work nationwide. The measures for  implementing the customs inspection system will soon be  distributed to subordinate units for implementation.    Correspondingly, the system of processing through customs  will be further reformed. Qian Guanlin said: It is necessary  to reform the system of customs declaration and cultivate the  customs declaration service market. The State Council has  determined that examination and approval of customs brokers will  be administered by customs. It is necessary to gradully build  specialized customs broker agencies into business entities  bearing the nature of social intermediate organizations  responsible not only to enterprises but also to customs. It is  necessary to begin studying and to gradually establish a system  for administering customs clearances by consignees and  consignors of import-export goods, as well as by their agents;  it is necessary to study and establish a customs clearance  management standard based on risk analysis; it is necessary to  quickly establish a customs clearance method suitable to  expressways; it is necessary to study the comprehensive  application of electronic data exchange; it is necessary to  further expand the results of the reform of joint inspection of  sea-transported goods and popularize them throughout China this  year; it is necessary to revise in a timely manner customs'  method of supervising and controlling mailed goods by  concentrating on supervision and control, in order to move in  the direction of international practice.</p>

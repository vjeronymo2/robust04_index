In a statement to TANJUG Cairo correspondent, Juppe said  the aim of France was to "exert strong political pressure on the  warring sides in Bosnia" -- the Moslems, Serbs and Croats.    France, together with Great Britain, initiated at the recent  NATO summit in Brussels that a threat with air strikes on the  positions of the Bosnian Serbs be included in the final document  if the Serbs resisted opening of the airport in Tuzla and  prevented replacement of the U.N. troops in Srebrenica. Tuzla  and Srebrenica have been declared safe areas and are situated in  northeastern and eastern Bosnia.</p>

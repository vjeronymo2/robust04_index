			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / IMF approves Romanian loan The International Monetary Fund yesterday approved a 19-month loan agreement for Romania worth Dollars 700m (Pounds 479.4m), its first new loan to the country in nearly two years. Under the deal, Romania has agreed to bring annual inflation down to two digits by the end of the year from the present 265 per cent, to speed up privatisation and restructuring of the state sector, which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of industry, and to maintain internal convertibility of the leu, the national currency. IMF approval of the loan package, agreed in principle last December, was delayed due to the government's slowness in drafting new tax laws and its 1994 budget.</p>

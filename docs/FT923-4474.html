			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Return of redundancy cash sought A LOCAL AUTHORITY whose enhanced severance scheme was ruled unlawful by the High Court is to ask some former employees who volunteered for redundancy to return part of their payments. Having failed to reverse last year's test-case court ruling, North Tyneside Council has now received counsel's opinion that it must act in the fiduciary interest of its chargepayers by seeking recovery of the payments. A full meeting of the council on Thursday is expected to decide that it has to follow its legal advice. The council will have to target selectively those ex-employees from whom it believes it has the best chance of recovering sums which merit the effort involved. Unions representing council workers oppose the move. The redundancy payments, ranging from a few hundred pounds to about Pounds 12,000, were made almost two years ago. Enhanced payments were made to 332 volunteers in 1990-91 when the council faced cuts of Pounds 6.8m because of charge-capping. The scheme was suspended after a challenge by the district auditor. Counsel for the district auditor told the High Court that the council had authorised Pounds 2.54m in payments under the scheme, of which Pounds 1.81m was without specific statutory authority. Payments were on average about 3 1/2 times as great as the council was authorised to pay. Mr Brian Flood, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said that the repayments drive which Mr David Allsop, the district auditor, had required was 'absolute nonsense'. He said: 'Enhanced redundancy payments are a recognised management tool throughout private and public enterprise.' Thursday's meeting will also hear details of a proposed council restructuring costing up to 1,000 jobs, equivalent to 10 per cent of the workforce. North Tyneside, which has exhausted its reserves, will face a deficit of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m in 1993-94.</p>

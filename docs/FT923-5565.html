			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Motoring: A Volvo to hurl round the track - Stuart Marshall improves his driving at a racing school YOU MIGHT think a Volvo would be the last car anyone would choose as the standard training vehicle for a racing and high-performance driving school. I am not being unkind. But if you were asked to name a car with sharp, sporty handling, high cornering speeds and sparkling performance, you would hardly think first of a Volvo. Yet there I was, lapping the Castle Combe circuit in Wiltshire at speeds one would not dare use on a public highway. The Volvo 480 Turbo coupe seemed to be enjoying it as much as I was. The 480 Turbo coupe is built in the company's Dutch plant. It is a pretty little car, with a 1.7-litre Renault-supplied engine putting out 120 horsepower at 5,400 rpm and developing maximum torque (in other words, pulling hardest) at 4,500 rpm. It costs Pounds 16,695 but there are two other non-turbocharged versions: a 1.7-litre, 102-horsepower 480 S (Pounds 13,895) and a just-introduced 110-horsepower, two-litre ES (Pounds 15,295). Because they are Volvos, they are strong on safety and security as well as performance. A driver's side airbag is available and all have a standard burglar alarm with a visible warning flasher. Volvo suggests a 480 would make a good alternative to the hot hatchbacks of various makes that have been hit by sky-high premiums. The insurance companies seem to agree: even the 480 Turbo is in group 13. That means it is regarded as a better risk than a Ford XR2i or Peugeot 205 GTi 1.9 (both group 14), Ford XR3i or VW Golf GTi (both 15). The 480, launched five years ago, has always been refined and sporty enough to attract the kind of buyers - many of them women - who felt they could not quite afford a BMW 320. Detail changes, including development of the suspension by Lotus, have made it go and handle better each year. Now, the 1993 model Turbo - the car I drove at Castle Combe - has an electronic traction control system, using the same sensors as the ABS brakes, to stifle wheel-spin when accelerating hard. The Racing and Performance School finds its 480 Turbo coupes are standing up well to the tough life they lead. Many who drive them are not exactly experts, nor do they want to become racing drivers. Their aim is to enjoy themselves while improving their car control skills and becoming better, safer motorists. On the circuit, wearing full harness and with an instructor beside them, they can explore their own (and the car's) limits without risk to life or licence. A point the school makes is that, unless they have had advanced driving instruction, all motorists have taught themselves how to drive at over 40 mph (65 kmh) - with, it has to be said, varying degrees of success. So, one of the first principles to take on board at Castle Combe is that good fast driving is, above all, smooth and safe driving. You are told always to brake and, if necessary, change down when in a straight line on the approach to a corner and then turn into it. With the car nicely balanced, you apply power progressively, clipping the apex of the corner and using the full width of the track as you exit, accelerating hard up the straight. After a few practice laps you find that not only are you getting it right but that it is the natural, relaxed way to drive a car quickly. Of course, the tyres whimper when cornering; but if they howl, you know you are losing speed as well as smoothness by steering coarsely, putting on too much power, or both. Is any of this relevant to driving on the road? Obviously, the racing line on corners is for circuits only. But the consistent smoothness, unbroken concentration and proper use of brakes and gears which also are taught are the hallmarks of a good driver. Just as hard acceleration, inattention, sudden swerves and harsh braking are those of an indifferent one. Compared with the cost of a no-claims bonus lost through thoughtless driving, an Pounds 89 half-day introductory session at Castle Combe with expert tuition and the use of the Volvo 480 Turbo is money well spent. At Racing and Performance School a full day, with both introductory and higher-standard intermediate sessions, is Pounds 175. Call or fax 0793-751-855 for details. IT IS not just the average driver's skill that needs improving. We are, it seems unsure to woefully ignorant of some of motoring's basic rules. According to a survey of 1,000 drivers of all kinds carried out for Volvo Car UK, four out of five do not know the correct stopping distance from 70 mph (112 kmh) or - unbelievably - even the speed limit in built-up areas. For the record, it is 245ft (75 metres) plus thinking time before applying the brakes - say, 300ft (92 metres) in all, and that is on a dry surface. The speed limit is 30 mph (48 kmh). The survey showed that the 20 per cent of drivers who hog the outside lane on a motorway, thinking it is meant for fast cruising and not overtaking, are likely to be young (17-24 years old) or over 65. Fewer than half of us know that headlamps should be flashed only as a warning. The rest think a flash means anything from 'Get out of my way - I want to overtake' to 'Come through - I'm waiting for you.' Women drivers are revealed as knowing just as much about the rules of the road as men, and are said to be more aware of correct speed limits. Do they take greater notice of them? The survey is tactfully silent.</p>

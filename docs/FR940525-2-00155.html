			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, as discussed above, the Commission also is approving today information barrier procedures for BSE specialists. These procedures ensure that upstairs firms affiliated with BSE specialists will not receive information advantages due to the relationship between the entities. <FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&hyph;34076 (May 18, 1994) approving BSE's information barrier proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow the BSE to implement its competing specialist proposal on a one-year pilot basis. In making this determination, the Commission has carefully analyzed the potential benefits from competition, such as better quotes, with the potential for increased internalization of order flow. The Commission believes that the BSE has incorporated features in its proposal to allow it to implement, for a one-year period, a competing specialist system that will allow firms to designate order flow to an affiliated specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, nevertheless, believes that before the BSE proposal will be extended beyond the one-year pilot period or approved on a permanent basis, the BSE will have the burden to prove that its proposal resulted in added depth and liquidity to its market and improved quotations. The Commission emphasizes that if the Commission is dissatisfied with the data or the market effects of the pilot, it would not be inclined to extend the competing specialist program. Accordingly, the Commission requests that the BSE provide, on a quarterly basis, the following information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. A list indicating how many competing specialists are on the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A list identifying, for each competing specialist, the issues in which they are competing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The volume of ``preferenced'' trades in each issue; and the percentage of total volume of trades sent to the BSE for execution in each issue represented by ``preferenced'' volume. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The volume of ``preferenced'' share and transaction volume; and the percentage of total BSE share and transaction volume the ``preferenced'' volume represents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. BSE's volume attributable to ITS commitments sent by other ITS participant markets; and the percentage of such commitments attributable to ``preferenced'' issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The number of ``preferenced'' orders executed by the non-designated specialist(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The number of ``preferenced'' orders effected against the limit order book, both in total and separately for each ``preferenced'' issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The number of limit orders placed on the book, as compared to before the commencement of this pilot, both for the BSE as a whole and separately for the stocks for which there are competing specialists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. BSE's share of Tape trade reports, as compared to before the commencement of this pilot. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, we request the Exchange to submit a report to the Commission, discussing the data outlined above, eight months from the date of commencement of the competing specialist pilot. The report should discuss such data in terms of the effects of the competing specialist pilot on the quality of the BSE market with respect to depth, liquidity, and quote improvement. <FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Should any other exchange attempt to implement a similar system that is acceptable to the Commission, it should be noted that the pilot period would be limited to the same one year period afforded the BSE. At the end of such period, all such systems will be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny regardless of how long they may have been in operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds preliminarily that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission preliminarily believes the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) because it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of free and open market and a national market system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;12) is approved for a period of one year through May 18, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)92) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 59 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Continuously Enhance Sense of National </F> Defense, Solidly Foster Idea of Duty--Marking 10th Anniversary  of Promulgation of `PRC Military Service Law' in Force"]    [Text] The 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the  "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China" falls  on 31 May this year. Practice over the past 10 years proves  that this "Military Service Law" has made important  contributions to enhancing the whole nation's awareness of  national defense, strengthening the modernization of national  defense and the Army, safeguarding state security and social  stability, and enabling socialist modernization to proceed  smoothly. It is in line with our national conditions, the  conditions of the Army, and the general circumstances at home  and abroad.    The enforcement of the "Military Service Law" as a basic law  governing the modernization of national defense has always been  and will always be closely bound up with Army building and the  building of reserve defense forces. The fact that, over the  past 10 years, the building of national defense and the Army has  consistently enjoyed a fine atmosphere and care and support from  the whole society is a result of the conscientious  implementation of the "Military Service Law" by party and  government organs at all levels, organizations, enterprises and  institutions, and all circles of society. The nationwide  enlistment drive has long stayed at high tide and batch after  batch of outstanding young people reaching enlistment age vie  with each other to join the Army and loyally execute their  honorable obligation to defend their motherland. The personnel  of our Army have always been young and strong, the services have  been able to keep a large number of mainstay technical  personnel, efforts have been made to align the building of  militia and reserve services with the requirements of people's  warfare under modern circumstances, the mobilization capacity of  reserve forces has continuously expanded, proper arrangements  have been made for large numbers of armymen transferred to  civilian work and ex-servicemen who play a positive role in  economic construction, and military training work for the broad  ranks of students in institutions of higher learning and senior  middle schools has moved ahead vigorously. All of these have  benefited from the implementation of the "Military Service Law."  It is also a result of the mobilization and education provided  by the "Military Service Law" that the building of militia and  reserve services has strengthened in an all-round way and has  played an important role in safeguarding social stability and  promoting the building of the two civilizations. In short, the  positive influence of the enforcement of the "Military Service  Law" on the building of the Army and reserve forces as well as  the building of the entire country is multifaceted and of  profound and far-reaching significance.    There is an important experience in the 10-year enforcement  of the "Military Service Law" that deserves to be carried  forward: Making a good job of the implementation of the  "Military Service Law" under the new circumstances not only  depends on the standardizing function of the "Military Service  Law" itself, but in the meantime cannot go without propaganda  and education on the strategic significance of implementing the  "Military Service Law" and all relevant stipulations. The  officers and men of our Army and the broad ranks of personnel in  the militia and reserve services should continuously enhance  their consciousness of national defense and firmly establish  awareness of their obligation to enlist in the army through  in-depth study of the "Military Service Law."    Making a good job of education in national defense and  enhancing the sense of national defense is an issue which the  CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central  Military Commission have time and again emphasized since the  beginning of reform and opening up, especially since the 14th  party congress. This is because it is an ideological foundation  for strengthening the building of national defense and the Army  and guaranteeing the implementation of the "Military Service  Law." This point is ever more important in a peaceful  environment. If a country or nation lacks a strong sense of  national defense, it is bound to plunge into no end of crises  and may even suffer national humiliation and forfeiture of  sovereignty. If an army or an armed force has a weak sense of  national defense, even if it is well equipped, it will not have  a strong fighting will or high combat effectiveness and will not  be able to win a war. Making a good job of education in  national defense and enhancing the sense of national defense is  not only an important aspect, but a primary precondition in the  implementation of the "Military Service Law." Education will  help each armyman on active service, militiaman, and member of  the reserve service to foster patriotism and revolutionary  heroism to a greater extent in themselves and conscientiously  make their due contributions by discharging their sacred  responsibility to protect state security and safeguard social  stability and by providing a powerful security safeguard for the  deepening of reform and economic development.    Compulsory military service is the main body of the  military service system and is the basic military service system  of our country. Firmly establishing an awareness in people's  minds of the importance of performing military service and of  executing their duties according to the law is the most  fundamental prerequisite for enforcing the "Military Service  Law." In the context of the development of a socialist market  economy, it is of especially important significance to emphasize  this issue. Only by being firmly duty-minded can one correctly  understand and treat the adjustments to various interest  patterns and interest relations caused by social changes,  consistently put the country's security and state interests  above everything else, and regard performing military service  and executing one's duty according to the law as the most  honorable sacred responsibility. Only with this can we  effectively resist the influence of money worship and various  erroneous ideologies and selflessly dedicate our youth and blood  to the glorious positions of army building and protecting our  motherland. Only with this can the broad ranks of militiamen  and reserve service personnel seek prosperity while being  vigilant against possible dangers, take an active part in  military training, conscientiously perform various duties in  preparation for war, truly become capable assistants to the  People's Liberation Army and a strong reserve force, and give  better play to their role as a mainstay force in promoting and  protecting socialist modernization.    Since the "Military Service Law" was promulgated 10 years  ago, local governments at all levels and the general public have  done a great deal of fruitful work to strengthen the  modernization of national defense and have created many  favorable conditions for army building and the building of  reserve defense forces for which we would like to express our  deepest respect and gratitude. We are determined to do a better  job in studying, propagating, and implementing the "Military  Service Law" under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee  and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as  the core, and, together with the people of all nationalities in  the country and under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, continue to  make new contributions to speeding up the modernization of  national defense.</p>

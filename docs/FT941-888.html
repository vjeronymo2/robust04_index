			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Food retailing The big food retailers scared themselves and their shareholders witless last year by competing over-aggressively on price. But they appear to have re-established a more orderly grocery market in recent months. Big price promotions have stopped since J. Sainsbury stamped its foot and launched its essential-for-essentials campaign. Yet the critical question remains whether that price skirmishing represented a one-off adjustment to the discount threat or was just the first manifestation of a downward price spiral caused by over-capacity. Wm Morrison recently soothed the market by suggesting the former. Food retailers are also trying to stabilise the situation by scaling back new store developments. Stricter planning restrictions are reinforcing the effect. There is still some scope to grow profits by nailing suppliers to the floor and cutting in-house costs. The grocers are also broadening their product ranges and hastening diversification plans. Sainsbury's already boasts a presence in the US through Shaw's and runs Savacentre and Homebase in the UK too. Tesco has dipped its toe in France and a toe nail in Hungary. Even so, the sector's earnings outlook will remain dull for a few years yet. A big re-rating therefore seems unlikely. However, there is undoubtedly great value to be had over the longer term as the cash stream remains strong and development costs tumble. An outside bidder with a lot of patience may yet be tempted to unlock it. If the grocery chains were any smaller, their own managers may have been tempted to have a go.</p>

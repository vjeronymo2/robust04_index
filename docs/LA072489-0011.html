			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Mary Martin's longstanding record for the number of times she had her hair  washed onstage is about to be broken. During her legendary run in "South  Pacific" (beginning in 1949), Martin washed that man right out of her hair 837  times. On Saturday, actress Rosemary Prinz -- one of the original cast members  of the New York production of "Steel Magnolias" -- will celebrate 838 stage  shampooings. The beauty parlor-set show (currently represented locally at the  Wilshire) has played at the off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Theatre since June 19,  1987. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

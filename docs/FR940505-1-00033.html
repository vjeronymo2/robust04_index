			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's current challenge to minimize federal intrusion is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the proposal and promulgation of these federal plans_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans which EPA hopes to see replaced by state and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Consequently, EPA will withdraw or rescind any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal measure it proposes or promulgates as soon as it can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve acceptable SIP measures submitted by the state which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for commensurate emissions reductions. In fact, EPA hopes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these FIPs will become obsolete as a regulatory matter. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining value of these FIPs would then be the partnerships and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solutions which both minimize federal intrusion and enable the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state and local agencies to achieve the clean air goals as the law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> envisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To put this another way, while EPA's goal is to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal intrusion into state and local decision making and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation authority, only prompt action by California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials_within the timetables of the CAAA and the court ordered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadlines_can significantly diminish the FIPs' impact on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state. EPA intends to assist the state and local agencies in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts to adopt and submit ozone SIPs with the requisite emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions and ozone attainment demonstrations. As pointed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier in this discussion, successful state and local action will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow EPA to withdraw the regulatory pieces of the federal plan or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the scope and stringency of its imposed or impending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Minimize Adverse Socio-Economic Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has attempted to fashion these proposed FIPs to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment obligations while trying hard to avoid unnecessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe social and economic impacts, both through the choice of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular regulations and by the timing of their implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite these mitigatory approaches, federal regulation sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to achieve the NAAQS in these heavily polluted areas has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for significant social and economic disruption. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inevitable result of the extraordinary emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required, the advanced level of control that already exists, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the constraints on EPA's authority and practical ability to enact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and implement many of the most appropriate control approaches for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these areas. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Current control strategies in these areas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially in the South Coast, already employ state of the art  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology and regulatory design for many pollution sources. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve attainment in these areas, in effect, we must do even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better. To mitigate the severe impact of further near-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction requirements, EPA has attempted to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control options which provide emission sources with flexibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentives for technological development, product reformulation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution prevention. We will look to the public comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals to further identify such strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposals in this rulemaking are designed to achieve the substantial emission reductions required in these three areas and are not necessarily appropriate for areas with lesser problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We want to emphasize here again that state and local agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are in a far better position to tailor plans for the areas that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize adverse impacts of the attainment obligations. Through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proximity they have a better understanding of their emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources and their local communities. They can also achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant mobile source reductions from transportation and land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use measures that are beyond EPA's resources and authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement directly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, there is a growing body of evidence supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of market-based programs, sometimes incorporating fees, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage emissions reductions and transitions to cleaner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies and processes. Such policies can be effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed and implemented at the local level where a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding of local conditions and economies can be integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into a flexible program and, regarding fee-based programs, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revenues can be redistributed within the community. A well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed program can effectively minimize the disruptive impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major emissions reductions. Conversely, federal measures for local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation must be general enough to provide for enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a distance, and have severe legal restraints relative to local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revenue issues. The federal Miscellaneous Receipts Act, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, requires revenues from any such federal fee-based programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury, thereby preventing their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redistribution within the local community. In short then, locally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed and implemented plans become the best means of minimizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> socio-economic impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Ensure Fairness with Respect to Impacts on the Population as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whole and on Individual Air Pollution Sources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extent of the air quality problems in these three areas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as principles of equity, demand that emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must come from every source of pollution_from cars to refineries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to hand-held spray paint. Fairness is an elusive goal_what seems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair to one may not seem fair to another_but there are a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts to bear in mind as we formulate a plan for clean air: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some emission sources have been required to reduce more than others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the past; (2) Some emissions can be reduced more cheaply than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others; (3) Some individuals and sources of emissions can more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easily afford to comply with air pollution regulations than others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Myriad sources comprise the pieces of the air quality problem,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and each of these sources must be part of the solution. What part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the solution each will contribute, and how to fashion those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributions into a plan is where the challenge lies. EPA has and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to consider the issue of fairness as it develops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these FIP strategies. We encourage the regulated community and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public to make sure that the clean air strategies which ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> get implemented are fair by: (1) Constructively participating in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP public involvement processes; and (2) supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of appropriate SIP measures to displace as much of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the FIPs as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Ensure That the Federal Government Does its Part to Contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Solution <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

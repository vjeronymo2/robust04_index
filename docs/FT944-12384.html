			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Canal-Plus leads digital race Canal-Plus, the French media group, is expected to be the first European broadcaster to launch a digital television service when it starts digital transmissions late next year. Societe Europeene des Satellites (SES), the Luxembourg-based company that operates the Astra satellites, said yesterday that it had signed a contract with Canal-Plus for the French company to relay a digital service from the Astra 1E and Astra 1F satellites, which will be launched in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Digital television, which enables broadcasters to relay higher quality screen images and to transmit up to 10-times the usual number of channels from each satellite, is already on stream in the US, where Direct TV began digital transmissions this summer. Almost all the main European broadcasters have expressed interest in launching digital services over the next decade, but Canal-Plus is the only European broadcaster to have committed itself to booking satellite space for its forthcoming service. The French company, according to SES, could start digital transmissions from late next year when descrambling devices will be available. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks have entered what one could  describe as the final stage. It is the most difficult phase,  though, because it has to do with governing the country.  Government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] negotiators today began discussing national  reconciliation. There are already differences about UNITA's  participation at the various levels of government and the  reinstatement of state administration to every corner of Angola.  UNITA also wants to rule in Benguela and Huambo Provinces. It  also wants the Ministry of Public Works and the portfolios of  deputy ministers of interior and finance. The government has  already rejected this. UNITA has raised obstacles regarding the  reinstatement of territorial administration. The two  delegations agreed to deal with the issue tomorrow.    Also being discussedf is the return of buildings owned by  the  two sides. The government and UNITA have agreed to return each  other's buildings. The future of the Voice of Resistance of the  Black Cockerel [Vorgan] is also being discussed, namely when  will it stop being partisan. The government says Vorgan cannot  continue broadcasting on short wave because it is against the  law. UNITA says it is necessary that Vorgan continues on the  air, but it says it will look into the matter.</p>

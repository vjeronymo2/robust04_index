			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan down by 2.4% as liquidity dries up Most senior bourses were closed for the Whit Monday holiday. In London, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index indicated a gentle, and almost general downtrend and, with Wall Street lower, neither Milan nor Madrid were disposed to argue at the end of the European day. MILAN added to last week's declines with a further 2.4 per cent fall, although some late buying helped to pick shares up from their lowest levels. The Comit index, which lost 18.48 was seen testing support at 757.97, in modest trading which involved further selling by foreign investors. Mr Michele Pacitti at NatWest Securities noted that the current downturn had accompanied the drying up of the high levels of liquidity that had driven the market higher after the general election at the end of March. Fiat lost L166 or 2.4 per cent to L6,687 but Olivetti picked up from a day's low of L2,740 to finish down L44 at L2,822. Against the trend, Italmobiliare rose L927 to L48,330 on the view that recent falls had been overdone. Assitalia added L282 to L18,150 in response to the the Berlusconi government's statement that it would stick to the planned privatisation schedule of the insurer's parent, INA. Nuovo Pignone rose L60 to L6,750 as ENI complete the sale of a majority stake to General Electric of the US. MADRID's midsession recovery foundered on weakness on Wall Street, and the general index closed 0.29 lower at 337.91 after a high of 339.36. Turnover fell to Pta22.7bn as attention focused on second rank stocks. TEL AVIV had another bad day. Israel's central bank raised interest rates by half a percentage point in an effort to stem rising inflation and housing costs, and the Mishtanim index slid by 5.14, or 2.55 per cent to 196.20. This followed a 2.4 per cent fall on Sunday, after Israel Radio broadcast more excerpts from a controversial speech which Mr Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman, made in a Johannesburg mosque on May 10. The radio said that Mr Arafat's remarks put into doubt his commitment to the deal on Palestinian self-rule. ATHENS fell 2.8 per cent, driven down by one month interbank rates that remained above 140 per cent and a liquidity shortage due to pressures on the drachma. The general index closed 25.91 lower at 887.08 in active volume of 1.3m shares. WARSAW extended its recent gains, the Wig index rising by 423, or 3.6 per cent, to 12,240.8. Brokers liked the fact that most stocks were appreciating moderately, but with foreign investors remaining on the sidelines there were also fears that profit-taking could interrupt the uptrend.

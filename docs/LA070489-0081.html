			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ahmed Khomeini, the son of Iran's late ruler, indicated he is not running for  president, virtually ensuring that Speaker of Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani  will win the post. In a letter to Parliament, Khomeini said he needs time to  recover from the death of his father a month ago before considering his  political future, according to Tehran Radio. Khomeini, known to have had  presidential ambitions, was the only person seen able to pose a serious  challenge to Rafsanjani in the July 28 election. In his letter, Khomeini  reaffirmed his backing for senior leaders, including President Ali Khamenei.  </P></p>

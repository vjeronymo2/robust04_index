			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> F-15 SALES TO SAUDIS MAY AID MCDONNELL DOUGLAS  </P> <P> A U.S. sale of the advanced version of F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia  would provide at least a modest boost to some defense contractors, particularly  ailing St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, which has said it will eliminate  17,000 jobs this year.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected to work out details of the sale,  involving 24 F-15 Eagles, during his current visit to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Pentagon would most likely make the sale from its current stockpile, but  McDonnell Douglas would have the opportunity to win an extended contract to  provide replacement aircraft, said Michael Beltramo, a defense-industry  management consultant in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> An advantage of an extended contract, he said, is that the F-15 "is the most  mature" aircraft. Unlike some newer, riskier programs, the manufacturer  understands better "what the costs and risks are" in producing the aircraft.  McDonnell Douglas' experience means that "each aircraft (under an extended  contract) will add a profit to their bottom line," he added.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas spokesman Jim Reed declined to speculate on what effect a  sale to the Saudis would have on the company. Any increased production of the  fighter -- which is manufactured at the company's St. Louis facilities -- would  not affect layoffs announced this year, he said. The company announced the job  cuts -- including 9,000 in Southern California -- as part of a plan to cut  costs by $700 million to improve its profitability.  </P> <P> Reed said the federal government has funded the F-15 program through the fiscal  1991 year. McDonnell Douglas is slated to produce about 24 fighters this year  under its contract, he said. He declined to say what F-15's cost is, but some  analysts said the government's cost may be as high as $50 million for each  fighter, including the total equipment that must be added.  </P> <P> The Pentagon has a current inventory of 800 to 850 fighters, Beltramo said.  </P> <P> The F-15 Eagle is the most sophisticated version of the fighter plane. That  version has never been sold to the Saudis although they have purchased the  F-15C and the F-15D. The Reagan Administration considered selling the advanced  F-15 to the Saudis about five years ago, but abandoned it because of an  expected bitter fight with a Congress concerned that the sale would endanger  Israel.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Dean Takahashi contributed to this article.  </P></p>

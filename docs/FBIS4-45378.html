			<p>Eradication   Failure   <F P=102> NC0606115694 Paris AFP in English 1025 GMT 6 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> NC0606115694 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 6 (AFP) -- Lebanon on  Monday denied Israeli reports that it had failed in its campaign  to eradicate hashish and poppy growing in the Syrian-controlled  al-Biqa' Valley, as a UN delegation was set to begin drug talks  here.    "Israel is trying to undermine Lebanon and Syria's  reputations," the head of the national anti-drug commission,  Sultan Haydar, told AFP.    He dismissed as "provocation" a report published on May 27  by  the Israeli daily MA'ARIV alleging that Israel was developing a  "biological weapon" to destroy Lebanese poppy fields to end  drug-trafficking across the border.    "There isn't a single plant of hashish or poppy in the  Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil region (of the al-Biqa')," Haydar said.    "For the third consecutive year the Lebanese armed forces,  assisted by the Syrian army, have eliminated drugs from that  region and violators are being punished," added Haydar, who is  also an advisor to the agriculture minister.    A delegation of the UN Development Program for the fight  against drugs in Lebanon was to start a five-day visit in  Lebanon on Monday to discuss efforts to eradicate the growing of  hashish and poppy from the al-Biqa' Valley.    A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said the delegation  would visit the Ba'labakk region in the al-Biqa' to get first  hand information on the joint Lebanese-Syrian efforts.    According to MA'ARIV the Israeli police last year called on  the most advanced genetic engineering techniques to develop a  gene, based on poppy derivatives, capable of destroying up to 70  percent of the Lebanese crop.    Israel's coordinator in Lebanon Uri Lubrani told MA'ARIV  that  once there is peace with Syria and Lebanon "and the opening of  borders I don't even want to think about the catastrophe that  could take place."    An Israeli police spokesman has declined to confirm or deny  the report.</p>

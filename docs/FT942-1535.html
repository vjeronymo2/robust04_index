			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (9): So close - and yet so far apart - Paul Abrahams considers the affinity - and also the antipathy - towards the Japanese South Korea is xenophobic. Suspicion of foreigners and foreign goods is instilled at primary schools, propagated by the media and practised by bureaucrats and businesspeople. There are, of course, individual exceptions. But South Korea is probably one of the most xenophobic countries in the world. The cause of this extraordinary collective dislike of things and people foreign is not hard to fathom. Korea has been invaded, ravaged, and economically exploited by foreign powers throughout its history. Forces from the country's three powerful neighbours, Japan, China and Russia, have all battled over the country, while even before the Korean War, troops from the US, France and the UK each made incursions of various gravity. Although Korea has endured onslaughts from all directions, South Korea's xenophobia is targeted at one country in particular - Japan. A visit to the Independence Hall of Korea, near Chonan, a shrine to nationalism visited daily by thousands of children, explains why. The most popular exhibit - in the Japanese Aggression Hall - is a waxwork display illustrating Japanese soldiers during the occupation between 1910 and 1945. They are shown in the process of torturing Korean women, and burying Korean men up to their necks before beheading them. The hall explains to the children how the enmity between the two countries dates back to the first Japanese invasion of 1592 when Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi's forces ransacked the country. They can read citations of merit awarded during the conflict which granted a stipend to Koreans who beheaded more than one Japanese soldier. On view is a replica of one of the 'turtle ships' that Admiral Yi Sun-Shin used to destroy the Japanese fleet. And in case the message has not sunk in during the visit, the children can buy comic books retelling the sagas of Korean heroes and heroines fighting against the Japanese. Admittedly, the museum does offer a few details of other foreign incursions. The Manchurian invasion of the early 17th century, which was probably as destructive as the earlier Japanese attack, is given a little space. One of the hundreds of monuments erected in the 1870s by Regent Hungsun Taewon-gun after the French and US landings is also on show. It reads: 'Western barbarians invade our land. If we do not fight, we must then appease them. To urge appeasement is to betray the nation.' But the main emphasis of the museum is directed against the Japanese. Such sentiment is propagated throughout South Korea. Take Korea's submarine construction programme. The first vessel was called Changbogo-Ham, after the 1st century Korean admiral who fought the Japanese. The second was the Lee Chun-ham, named after another admiral who struggled against the Japanese. The third, the Choemuson-Ham, was named after the 14th century admiral who destroyed about 500 Japanese pirate ships using gunpowder and guns. Fourth was the Park-Wi-ham, after the admiral who attacked Tsushima Island in Japan and crushed 300 Japanese vessels in 1389. Even South Korea's armaments programme, the Yulgok project, is named after a 16th century court adviser whose warnings about the possibility of a Japanese invasion were ignored. The Japanese Aggression Hall focuses not only on the atrocities during the colonial period, but also on the cultural imperialism imposed by Japan. In the later stages of its colonial occupation, Japan attempted to force complete union by obliging Koreans to adopt Japanese style names and enforcing use of Japanese in state schools. Inability to speak Japanese meant Koreans were denied ration cards. The Japanese also tried to stop the Koreans wearing their traditional white clothes. Pictures in the hall also show Koreans being forced to worship at Shinto shrines. Few nations continue to poke at the sores of the second world war with as much fervour as Korea. This compares with a Japan, where many continue to deny Japanese blame for the outbreak of hostilities during the Manchurian incident in the 1930s and refuse to admit that the Japanese army committed atrocities during the subsequent war. Earlier this year, Mr Shigeto Nagano was forced to resign as Japan's justice minister just 10 days after taking office. The reason was that he had voiced the view, commonly-held among older Japanese, that the massacre of 150,000 people in the former Chinese capital of Nanking in 1937 never happened. He also claimed that the occupation of China had not been an act of aggression. Many Japanese also still refuse to admit the role of the Japanese imperial army in setting up brothels during the Pacific War using other Asian nationals, including Koreans, known as comfort women. The Japanese government only last year acknowledged and apologised for coercing such women. At least 100,000 of them were Koreans. As for Japanese attitudes to the colonial period, diplomats in Tokyo privately regret that Koreans do not recognise the beneficial side of colonialism. During 37 years of occupation, Korea's economy was transformed, they say. Feudalism was abolished, the political and judicial systems updated, the economy advanced from an agrarian to a semi-industrial state. Agricultural production increased, railways were built and mining and forestry operations vastly expanded. Such patronising attitudes infuriate the Koreans. Given the history of Korea and Japan, lateral relations between the two countries are understandably not as good as they might be. However, both governments are trying to create a rapprochement between the countries, ending centuries of enmity. The Koreans want to reduce their massive and worsening Dollars 8.45bn trade deficit with one of their most important trading partners by attracting Japanese technology and investment, particularly in the realm of automotive components and machine tool technology. The Japanese, for their part, view the possible nuclear build-up in North Korea as a direct threat to their security, and so are anxious to support Seoul. However, to attract additional investment and generate more cordial relations with Japan will require a massive change in attitudes among Koreans, who will have to exorcise the Japanese ghost from their national psyche. It will also need a complete redirection of Korean nationalism. Admittedly, the Korean attitude to Japan is ambiv- alent. There is the fascination of the Japanese economic model. Protectionism, large conglomerates and state- directed investment have all been borrowed from Japan in an effort to emulate that country's economic miracle. Similarly, urban Korean youths are obsessed by Japanese culture. Women openly look at banned Japanese fashion magazines, although many cannot understand Japanese. Adolescent boys read Japanese comics and listen to Japanese music. The ambivalence of Korean youths is shown in the results of a recent survey which recorded that the country they most admire is Japan. But they also view Japan as potentially the most dangerous. Any rapprochement with Japan is likely also to require a reassessment of Korea's own role during the Pacific war. Although the Independence Hall of Korea stresses the horrific treatment by the Japanese of Korean 'comfort women', there is no mention of the tens of thousands of Koreans who fought for the Japanese during the Pacific War, many of them volunteers. The behaviour of Korean prison guards, many of whom had a worse reputation for cruelty among Allied prisoners of war than the Japanese, is also glossed over. Nor does the museum explain that Korean collaboration reached the highest echelons of subsequent governments. For example, former President Park Chung-Hee saw active service in the Japanese Imperial Army in China during the final stages of the conflict. Many members of the government after the 1961 coup also had Japanese military experience. How successful are the two governments likely to be in their efforts to reduce animosity? Certainly, the countries have a cultural affinity. The Koreans are proud that the Chinese influence, so pervasive in Japanese life, was transmitted through Korea. They share Confucianism, both support a similar form of capitalism, and they are also among the few democratic governments in Asia. Economically, they could form a powerful trading block. But although they may be physically close, the countries remain mentally apart. The long-term relationship will depend on how Korea views its strategic interests in a post-unification future. Without a threat from the north, Korea will be bereft of an external threat. Is Korea sufficiently mature to feel comfortable without an enemy? South Korean policy makers are unsure whether Korea and Japan, the region's two economic powerhouses, are set on an inevitable collision course, leading to an arms race that would shatter the strategic balance in north-east Asia. The ambition of the Japanese self defence forces to acquire aircraft carriers is viewed with alarm by the Koreans who believe such vessels can in no way be construed as defensive weapons. The alternative policy, viewed as desirable by some bureaucrats in the Blue House, the president's residence, is the creation of huge trading bloc between Japan, Korea and Taiwan, which would offer a combined market almost as large as the US. If they are to be successful in healing this bruised relationship, the Japanese must become more sensitive to Korean concerns. The Koreans, for their part, must develop a more mature form of nationalism, based less on a xenophobic past and more on the needs of the future. The alternative is an arms race that will serve neither countries' interests.  -------------------------------------          TRADE DEFICIT WITH          JAPAN DETERIORATES  ------------------------------------- Year                 Dollars bn  ------------------------------------- 1989                    3.99 1990                    5.93 1991                    8.76 1992                    7.86 1993                    8.45  ------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance  -------------------------------------</p>

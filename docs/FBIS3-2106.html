A survey shows that the province has about 1,000 markets  specializing in labor service, information, technology and real  estate.

One example is a labor market consisting of 71 exchange  centers and over 500 employment offices. It has helped more  than 700,000 people to find new jobs over the past year.    The Hangzhou Enterprise Property Rights Exchange Center,  which opened for service two months ago, has already admitted 10  enterprises as members.    With the encouragement of the provincial government,  research  institutions and scientists have set up more than 2,000 non-  governmental research organizations, and 3,000 technology  associations, in addition to eight technology markets.

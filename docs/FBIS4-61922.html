			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- The Russian-Estonian  negotiations on the withdrawal of troops are now in a blind  alley as concerns both military and humanitarian issues  involved, head of the Russian delegation, Ambassador Vasiliy  Svirin said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS today. No  headway was made in last week's round of talks because of the  "non-constructive approach of the Estonian side," the ambassador  said.    "The Estonian side has gone back on its earlier statements  which Russia regarded as a basis for the withdrawal of the  troops before August 31," the ambassador said, referring to the  statement made by the Estonian delegation head during the 14th  round of talks, who went on record as saying that the agreed  provisions concerning military pensioners remained in force  despite the fact that they were at variance with some clauses of  the law on citizenship of Estonia".    In the present situation there is no need to mislead the  public opinion and continue "negotiations for the sake of  negotiations". For this reason the Russian delegation has come  up with a new proposal. Each of the for main working groups --  on humanitarian and legal, military, economic, and border issues  -- must prepare new versions and formulas in May to pull the  negotiations out of the impasse. Only when it becomes clear  that serious shifts are in the offing, the date can be set for  the next round of talks, the ambassador said.    Russia has no "excessive claims" concerning social insurance  for military pensioners and their families residing in Estonia.  Moscow's position on this is analogous to that it upheld in  negotiations with Latvia. A mutually acceptable solution was  found in those talks and Russia and Latvia signed a package of  agreements, the ambassador recalled. The successful outcome was  made possible thanks to the political will of the two countries  and their readiness for sensible compromise solutions, he said.</p>

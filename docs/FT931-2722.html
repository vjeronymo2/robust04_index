			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Book Review: Regional rewards of civic tradition MAKING DEMOCRACY WORK Civic Traditions in Modern Italy By Robert D Putnam Princeton University Press, Dollars 24.95. 258 pages Here is a book resolutely imbued with counter-cyclical character. Just as cartloads of Italian politicians and businessmen are being arrested on suspicion of involvement in corruption scandals, along comes a lengthy study examining and, in many cases, upholding Italy's credentials as a paradigm of democratic society. The author, a professor of government at Harvard, aided by two Italian academic collaborators, investigates the success of Italian regional institutions since reforms introducing decentralisation were implemented in the early 1970s. This scholarly volume - proclaimed on the back cover as 'beautifully and lucidly written' - suffers from some remarkable drawbacks, not least its use of the most richly ponderous form of American academic argot. If the author constantly repeats some basic themes, often involving phrases of exemplary opacity such as 'norms of reciprocity' and 'vertical and clientistic networks', this may reflect his own doubts about whether readers are penetrating the maze. The book draws its authority from extensive field-work over 20 years - 'thousands of interviews with politicians, community leaders and ordinary citizens'. Curiously, none is quoted by name, although the book is peppered with long extracts from the work of US political scientists. Putnam makes occasional delicate reference to 'patron-client relationships', but ducks the question of corruption as a source of inefficiency in economics and government. Yet the book reaches three conclusions of significance, both within and beyond Italy. First, regions with the most flourishing economies tend to have the best-run, most responsive and most stable regional governments. Second, this combination of public-sector effectiveness and positive economic performance is most evident in regions (particularly in north and north-central Italy) with the longest traditions of civic engagement. Putnam traces back to the 12th century evidence for his contention that 'civics helps to explain economics, rather than the reverse'. Third, Italian regional reform, far from stabilising the country's cohesiveness, is undermining it. Regional reform, writes Putnam, 'appears to be exacerbating, rather than mitigating, the disparities between north and south'. He treats only sketchily the implications of the recent rise of the northern 'leagues' campaigning for regional self-determination in areas such as Lombardy or Veneto. But the reforms, combined with public outrage over corruption, are creating pressures which could lead to a break-up of the Italian state. Putnam's conclusions are both exciting and depressing. Exciting because, if the key to improving prosperity lies less in encouraging individualism, and more in promoting civic public-spiritedness, then governments everywhere might turn to the Italian model as a source of inspiration. Depressing, because the book postulates a form of fatalism determining which regions will fare well, and which will do badly. In the US, this book will support the thesis that the self-help doctrines of Reaganomics was ultimately detrimental to the nation's economic fate. 'History suggests that both states and markets operate more efficiently in civic settings,' Putnam writes. This message might have emanated directly from Hope, Arkansas. In Europe, Putnam's findings support the new-found emphasis of the European Community on 'subsidiarity' - bringing government decision- making as close as possible to the people. Yet the book also shows that simply increasing financial transfers to less well-off regions often has little effect in reducing regional imbalances. At the end of the last century, 'civic' northern Italy was more geared towards agriculture than the south, and had a smaller percentage of its workers in manufacturing. But by 1911 the north boasted incomes 50 per cent higher than the south. By the mid-1980s, for all the funds poured into the Mezzogiorno, the north-south income gap had widened to 80 per cent. Between 1970 and 1988, supremely civic Emilia-Romagna jumped from 45th to 17th place in a list of 80 EC regions ranked by gross domestic product per head. Calabria in the south - the least civic region - stayed in last place. By providing evidence that Italian regions inherit their institutional performances from centuries of civic traditions, Putnam has provided a thesis with disturbing implications, not only for Italy. As one unnamed regional president in an 'uncivic' region said to him: 'This is a counsel of despair] You're telling me that nothing I can do will improve our prospects for success.' If this is a melancholy thought for Calabria, it is still more dispiriting for parts of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe burdened by traditions of autocratic government pre-dating communism. Conversely, Putnam provides hope for now-liberated countries where efforts to overcome the legacy of communism are helped by previous centuries of civic-minded pluralism - for instance, in Bohemia or the Baltic states. A sign of the longevity of pre-communist political and cultural traditions has already been seen in the former Yugoslavia, as well as, less disastrously, in the break-up of Czechoslovakia. This week, the Italian prime minister has spoken of the risk that his country could split between north and south. In Italy's current political confusion, the regions' diverse traditions of civic responsibility, and the evident failure of a large part of the political elite to live up to them, are aggravating fissiparous tendencies. It is to be hoped that these pressures will not force Italy to the brink.</p>

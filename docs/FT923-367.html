			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Political resentment thrives in a country divided: The economic divergence between north and south, reflected in the impeachment drive IT IS ironic given Brazilian President Fernando Collor's rhetoric of modernisation that he should hail from one of the country's most backward states, while the most advanced states are at the forefront of the campaign to unseat him. Alagoas, in Brazil's poverty-stricken northeast, is the kind of place where men kill for honour and hired gunmen cost less than a pair of sneakers. Another world entirely from the industrialised south, its air is heavy with the sickly aroma of sugarcane on which the state's economy has been based since colonial days. Brazil's notorious income gap - the world's highest - is particularly shocking in Alagoas where 27 families carve up 40 per cent of state income. Four fifths of the 2.47m population lack clean water and earn an average monthly wage of less than Dollars 100 (Pounds 57) per household. Taking advantage of the population's poverty and lack of education, politics in Alagoas is conducted on the basest level. Candidates proffer cement, food parcels, medicines or money in an innovative system known as voto carbono. Voters must present a carbon copy of their ballot slip to receive their bribe. In much of the state plantation workers are kept in penury by plantation bosses who command their votes. Physical intimidation of candidates is common. Mr Wilson Perpetuo, the state home secretary, says: 'Alagoas has a tradition of political violence. He who has had power or lusts after it won't accept someone else having it, and so shoots him.' The Collor family, it seems, is no exception. Mr Collor's senator father shot a colleague on the floor of the House (hitting the wrong man), while his brother-in-law recently took aim at a mayor. Mr Collor's critics say that his alleged lack of morality and imperial attitude in his 30 months in office reveal his true colours as a northeastern aristocrat. One of his own ministers comments: 'His problem is he took the politics of Alagoas to Braslia.' Such remarks are provoking mounting tension between north and south, particularly as the campaign for impeachment has been concentrated in the south where all the leading newspapers and TV networks are based. Mr Jose Afanio Godoy, editor of the Journal de Alagoas, complains: 'The south just couldn't take being governed by a politician from a poor northeastern state.' Behind this resentment lies the political over-representation of the small north and northeastern states and the huge divergence between north and south economically, a gap heightened by the south's rapid industrialisation since the 1950s. While national per capita income is Dollars 2,600, conditions for the 42m inhabitants of the northeast are among the poorest in the world. Almost half live below the poverty line. Life expectancy in Alagoas is 19 years less than in Sao Paulo. Mr Marcio Porangaba Costa, economics professor at Alagoas University, says 'the northeast is for Brazil what Ethiopia is for the world'. Yet politically it is the south that feels discriminated against. With a population of 61m and contributing just 17.9 per cent of GDP, the north and northeast has 264 senators and congressmen, almost as many as the 289 for the south and southeast with its far larger population of 84m and 75.9 per cent of GDP. It takes 10,750 voters to elect a congressman in the northern state of Roraima compared to 330,000 in the southern state of Sao Paulo. The blame lies with the military rulers of 1964-85 who, to retain power with a semblance of electoral legitimacy, increased the representation of small rural states that could be easily manipul-ated. Southerners have long been uncomfortable with this situation, pointing out that without the north, Brazil would be a very rich country. Sao Paulo state alone has a GDP equal to that of Mexico. However, although Sao Paulo once attempted segregation, Brazilians generally take pride in the country's social harmony - remarkable considering its large population and ethnic mix. But the Collorgate scandal is changing that, centred around a northeastern president who has challenged southern economic interests by opening up the Brazilian market. Separatist parties have formed in the south, together with campaigns to form new southern states to increase political representation. In Sao Paulo last week Radio Atual, a radio station for the large community of northeastern migrants, was attacked and 'Get Out Northeastern Rats' painted over its walls. Mr Alceu Collares, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, proposes revising the federal structure. 'Brazil is the only country in the world where minorities govern,' he complains. But with small states dominating Congress it would be difficult to muster support among congressmen to change the political balance. Moreover, there seems little likelihood of improving the economic balance, partly because it suits the northeastern elite to have the majority of the population poor, backward and easy to control. Northeastern presidents such as Mr Collor and his predecessor Jose Sarney have failed to reduce the gap. Nor, as state governor from 1986-89, did Mr Collor improve income distribution within Alagoas. These days Mr Collor is not popular in Alagoas. Many locals accuse him of bringing the state's name into disrepute, not least because his presidency has become known as 'the Republic of Alagoas'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Population    % of   Senators &amp;  Electors per    % of                    (m)       total  congressmen  congressmen   total GDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORTHEAST         42.2       29.0       178                      13.6 Maranhao           4.7        3.4        21         140,000       0.93 Piaui              2.6        1.8        13         135,000       0.48 Ceara              6.3        4.3        25         170,000       1.56 Rio Grande   de Norte         2.4        1.7        11         180,000       0.90 Paraoba            3.2        2.2        15          75,000       0.71 Pernambucco        7.1        4.9        28         170,000       2.41 Alagoas            2.5        1.7        12         115,000       0.79 Sergipe            1.4        1.0        11         110,000       0.71 Bahia             11.8        8.1        42         170,000       5.07 NORTH             10.1        6.9        86                       4.35 Roraima            0.2        0.2        11          10,750       0.06 Acre               0.4        0.3        11          17,625       1.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North/Northeast total: percent total population; 36,  GDP; Dollars 60bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: World Bank, IBGE, Instituto de Nutricao, TSE (1991)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Population    % of   Senators &amp;  Electors per    % of                    (m)       total  congressmen  congressmen   total GDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTHEAST         62.0        42.5       181                     58.2 Sao Paulo         32.0        21.4        63       330,000       36.0 Rio               12.5         8.6        49       190,000       12.0 SOUTH             22.1        15.1        86                     17.69 Rio Grande   do Sul           9.2         6.3        34       195,000        8.36 South/Southeast total: percent total population; 58,  GDP; Dollars 200bn  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Northeast     Brazil Total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Population                                          42m             146m Life expectancy                                      46               60 Percent households below poverty line              44.0             23.3 Percent households with electricity                34.3             60.2 Infant mortality                           100 in 1,000      60 in 1,000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

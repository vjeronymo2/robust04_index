			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 19 (CTK) -- Katarina Tothova, the  ex-minister of justice and a member of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), does not think that public  competition for the posts of state officials, the conditions of  which the HZDS published in the form of an advertisement in the  daily PRAVDA on Friday [13 May], was incorrect or even illegal.  "Everybody may do everything which is not forbidden by the  law," Tothova said today at a press conference of the "shadow  cabinet" of the HZDS leader and former premier, Vladimir Meciar.    She said she considered it highly moral that the HZDS was  preparing its own potential of experts, and recommended other  parties to follow suit. She said she expected the HZDS to be  represented in the government after the autumn elections.    Although polls have shown a decline in the HZDS's  popularity,  the movement still enjoys the highest confidence of voters (27  percent), and has great election ambitions.    On Wednesday [18 May], PRAVDA rescinded the contract with  the  HZDS for its "not keeping to the advertising rules." The  full-page advertisements worth almost 2.5 million crowns  ($80,600) will not be published any longer. Besides the  conditions of public competition, they also included attacks  against Slovak President Michal Kovac and some members of the  present cabinet of Jozef Moravcik.</p>

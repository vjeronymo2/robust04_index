			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: Much music making in Zurich - Ronald Crichton enjoys Henze, Wagner and Verdi operas plus a Cecilia Bartoli recital Not many European cities can offer an opera house as pleasant to visit as Zurich's lakeside complex with its cosy, comfortable, main auditorium. Nor can there be many where you can see three operas and a star recital in the space of 10 days. A balance is maintained between the old repertory opera and the stagione system with only one or two productions on show for longer than most visitors stay. New to Zurich was Nikolaus Lenhoff's production of the revised version of Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg, described by Andrew Clark after the premiere in Munich last year. This has been transferred, with (except for William Cochran's authoritative Elector) a new cast and conductor. It was Luchino Visconti who suggested to Henze an opera on Kleist's play about a dreamy, impetuous soldier-prince at odds with the traditions of Prussian militarism. Ingerborg Bachmann condensed the drama into a workable libretto, softening the military aspect on the way. When the opera was first given, at Hamburg in 1960 (yes, Homburg in Hamburg) much stress was laid on the brevity and concision of Henze's new score compared with the overflowing abundance of its predecessor, Konig Hirsch. Indeed this short three-acter is not prolix and there is a Stravinskyan pungency and economy. Yet coming back to Homburg after more than 30 years the chief impression was of welcome re-immersion in Henze's early, luxurious sound-world, poised somewhere between Konig Hirsch and the ballet Ondine which followed soon after. Gottfried Pilz's dignified single set, saved from monotony by the enchanted lighting, uses a front gauze, right for the opening and closing scenes but dulling some important action details, like the business of the laurel wreath and the glove filched by the Prince from his beloved Princess Natalie. Sights and sounds of war were so much played down as to be almost unnoticeable. The baritone Thomas Hampson is swiftly making the title-role in Homburg his own. He may not have (few opera singers can claim this) the other-wordliness concealing inner strength of the actor Gerard Philipe who so memorably played the Prince in the TNP production of the play in Paris. Yet he is elegant in bearing and movement, and he deals easily with Henze's consciously Italianate vocal lines. Already Hampson gives a credible portrait of a Hamlet-like dreamer with misdirected spurts of activity. Otherwise, apart from Cochran's Elector, the best singing came from Martin Zysset as the Horatio-figure, Count Hobenzollern. Eliahu Inbal conducted, alert and sensitive but inclined to let the brass have its head. The recitalist was the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, who already draws as much applause when she appears on the platform as many singers do when they leave it. A first half of Italian old masters and Mozart songs led up to his 'Parto, parto' from La clemenza di Tito. The second half, all Rossini, ended with the rondo-finale from La cenerentola. Both big pieces were sung with style, intelligence and the right weight of tone for the size of the house. The Italian songs included some Paisiello, a composer for whom Bartoli evidently has a penchant. More, please. Rossini brought five different settings of some favourite lines by Metastasio, characterised with dazzling clarity, also French songs in which, flashing eyes and pouting lips notwithstanding, the words did not tell. Since they are miniature narratives, this mattered. Gyorgy Fisher accompanied. I was glad to catch the revival of Robert Wilson's 1991 Lohengrin with his own Japanese-style abstract sets and stately, hieratic movements. The treatment suits Wagner's phrase-lengths, slow tempi and extended time-scale surprisingly well. Anja Silja's baleful, statuesque Ortrud, complete mistress of the physical style, unobtrusively but firmly dominates the stage. Her cry in the second act to her heathen gods, filled with rage, envy, deep sadness and stifled guilt, was unforgettable. She had strong support the from the wiry, tensely-projected Telramund of Rolf Haunstein. Gosta Winbergh was a better-than-average Lohengrin, Gabrielle Lechner an acceptable Elsa. A bald patch somewhere in the middle register conveyed the girl's hesitations and anxieties rather well. Roland Hermann was a first-rate Herald. The conductor Ralf Weikert allowed the brass to play with a blatancy fully justifying the rude things said about Wagner's loudness in the early days. No such fault in Carlo Franci's polished, finely-controlled account of Macbeth - and loud brass can be more conspicuous in Verdi than anywhere. This was a revival of the 1985 staging by Grischa Asagaroff in Josef Svovoda's ingenious hanging, swivelling panels of fly-chains. A strong central couple: Simon Estes in splendid voice with a steely-voiced, commanding Lady from Mara Zampieri. Laszlo Polgar was a good Banquo. The final chorus was unusually satisfying and conclusive.</p>

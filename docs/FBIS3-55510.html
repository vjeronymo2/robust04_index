In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Sunday, Vladimir  Kazimirov,  head of the Russian delegation to the talks, expressed  satisfaction with the negotiations, stressing that both sides  consider as inadmissible any attempts to internationalise the  conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.    The participants in the talks agreed to take practical steps  and act together if need be in order to end the bloodshed and  stabilise the situation in the war zone. Iran and Russia are  ready to support constructive moves by international  organisations and separate countries in this direction,  Kazimirov said.    Over the last two days Kazimirov met with Iranian [Deputy]  Foreign Minister Mahm'ud Va'ezi and Iranian Foreign Ministry  department for the CIS and the Caucasus Morteza Bank. [sentence  as received]    Russia is acting as a mediator in the conflict settlement in  the disputed enclave. It channels its efforts in several  directions: Mediation proper, activities within the framework of  the Minsk talks of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, as well as active contacts with the states interested in  ending the bloodshed because of their geographical closeness to  the war zone, Kazimirov said.    "Within this context we continue enhancing mutual  understanding with Iran, whose borders are now close to the war  as never before," Kazimirov said.    He stressed that the talks have revealed the closeness of  the  two countries' approaches to and assessments of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. An agreement has been reached to  maintain regular contacts and take concrete steps to resolve the  conflict.    Kazimirov noted that Russia will continue "persistent"  mediatory efforts in order to reach a concrete and binding  agreement on ceasefire and termination of hostilities. This  will pave the way for solving many other problems caused by the  conflict, including the withdrawal of troops from the occupied  territories, the return of refugees to the places of their  permanent residence, resumption of transport services and energy  supplies, and acceleration of the negotiation process on the  whole.    Kazimirov's visit has been initiated by the Russian side,  following a new aggravation of the conflict. The Russian envoy  is expected to leave Tehran on Monday.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TAKING A FLYING LEAP? BUNGEE JUMPERS DO IT  </P> <P> Jumping from a hot air balloon 150 feet in the sky with an elastic cord  attached to a harness around your middle is an unforgettable adrenaline rush.  </P> <P> The world's first commercial hot air balloon bungee jumpers, about 60  thrill-seekers who recently gathered in a Northern California cow pasture, say  the same.  </P> <P> They came from cities across the country to pay the Palo Alto-based Bungee  Adventure company $99 for one jump and a video record of the feat.  </P> <P> Todd Newton, 21, a security guard from Richmond, Calif., became the first  recorded paying customer to make a bungee jump from a hot air balloon at  daybreak on May 5.  </P> <P> "Are you scared?" ground supporters called to him while the green, yellow,  black, red and orange balloon ascended.  </P> <P> "Yeah," he said.  </P> <P> The group on the ground began chanting, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1!"  </P> <P> Prompted by the countdown, Newton hurled himself into space.  </P> <P> "Yeeehaa!" he screamed, dangling triumphantly from the cord seconds later. "I'm  a born bungee baby!"  </P> <P> "We've got a satisfied Yo-Yo," said a beaming John Kockelman, 30, who founded  Bungee Adventure along with his brother, Pete, 32.  </P> <P> After the lunge earthward, the jumper is lowered to the ground.  </P> <P> The Kockelmans, leaders among pioneer bungee jumpers, got into the sport in  October, 1987, doing it for fun in the beginning from bridges, buildings, giant  cranes and redwood trees.  </P> <P> Bungee jumping hot spots also can be found in Australia, where a group has  conducted about 23,000 jumps off bridges, and in France, where two  thrill-seekers fell to their deaths last year.  </P> <P> The Kockelmans went commercial in May, 1988, and have supervised more than  9,000 bungee jumps off bridges.  </P> <P> "We were looking for a better platform when we hit upon the idea of jumping  from a hot air balloon," John said.  </P> <P> Pete obtained a pilot's license and the brothers invested in a $20,000 balloon,  then added another $10,000 in special reinforcing safety features needed for  bungee jumping.  </P> <P> "No one else in the entire world is doing hot air balloon bungee jumping  commercially," John said.  </P> <P> With very little advertising, the Kockelmans' balloon is already booked into  July.  </P> <P> What does it feel like to leap from a hot air balloon?  </P> <P> My jump, known as "The Flight of the Pudgy Eagle," found some answers.  </P> <P> I can report that first comes terror -- during that finite moment your weight  shifts forward, away from the swaying balloon basket -- as every nerve in your  body screams, "Don't do this!"  </P> <P> Seconds after the inexorable plunge toward hostile Earth, terror gives way to  the giggles as the jumper hits the end of his 43-foot-long bungee cord and it  stretches, slowing that awful fall and doubling to 86 feet in length.  </P> <P> Next comes a whacking great rebound -- boing-g-g-g, and another, boing-g-g-g --  high above terra firma.  </P> <P> The giggles are nearly unstoppable as you bob up down like a human yo-yo.  </P></p>

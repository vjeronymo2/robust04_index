			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: TransAlta takes stake in NZ electric utility TransAlta Energy, the Alberta-based power utility, has paid NZDollars 120m (USDollars 75.9m) for a 49 per cent stake in Capital Power, the main electric power distributor in Wellington, New Zealand. The Wellington muncipality retains a 51 per cent interest in Capital Power. The purchase follows last week's announcement that it was acquiring 20 per cent of EnergyDirect, which serves an area around Wellington. TransAlta paid NZDollars 50m for the EnergyDirect stake, which was bought from Enerco New Zealand. The Canadian company gained a foothold in New Zealand last year by forging a partnership with Mercury Energy, formerly the Auckland Electric Power Board, to design the first independent power station in the country. The 110MW plant is due to be commissioned next July. In addition to its Canadian operations, TransAlta has an operating interest in a 1,400MW hydroelectric station in Argentina.</p>

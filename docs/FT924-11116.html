			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: STV chief takes up share options worth Pounds 767,000 MR GUS Macdonald, managing director of Scottish Television, has exercised options to buy 179,600 STV shares at a total cost of Pounds 191,111. At last night's close they were worth Pounds 766,892, giving him a paper profit of Pounds 575,781. He masterminded STV's coup last year in winning renewal of the franchise with a bid to the Independent Television Commission of only Pounds 2,000. However, the company said these share options were granted several years ago and had no direct connection with the licensing round. Mr Macdonald, 52, who started work as a fitter in a Clyde shipyard, joined STV in 1986 from Granda Television, where he had worked on World in Action, was head of current affairs and presented programmes such as Right to Reply and What the Papers Say. Last year's low bid was a financial coup for STV which was unopposed in the tenders and therefore certain to retain its franchise. It made the company one of the UK's most profitable broadcasters for its size. STV spent nearly Pounds 4m on its campaign, the main plank of which was forming and paying for alliances with the leading independent producers in Scotland. Any outsider, therefore, found it difficult to sign up the programming-making talent necessary for a credible bid.</p>

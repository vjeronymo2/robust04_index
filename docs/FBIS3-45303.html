			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- The new Sino-U.S.  textile agreement will create favourable conditions for the up-  coming China visit by the U.S. secretary of the Treasury and the  scheduled meeting between the Chinese and U.S. foreign ministers  in Paris.    Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, made this remark when meeting here this afternoon  with chief U.S. negotiator Jennifer Hillman, who is here  attending the fourth round negotiations on bilateral textile  trade.    The negotiation ended here this afternoon with a new  agreement on the Sino-U.S. textile trade being reached.    "The agreement has been reached through the joint efforts of  both sides and both sides have adhered to the principles of  consultation and equality during the talks," Wu said.    She said that U.S. capital, technology and equipment are  conducive to China's modernization drive, as China's potentially  huge market and abundant source of labour are important to the  United States.    China and the United States are economically complementary  and China attaches great importance to developing cooperation  with the United States in all areas, she said.    Nevertheless, the minister said, various problems and  difficulties may arise in future cooperation between the two  sides. But the best way to address these problems is through  dialogue and consultation on an equal footing, as has been  proved by years of practice.    Any attempt to exert pressure by one side on the other can  only lead to a trade war between them, she said.    China and the United States share common interests in  dealing  with illegal trans-shipment of textiles, Wu said, and added that  she hoped both sides would make joint efforts to address the  issue so as to ensure a smooth implementation of the memorandum  of understanding on the bilateral textile agreement.    Hillman told Wu that the just concluded negotiations were  productive, cooperative and mutually satisfactory.    China is the largest exporter of textiles to the United  States, Hillman noted, and the agreement will provide for  consistent and orderly growth of China's textile and textile  product exports to the United States.    The U.S. chief negotiator also said that the new agreement  will provide strong tools to ensure that the trans-shipment  problem is tackled forcefully.</p>

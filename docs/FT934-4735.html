			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sorrell sells 40% of WPP holding Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the heavily-indebted marketing services group, has sold about 40 per cent of his shares in the company. A total of 848,917 shares were sold by Mr Sorrell on November 18 at 92 1/2 p, leaving him with 1.3m shares out of WPP's issued equity capital of 434m shares. Mr Sorrell is the first director to turn seller of the shares since they began a robust recovery from their all-time low of 22 1/2 p in October 1992. He and some fellow board members had been periodic buyers of the shares during the sharp upturn. Mr Sorrell bought 100,000 shares at 34 1/2 p in September 1992, while other directors acquired stock the following month. Mr Sorrell acquired a further 100,000 shares at 55p this January. WPP's share price peaked at 105p in mid-September, following the sale by banks of most of the ordinary shares they received by converting preference shares in the company. SG Warburg, the stockbroker, bought 46.9m shares at 93p and placed them at 94p with 60 institutions in the UK, US and Europe. The shares yesterday closed 3p up at 91p.</p>

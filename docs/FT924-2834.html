			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: While Jordan's crops flourish exports wither - Regional politics are badly depressing farm incomes in the kingdom IN STARK contrast to other areas of the country's booming economy and despite good weather and a high crop yield last season, Jordan's agriculture sector has hit a slump. Its exports are down by 70 per cent from the 1989 level, local market prices have plummetted, and many crops are being dumped or destroyed. As the rot sets in, the government's plan to diversify its agro-industries through privatisation is failing to attract committed investors, while ministries are bickering over the accuracy of official economic indicators. Jordan's farmers, more than any other sector in the kingdom, continue to suffer from political tension in the region as a result of the Gulf war. Kuwait, which in 1989 bought 29 per cent of the country's agricultural exports, maintains its embargo on all trade as a punishment for Jordan's pro-Iraqi sympathies during the crisis. At the same time Saudi Arabia, which received the lion's share of 41 per cent of Jordan's agricultural exports in 1989, has once again suspended trade amid claims that high levels of contamination were found in a shipment of vegetables from last August. Any hopes that shipments would soon be resumed were dashed last month when King Hussein, in a speech to the nation, made a blistering attack on the two Gulf countries. The collapse in export sales has induced a dramatic fall in prices on the local market. In some cases, fruit and vegetables can be obtained for half as much as last year. The Department of Statistics' projection for the sector's share of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 1992 is 5.8 per cent at market prices, compared to 7 per cent in 1990, but the effect of the trade hiatus with the Gulf states, and how long it will last, is anyone's guess. At least 7.3 per cent of the country's labour force will be directly affected by the crisis. Although officials at the Ministry of Agriculture dispute most of the figures from the Department of Statistics, they admit that things could not be worse. A frustrated Minister of Agriculture, Dr Fayes al Khasawneh, complains of an over cautious private sector, lack of available credit, and sheer bad luck. He fervently refutes that Jordanian produce contains high level of pollution and pesticides. 'We tested samples of vegetables taken from trucks that returned from the (Saudi) border and found that there were no traces of contamination whatsoever.' Yet despite his pleas on television, at business dinners and in public meetings, the private sector refuses to offer any substantial investment in what could be potentially lucrative agro-industries and supporting services. Dr Khasawneh, whose PhD is in soils and fertilisers, enthuses about the need to diversify Jordan's agricultural products by investing in processing plants. 'My thesis is there should be industries built specifically to process crops planted for that purpose,' he explains. 'Take, for instance, our tomato paste plants Why don't they produce juices, sauces, tins, ketchup, the whole gamut?' 'Processing plants should be planned on a contractual basis and food processing could include tinned beans, carrots, sliced grapefruit, tangerines, fruit preserves, etc. If we had this then we could capture east and west European markets,' he said. European markets presently account for 0.6 per cent of total exports. Private investors complain firstly of regional instability. 'Give us peace (with Israel) and we'll invest,' said one entrepreneur. They also fear that the government will fix prices instead of allowing a free market equilibrium. According to Dr Khasawneh, competition with the state is not an option, although the government presently operates a minimum price floor mechanism to support farm prices. The lack of available credit from the state owned Agriculture Credit Company (ACC), which offers nothing to exporters, and commercial banks, is the other major disincentive for investors. 'For the last few years (credit) has not exceeded 12m Jordanian dinars (Dollars 18.07m) from the ACC and a similar amount from private banks,' complains the minister. 'This is inconsequential. We require at least JD40m to JD50m (per annum) considering our output is in excess of JD400m (per annum)'. One positive outcome from the export crisis is that the country has achieved self sufficiency in all home grown crops with the exception of apples, according to the minister. However, with a food import bill of JD417.7m in 1991 in contrast to export sales of only JD86m, according to the Central Bank of Jordan, this is little consolation to at least 20 per cent of the population who receive their income from the agriculture sector. While the deadlock remains the Ministry of Agriculture is calling for an information revolution with accurate economic indicators and agricultural data on which long-term strategy can be based. The governmental Agricultural Marketing Organisation is frantically searching for new markets to fill the void left by the Gulf states, the farmers complain that they are victims of politics, and the private sector continues to wait and see.</p>

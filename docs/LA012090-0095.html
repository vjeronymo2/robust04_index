			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER WILL VISIT CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO SIGNAL SUPPORT  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III will visit Czechoslovakia next month to  signal growing U.S. support for the new government's shift from communism to  democracy, officials disclosed Friday.  </P> <P> Baker, who is going to Moscow on Feb. 4 for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze, also is considering stops in Romania and Bulgaria, the  U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is in the midst of working out a program to lower U.S.  tariffs so Czechoslovakia can boost its trade with the United States.  </P> <P> Baker will meet with Shevardnadze Feb. 6-7 to discuss, among other topics, arms  control and the civil war in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Baker likely will go to Prague on Feb. 8 or 9, depending on other undecided  travel plans, said the officials, who demanded anonymity. He will wind up in  Ottawa for the Feb. 12-13 conference with North Atlantic Treaty Organization  and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers on the U.S. "open skies" proposal.  </P> <P> That proposal would allow unarmed aircraft to fly over other countries'  territories in search of suspected military activity.  </P></p>

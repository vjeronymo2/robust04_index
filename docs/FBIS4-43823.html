			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin by </F> correspondent Nicolas Balique in Dakar; date not given; from the  "Afrique Soir" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Roussin] It can already be said that the situation  is rather good, but we cannot be over optimistic. It is a  difficult operation, people need a great deal of courage to  endure this very important change and a few more months will be  needed to make sure that things are moving in the right  direction. In any case, France stands side by side with Africa,  working with it and supporting it, doing what we have already  been doing since January, namely, ensuring a very concrete  follow-up with very significant measures taken as time goes by  to help our partners live through this difficult period.    [Balique] The key word is recovery, both internal and  export-driven. According to your information, are encouraging  signs or shudders already visible? The case of the Ivory Coast  is an example, but is there any other?    [Roussin] I believe that we could go beyond your excellent  wording, you say shudders, I believe that we can go beyond that.  There are very encouraging signs in a certain number of  countries, I am thinking of Burkina Faso. You mentioned the  Ivory Coast, one could also speak of the situation in Gabon and,  since we are in Dakar, of positive developments in the  Senegalese capital. I can observe very encouraging signs, but  other conditions must be met for a genuine recovery. Legal  guarantees, a single legal system, are needed to give a certain  number of guarantees to investors. A noticeable growth must be  observed too. I am very optimistic and I am convinced that we  will see growth resume and, at last, development become a  reality.    [Balique] Some French businessmen complain of difficulties  encountered in transferring funds.    [Roussin] Rightly so. You are right to stress this problem.  Some of our fellow nationals who are doing business in Africa  encounter very serious difficulties. My mission is to listen to  them and persuade my colleagues, the economics minister and the  minister for social affairs, to make sure that problems  encountered by our fellow countrymen facing difficult times are  being taken in consideration. I met a certain number of French  businessmen in Dakar today, they are facing very serious  difficulties and I appealed to the president of the republic. I  asked him to make sure that when measures are taken concerning  the settlement of the foreign debt, measures will also be taken  to guarantee that debts owed to French businesses by, let us  say, the Senegalese Government, are settled as well, because  businesses too are sometimes owed very large sums of money. In  the current situation Senegal must absolutely do something for  French businesses.</p>

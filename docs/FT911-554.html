			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Letter: Well covered Sir, Certain recent items about Ireland in the Financial Times confirm its reputation as a serious newspaper. I read on March 11 about the alleged substitutability of the new (Irish) pound and the old penny coins; on April 30 a flattering assessment of the Irish psyche; on May 1 about potholes in roads; and on May 8 about the ratio of pubs to population in certain villages. It's as well you invariably locate Irish news on UK pages, otherwise non-Irish readers might be jealous of such attention to my country. Cathal Guiomard, J J Balmerstrasse 8, 4035 Basel, Switzerland</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Americas embrace 'open regionalism' - Stephen Fidler on rapid - some say worrying - trade integration Economic integration in Latin America seems to be going forward at breakneck pace. Hardly a week passes without a trade deal being signed or a new initiative announced. In the last few weeks, Brazil has launched an initiative for a South American free trade area and Mexico has signed a free trade agreement with Costa Rica. The US administration also has announced that a summit of the leaders of elected governments in the Americas would be held in Miami in December. Free trade in the western hemisphere will be one of the main talking points, with the coming into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico at the start of the year. These government moves are being accompanied by a sharp rise in trade within the region. Other Latin American countries accounted for 16.7 per cent of the region's exports in 1992, up from 10.8 per cent in 1990, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America. Trade expanded by more than 50 per cent in 1991 and 1992 and grew further last year. US exports to Latin America have doubled in seven years, rising to more than Dollars 80bn in 1993. Most governments claim the proliferation of free trade areas, customs unions and bilateral trade deals point in one direction - to what they call open regionalism. This means intensifying their relationships with other countries in the region while remaining open to the outside world. But not everybody believes that the haphazard network of trade alliances is necessarily benign. Mr Moises Naim, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington and a former Venezuelan minister, says that far from being the building blocks of a hemispheric free trade zone, sub-regional free trade agreements 'are more likely to be stumbling blocks'. The Madrid-based Institute for European-Latin American Relations argued last year that the current round of market-driven regional trade accords - with ever greater links between those countries with the most dynamic economies - could reinforce rather than reduce wealth differentials among countries in the region. Even free trade with the US may not yield many trade benefits. A 1992 report from two World Bank economists suggested only Brazil and Mexico would benefit substantially from free trade with the US since most exports from most other countries already face low duties there. In July, Washington will name those countries that, in principle, would be eligible to negotiate free trade agreements with the US. The nomination does not commit the US to negotiations and says nothing about whether accession to Nafta or a bilateral trade accord with the US is the right way forward. The list will be next reviewed in 1997. In spite of the lack of trade benefits, most Latin governments will be anxious to see their names on the list. They are emphasising other reasons for joining Nafta: insurance in case the world further develops into regional trade blocs and the increased investment they believe is implied by being in the Nafta club. The process towards Nafta may not be that easy. Despite its promises to Chile that it will be next on the US free trade agenda, the administration of President Bill Clinton may not want to open another trade debate in a hurry. A lot of political capital was spent on securing the Nafta accord and other countries do not have the strategic significance to the US that Mexico has. Nonetheless, Nafta's attraction may well loosen the ties that are binding Latin American countries together. Argentina is generally thought to be next in line after Chile for Nafta treatment, but it is committed to negotiate with the US as part of Mercosur, a regional common market to come into force next year with Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. Yet Brazil's economic problems and the traditional mistrust of its governments for the US mean that Nafta is a low priority for Brazil. While Mercosur governments this month reiterated their intention of trying to negotiate jointly with third parties such as the US, Brazil also took the opportunity to launch its own South American free trade zone. The Brazilian government stressed that this was not meant to be a competitor to Nafta and that the two initiatives were complementary. But to some governments in the region, the initiative looks like a Brazilian attempt to recover some political weight lost in the region over the last decade and to counterbalance North American influence. Whatever the case, some economists believe the idea may have real economic merit if it gives neighbouring countries free access to the big and still relatively protected Brazilian market. 'In the short run,' says Mr Naim, 'Latin American exports could increase more through freer access to the Brazilian market than they could by signing a free trade agreement with the US.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FASTEST GROWING TRADE RELATIONSHIPS IN LATIN AMERICA Reciprocal exports (Annual growth rate %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Relations governed by broad liberalisation agreements Argentina-Brazil       15.3   -4.5   18.4   24.2   22.1   43.3   59.0 Colombia-Venezuela      5.6   35.6    6.2   15.6   31.9   27.1   47.1 Argentina-Uruguay      35.4   28.3    3.8   -2.4   20.8   37.5   33.7 Argentina-Paraguay     16.7   11.5   -0.8   28.0   39.6    9.9   50.8 Chile-Mexico          -48.5   33.0  226.9  -17.8   16.2   13.6   44.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Relations not governed by agreements Brazil-Mexico         -32.3   -9.7   19.7   47.3   17.6   40.5   63.6 Mexico-Venezuela      -23.5   54.1    1.8   46.9  127.6  -19.9   54.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Commodity Trade Data Base (Comtrade) of the United Nations Statistical Division (Unstat), and other official sources.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

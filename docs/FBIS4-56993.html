			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 10 May.    The Venezuelan Central Bank issued a communique the night of  2 May indicating that the Consumer Price Index registered a 3.3  percent increase in April. This increase, added to the figures  accumulated through March, reveals a 12.6 percent inflation rate  for the first quarter of 1994. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 3  May 94 p 11)    Today, Venezuelan Central Bank sources revealed that the  drop  in international reserves for April was estimated at $900  million. According to these sources, the drop in reserves during  the first quarter of 1994 was due to falling oil revenues,  mistrust unleashed by the Banco Latino scandal, and huge foreign  debt payments. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1604 GMT 5 May 94)    During the first quarter of 1994, Citgo Petroleum  Corporation, a subsidiary of Venezuelan Petroleum in the United  States, registered net profits of $43.300 million, which  represents a 133 percent increase over profits registered during  the same period in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May  94 p E-7)    Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce  and Services, pointed out that his organization is not  responsible for the recent outbreak of price increases resulting  from the devaluation of the bolivar. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in  Spanish 5 May 94 p E-8)    In light of the fiscal crisis, the government is considering  selling between 10 and 20 percent of the shares of the National  Telephone Company of Venezuela for the second half of 1994 as a  last resort. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 94 p E-8)    It has been unofficially reported that international  reserves  dropped $900 million in April. The sources added that the  largest drop was reported between 25 and 29 April when it was  announced that the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela  would be resigning and an interest rate drop was possible.  Central Bank of Venezuela authorities said the bank will not  release official figures for the month of April. (Caracas EL  NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 94 p E-1)    Financial sources have reported that between January and  April, the eight banks for whom the state has intervened have  had to pay $550 billion bolivars. The run on the banks forced  the institutions to turn to the government. According to recent  studies conducted by the Banks Superintendency, overall losses  amount to approximately 359 billion bolivars. (Caracas EL  NACIONAL in Spanish 7 May 94 p E- 1)    Between 1 January and 6 May, the bolivar has been devaluated  22.8 percent. A marketing research firm reported that this will  represent reduced purchasing power and greater unemployment.  (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 8 May 94 p 2-1)    The Foreign Trade Institute has reported that Colombia has  replaced the United States as the main market for Venezuelan  nonpetroleum products. In 1993, Venezuela exported $808.237  million in nonpetroleum products to Colombia. (Paris AFP in  Spanish 2114 GMT 9 May 94)</p>

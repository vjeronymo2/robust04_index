			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHABAD -- IT IRRITATES AND INSPIRES JEWS IN SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> RELIGION: DESPITE ITS HOMELESS SHELTER, DRUG PROGRAM AND OTHER GOOD WORKS,  CONTROVERSY SHADOWS THE HASIDIC SECT.  </P> <P> On the eve of its yearly telethon, Chabad of California finds itself busier  than ever and, as usual, strapped for cash, according to Rabbi Boruch Shlomo  Cunin, the sect's charismatic leader.  </P> <P> But this year is different, because the Hasidic sect is enmeshed in a bitter  squabble that focuses on a Jewish student housing co-op near UCLA and has riled  many in the Jewish community.  </P> <P> The dispute has again drawn attention to Chabad's role among Los Angeles Jewry,  where the black-coated rabbis of the mystical denomination have won support  among many who have no other contact with organized religion.  </P> <P> At the same time, Chabad's unabashed evangelical efforts have managed to  irritate others who have viewpoints of their own, including some in the  strictly observant Orthodox community.  </P> <P> The latest development came Thursday, when a two-page ad in the Hollywood  Reporter appealed to show business celebrities to boycott tonight's telethon on  KCOP, held from 5 p.m. to midnight, when Chabad expects to raise more than $5  million.  </P> <P> "Is it true that Chabad obtained title to three Jewish student living  cooperatives, with an equity value of $2 million, by fraud and deceit?" asked  the advertisement.  </P> <P> The ad was placed by a group called Friends of the Bayit (which means "house"  in Hebrew), which wants the buildings returned to the board that previously ran  them. It urged performers ranging from Bob Hope to Whoopi Goldberg to press  Chabad to go to court to settle the dispute, which has dragged on since last  December.  </P> <P> Chabad has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it took over the properties only  after other Jewish groups declined to underwrite the housing projects in  Westwood, Berkeley and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Supporters of the previous board have scheduled a demonstration for 1 p.m.  today outside Chabad headquarters in Westwood, but Cunin, Chabad's West Coast  director, said that he still expects a successful telethon.  </P> <P> Basically, the dispute is a messy, complicated legal wrangle over real estate.  That it has become a hot topic of conversation and debate among Los Angeles  Jews attests to Chabad's ability to both inspire and irritate.  </P> <P> The sect, which traces its beginning to the 18th Century, has spread like  Bermuda grass since Cunin arrived in Los Angeles 25 years ago.  </P> <P> Supporters praise Chabad's drug rehabilitation and homeless shelter, its  outreach to uncommitted Jews and its school network that provides Jewish  education in areas where there are few other alternatives.  </P> <P> And they rave about the leadership of the silver-bearded Cunin, a 49-year-old  father of 13.  </P> <P> Starting from the garage of his house in the Fairfax District, Cunin built a  network of 42 synagogue centers, 12 social service facilities and 14 schools  stretching from San Diego to San Rafael.  </P> <P> While no more than a few thousand Jews actually pray regularly at Chabad  synagogues, about 10,000 pupils attend its Hebrew schools and youth programs,  and thousands more have been touched through the telethon or personal  encounters with Chabad emissaries, who often stop people on the street and urge  them to say their daily prayers.  </P> <P> Sympathizers and detractors alike attribute the success of Chabad in California  to the charisma of Cunin.  </P> <P> "Once you know him you kind of fall in love with the guy," said Howard Furst,  owner of AAA Flag &amp; Banner Manufacturing Corp.  </P> <P> Furst met Cunin while trying to drum up business for his company. He now finds  himself donating $30,000 worth of flags and banners to publicize the telethon,  which last year featured appearances by a broad range of celebrities. Bob  Dylan, for example, performed "Hava Nagila."  </P> <P> The telethon, first aired in 1980 after a fire gutted the Chabad headquarters  in an old fraternity house, raised $1.2 million the first year, increasing to  $5.4 million in 1989.  </P> <P> Furst may be typical of the Jews who support Chabad without subscribing to its  elaborate belief system, which is summed up in the three words whose initials  make up the name Chabad -- wisdom, understanding, knowledge.  </P> <P> "I won't join their temple because that's not the way I believe," Furst said.  "It's too religious for me . . . (but) I got interested in the good things  they're doing."  </P> <P> But others in the Jewish community say that Chabad is a maverick movement whose  leaders would rather have little to do with the rest of the organized Jewish  community.  </P> <P> "The problem with Chabad is the perception not only that its way is the only  way (to Judaism) but that Chabad is the only institution," said Rabbi Laura  Geller, executive director of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American  Jewish Congress.  </P> <P> Geller's group has been tussling with Chabad for years over whether to place a  Hanukkah menorah in City Hall, something that the Jewish Congress opposes as a  mixing of church and state.  </P> <P> Even in the Orthodox camp, where Chabad is among the strictest exponents of  traditional Judaism, there are those who are disturbed by its zeal.  </P> <P> Chabad's emissaries want to convert the entire Jewish people to their point of  view, said one rabbi, who declined to be identified. Sme Orthodox Jews do not  like the idea that somebody has a corner on truth, he said.  </P> <P> Chabad also has stirred up considerable controversy with its activities in  Israel. Since 1970, it has been the driving force behind a campaign to change  Israeli immigration laws so that only converts whose conversion was supervised  by Orthodox rabbis would qualify for citizenship.  </P> <P> The initiative has been roundly denounced by Reform and Conservative Jews as an  attack on their legitimacy in the United States, where they make up the bulk of  the organized Jewish population.  </P> <P> Controversy is nothing new to Chabad, a sect whose origins lie in the Hasidic  revival movement that took Eastern European Jewry by storm at the end of the  18th Century.  </P> <P> Hasidism's founder, an itinerant preacher known as the Baal Shem Tov (Master of  the Good Name), taught the importance of mystical belief, urging Jews to  emphasize sincere, joyous prayer and good deeds.  </P> <P> His followers set up different schools, or courts. Chabad is also known as  Lubavitch, after the town in Byelorussia that was its headquarters for a  century.  </P> <P> Chabad's current leader, Menahem Mendel Schneersohn, called the Lubavitcher  Rebbe, was born in 1902 and came to the United States in 1940, where he oversaw  from his Brooklyn headquarters the expansion of Chabad to dozens of cities in  the United States and outposts overseas.  </P> <P> Not the least of his emissaries was Cunin, who vividly remembers the day when,  as a young rabbi in the 1960s, he received his mandate from Schneersohn: "Go --  California is yours."  </P> <P> Only a few years ago, however, Chabad of California was so deep in debt that we  were "well over the edge," Cunin said in a recent interview, and Schneersohn  criticized him in his internationally distributed weekly talks for "leaping too  high."  </P> <P> At one point, Cunin recalled, "We owed $18 million to an assortment of 40 banks  and 18 individuals -- and all of it (secured by) my beard."  </P> <P> As Cunin knocked on the doors of mansions in Beverly Hills, following up old  leads in the hopes of finding new contributions, he came upon a woman who later  said their brief meeting had changed her life.  </P> <P> Hermine J. Weinberg, who was then going through a divorce from her hotelier  husband, William, sent Cunin a check for $1,000, but that was small compared to  the provisions of her will -- a bequest of the bulk of her multimillion-dollar  estate to Chabad.  </P> <P> William Weinberg and their children, who were cut out of the will less than two  days before Hermine Weinberg took her own life in 1985, contested the bequest  but a settlement was reached in 1988 in which Chabad netted $21 million.  </P> <P> "The Weinberg miracle," Cunin calls it.  </P> <P> In its 25th anniversary magazine, Chabad claims to have brought Judaism to  rapidly growing cities like Lancaster, Palmdale, Upland and Fresno, "where  there had been but a dim flicker."  </P> <P> Some would take issue with that statement. "There has been a lot more than a  glimmer of Judaism at this synagogue for the last 40 years," responded Rabbi  Alan Henkin of Beth Knesset Bamidbar, a Reform synagogue in Lancaster.  </P> <P> Cunin says he has a mailing list of about 58,000 homes in Southern California,  where his yearly telethon has made him one of the region's most widely  recognized Jewish leaders.  </P> <P> Chabad's success is "an example of what L.A. can offer to people of an  entrepreneurial way of thinking," said Max Vorspan, a historian of Los Angeles  Jewry and vice president of the Conservative movement's University of Judaism  on Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> Said Rabbi Meyer May, executive director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center: "To  the credit of Chabad, they recognized that they have a major responsibility for  reaching out to unaffiliated Jews, and in this effort they are almost  unparalleled. . . . Nobody has made as large a commitment as they have in L.A."  </P></p>

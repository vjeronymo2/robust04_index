			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roman Gerasimov and Dmitry Kossakovsky; first </F> paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment]    [Text] An ecologically pure technology of producing  secondary metal has been developed at the Institute of  Electro-Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences.    After the disintegration of the USSR the commercially  developed lead deposits for Russia's customers found themselves  outside of the country's borders, whilst the price of lead from  the CIS countries is quite often higher than it is on the world  market. At the same time the demand for it can, to a  considerable extent, be met by using the storage batteries which  have exhausted their service life. In the industrially advanced  countries up to 95&percnt; of used batteries are processed, and  75&percnt;  of requirements in lead are being met with secondary metal  obtained in such a way. Its cost is approximately three times  less than primary. In Russia less than 50&percnt; of used  batteries  are being collected, which is creating a serious ecological  problem. The nearly 90,000 tons of lead scattered annually in  the environment contaminate it more than the releases from  burning ethyl petrol. The pyrometallurgical method of the  treatment of old batteries, used in our country, contaminates  the environment with sulphur dioxide and lead aerosols.    The Electro-Chemistry Institute of the Russian Academy of  Sciences has worked out an electrochemical technology which not  only has a number of ecological advantages (absence of harmful  effluents into the atmosphere, minimum amount of solid waste,  closed cycle of water-supply), but is also economically more  profitable than pyrometallurgical technology.    It is particularly convenient for the treatment of a small  number of storage batteries (about 3,000 a year), which makes it  possible to site production not far from the places where used  batteries are collected and so save on the storage facilities  and transportation expenses.</p>

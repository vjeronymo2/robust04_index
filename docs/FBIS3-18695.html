The Nordic prime  ministers, meeting in Stockholm, thought it important that the  Russian soldiers should withdraw from Estonia and Latvia by the  end of August as Russia has promised. Prime Minister Esko Aho  stressed that Finland will not offer to act a mediator in the  dispute, even though Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  will be visiting Finland at the end of the week. According to  Aho, it is important for Finland, however, to maintain contacts  with both sides.    The prime ministers of the Baltic countries were also in  Stockholm today. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar stressed  that the Russian troops pose no direct military threat to  Estonia, but the issues concern environmental problems and crime.</p>

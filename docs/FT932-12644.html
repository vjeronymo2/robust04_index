			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Green shoots hide problems under the surface - Bare patches are appearing in many UK fields, reflecting adverse planting conditions THERE ARE green shoots on farms all over the country. But like some of those alleged to relate to the British economy they can be tender plants and the apparent evidence on the surface does not always fully reflect the reality. For instance, crops of wheat, barley and oilseed rape planted last autumn are now growing vigorously. As they do so the volume and height of green material helps to hide the many problems that are a legacy of the wet weather in which they were planted. At least they do for the casual observer passing on the road. Look down on the same crops from an aeroplane, or as I have done recently, from the windows of trains travelling right across the country from east to west, often above the fields, and the scars are still there to be seen. There are great patches of land into which good seeds were planted but did not grow. The soil was so wet and cold last November that they rotted instead of germinating. There are other bare areas in a disturbing number of fields that are clearly the work of pests - almost certainly slugs. The slug problem has become much worse in recent years as more farmers have turned to chopping straw behind their combined harvesters instead of burning it - a practice now banned by law. Chopped straw is attractive fodder for slugs, enabling them to thrive and reproduce to ever increasing numbers. Collectively the patches amount to a sizeable area of the country and it is already clear that many cereal and oilseed rape fields affected by one or both of these problems will not fulfil their potential. Add to that the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture's December census recently revealed that 19 per cent fewer acres of autumn cereals were planted last year because of a combination of the wet weather and the European Community's new set-aside regulations and it can be seen that the UK harvest of autumn sown crops this year is likely to be significantly reduced. Indeed some trade sources have put the reduction at some 2m tonnes, equivalent to about 10 per cent of last year's total harvest. Within the constraints of set-aside, however, it is probable that some of this may be made up by spring sowings. These have increased, mainly on land originally intended for autumn planting, and in most cases they have gone into excellent seed-beds and, following timely rains, have grown away well. Spring-sown barley, peas, beans, sugar-beet and oilseed rape have all benefited from the kind spring, although unusually for spring problems with slugs are continuing in some areas. But all other things being equal and the weather over the next few weeks permitting, yields from these crops should be above average come August. Livestock farmers too are having a good spring. Grass is growing well, bringing the promise of plentiful seed through the summer as well as hay and silage for next winter, and sheep farmers all over the country are reporting the best lambing they have had for several years. There are economic green shoots as well. The price of finished lambs, for instance, is higher than it has been since the removal of the EC's variable guarantee scheme nearly eighteen months ago. This is mainly because of growing demand for English lamb in Italy and France and the fact that their normal alternative sources in eastern Europe cannot supply because of ethnic conflicts. However, the greatest impact on UK farming this year has come from the withdrawal of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism last September and the subsequent devaluation. According to EC rules this discrepancy with other community currencies had to be made up to British farmers through the so-called 'green' currency system. This has meant that prices of EC-supported commodities have at their peak been increased by around 20 per cent, which more than cancelled out the initial price reductions imposed by CAP reforms. Potentially it has also increased area and set-aside compensation payments for the same reasons. The crucial day, however, is July 1. For the value of sterling against other EC currencies on that day will decide the level of those payments for the coming year. Needless to say farmers are hoping the pound will not recover too fast. They have already seen guaranteed prices of grain rise to Pounds 20 tonne more than they expected last harvest only to see those levels eroded by Pounds 5 a tonne in recent weeks as sterling has recovered. Further revaluations leading to further price reductions are on the cards over coming weeks. Even so commodities have been sold this year, both spot and forward, at prices higher than farmers dared hope. Devaluation-induced windfall profits have been and will be made. And when farmers have money they will spend it, as tractor manufacturers have once again been reminded. It has been reported by the Agricultural Engineers' Association that in the first quarter of 1993 tractor registrations were 13 per cent higher than for the same period last year. This followed several years of declining sales and urgent replacement of ageing machines was therefore needed on many farms. But the fact that many of the deals are being done on hire purchase also reflects that farmers are alive to the fact that they can lock in interest rates now lower than for a long time and that capital allowances have been raised in the Budget from 25 per cent to 40 per cent. It is however significant to learn that sales of tackle have dried to a trickle in the last couple of weeks. Dealers believe this is almost entirely because of the dreaded 'Domesday forms' that farmers are having to complete to qualify for compensation for the equally unpopular set-aside. They have spent so long stuck behind their desks or queueing for Ordnance Survey maps that they have been unable to spare the time to buy, dealers say. So, while the combination of spring and sterling's devaluation have led at least to a partial recovery of confidence in British agriculture it is at best patchy and there are real fears that worse may be to come. Last week Copa, the Confederation of European Farmers' Unions, alleged that the Gatt settlement on farm commodities negotiated between the EC and the US in anticipation of a full agreement later would if implemented lead to a massive extension of set-aside. Mr Rene Steichen, the EC agriculture commissioner, denied that this would be the case and said that any modifications to farm production could be accommodated within last year's CAP reform package. But farmers, always suspicious of politicians' promises, remain unconvinced.</p>

Mr. Phonsin said the law, which is not  concerned with Thai industrial products, will take a long time  to come into effect.    Thai products exported to Japan are primarily semi-processed  goods or raw materials which are subsequently used to produce  other exports for the U.S. He said imposition of the law  contradicts the GATT agreement which will come into effect in  1995.    He believes there is ample time for the U.S. to resolve the  conflict. The move is considered to be a political gesture  after negotiations hit a snag. In the short run, Thailand does  not have to adjust its export and international trade  strategies, he said. But the Government and the private sector  should follow development of the issue closely.    He agreed with the move by the Committee on Raising  Thailand's Competitiveness, which is chaired by Deputy Prime  Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak, to determine the country's  long-term trade strategies.</p>

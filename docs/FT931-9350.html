			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / De Klerk stresses need to include Inkatha in talks SOUTH Africa's president, Mr F W de Klerk, warned yesterday that the South African republic risked breaking up unless Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, could be brought into negotiations on a post-apartheid constitution. 'Otherwise we might be looking for trouble in South Africa. We don't want to go the Yugoslavian way,' he said in a BBC interview. The threat of secession from the republic by Chief Buthelezi, political and tribal leader of the Zulus, became acute after news that the chief's rivals, the African National Congress, had done a bilateral deal with government to install a power-sharing cabinet to rule South Africa until the end of the century. Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party would probably gain enough votes to participate in this cabinet along with the ANC and ruling National Party. But Chief Buthelezi reacted to news of the deal by warning of possible bloodshed if such a solution were imposed on his people. The Inkatha leader said in a statement the government and the ANC would have to resort to force to compel the KwaZulu homeland, which he heads, to accept the plans announced on Friday. He, too, raised the spectre of Yugoslavia, saying 'minds should be concentrated on recent world events in which similar arrogant impositions have resulted in untold misery and bloodshed'. Late last year, Chief Buthelezi published a draft constitution for the Natal region which amounted to a unilateral declaration of independence from the republic. This constitution and other issues are to be discussed when Inkatha and government negotiators meet for three days later this week to prepare for a planned multi-party conference due by the end of this month.</p>

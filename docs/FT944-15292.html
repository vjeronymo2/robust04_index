			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: City advisers add vital dimension Sir, I read with interest that certain leading company acquisition teams believe they 'can do everything a merchant bank can do' ('No Adviser the magician's rival', October 11). Hanson has small teams in London, New York and now Hong Kong and we also believe in doing as much work as possible ourselves. However, our company's founders were probably as knowledgeable on this subject as any in-house team, but never felt they could do without their 'City advisers'. You acknowledge that banks must be used for flotations and takeovers, but there is another vital dimension - the generation of ideas. The City has an array of talent and specialisation which no in-house team could hope to match. Help from banks is particularly relevant for expansion in unfamiliar geographical areas. As they are not charities, banks are not going to come up with ideas unless they are going to produce business. C D Collins, director, corporate development, Hanson, 1 Grosvenor Place, London SW1</p>

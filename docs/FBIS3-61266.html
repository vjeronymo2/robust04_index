			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A.V. Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of </F> the Russian Federation, by ROSSIYA correspondent Andrey Sharyy,  place and date not given, under the rubric "Throughout the Wide  World": "The Country Tripped Itself Up: The Minister of Foreign  Affairs of Russia on Domestic and Foreign Policy"]    [Text] The outcome of the elections created an acute  desire among politicians to speak up. Andrey Kozyrev, who by his  own admission fully grasped the need for "contacts with the  public" during the election campaign, did not stay on the  sidelines either. Toward the end of last week the minister of  foreign affairs invited to his suite representatives of the few  Moscow newspapers--as a diplomat described it, "publications of  a quiet democratic persuasion." Andrey Sharyy represented the  weekly ROSSIYA at this session of contacts with the public.    [Sharyy] Andrey Vladimirovich, will the results of the  elections influence Russia's foreign policy?    [Kozyrev] Russia's foreign policy is determined by the  president. Fortunately, the president is not being replaced.  This means that there are no grounds to speak about changes in  the country's foreign policy course. The source and mandate of  Russia's foreign policy remain unchanged. We should not forget  that the adoption of the new Constitution is the main outcome of  the elections. This document carries the imprint of the national  leader, just as policy unavoidably bears the imprint of what is  happening in society. Despite the elections introducing a  certain element of destabilization into our society, I see  nothing terrible about their result.    Indisputably, foreign policy accents may be changed when the  new parliament begins to work, when its nature and character are  determined. We will need to take into account the position of  the Duma, obviously, heed the criticism in some way, and adjust  our course. However, few candidates took an interest in foreign  policy issues during the election campaign, and this is why it  was difficult to find out who is dissatisfied with what. Perhaps  only Zhirinovskiy distinguished himself, but his criticism  amounted to fascist-type demagoguery. It is hard to call what he  proposed a foreign policy program. Besides, the positions of the  LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] keep changing. In one  of his presentations after the election, Zhirinovskiy retracted  virtually all territorial claims against foreign countries. At  the same time, note an altogether unprecedented case: The man is  making territorial claims against his own country by demanding  that Kaliningrad be converted into a Russian-German condominium.  This is the extreme limit of irresponsibility, these are crazy  pronouncements.    I believe that we should not panic and exaggerate the danger  to the process of democratic reforms. Of course, the results of  the election are not too gratifying; nor can we ignore the  circumstance that the threat of fascism coming to power has  arisen in the country. However, I had, after all, been talking  and warning about it for a long time. We should try to separate  the buffoonish form of Zhirinovskiy's speeches from this real  threat.    The task of forming a broad antifascist front, including the  participation of Communists, is becoming obvious. I am trying to  evoke in the Communists the essence of communism; after all,  during World War II the communist Soviet Union fought Nazi  Germany together with the United States, which did not eliminate  ideological differences. I hope that the Communists will not act  together with fascists at present, either.    Please do not try to find in these words some kind of a  failure to dovetail with my previous positions. It is just not  there. I remain anticommunist, and since the elections our  differences with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation,  say, on economic issues have not diminished. They say that they  intend to build communism; let them intend--we do not intend;  but as far as fascism is concerned....    Previously, we said that our opposition is of the  "Red-Brownshirt" coloring. The time has come to separate the Red  from the Brown. By no means should we allow the formation of a  communist-fascist bloc. An antifascist bloc is needed.    [Sharyy] To your mind, to what degree did the democratic  image of the country at large and your ministry in particular  become "tarnished" throughout the world after the results of the  election were known?    [Kozyrev] I believe that the initial headline shock of both  our press and foreign newspapers has already worn off. The  threat of the peril of democracy is real, but it should not be  made larger than it actually is. First, for now we cannot say  that Zhirinovskiy will control the parliament. His influence is  prominent, but it does not mean a change in the overall course.  Second, it is not yet known what kind of people these are. I for  one do not know anyone in the LDPR, except for Zhirinovskiy  himself. It is quite possible that some of the LDPR faction will  not march to the drum of its leader. Besides, it is not known  how Zhirinovskiy himself will behave.    Excessive patriotic rhetoric merely hardens the adversaries  of Russia abroad. We are tripping ourselves up in a way. The old  Supreme Soviet regularly engaged in this, continuously provoking  our partners to take a harder line. We should be aware of one  more circumstance which is manifested in some circles  speculating with pleasure on the results of the elections,  beginning with the Ukrainian supporters of nuclear weapons and  to those in Central Europe who, with maniacal stubbornness, wish  to join NATO. Questions are already being heard: Are we not  coming out against the admission of Poland and the Czech  Republic to NATO because we are beginning to yield to our  Red-Brownshirts? There are circles in the West, too, which are  interested in maintaining at least a residual arms race for  their corporate considerations because they make money from it.  At present, they are prepared to latch on to any pretext in  order to say: "You see, you cannot trust the Russians!"  Meanwhile, our patriots take pleasure in giving them  ammunition....    [Sharyy] What lessons have you personally learned from the  outcome of the elections and the outcome of your election  campaign in Murmansk?    [Kozyrev] So far, I am not all that scared. The experience  of  my campaign indicates that if you talk normally to the people,  answer questions, hear them out, and so on, they will vote for  you and be receptive to your arguments. Moreover, they, these  people, are very reasonable; on the other hand, I understand  them. I understand their irritation over these endless  scholastic TV debates. In essence, the people did not vote for  Zhirinovskiy; they voted against those whose peacockery  irritated them, against the complacency of the authorities. They  were sick of seeing on screen the mugs of my colleagues and  friends, including obviously my own, who know everything but  cannot explain it articulately.    The nighttime "Welcoming the New Political Year" on TV is  precisely a case in point. They gathered in order to be seen on  screen yet another time. I for one did not attend this  welcoming, although I had been invited persistently. I was so  tired that, to tell you the truth, I went to bed at 2200 on the  night of the vote. During the night I was awakened by my wife,  who was in tears when she saw what was happening there.  Incidentally, the unprofessionalism of our politicians was a  factor in the conduct of the election campaign. Where were  professional politicians to come from? All of these American  recipes for conducting advertising campaigns do not work out  here. Against the background of how the people live in Murmansk,  the dog from the advertising clip of Russia's Choice is  terrifying. After all, society in the United States has a full  stomach, whereas a different approach to our people is needed.  Do you remember the proverb "Some complain of not enough cabbage  in their soup, while others complain that their pearls are too  small?" So, for now we have cabbage soup, and this is the reason  American electoral logic does not apply to Russia.    [Sharyy] However, you belonged to the leadership of the  Russia's Choice bloc and obviously could influence the tactics  of the election campaign....    [Kozyrev] In the executive committee we entrusted this to  people who were professionally responsible for this--Bragin and  Poltoranin. As one of the members of the Russia's Choice  leadership, I do not disclaim responsibility, although, frankly,  in the weeks right before the election I was too busy with my  campaign in Murmansk and international affairs to follow the  situation in Moscow. I did not even have an opportunity to watch  TV. However, I was altogether terrified when I returned home.    This should provide a great deal of food for a great deal of  thought, for a major adjustment of policy. What was  Zhirinovskiy's forte? He went to the elections with lies of  cosmic proportions, whereas Russia's Choice went to the  elections with something inarticulate. Zhirinovskiy bought  several hours of TV time and sort of talked to people in a human  way. He talked obvious nonsense. However, it turned out that  this was nonsense, say, for me, but not for many people: They  are no longer used to things being just explained to them and  argued in regular spoken language, without showing off, without  posturing, or to problems of interest to them being discussed  with them....that they were not shrugged off. Here is the  result. I did the same in Murmansk, that is, answered questions  in a popular, human language, and looked at the audience. If I  saw that my words were not getting through, it meant that I had  to explain in more detail and argue. I understood that one  should talk to the people and explain all the nuances to them,  because hundreds of myths exist which have been quite skillfully  created by SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA. So, in addition to  adjusting the course, we should think about ways to explain our  policy to people.    [Sharyy] What are the differences between parties with a  democratic orientation on foreign policy issues?    [Kozyrev] I do not have an answer to this question at the  moment. The emergence of differences is not dictated by the  policy course; the process originates in reverse--personal  ambitions bring about political polarization. Many of my  colleagues from the democratic camp were thinking about not only  the elections to the Federal Assembly but also a presidential  elections. Each candidate needs his own party for the  presidential elections. When Russia's Choice was being formed I  came out in favor of it emerging precisely as a bloc rather than  a party. At that time, this point of view won out just because  it was right and not because I advocated it. Having understood  that no one will give up their ideas about filling the position  of president--neither Serezha, nor Grigoriy--I proposed to not  split the parliament and proceed toward the elections with a  joint platform. Of course, some variants were possible; well,  women could break off if they wanted to create something on  their grounds. However, the democratic movement would have  preserved its unity. However, a reverse process got  underway--based on ambitions. It turned out that for some  democratic leaders the main problem was that they did not end up  as the first ones on the lists. The split for personal reasons  prompted a search for political substantiation. Since there were  not enough real differences, artificial ideological spectrums  emerged: The programs of some parties shifted to the left or to  the right, perhaps, considerably further than their leaders  would have liked. They have now grasped for themselves that  their genuine electorate is elsewhere.    [Sharyy] The experience of the coexistence of the Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs and the old parliament turned out to be  unsuccessful. Obviously, problems will arise for you in the  Federal Assembly, too. Proceeding from your experience in  interaction with the Supreme Soviet, what are you preparing for  at present?    [Kozyrev] I had a very constructive attitude toward that  parliament. To my mind, my situation with regard to that  parliament was quite normal. I must say that at the beginning  cooperation was not being established all that badly. It is  another matter that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in  the condition in which it was a couple of years ago could do  little. I hope that a constructive relationship will develop  between the new parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  At any rate, we are doing everything possible and are preparing  for this as much as possible.    What do we need the parliament for? First, to have a  legislative base.    Second, for opposition. Why? Because the parliament should  express the public sentiment. You might recall that I asked the  Supreme Soviet time after time to give me an opportunity to  speak from the rostrum. I continued to invite myself to events  of this kind even when the Supreme Soviet became altogether  frantic and they appeared to be unable to stand the sight of me,  because there is no other way to communicate: Normally, a  minister reports, and deputies ask questions. It was just  impossible to work with a majority of the old deputies because  they altogether failed to get to specific problems. I will tell  you that a completely monstrous catastrophe will happen if the  Duma is going to be like the Supreme Soviet.... On one occasion  we held a quite businesslike closed-door meeting of the Supreme  Soviet Committee for International Affairs. The newspapers  wrote: How come--there is a confrontation between the ministry  and the Supreme Soviet, but the conversation proceeded in a  friendly tone? So, this was a very instructive meeting: At  first, all the Isakovs and Baburins flocked there, but they sat  in the hall only as long as the TV cameras were rolling. A few  people came who were interested in something, who wanted to  figure it out, and began to ask questions. Fifteen minutes later  the entire irreconcilable bunch left. Why would they stay? They  cannot carry on a conversation at this level.    Control is the third point in relations between the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and the Duma. Regular control of the  parliament over the ministry is needed, just as there is control  in any normal country over the operation of any normal  department.    [Sharyy] Apart from the need to explain the outcome of the  elections to the entire world, what particularly concerns you in  our foreign policy at present?    [Kozyrev] I am concerned about a few substantive issues, for  example, the issue of expanding NATO membership. We have ensured  that for now no decision on quantitative expansion will follow.  Some Central European figures cannot even explain what joining  NATO would accomplish for their countries, and cannot actually  imagine how this will end. Expanding NATO will, pardon me,  amount to a revolution in the entire military organizational  development and command. And nobody is ready for this at  present. Some politicians are saying persistently that  ultimately it is possible to admit new members to NATO. But we  are saying this, too! However, this is "ultimately," that is,  following a stage of cooperation! At issue is not the admission  of some countries to NATO as the beginning of the path but  rather an opportunity to join as the result of a path which is  yet to be traveled. Meanwhile, there is a long path to be  traveled. It is time to proceed from the discourse about who  should be admitted and when on to more essential issues, and  this is what gives me a headache. What will be the specific  content of this stage of cooperation?    The situation of the Russian-speaking populace in the nearby  foreign countries is the second serious problem. This problem  exists in various countries in different forms. For example,  there is a tremendous difference between the Baltic states and  Kazakhstan, but there are problems in both. Some of our foreign  partners have opted for a clearly speculative approach instead  of working along democratic lines. I would like to warn that,  while our strategic foreign policy course remains unchanged,  very firm things will occur on the part of Russia in this  instance. Incidentally, we will have to seriously interact with  the new parliament on these issues. Our relations with nearby  foreign countries largely depend on how qualified the deputies  of the Federal Assembly will be. Of course, we will not get  anywhere if the Duma consists exclusively of people who are only  capable of stating: "We do not have a policy in the nearby  foreign countries, and that is that."    [Sharyy] You have preferred to discuss domestic rather than  foreign policy today. Are you preparing for a switch in your  career?    [Kozyrev] No. The whole point is that in our country  domestic  policy is too closely tied to foreign policy. This connection  has become particularly obvious now.    The time has come to draw conclusions. We should not yell at  one another: "Hey, you are to blame for Zhirinovskiy's success!"  Now is not the time for public acrimony. This severe blow may  have been necessary for the democrats to come to their senses  and to get bruised. The main point is not to smash all Russia in  the process. The only fortunate thing is that the president was  not up for election this time. We have at least two or three  years in order to test once again what we are worth.</p>

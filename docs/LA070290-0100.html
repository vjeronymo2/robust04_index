			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TAKING LONG LOOK AT SEMI-GAS DEAL;  </P> <P> SEMICONDUCTORS: THE SMALL SILICON VALLEY FIRM MAKES SYSTEMS CRUCIAL FOR  ADVANCED COMPUTER CHIPS, AND NOBODY DOES IT BETTER. NOW THE JAPANESE WANT TO  BUY THE PLACE.  </P> <P> Andrew K. Lorenz is retiring this week, a concession not so much to the years  -- he's only 53 -- as to the energies used up in starting, building and selling  three companies in Silicon Valley.  </P> <P> For the past two years, Lorenz has been running Semi-Gas Systems in San Jose  for its current owner and anticipating his halcyon days. "I planned to take  what's left, take my wife and go sailing," Lorenz said last week, as his ties  to the company that he founded were coming to an end.  </P> <P> Yet Lorenz is torn about leaving, caught up in the controversy surrounding the  proposed sale of Semi-Gas to a Japanese competitor.  </P> <P> The $23-million deal between Hercules Corp. of Wilmington, Del., and would-be  owner Nippon-Sanso of Tokyo has been put on hold by U.S. government reviews.  Meanwhile, vocal opponents are looking for ways to scuttle the sale.  </P> <P> The deal is just a speck in the overall picture of foreign acquisition of U.S.  companies but is significant because of Semi-Gas' role in the U.S.  semiconductor industry.  </P> <P> Semi-Gas is a leading maker of gas-handling and purification systems -- large,  expensive chambers and complex controls used in making computer chips. Those  who want to block its sale warn that too much of the U.S. semiconductor  industry's infrastructure is passing into foreign hands, jeopardizing American  efforts to regain leadership and sacrificing the long-term economic and  security benefits that a healthy chip industry brings.  </P> <P> "We are very concerned; our strategic materials base is being bought out lock,  stock and barrel," said Peggy Haggerty, an industry lobbyist.  </P> <P> Such concerns have prompted the federal interagency Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States to review the sale. Although it can recommend  Cabinet-level discussion or presidential action, the committee on its own has  no power to stop the deal. The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department  does, however, and it is continuing a protracted review of the proposed sale.  Meanwhile, opponents are lobbying, testifying before Congress and even applying  behind-the-scenes pressure on Nippon-Sanso, hoping to generate the kind of heat  that helped drive off Fujitsu three years ago when it wanted to buy U.S.  semiconductor pioneer Fairchild.  </P> <P> "The question is, when there's a critical item or a critical industry that has  national security implications, is it wise to have (it) controlled by a foreign  producer?" said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute,  a Washington think tank. And, said Prestowitz, "the debate is over America's  wealth-producing capacity in the future and over America's independence of  action."  </P> <P> Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade negotiator, has been quietly advising Semi-Gas  employees who are working against the sale.  </P> <P> Lorenz founded the company in 1980. In 1983, when he needed more venture  capital, he sold 20% to Hercules. He also gave Hercules an option to purchase  the remainder of Semi-Gas within five years -- an option Lorenz admits he never  thought the larger company, which makes graphite and carbon fibers and food and  fragrance additives, would exercise.  </P> <P> At the same time, many others in the wide array of companies that supply  chip-making materials and equipment had found their "patient" money, even new  parent firms, across the Pacific. And because their fortunes were tied to those  of the chip makers, the suppliers increasingly went to Asia for customers. U.S.  dominance of the global market had faded.  </P> <P> In mid-1988, when Hercules bought Semi-Gas, it was profitable and the leader in  its market. That made it the perfect choice, a few months later, to supply the  gas-purification and management systems for Sematech, the industry- and  government-supported consortium designed to revitalize U.S. chip-making  technology.  </P> <P> But a year later, Hercules decided to scrap its venture into electronics.  Semi-Gas was one of three subsidiaries put up for sale. Its dominant position  -- 25% of the world market and about half of the U.S. market for its large,  expensive products -- attracted several bids. One came from three Semi-Gas  executives, including Lorenz, backed by British Oxygen.  </P> <P> But as in so many other arenas these days, the highest bid came from Japan.  Nippon-Sanso is a natural gas company that counts among its customers some of  the biggest names in electronics and chip making, including Fujitsu. Although  Hercules declines to confirm the figures, insiders say Nippon-Sanso's bid was  $23 million, 20% higher than the management-British Oxygen bid, which was also  heavily leveraged.  </P> <P> What makes Semi-Gas valuable to the Sematech venture also makes it attractive  to the Japanese. As chip makers try to pack more and more onto their already  incredibly miniature and complex silicon chips, purity and precision are  crucial. Even microscopic impurities act as boulders to block the chip's  delicate circuitry, and gas used in the process must be exceptionally pure.  </P> <P> "Nobody can do anything that compares with Semi-Gas in gas delivery systems,"  said Joe Stroop, spokesman for Sematech. Stroop said Semi-Gas' participation  has been critical to the third and final phase of Sematech's five-year mission:  to design a manufacturing system for memory chips whose circuits are 0.35  microns wide -- a size 5/1,000 the width of a human hair.  </P> <P> Losing the participation of Semi-Gas, Stroop said, would deal a six-month blow  to the Sematech efforts -- a serious threat because the consortium's charter,  and funding, expires in 1993. And if Nippon-Sanso bought Semi-Gas, the company  would have to drop out of the consortium: Sematech's charter bars foreign-owned  companies from being members or suppliers.  </P> <P> Sematech has warned Hercules and Nippon-Sanso that technological information  used by Semi-Gas to develop the systems for Sematech is proprietary and cannot  be transferred to a new owner without "our written permission. And we're not  likely to give our permission if the new owner is foreign," Stroop said.  </P> <P> More than half of Semi-Gas' customers are Sematech members and, said a Semi-Gas  official, some have warned they would turn to another American company if the  sale is approved.  </P> <P> But U.S. chip makers might have little alternative to doing business with  Semi-Gas after it is folded into Nippon-Sanso's American company, Matheson Gas  Products of Secaucus, N.J. Matheson's main business is gas, but it also  competes with Semi-Gas in gas-handling systems. Together, they would control  about 65% of the U.S. market -- a fact that spurred the antitrust review. The  review may continue for months as the companies respond to Justice Department  requests for vast quantities of market-share data.  </P> <P> Perhaps more important to Nippon-Sanso is the added edge Semi-Gas would give it  in the worldwide market; the fastest-growing sectors are outside the United  States. Matheson officials declined to discuss the deal.  </P> <P> "If Nippon-Sanso gets Semi-Gas," said one executive of the San Jose company,  "it is doubtful any American company would ever dominate gas handling again."  </P> <P> It is just such a situation that worries many in the U.S. chip industry.  </P> <P> Haggerty, who lobbies for Semi/Sematech, an organization of Sematech suppliers,  said her group would like to see a "moratorium on foreign acquisitions of these  companies that are important to strategic defense."  </P> <P> William Reed, president of the trade group Semiconductor Equipment and  Materials Institute -- which has an international membership and does not  oppose the sale -- said the relationship between chip makers and their  suppliers must grow more intimate as the semiconductor devices become more  sophisticated and the demands for precision are greater.  </P> <P> "That's why the Japanese have so much success: They learn when the two groups  work together they develop better products at a faster pace," said Reed. "And  it is one of the strong reasons for the success at Sematech. It dawned on them  (U.S. chip makers and suppliers) that they need to get together."  </P> <P> The fear is that with the leading companies in foreign hands, U.S. chip makers  will be shut out of technology advancements.  </P> <P> Too, the majority of the materials and equipment companies are small, with  annual revenues of less than $10 million. That makes them all vulnerable to  foreign money, said one critic of the sale.  </P> <P> If the sale to Nippon-Sanso falls through, Semi-Gas executives might again turn  to foreign money. They said they may try to put together a new deal, with  British Oxygen backing.  </P> <P> While Reed agrees with the government's free-market policies and open door to  investment, he also said it is vital for the United States to have an  independent semiconductor industry.  </P> <P> "The U.S. government should create an environment that would enable our  semiconductor customers to survive in this race," he said, citing oft-repeated  industry calls for more favorable tax treatment. "If our customers were  healthy, the equipment and materials (companies) wouldn't be in the shape they  are today."  </P></p>

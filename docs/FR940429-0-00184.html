			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters contended that it would be too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome for institutions to document the placement rates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students because students and employers would have little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive to provide written verification of employment. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters believed the substantiation requirement would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage employers from hiring students from institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited documentation. Some commenters recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution should be required to record information, such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name, address, and telephone number of the employer, the job  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title, and the starting date of employment, instead of obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the documentation proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency, or the Department's reviewers, or an auditor could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then use this information to verify the placement. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested that a written statement from the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that his or her employment was a result of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training would be sufficient verification; or that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should merely be required to document its attempt to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written verification from employers or graduates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters also were concerned about the cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's proposed requirement that an institution's auditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should review the documentation of placement rates for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student in the placement-rate calculation. Some of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested that the auditor be permitted to verify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement rates by selecting a random sample. Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the Department should administer and pay for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own placement substantiation procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated in the preamble to the February 28, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM, the Secretary believes that requiring institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document this data and requiring an auditor to review this data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will help curb abuse by institutions that may overstate their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement rates to achieve and maintain eligibility for short-term programs. In order to address this concern, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that documentation of employment must be made by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliable source and that written statements by the student or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution are not sufficient. The failure of an employer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student to respond to requests for documentation is accounted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by using a placement rate that excludes up to 30 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's graduates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary disagrees with comments that the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of auditing each placement rate is unnecessary or prohibitively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expensive. The audit will be conducted as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's annual compliance review and specific guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in the Department of Education's audit guide should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafted in a manner sufficient to detect abuse and avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that based on auditing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> literature, certified public accountants cannot certify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy of an institution's placement-rate calculations, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must instead follow the procedures of an attestation engagement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section has been amended to require that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution shall substantiate the calculation of its completion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and placement rates by having the certified public accountant who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares its audit report required under &sect;668.23 report on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's calculations based on performing an attestation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engagement in accordance with the Standards for Attestation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engagements of the American Institute of Independent Certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Accountants (AICPA). Section 668.24 has also been amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reflect the same type of change discussed here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters argued that students who are hired by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution either before or after they receive a degree or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate from that institution, should not be excluded from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the placement rate calculation. The commenters suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions would be penalized for hiring the most qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate and that any abuse in this area could be easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected. Other commenters suggested that graduates who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed by separate businesses that are operated by, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially linked to, an institution's owner(s) should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded from the placement-rate calculation. Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that graduates who were student employees should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtracted from the number of students who have degrees or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificates if they find a position with another employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Upon further consideration, the Secretary agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that including students who are hired by an institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a negligible effect on the institution's placement rate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly if the hiring is based on a legitimate employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion to exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduates from an institution's placement-rate formula if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are hired by separate businesses that have some financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection to the institution. In many of these cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for abuse is not as great because the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interests of the parties that control the separate businesses do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not necessarily coincide with the financial interests of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees that student employees who are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer employed by the institution upon graduation and who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hired by another employer after graduation, should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded from the placement rate calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirement that an institution exclude from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of a placement rate students who are hired by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has been deleted from these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters believed that the placement rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation may be misinterpreted by some institutions because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed placement rate calculation requires the school to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include students in the numerator who, ``on the date of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> are employed, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or have been employed for at least 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks following receipt of the credential by the institution.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters suggested that the phrase ``are employed'' will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be interpreted to mean that any student employed at the time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation is made, regardless of whether they have met the 13-week standard, can be included in the numerator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Every student must be employed for at least 13 weeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related comparable occupation before that student can be counted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as placed. The Secretary agrees to clarify this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A change has been made to clarify that every student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be employed for at least 13 weeks in a recognized occupation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which they were trained or in a related comparable occupation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before that student can be counted as placed by inserting a comma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the words ``have been employed.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> English as a Second Language. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters argued that the purpose of the testing requirement for students who completed a program in English as a Second Language (ESL) was unclear, and that testing the proficiency of these students was an intrusion on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's internal academic affairs and a violation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education Organization Act. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended testing students before they enrolled in an ESL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to determine whether they needed to improve their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proficiency skills, as well as testing students who completed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. A commenter suggested that the ESL testing provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should also apply to vocational programs that include ESL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education within the curriculum. Another commenter expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support for the provision as written in the February 28, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

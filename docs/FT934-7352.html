			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (15): Slightly less than shipshape - Vanessa Houlder finds Bristol changing tack after the recession / The South-west THE RECESSION has left deep scars on Bristol and the south-west. The buoyant economic conditions enjoyed by the region in the 1980s evaporated in the 1990s as its core industries, including defence and financial services, suffered severe setbacks. After years of worrying about the problems of success, such as labour shortages and congestion, Bristol has changed tack. Increasingly, it is concerned about re-establishing a vibrant economic base. 'We cannot be complacent,' says Mr Andrew May, chairman of the planning and development committee of Bristol City Council. 'We have to develop new sectors.' Agents report an upturn in interest in the past six months, from occupiers in sectors such as computers and financial services. However, nobody denies that letting market is difficult. 'The market is still tough. Companies are very cost conscious. It takes them a long time to make a move,' says Mr Michael Finucane, of King Sturge, chartered surveyors. Weak demand has taken a toll on office rents. Asking rents are down by about a tenth from their peak; the decline is greater if tenants' incentives, such as rent-free periods are taken into account. Renting second-hand space in the centre costs Pounds 8-10 a sq ft a year, while new space commands about Pounds 20 a sq ft. The amount of empty office space in Bristol stands at about 1.7m sq ft, equivalent to about 12 per cent of the total stock. That is below the national average for city centre offices, which is estimated to be about 15 per cent. The oversupply is particularly noticeable in small buildings of less than 2000 sq ft, which account for over 1m sq ft of the empty space. 'In recent years, small self-contained buildings, typical of the Clifton and Queen Square areas, have declined in popularity relative to open-plan accommodation, which is perceived by occupiers as being more efficient,' according to Chesterton, chartered surveyors. The stock of vacant new buildings in Bristol, which account for about 500,000 sq ft of space, is relatively small compared with previous downturns in the property cycle, such as the early 1980s. This is, in large part, attributable to the council's past restraint when granting planning permission. Recently, it has begun to take a less rigid stance, as part of its efforts to bolster the city's occupier base. Hitherto, however, the council's tough line with developers, coupled with its concern about issues such as conservation, car restraint and environmental issues, has provoked concern that the city was indifferent to the needs of the property market and commercial occupiers. A recent survey by APR for the Estates Gazette uncoveredwidespread criticism by Bristol companies which considered that the motorist and commercial occupier were badly catered for. Many said they would consider relocating to an out-of-town centre, motivated by desire to escape the traffic and parking problems and be nearer a motorway. The popularity of the out-of-town market, which includes schemes such as Arlington's Aztec West business park, is evident from its success in securing lettings against competition from the city centre. The out-of-town market accounted for 200,000 sq ft of the 380,000 sq ft of space that was taken up in Bristol last year. The 200,000 sq ft of space that was taken up in the first six months of 1993 was split evenly between the town centre and the out-of-town centres. Concern about the competition from out-of-town centres is not limited to the office market. The city's retailers are soon to face competition from Cribbs Causeway, a 650,000 sq ft regional shopping centre close to junction 17 of the M5. The scheme, which is being developed by J T Baylis and the Prudential, is due to start construction next year. In general, however, development in Bristol is at low ebb. Although 1.85m sq ft of offices have planning permission, most schemes are likely to remain on the drawing board for some time. An exception is the second phase of the 95,000 sq ft Trinity Quay scheme being developed by the Church Commissioners, which was pre-sold to the National Westminster Bank for Pounds 40m last year. Few schemes are likely to start without securing a tenant in advance. According to Chesterton, the schemes that are most likely to begin construction include Temple Meads, where the Bristol Development Corporation has planning permission for up to 250,000 sq ft; Bond Street, where National Provident has planning permission for up to 110,000 sq ft of new offices; Thomas Paty House, where there is planning permission for 65,000 sq ft of offices; and Newfoundland Street, where Wyndham Investments is planning 80,000 sq ft of offices. The Bristol Development Corporation, the regeneration body, has announced several other proposed developments, including a Pounds 20m office scheme by Dysart Development and a Pounds 50m retail and leisure complex by Wilson Connolly at Avon Meads, next to the new spine road it is building to link the M32 in the north to the A4 Bath Road in the south. Hanson, the conglomerate, has also proposed a large retail and leisure scheme on a former Wills tobacco factory in South Bristol. In the warehouse sector, there is more evidence to support an early resumption of development activity. A distribution warehouse scheme at St Philips Central, which is being promoted by Bristol &amp; England Properties, has already secured lettings for about three-quarters of its space. The investment market is also making slow progress in Bristol and the south-west. Although the institutions have the capacity to make investments, there is a distinct shortage of the type of buildings - with long leases and financially secure tenants - that they find attractive. A strong pick-up in the letting market will eventually feed through into new investment opportunities. On the current showing, however, that is still some way off.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / EC energy plans survive row EUROPEAN Commission plans to open up the EC market in electricity and natural gas survived - just - to be fought over another day, as energy ministers of the 12 yesterday agreed to reconsider this key plank of the Community's single market early next year. Dutch-led opposition to the Brussels liberalisation plan, originally to have been in place when the single market starts in January, snatched away what the current UK presidency of the EC had identified as one of its most desired trophies. Under pressure from Denmark, EC nations also postponed until next year any decision on a proposal to boost competition in oil and gas drilling and exploration. The plan would prohibit governments from giving preference to companies from their own nations in the granting of prospecting and drilling licences. The British energy secretary, Mr Timothy Eggar, said a decision could be taken on the proposal during the first half of next year when Denmark holds the EC's rotating presidency. Diplomats said Denmark may have vetoed the plan if the other 11 EC nations had tried to push it through. Under EC rules, any member nation can veto a measure it judges harmful to vital national interests. But the veto is rarely used. Norway also opposes the competition plan. Though not an EC member, Norway could try to block the project through the terms of a free trade accord which it - and six other non-EC members - signed earlier this year with the Community. The Commission proposals aim to open national gas and electricity networks to greater competition from next year, by giving large energy users the right to buy from suppliers anywhere in the EC. This facility would then be extended to smaller energy users from 1996. The ministers in their conclusions asked Brussels to 'consider modifications'. That 'is not withdrawal or amendment', but looking at things like transitional periods, UK officials said.</p>

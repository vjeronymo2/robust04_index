			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Major maps out series of new policies: Kinnock stresses revival aims as main parties launch manifestos MR JOHN MAJOR committed the Tories yesterday to a raft of new policies in an attempt to seize the initiative during the last three weeks of the election campaign. As the Conservatives and Labour presented their manifestos for the election, two opinion polls gave further conflicting signals about their standings with the voters. In the wake of surveys this week pointing to a five-point Labour lead, a Gallup poll for today's Daily Telegraph showed the Conservatives holding a two-point advantage. By contrast, an NOP survey for The Independent gave Labour a four-point lead. Mr Neil Kinnock unveiled a prospectus with few surprises, emphasising his party's commitment to economic revival and to long-term investment in the economy and the welfare state. But a re-statement of Labour's plans to take control of the water industry and of the national electricity grid brought sharp falls in the shares of the water and electricity companies. The falls came in spite of suggestions from senior party figures that such control might well fall short of renationalistion. The party looks more likely to opt for closer regulation of the industries. The glossy 29,000-word Conservative prospectus for the 1990s, entitled the Best Future for Britain, promised to stick to the core economic policies of Mr Major's predecessor. It pledged further cuts in the taxes on incomes, savings and inheritance and a renewed drive towards deregulation and privatisation. Mr Major emphasised the importance of the Citizen's Charter in improving the quality of public services by announcing the creation of a cabinet post to oversee its implementation. Speaking at press conference to launch the manifesto, he said its essential goal was to extend 'choice, ownership, opportunity and responsibility'. British Rail freight and parcels operations are to be sold, along with British Coal. But, initially at least, BR passenger services are to be franchised on a regional basis rather than sold. Mr Major insisted he aimed to 'build on the successes of the last 12 years', but the manifesto also set out a clutch of policies designed to counter any 'mood for change' among the voters. Alongside typically 'Thatcherite' plans to extend curbs on union powers and to boost home ownership, it pledged public money to revitalise inner cities, and policies on health care and social security leading to a generous as well as prosperous society. The manifesto included scores of measures designed to appeal to specific groups. Labour's document  - It's Time to get Britain Working Again  - sought largely to reconfirm the party's shift to the centre ground since 1987. The 28-page manifesto, condensing the 1991 paper, Opportunity Britain, sought to promote the Pounds 2.7bn in new funding for economic recovery and public services in Mr John Smith's Budget. Stressing the need to counter the recession's impact, the manifesto promises immediate action on investment, jobs and training to build 'sustained and sustainable recovery for the future'. Measures include a Pounds 1.1bn package of enhanced capital allowances for industry and job creation, Pounds 1bn for the health service and Pounds 600m for education funded by the planned tax increases on the higher paid. The 10,000-word paper was also at pains to limit its commitments on constitutional reform. Earlier hints that regional assemblies for England and reform of the House of Lords might be pledged within the lifetime of a parliament have not emerged. Mr Kinnock used his foreword to commend a Labour government as offering 'a fresh start for Britain'. He concluded: 'It will mean greater freedom, security and opportunity. It will mean change for the better.'</p>

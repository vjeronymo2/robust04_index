			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: BTR Yesterday's results from BTR should lay a few ghosts to rest. The Pounds 54m pre-acquisition provision taken against Rexnord, bought in December, looks moderate when measured against the Dollars 820m purchase price. Since provisions against Hawker Siddeley are also virtually used up, quality of earnings should be less of a concern. Neither is it easy to maintain the argument that BTR is hamstrung by excessive short-term debt following the Rexnord deal. With at least Pounds 300m a year flowing into the coffers as investors exercise their warrants, and a creditable record of cash generation being maintained, BTR could quickly de-gear. In that case the group deserves to be judged on its ability to increase sales and rebuild margins. On paper the prospects are promising. Group margins peaked at 17.5 per cent in 1989, against 15.6 per cent last year. Since that peak BTR has shed turnover in distribution and reinvested in potentially higher-margin areas. The Pounds 44m rationalisation costs included in yesterday's figures show that overheads have been whittled away. If the previous margin peak can be exceeded this time around the cycle, there is plenty of profits growth to come. The worry is that organic growth has so far proved elusive despite improving conditions in North America and Australasia, which account for almost half of turnover. While the 13 per cent rise in the dividend signals confidence, BTR will have to prove that it has lost none of the old line management skills if it is to regain a premium rating.</p>

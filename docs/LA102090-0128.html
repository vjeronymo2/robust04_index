			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IRS SEIZES ALLEGED PORN KING'S PROPERTY  </P> <P> About $800,000 worth of artworks and other property was seized from the Van  Nuys home of alleged pornography kingpin Reuben Sturman to help pay off his  $4.9-million tax bill, the Internal Revenue Service reported Friday.  </P> <P> The property was taken Thursday from Sturman's sprawling home in the 13900  block of Weddington Street and will be sold at a public auction to pay the back  taxes, said Patricia Hudak, IRS assistant public affairs officer in Cleveland.  </P> <P> Sturman was convicted in Cleveland last year of violating banking requirements,  conspiracy and tax fraud, after an investigation by the IRS that involved  proceeds from an alleged pornography distribution empire.  </P> <P> After his Nov. 17, 1989, conviction in Cleveland, Sturman was sentenced to 10  years in prison and fined $2.46 million. He remains free on $1-million bail  while appealing the conviction. He could not be located for comment.  </P> <P> Sturman was not living in the Van Nuys house at the time of the seizure, but  Los Angeles police said he resides elsewhere in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The IRS did not reveal what specific items were taken from the  5,610-square-foot, Tudor-style house in Van Nuys because the property list was  sealed by court order, Hudak said. The IRS has also placed a tax lien against  the football-field-size property, which is surrounded by a five-foot fence.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, IRS agents also seized property and placed a lien against a  house in Cleveland owned by the 65-year-old Sturman, Hudak said.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the auction of property taken in both seizures will be used to  defray $4.9 million in taxes and interest Sturman owes for the years 1978  through 1982, Hudak said.  </P> <P> Hudak said the seizures occurred because other efforts to collect the money  from Sturman were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> "We ask for immediate payment," she said. "If that fails . . . enforcement  action can be taken. We try to collect the money as quickly as possible."  </P> <P> Sturman, who was described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest  distributor of pornography, is awaiting trial next month in Las Vegas on  charges of racketeering and interstate transportation of obscene material.  </P></p>

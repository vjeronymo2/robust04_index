On Saturday, 19  March, government and CRS representatives were able to iron out  the final differences that had stopped the negotiations and  reach a specific agreement on all the topics discussed. "As a  result of this and in order to adjust the details of the  ceremony whereby the CRS will lay down its weapons and rejoin  civilian society, the signing of the final Political Accord will  take place on 9 April in Monte Flor, Ovejas Municipality, Sucre  Department," the communique signed by the two sides said. In  the eight-point agreement, the government pledges to give the  CRS two seats in the House of Representatives and, possibly,  another in the Senate. The eight points agreed on refer to human  rights, citizen participation, economic consensus, regional  development, legal benefits, political advantages  [favorabiliades], reincorporation, and the surrender of weapons.    CRS spokesmen voiced their satisfaction with the agreement  reached and called on active rebel groups to hold talks with the  government and seek alternatives of peace. The CRS disbanding  process began a year ago when a dissident ELN [Army of National  Liberation] group publicly expressed its desire to talk and  surrender its weapons. At that time, the CRS had rejected the  orthodox leadership of Manuel Perez, a Spanish former priest,  kidnappings, and indiscriminate violence as a guerrilla warfare  strategy. The process experienced its biggest setback last  September when leaders Enrique Buendia and Ricardo Gonzalez were  murdered. These men, who were unarmed and had special  authorization from civilian authorities, were getting ready to  make contact with other comrades in arms when the Army detained  and killed them.</p>

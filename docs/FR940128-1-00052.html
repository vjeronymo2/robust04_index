			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist themselves in the implementation of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish laws, the States have formed the ISSC. The ISSC is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization of State officials, representatives of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, and representatives of the shellfish industry. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides guidance to the States and provides a forum for them to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discuss their problems in attempting to ensure the sanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of shellfish handling and production (Ref. 97, p. 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA evaluates State and international shellfish sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs (Ref. 98, part I, p. 2). When it finds that the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is consistent with the NSSP, FDA accepts the State's or country's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipper certifications. FDA publishes the ``Interstate Certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shellfish Shippers List'' monthly, in which it lists the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 2,000 shellfish dealers that have been certified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While FDA continues to believe in the cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partnership that it has established with the States, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence that this system is not protecting the public health as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as it might (Refs. 7, p. 331; 99, p. iii; and 100).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Problems can originate anywhere. As explained in the discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above of the term ``lot of molluscan shellfish,'' the water from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which shellfish are harvested plays a significant role in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining their safety. If they are harvested from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unclassified or polluted waters, shellfish can be a vector of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicable disease. Problems can also occur as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions under which the shellfish are held on the harvest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel, in the processing plant, or by subsequent handlers or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repackers of shucked products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the current situation, FDA has tentatively determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is necessary for it to take steps to strengthen and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide additional support for the existing cooperative program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, FDA is proposing two measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, FDA is proposing to add &sect;1240.60(b), which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that all shellfish offered for transport or transported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in interstate commerce bear a tag that lists the date, place,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type, and quantity of shellfish, and by whom it was harvested,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the harvester's identification number. FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing this requirement because it has determined that a tag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the only means by which the agency can ensure that it will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible to determine whether the shellfish have been taken from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe water. FDA is proposing to require that the place where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish were harvested be listed because it will enable a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor who receives the shellfish, or a regulatory official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who inspects them, to determine whether they were taken from safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require that the date when the shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were harvested be listed because, as discussed above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shifting conditions in shellfish harvesting waters make shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety virtually a day-to-day proposition. Therefore, when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish are harvested becomes a critical factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing that the type of shellfish e.g., oysters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clams, mussels, or scallops, and quantity be shown on the tag or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bill of lading to ensure that the tag is applied only to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product to which it was initially affixed. Information on type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and quantity of shellfish describes that product. FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require that the person by whom the shellfish were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvested be listed because that person has the most direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge of where and when the shellfish were harvested and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be readily identifiable in case there are problems with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shellfish, so that quick action can be taken to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of any problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, FDA is proposing that the harvester identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number issued by the shellfish control authority be included to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a means to confirm the harvester's identity and to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the harvester's local address in case of an illness investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or followup to tagging and labeling discrepancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing this tagging requirement under section 361  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the PHS Act. Under this section, the Surgeon General and, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegation, FDA, is authorized to make and enforce such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations as in FDA's judgment are necessary to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA tentatively finds that requiring a tag is a measure necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prevent the spread of communicable diseases because the tag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will readily permit identification of those raw shellfish that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were harvested from properly classified waters, and thus that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be vectors of communicable disease in interstate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce, and those that were not harvested from properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified waters and thus that may be vectors of disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the PHS Act, FDA is also authorized to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such measures which in its judgment may be necessary to enforce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations that it adopts to prevent the spread of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicable diseases (section 361(a) of the PHS Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FDA is proposing to provide in &sect;1240.60(b) for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seizure and destruction of any shellfish that are not properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tagged. Without the assurances provided by the tag, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish may bear a microorganism that may render them injurious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to health. Thus, they are unfit for consumption and must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from the food supply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

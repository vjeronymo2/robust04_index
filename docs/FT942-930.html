			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Pragmatism in a rocky relationship: Simon Holberton says practicalities are becoming more important in Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong Kong Rarely has there been a week in Hong Kong which promises so much as this one. Britain and China may be close to striking two agreements - on the financing of the colony's new airport and on the use of military land after Chinese sovereignty resumes in 1997. These are vital to the welfare of the colony and its 6m inhabitants. In addition, on Wednesday Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) debates Governor Chris Patten's plans to increase democracy ahead of the transfer and will settle, finally, whether to accept his proposals for the last elections under British rule, or adopt a watered-down version. The juxtaposition of these events must be encouraging for Mr Patten. An agreement on the airport used to be thought by his critics to depend on Britain capitulating on his political reform package. Yet China, which has fought hard against the governor's proposals, seems to have confounded the experts and separated the political and economic issues. This apparent change of heart - though few would be more optimistic until the airport and military land deals are actually agreed - suggests that in the past Britain may have misjudged Beijing's strategy towards Hong Kong. It would be foolish to believe that all problems dividing the UK and China will be miraculously solved if agreements over airport finance and military land are struck. But the official advice British ministers were used to receiving suggested that such deals would have been impossible: ministers were told that China would not subordinate political interests to Hong Kong's economic concerns. Beijing's leaders have shown themselves to be much more pragmatic than these advisers expected. They realise that in three years they will take charge of one of the most highly developed economies which produces the equivalent of a quarter of China's output in a territory just 0.01 per cent of the mainland's land mass. Beijing knows that managing the transition will be considerably more difficult without Britain's co-operation. It is not surprising, therefore, that China should want to see the completion of two large, complex civil engineering tasks: the construction of a new international airport at Chek Lap Kok to replace Hong Kong's crowded Kai Tak airport; and a naval base on Stonecutters Island, in Victoria Harbour, whose construction depends on a deal over the future use of military land. Beijing's new enthusiasm for agreement has no doubt been helped by the concessions it has won from Britain. On the airport project, Beijing has, during two years of negotiations, persuaded the Hong Kong government to increase the equity it will invest in the HKDollars 83.3bn airport and connecting railway project from HKDollars 16.4bn to HKDollars 60.3bn. The remain portion, to be financed by long-term borrowing, has been cut by the corresponding amount to about HKDollars 23bn. China has been determined to minimise the amount of public debt it will inherit in 1997 - so the project will be financed with a far higher proportion of equity than would be considered financially prudent in most developed countries. After a bilateral meeting on Friday, the British and Chinese sides instructed officials to draft a detailed agreement. The main sticking point is the form of words China will use to reassure bankers that lending to the airport and railway corporations will be secure. There is optimism that agreement can be reached though ominously it is the same obstacle that Britain failed to surmount in secret talks with China three years ago during an earlier attempt to secure the airport's future. The gains Beijing has made in its talks with Britain over military land have not been made as public. But China is believed to have forced the British into accepting that a larger portion of current military sites should be transferred to the People's Liberation Army, rather than handed over to the Hong Kong government for re-development. In addition, the Hong Kong government will build a 400 square metre port off Stonecutters island for the PLA navy. The stalling point has been a apparently technical point: whether Britain will agree to act as a 'guarantor' of the project in the extremely unlikely event of LegCo refusing to vote the approximately HKDollars 3.5bn needed to build the new base and refurbish other military sites that China will inherit. British and Chinese officials meet again today for further discussions. The result of a long negotiating session over the weekend suggested the Chinese may have drawn back from an early settlement. With their sense of history, the Chinese may anyway wish to postpone a deal until at least Wednesday when the Black Watch regiment of the British army 'beats the retreat' for the last time in Hong Kong, marking the end of almost 150 years in which at least one British regiment has been stationed in the colony. That could mean a deal on military land coinciding with the LegCo vote on Mr Patten's democracy legislation. His plans would make LegCo more representative of the colony's population. Like the airport and defence territory deals, the outcome of the vote hangs in the balance. Mr Patten's advisers calculated over the weekend that they had only 26 certain votes, out of a LegCo membership of 60, for his bill - although they are confident three or four other legislators can be persuaded to vote with the government. But the vote may be determined by the tactics Beijing adopts. The Liberal Party, which has 15 members in LegCo, has been lobbying independent and pro-China members to support its 'middle way' - amendments to Mr Patten's proposals which follow more closely what China is assumed to want. It suggests, for example, that nine new constituencies to be created for the 1995 LegCo elections should be restricted to a total of 122,000 business voters, rather than the 2.3m extra voters Mr Patten wishes to enfranchise. The vote could swing against Mr Patten if the three LegCo representatives allied to Beijing side with the Liberal Party rather than abstaining. The signs are that China has yet to decide its strategy. Mr Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, hints that members of the Chinese government are divided. 'Some believe if we adopt the Liberal Party's proposals we can have a much smoother transfer of power in 1997,' he says. 'The 1995 elections would fit in better with the Basic Law (Beijing's mini-constitution for the colony) than Mr Patten's 1992 proposals. 'But others think that if China takes a positive attitude it could be interpreted that the LegCo decision has validity. If China were to accept LegCo's vote people would also question the need for Sino-British talks in the first place.' So far China has seen LegCo as merely an 'advisory body' to a colonial regime. Whatever the result of Wednesday's vote it will mark a watershed, finally setting in concrete the way politics will be conducted in the last three years of British rule. While rows over Hong Kong's political development may cloud Anglo-Chinese relations from time to time, they will no longer form a obstacle to the practical business of transferring sovereignty. That bodes well for deals on the airport and military land, even if the conjunction of events this week ultimately proves too much for China to digest at once.</p>

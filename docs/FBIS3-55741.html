			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Opening address by President Boris Yeltsin at the first </F> session of the Federation Council in Moscow -- live]    [Text] Esteemed members of the Federation Council! Under  the Constitution, 178 places are provided for in the Federation  Council - 171 people have been elected, 140 people have  registered. So the Federation Council is competent to begin its  work. Allow me, in accordance with the Constitution, to declare  open the first sitting of the Federation Council, of the Federal  Assembly of the Russian Federation. [applause followed by  Russian national anthem]    Esteemed members of the Russian Federation! As of today,  Russian statehood is acquiring new qualities. The bicameral  parliament of the Russian Federation is beginning its work. At  the same time, the chronological link which was broken for  decades is restored. The State Duma has begun work at the same  time as the Federation Council. And it is not a matter of the  formal restoration of the name of a state institute of Russia.  The meaning of what has happened is much deeper. Russia is  returning to its roots, is restoring lost traditions. It cannot  acquire its true character without that. It's not possible to go  forward without that. It's not possible to take a worthy place  in the contemporary world without that.    The new Russian statehood is based upon a solid legal basis,  the Constitution, which was adopted not by a group of people,  not by a party but, for the first time in the history of Russia,  by nationwide vote. We all still have a lot to do to ensure that  the constitutional statutes become norms of our life, to learn  to live in accordance with them.    I recognize fully the particular responsibility that lies  upon the president in that common work. As president of the  Russian Federation, in carrying out my duties, I will observe  and defend strictly the Constitution of the Russian Federation  adopted on 12 December 1993 by nationwide vote, respect and  guard the rights and freedoms of the people of Russia and serve  faithfully their interests, defend the sovereignty and  independence, security and territorial integrity of the state,  fulfill conscientiously the duties placed upon me by the  Constitution. I am counting on the deputies of the Federal  Assembly also to adhere strictly to the Constitution of Russia  in their actions.    Those who are here in the Federation Council are those who  won free and democratic elections in sharp and open competition.  I congratulate you on this great political and personal  success. You have been elected to the Federation Council, the  upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. Russian citizens have  put their trust in you, they have transferred on to you part of  their power and at the same time placed on you great  responsibility for our fatherland, for the people of Russia. I  hope every one of you fully realizes this.    You will now participate immediately in running a great  power, in determining its destiny. Each of you will now have a  much greater opportunity to be of use to Russia. I believe that  you you will use this opportunity to the maximum for the good of  our people.    On this exciting day I should like to share with you what I  believe to be especially important for present-day Russia.  First of all, the parliament starts its proceedings in a  country which is at peace. The electorate expects from deputies  real efforts to consolidate civil peace. Last year a great  effort was required to retain this peace. At the hardest moment  most of those now in this hall backed the president and helped  to avert chaos and civil confrontation in Russia.    There is a great need now for members of the Federation  Council and deputies of the State Duma leading the Russian  parliament to the the road of creation. Cooperation must be the  main thing in relations between the legislative and executive  authorities. The Federal Assembly is starting its work in a  single Russian Federation state. No matter for whom our voters  voted, no matter what party or bloc they gave their vote to,  they were unanimous that the Russian Federation should continue  to be an integral state, a firm federation. It is our duty to  fulfill this will. The Constitution clearly demarcates what  things come under the jurisdiction of the federation and of its  components. We must strictly adhere to that, and at the same  time remember that strong regions are the condition of Russia's  prosperity.    Parliament is starting its working at a most crucial moment  of the existence of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Each  of the states is increasingly coming to understand that alone  they cannot cope with most difficult problems, and that they  cannot survive alone. Our countries are already being linked  together, and in this process it is Russia's vocation to be the  first among equals.    Our compatriots, those in the former Soviet republics, first  and foremost, rely on the fact that voluntary, free, and  peaceful integration will grow from strength to strength. They  hope that their lawful interests will be protected. And our duty  is to live up to these expectations.    The election of the Russian president to the post of CIS  chairman provides an exclusively favorable opportunity to  implement these aims. Our position remains unchanged. The  richer, the more comprehensive, and the closer the relations  between our states are, the better. You are starting work in an  atmosphere of profound transformations in the country. We all  know how difficult it was to move from endless and fruitless  talk to practical deeds. It is imperative now not to stop  half-way.    Over the two years of reforms in Russia, the basis for a  market economy has been laid. But this is just the beginning. In  the course of the parliamentary campaign, many fresh and  original ideas were voiced which can give fresh impetus to  reforms.    The parliamentarians have a realistic opportunity to  implement these ideas, first and foremost in laws. It is laws  which are the foundation of democratic power.    In many respects, the Russian Federation's legislation has  still not become the legislation of the market. Almost  insuperable obstacles still remain both for businessmen and  bankers and private farmers. If during the time of your work in  this sphere you can bring about a breakthrough, you will not  only justify the aspirations of the electorate, but will assume  a worthy place in the history of Russia. We have many  resourceful and energetic people who want and can get down to  work. Today they are in need of our support. We must finally  give them the opportunity of working and earning. These people  are the very basis of our country's prosperity. It is their  hands that are creating a stable and prosperous society in which  no one will feel himself humiliated and alienated.    At the same time, material prosperity alone will not make  the  country happy nor revive in citizens of Russia a sense of their  own dignity. We must honestly admit that in the most difficult  transformations in the Russian Federation, only a very little of  the mighty potential of the multinational culture of the  fatherland has so far been activated. This culture has been  left on the sidelines of the reforms, and it is perhaps this  that is the reason for many difficulties and failures. It is  our common task to align the market and culture to the greatest  possible degree. Unless we do so, the market will not become  civilized; unless we do so, the market will not emerge from  crisis, there will be no revival of spirituality, there will be  no revival of Russia's greatness.    I call upon you to bear this constantly in mind in your  work.  The Federal Assembly is starting its work in a period when the  Russian Federation's democratic statehood is being established.  Everyone knows with what pain and difficulty this process has  been proceeding. The adoption of the Constitution offers a  realistic opportunity for making this more calm and effective.    It can be said that for the first time agreement has been  reached in Russia on the rules and norms which are obligatory  for all political forces. And we must at all costs preserve  this accord, in order that there can be calm in the country, in  order that dictatorship can never return to Russia. We can and  must help public and political forces to find accord on the main  issue, the categoric and total exclusion of force from the  country's political life.    There shall be no justification for those who organize mass  disorders. No one must evade responsibility for calls for  violent actions, for inciting national, social or religious  dissension amongst people.    There is one more issue I would particularly like to dwell  on. Russia is a great power and it will never agree to be on  the sidelines of world civilization. The time has ended when  our country felt itself to be a besieged fortress and was in  confrontation with the rest of the world. Our task today is to  activate truly wide and equal cooperation with the world  community.    It is not by military might alone that a worthy place in the  world is defined. Our country and people have a great resource  of vital energy, and it is up to us to help our fatherland to  gather its forces, to revive those powerful stimuli which would  resurrect its greatness. International law is our fundamental  guideline in the world. Russia will strictly abide by its norms  and principles, convinced that this is the most efficient way of  protecting national interests.    However, one other aspect is of no lesser importance: all  states must also strictly abide by norms of the international  law in their relations with Russia. No double standards will be  tolerated here. I hope that State Duma and Federation Council  deputies will support both the president and the government in  this respect.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council! The majority of  you are experienced politicians who have learned the secrets of  power and are capable of distinguishing great politics from  petty intriguing. I see you as one of the main stabilizing  forces of Russian statehood. And both the president and  parliamentarians could voice disagreement with one or other  decisions taken by the other, could be dissatisfied with each  other, could argue and stand their ground. But any political  problems can and should be resolved only by legal procedures.  We must remember always that we represent a great country, a  great people, multinational Russia, and that means that as long  as our powers are in force we are not free from that demand,  even in our private life, and even more so on the state tribune.    It is essentially, finally, to forget revolutionary  vocabulary, to rid ourselves of the vestiges of unhealthy  suspicion and political maximalism [maksimalizm].    Given the diverse party nature of parliament, there is a  fundamental basis for joint constructive action - that is  concern for the citizens of Russia, that is sticking to the  strategic course for economic reform. We should consider the  constitutional and democratic procedures for forming power and  defining the political and economic policy of the country to be  unshakable and inviolable. At the same time, the state is  obliged to defend democracy by all legal means. In Russia, in  Russian statehood there are quite a few old and not so old  traditions. They are to be enriched substantially and new  elements are to be introduced into them.    This directly concerns the Federation Council.  Constitutional norms define the overall structure of work of the  upper chamber of the Russian parliament. A lot of work lies  ahead to specify these norms. I hope you will approach it  looking not just one or two years ahead, but far into the  future, into the 21st Century. I intend to be in constant  contact with legislators, to hold consultations with the leaders  of parliamentary factions on all the most important issues.    The Constitution envisages an annual presidential address to  the Federal Assembly. I will make one shortly, after procedural  matters are solved in either chamber. In this address I will  submit to you a program for political and economic changes in  1994, the main directions of domestic and foreign policy, and I  will also outline plans for the next two years. The address will  take stock, as carefully as possible, of all the constructive  ideas contained in election manifestoes and programs, as well as  of deputies' proposals on ways to organize our cooperation.    Esteemed Russian members of parliament: you have been asked  by the citizens of this country to lay the foundation for the  building of Russian parliamentary culture. This is peaceful,  creative, and also very difficult work. Special responsibility  has been placed upon you: you are the start, and the future of  Russia depends to a large extent on how successful this start  is.    Let me wish you success in our common cause of shaping our  fatherland. Thank you.</p>

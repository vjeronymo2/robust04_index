			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Go-ahead for Pounds 85m shopping complex Gracemount Developments, a property company owned by Mr Paul Jillard, Mr Keith Johnson and Grand Metropolitan Estates, is to develop a 300,000 sq ft shopping centre worth about Pounds 85m at Solihull, West Midlands, Paul Cheeseright writes. The borough council, as owner of six of the seven acres needed for the scheme, yesterday said it had signed contracts for the development with Gracemount. The council will give Gracemount a long-term lease and receive a royalty in return. But the development will not start until the 30 different interests in the land not owned by the council are bought out. If the council resorts to compulsory purchase there will be a public inquiry next year.</p>

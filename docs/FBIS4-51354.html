			<p>BFN     [Text] The party and government leading comrades at various  levels should firmly remember the purpose of the party,  strengthen the sense of the masses, be concerned with the woe  and weal of the masses, always be concerned with the well-being  of the masses, help the masses solve their practical problems in  production and livelihood, accelerate the economic development  of the less developed areas, and help them turn poverty into  wealth as soon as possible and change their appearances. This  was what Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party  committee, prominently stressed during his investigation and  study activities in Qihe on 23 May.    Jiang Chunyun has regarded Qihe as an area that he keeps in  contact with while dealing with his work. Over the past year,  he has established profound ties with the local people there.    On the morning of 23 May, Jiang Chunyun went to (Dayang)  Village of (Xiaozhou) Township. He successively visited the  homes of Villagers (Yang Ailin) and (Yang Meilin) and the  vegetable growing areas in (Dayang) Village. He asked them  about their vegetable planting and marketing situation as well  as their income. He suggested that they should achieve not only  production but also marketing.    Jiang Chunyun also visited the fine wheat seed cultivating  base in (Dayang) village to understand the wheat and cotton  growing situation.    He said: Cotton is a major advantage of the northern and  western areas of Shandong Province as well as a pillar of the  rural economy. So, we should exert great efforts to grasp cotton  production. After that, he went to the construction site of the  on-going (Huajiao) road; called on the personnel who were  engaging themselves in the construction work, including the  cadres of the provincial agricultural commission, the provincial  personnel affairs department, the provincial radio and  television department, and the provincial (?export) company who  take on jobs in Qihe; and also wielded a shovel to join the  labor.    He earnestly said to these cadres: Promoting a coordinate  development of the eastern and western parts of the province and  seeking common wealth is a major task that the province should  make efforts to fulfill. Helping the people in less developed  areas turn poverty into wealth as soon as possible is an  unshirkable duty of the party cadres and the people's public  servants. So, we should firmly foster the purpose of serving  the people, have a profound feeling to do more concrete deeds  for the people, and make contributions to rejuvenating the  economy in these areas and bringing about happiness to the  people there.    After hearing the reports made by the leaders of Dezhou  Prefecture and Qihe County, Jiang Chunyun urged that Dezhou  Prefecture and Qihe County should take the lead in narrowing the  gaps with the eastern areas and turning poverty into wealth as  soon as possible.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out that to deepen reform, we should  implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee, focus on setting up the socialist  market economic system, promote overall reform, and make a key  breakthrough.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should persist in the principle  of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are  tough and actually ensure to grasp both material and spiritual  civilizations and to make achievements in these two aspects.</p>

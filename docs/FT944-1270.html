			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Toys make children of us all: Vanessa Houlder on the gadgets and products that excited or seduced consumers this year The hit product of 1994 caused hype and havoc in equal measure. The shortage of the plastic action toys called Mighty Morphin Power Rangers led to overnight queues, waiting lists months long, a thriving black market, fights in toy shops and even an armed robbery. The demand for these toys, which are based on a TV series being screened in 80 countries, is on target to beat all previous records for toy sales in the run-up to Christmas. The output of 33 factories across the world working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, evidently left large numbers of unsatisfied customers around the world. 'It could sell 10 times over if the stock were available,' claims Bandai, the manufacturers. It is no surprise that product crazes most often occur in the toy industry. Television's power to sell toys based on popular programmes, together with children's susceptibility to peer pressure and their skill at pressurising their parents, can create a mass market for a new product overnight. Selling toys aimed at adults is a trickier proposition, although there is no shortage of companies willing to try. The Christmas catalogue of Neiman Marcus, the elite Texas-based department store, offered customers a novel method of observing fish and coral with its Dollars 7,500 Bellaqua Breathing Observation Bubble (Bob), an underwater scooter with an air-filled dome to cover its rider's head and shoulders. Another ingenious, if less elaborate, viewing gadget made a big inroad in the UK. The Night Spy, a Pounds 495 image intensifier that allows wildlife spotters, astronomers and caving enthusiasts to see in the dark was the best-selling product of Innovations, a UK catalogue company. On a more practical level, some of the most fashionable gadgets of 1994 have been communication tools, which have benefited from falling costs and increased sophistication. In France, the Bi-Bop mobile phone, which is small enough to slip into a pocket, became an ultra-chic accessory for Parisians, following its launch last year. In California, pocket pagers continued to be essential items for teenagers. For techno-enthusiasts, one of the most promising new developments in the personal communications market was the arrival of Sony's Magic Link in September. It is a small, light personal digital assistant that organises contacts and calendar and allows users to communicate easily via voice, fax and e-mail. Another personal digital assistant, Sharp's Zaurus, a pen-based system that reads handwriting took the Japanese market by storm. Other top-selling gadgets in Japan were wide-screen television sets and car navigational devices based on global positioning systems. In general, however, the tastes of Japanese consumers are moving away from the technological sophistication of recent years. Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency, detected a widespread craving for familiarity and nostalgia this year in its annual survey of hit products. Wrinkle-free shirts, made from a fabric that retains its original shape, was a hit product that was a variation on a familiar theme. Another measure of a more downbeat mood among Japanese consumers was the popularity of books about dying. Peaceful Death, by radio commentator Rokusuke Ei, the most popular of these books, sold more than 1m copies. Value for money was a strong theme with Japanese consumers this year. The extravagance that characterised the late 1980s, when people exchanged splendid gifts such as live lobsters, has not yet returned. However, Japanese consumers were slightly more prepared to buy luxuries in 1994 than they were in 1993, according to Dentsu. Indeed, luxury goods have made a partial comeback throughout the affluent world, following the downturn of the early 1990s. At one point this year, Louis Vuitton said that demand for its range of bags was so strong that its luggage shop on Avenue Montaigne in Paris limited sales to two per customer. Moreover, demand for luxury goods has been strong in markets that were, until recently, closed to western retailers. Boutiques such as Cartier's in Shanghai, Christian Dior's in Moscow, and Ferrari's showroom in Beijing have allowed status conscious entrepreneurs to flaunt their new wealth. The spirits manufacturers have also found new markets. Imported vodka has found a surprisingly buoyant market in Russia, while brandy - and, to a lesser extent Scotch whisky - has sold strongly in China. On the other side of the world, the most intriguing development in the drinks market was the growing popularity of 'New Age' or 'natural' beverages. These concoctions, which boast names such as Raspberry Iced Tea, Amazin' Grape Juice, Mango Madness Cocktail, Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and Grape Beyond took the US by storm, helping to erode the market share of dominant cola drinks such as Coca-Cola. The challenges facing one of the US's all-time greatest drink brands is among the most intriguing product stories of recent years. But for the most important US product trend of 1994, it is necessary to look to the computer market. In the US, where consumers are already several times more likely to possess a home computer than in Europe or Japan, sales are growing at a pace that will see nearly half of US households owning a PC by 1998. This trend has been pushed forward this year by developments in multimedia. The arrival of machines that can talk, sing, play music and show video clips is creating new forms of electronic recreation, from 'infotainment' (such as Microsoft's Encarta, a CD-RoM encyclopaedia) to disc-based games that can be run on PCs. In the face of this competition, traditional game manufacturers, such as Sega, are fighting back with the first of a new generation of powerful 32-bit, compact disc-based machines. Sony sold out of its first video game machine, the Sony Playstation, on its first day on the market in Japan. As consumers wait for the new machines, enthusiasm for the existing 16-bit video game platforms has waned. For the first time in five years, Nintendo did not figure on the list of predicted top 10 Christmas best-selling toys produced by Hamleys, the London toy store. Nonetheless, the existing platforms have their uses. Sega has launched a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers game for its Mega Drive and GameGear. It might  -just might - help fob off the clamorous children whose parents failed to get hold of one of the prized Power Rangers toys.</p>

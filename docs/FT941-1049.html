			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Portia put into a new perspective - 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'King Lear' I had thought that the definitive staging of Act V of The Merchant of Venice  -the tricky garden scene in which lovers' problems are resolved and no one even mentions Shylock - was achieved by Peter Hall in his 1989 staging. But I watched Act V of the current West Yorkshire Playhouse Merchant with even more emotion and astonishment. Jude Kelly's staging keeps taking you by surprise, pushing hard against preconceptions, sending you back to re-examine the text. In this Act V, Shylock is by no means forgotten. This garden scene - the play is set circa 1920 - starts to come close to the garden of the Finzi-Continis, a temporary idyll which will soon be invaded. For Portia, remember, has married a man who, like his friends, is blatantly anti-Semitic. She has learnt to practise the quality of mercy of which she spoke, as has Lorenzo. It is, however, by no means certain that their new enlightenment will prevail over Bassanio, Antonio, Salerio and Solanio. But racial prejudice is only one theme in this play, which has undercurrents this staging hoists into the light. Above all, it retells the tale of Portia. Portia, in a brilliantly intelligent and complex performance, is Nichola McAuliffe. Her first words are 'By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world,' and for once she really means it. So worldweary is she, so tired and angry at the fetters placed upon her by the conditions of her father's will, that she is swigging wine and firing an unloaded gun into her own mouth when first we see her. This is Portia as Dorothy Parker. She can still be Portia the great lady and Portia the dangerous wit - even Portia the huntress - but she achieves that poise only on the brink of despair. And she learns that her father is not the only man whose wishes will confront hers. She is far more smitten with Bassanio than he with her. But love makes makes her quick to realise how bound up he is with Antonio. Antonio, Bassanio et al inhabit a closety, men-only milieu in Venice; and the fact that she is dressing up as a man acquires immense irony. In the trial scene she hears Bassanio tell Antonio 'Life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with me esteem'd above thy life'. And, even after trumping Shylock with her superior command of the law, she still urges him 'Prepare thee to cut off the flesh', not without a spasm of malice against Antonio. To Shylock she is not vindictive, merely precise; and the more she observes him, the more reluctant she is to use the law against him. The nastiest shock occurs at the end of this same scene. Antonio and her husband, treating her as 'one of us', rush upon her with instant talk of love - as if to initiate her into their gay mafia. And so, when Bassanio finally gives up the ring he had from his wife as a present to this wonderboy lawyer, she is aghast - and teeters right back into full despair. Sure enough, when Antonio meets her (not suspecting her recent drag act) on her home ground in Belmont as his friend's wife, he is now chilly and perfunctory. And, when she confronts Bassanio, she does so with real rage and heartbreak at his perfidy ('Even so void is your false heart of truth'). Though I have known this play for over 25 years, I followed all of this, and much else in this production, as if I never knew what would happen next. Several of the Venetian scenes occur in, or just outside, the Jewish ghetto. Not only Venice's Jews but also its black slaves (to whom Shylock refers at some length in the court scene) attend on several scenes. Shylock (Gary Wildhorn) is eloquent, as both oppressed and oppressor. Bassanio (Richard Lintern) is sexually ambivalent - he exercises his charm on both Antonio and Portia in quite disturbingly similar ways - and Antonio (Michael Cashman, a daringly unsympathetic reading) is a buttoned-up misogynist smoothie who snivels in terror of Shylock's knife. But the excellence of this staging lies not in individuals but in ensemble. No one delivers a single speech as if it were (mere) poetry; everything has its point. And no one addresses their lines out into the audience; everything is focused within the stage world. Another company tackling Shakespeare for the second time has received rather more national attention, mainly because it is all-black. This is the Talawa Theatre Company, directed by Yvonne Brewster; but in its new King Lear it comes off considerably worse than in its 1991 Antony and Cleopatra. Lear and poor Tom do a little rap routine; a white plastic sheet lowers itself in stages on the proceedings; the play begins with, and returns to, amplified heavy breathing. Edmund, Edgar, and Gloucester seem to come from three utterly different backgrounds; and relaxed verse-speaking, despite some individually excellent feats of phrasing, is still a general problem. The 39-year-old Ben Thomas (replacing Norman Beaton) is a most likeable actor, and so accomplished that he is the first Lear I have heard to bring off 'Never never never never never' as iambic rather than trochaic (Edmund Wilson and Vladimir Nabokov corresponded with some intensity on this matter). He is too energetic and too sane to be King Lear, but he has great dignity, and is often revealing. He can fuse poetry and meaning wonderfully; the imagery of 'birds i' the cage' and 'gilded butterflies', playing off each other in the same speech, acquired unusual beauty and poignancy. I hope he returns to the role, in a production more worthy of his mettles; and I hope he plays other, younger, Shakespearian roles soon. The Merchant of Venice is in repertory at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until April 23; King Lear is at the Cochrane Theatre, WC1, until April 16.</p>

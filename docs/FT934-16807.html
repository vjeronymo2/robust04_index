			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Sri Lanka army ends offensive HEAVY casualties and a shortage of troops have forced the Sri Lankan army to pull out of the troubled Jaffna peninsula, bringing to an apparent end its biggest military offensive (Operation Yal Devi) against Tamil guerrillas in more than two years. The army says 118 soldiers were killed and 250 injured when a 5,000-strong force, backed by tanks, gunboats and jet fighters, advanced 24 kilometres into the rebel-held areas last Friday and captured the port of Killaly. Yesterday the defence ministry said it had abandoned the port, used by the guerrillas for several years to beat an army blockade, and had withdrawn to the Elephant Pass army base on a strip of land which joins the Jaffna peninsula to the Sri Lankan mainland. Military analysts say Sri Lanka's defence forces, which lost two tanks in the operation, was taken aback at the heavy loss of life in spite of government claims of a great success. The Sri Lankan army does not have enough men to keep the port supplied through rebel territory during the monsoon.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Complexities threaten pension schemes Sir, I write in response to the article 'Minimum pension may be scrapped' (September 18/19). The removal of the existing impossibly complex Guaranteed Minimum Pension requirements is essential for the future of contracting out. It must be viewed, however, in the context of an equally necessary overall objective - the simplification of the present spider's web of pensions conditions as a precursor to increased security. Existing Inland Revenue and Department of Social Security requirements have produced a degree of frustration and despair among scheme administrators and employers that must be virtually unparalleled. Indeed, in a survey we conducted among finance directors of some 300 UK companies, one in three said any additional complicating legislation, with resultant increased costs, would cause them to consider scaling down or winding up existing company schemes. In our view, true simplification is attainable only by examining the purpose of each set of requirements, ensuring that it is really valid and then, if so, devising an alternative way of achieving the same goal. Our recommendations to the DSS and Goode Committee have stressed the need for simplification involving a complete redesign of the current Heath Robinson structure. The private sector will only be able to fill the pensions gap, left by the inevitable rolling back of state provision, when radical simplification has taken place. This must have as its cornerstone the integration of DSS and Inland Revenue requirements. There is a strong case for a co-ordinated ministerial approach to pensions policy, for departmental co-ordination in giving that policy statutory effect, and for a single regulator covering all pension matters other than investment management. Without such co-ordination, problems arising from conflicting objectives within government will always remain.

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Johannesburg boosted as Mandela meets Buthelezi Johannesburg was given a boost during afternoon trading by the apparently congenial talks in Durban between Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom Party leader. Chief Buthelezi said the talks had been 'going well', in spite of an earlier vow that his party's boycott of the April election was not on the agenda for the meeting. The market was provided with a further boost as the gold price traded above Dollars 380 an ounce. The golds index rallied from an initial fall to end 9 off at 1,986, industrials added 5 at 5,614 and the overall index put on 34 at 4,880. Golds had been depressed by the stronger commercial rand which was seen as dampening export earnings of the mines. Anglos proved the most buoyant issue in the wake of the rising political hopes, appreciating R7 to R204. Among the gold shares, Vaal Reefs lost R1.50 to R430.50 and Driefontein was off 25 cents at R55.25. De Beers, the diamond giant, advanced R2 to R105.00 ahead of the release of the group's interim results, which are expected next week. SA Breweries was unchanged at R82.50, while Remgro put on 25 cents at R31.25 and Sasol, the oil-from-coal producer, was up 50 cents at R22.50 in response to its 17 per cent increase in net income for the six months ending December. In industrial shares, Barlow Rand was down 25 cents to R27.75. Iscor posted a strong 10 per cent bounce to R2.70 in a resumption of its recent upward trend and Gencor rose 35 cents to R8.90.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (21): Vacuum at the heart of the EC - European Monetary Union / The Brussels compromise transformed the ERM from a semi-fixed exchange rate system into a 'dirty floating' operation FIRST Black Wednesday, then Lundi Noir. The de facto suspension of the ERM agreed on Monday, August 2, marks a turning point in Europe's plans for monetary union. Few dare to predict the outcome. But it is clear that EC leaders have begun to reassess the approach to EMU as set down in the Maastricht treaty. The two core assumptions in Maastricht were that the ERM could evolve smoothly into a monetary union before the end of the decade, and that the Franco-German alliance could drive the rest of Europe forward into a full political union. Both these assumptions now look dubious. The strains between the Paris and Bonn governments are evident, even if there is no suggestion of a breach. Germany resented French pressure to lower its interest rates in the run-up to the ERM crisis. Tensions increased when France pushed hard for the D-Mark to leave the ERM temporarily, against the advice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Brussels compromise transformed the ERM from a semi-fixed exchange rate system into a 'dirty floating' operation, with currencies allowed to fluctuate up to 15 per cent before central banks are obliged to intervene. The result is a vacuum at the heart of European monetary co-operation. The Community appears to be dividing into several camps, with no obvious consensus on procedure. The first camp contains the 'purists'. Led by the European Commission, this group argues that it is vital to stick to the EMU game-plan set out in the Maastricht treaty. The purists include Belgium and Ireland and, broadly speaking, Italy and France. Each puts a premium on EC solidarity; each would like Stage Two of Emu to begin on January 1, 1994, along with a deal on a location of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor the European Central Bank. The purists believe the European Monetary System's structures remain intact, thus allowing a reconfiguration of the narrow fluctuation bands once economic conditions become more favourable. The second group contains the 'sceptics', of which Britain is the self-appointed leader. Mr John Major declared last month that the EMU timetable was 'totally unrealistic' - words which might have carried more weight had the UK prime minister not chosen to utter them on the day Britain formally ratified the Maastricht treaty. Mr Major and his Cabinet colleagues are convinced that history is on their side. They believe they are winning all the arguments in favour of a more flexible approach to European integration. The third group constitutes the 'radicals', of which Spain is the most obvious leader. Having suffered three successive devaluations of the peseta (one in the middle of a general election campaign), Spain was so frustrated during the ERM crisis talks in Brussels that it called for a full suspension of the system. There are now fears in some European capitals that the Spanish may in future propose some form of capital controls as the best method of defending currencies and punishing the speculators, no matter the damage to the single European market. The fourth group, which is probably the largest, contains the 'pragmatists'. Led by Germany, the group includes the Netherlands, Denmark, and Luxembourg; it may also extend part-time membership to the UK and France. The pragmatists believe that there needs to be much more realism about EMU. If there is slippage in the EMU timetable, so be it. Chancellor Kohl specifically raised the prospect of a delay of up to two years during a post-crisis television interview, and other officials are now wondering privately if the 1999 target date for automatically locking exchange rates is viable. At the same time, the pragmatists, particularly Germany, insists that the 'convergence criteria' for EMU on inflation, budget deficits and government debt must be adhered to. Already some EC leaders have absorbed the lessons of the crisis. In the early hours of August 2, Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, spoke eloquently about the risks involved in exporting the discipline of price stability to the rest of the EC. Some countries had obviously concluded that the resulting high unemployment was too high a price to pay, he said. Mr Kok was too diplomatic to mention names, but he was clearly referring to France, whose government was forced to abandon its preferred franc fort policy because it could not bear to raise interest rates higher to defend the currency. The same lesson applied to the UK last September, and it continues to be valid for the poorer 'Club Med' countries grouped around Spain. The tension between what might loosely be called the German and Latin economic models is as old as the European Community itself. But it becomes sharper during a recession, or when the Community embarks upon an enterprise as ambitious as monetary union. In the coming months, it is safe to predict that the EC will enter a vigorous debate about EMU. The starting-point will probably be the 'White Paper' on employment and competitiveness being prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, likely to appear under the grand title of 'Entering the Twenty-First Century'. The original impetus for the paper was growing evidence that Europe was failing to create jobs at the same rate as the US and Asia, leading to an inexorable rise in unemployment. The ERM debacle makes the White Paper even more relevant. It will allow the EC to focus minds on the 'real economy' and its relationship to EMU, says one Brussels official involved. The implication is that EC leaders need to focus on today's problems rather than tomorrow's aspirations. No doubt the intellectual case for a single European currency operating in a single European market is as powerful as ever; but from now on, EMU will have to win the political argument, too.</p>

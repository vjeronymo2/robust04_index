The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, 31 U.S.C. 6301&hyph;08, governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the HHS awarding agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HHS awarding agencies shall notify the public of funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Forms for applying for HHS financial assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) HHS awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used in place of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF&hyph;424) series. However, HHS awarding agencies should use the SF&hyph;424 series and its program narrative whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Applicants shall use the SF&hyph;424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the HHS awarding agency. Applicants shall submit the original and two copies of any applications unless additional copies are required pursuant to 5 CFR part 1320. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, as amended by E.O. 12416, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF&hyph;424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the HHS awarding agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review. (See also 45 CFR part 100.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) HHS awarding agencies that do not use the SF&hyph;424 form will indicate on the application form they prescribe whether the application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Debarment and suspension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recipients are subject to the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' 45 CFR part 76. This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special award conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The HHS awarding agency may impose additional requirements as needed, without regard to &sect;74.4, above, if an applicant or recipient: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Has a history of poor performance; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is not financially stable; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Is not otherwise responsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

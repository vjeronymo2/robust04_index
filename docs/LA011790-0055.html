			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON IN THE SOVIET CAUCASUS?  </P> <P> A Red Army general bluntly describes the ethnic conflict now raging in  Azerbaijan as civil war. The Soviet press, which not long ago avoided reporting  news even of common crimes or aircraft accidents, relates in gory detail the  random murders, arson and mutilations carried out by Azerbaijanis and Armenians  and pronounces events to be "out of control." The government has responded by  declaring a state of emergency in parts of Azerbaijan and sending in thousands  of troops, though with what effect is still to be seen. Muslim Azerbaijani and  Christian Armenian gangs appear to be remarkably, if mysteriously, well-armed.  Their conflict, moreover, is fed by passions that even the threat of superior  firepower is unlikely to restrain.  </P> <P> Many nightmares haunt the Soviet Union of Mikhail Gorbachev. Among the worst of  these, in an empire peopled by more than 100 disparate and often discordant  ethnic groups, is the ever-present danger of communal strife and nationalistic  self-assertion. The confrontation between Azerbaijanis and Armenians reflects  animosities that are ancient and seemingly uncompromisable, and it is as  pointless to search for immediate causes for the newest outbreak of violence  between them as it is to look for immediate solutions. For most of its history  the Soviet state was able to suppress intercommunal tensions by the use or  threat of brute force or mass deportations. A more civilized regime now shuns  these methods, even as it searches desperately for effective alternative means  of control.  </P> <P> The long history of the Caucasus is spattered by repeated episodes of  turbulence and bloodshed. The great concern now is that the region could be  approaching a process of Lebanonization, of bloody intercommunal warfare where  each side will fight with a blind fanaticism because each feels that its very  survival may be at stake. It is a frightening possibility. It is also, all too  clearly, a wholly realistic one.  </P></p>

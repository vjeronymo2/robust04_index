			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Tong Zhiguang, board chairman of </F> the Import and Export Bank of China, by Liu Shaobo (0491 1421  0590), station correspondent identified by caption; place and  date not given -- passages within quotation marks recorded; from  the "National News Hookup" program]    [Text] To promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of China's foreign trade, the State Council has  decided to set up the Import and Export Bank of China. A  station correspondent interviewed Tong Zhiguang, board chairman  of the Import and Export Bank of China. [Video shows Tong  Zhiguang, in a dark Western business suit, seated at a desk in  his office; a male reporter is seen sitting across the desk and  holding out a microphone. As Tong speaks, the camera zooms in  to show medium closeup shots of him.]    [Liu Shaobo] "Chairman Tong, why did we establish the Import  and Export Bank of China?"    [Tong] "The State Council's decision to set up the China  Export and Import Bank is geared to the demands of our country's  current implementation of a socialist market economy. For many  years, our country has achieved tremendous results in exports  but our main exports have been agricultural, sideline,  indigenous, and specialty products. We now face the task of  upgrading and renewing our export products by exporting more  technology-intensive products. A review of the status of our  country's industries shows that our machinery and electronics  products and turnkey equipment are highly competitive in this  respect. The bank's establishment will create excellent  conditions for the export of such products. The bank will  extend credit on the export of such goods, so as to create a  strong banking support system for upgrading and improving their  quality."    Chairman Tong Zhiguang told the reporter: The Import and  Export Bank of China's capital funds are allocated from the  state coffers. The bank is managed on the basis of  self-sufficiency and break-even concepts, and along the lines of  enterprise administration; however, it is not an institution  that provides free allocations. Operationally, it is directed  and supervised by the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the People's Bank of China.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BAVARIANS PLAY BRAHMS, BEETHOVEN  </P> <P> Offbeat and contemporary repertory is the particular province of the Bavarian  Radio Symphony, Sir Colin Davis, told a reporter last week. "We have a very  large repertory, but it is not the standard one," Davis said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the ensemble from Munich, under Davis, played a standard program  at its second appearance in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Tuesday night. The  agenda: Brahms' Third Symphony and Beethoven's Fifth.  </P> <P> After a strident, weirdly unfocused run-through of the opening Allegro, Davis  and his Muncheners gave glowing, autumnal readings to the inner movements  before making climactic noises in the finale. Despite moments of genuine  musical cohesion, the impression this orchestra leaves is of provincial  achievement. Certainly, many of the sounds emerging from brass and woodwinds do  not meet an international standard.  </P> <P> Beethoven's C-minor Symphony elicited a fine and successful ensemble effort.  Davis' compelling musical perspective kept all elements in balance, contrasts  between movements remained sharp, and the triumph of the conclusion had been  thoroughly prepared.

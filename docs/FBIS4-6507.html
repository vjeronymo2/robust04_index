			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Work Indicating Way of Rearing Chuche-type </F> Revolutionaries" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  observes the 20th anniversary of the publication of the famous  work "Let Us Cherish Loyalty to the Party and the Leader as Our  Revolutionary Faith and Obligation" by the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il.    In the work published on April 20, 1974, Comrade Kim  Chong-il  emphasized the need to invigorate the efforts for establishing  the monolithic ideological system of the party in keeping with  the developing reality in which the whole society was being  modelled on the chuche idea. He said what was essential in this  was to rear the officials, party members and working people to  be chuche-type revolutionaries unfailingly loyal to the party  and the leader.    The work gives a comprehensive exposition of the reason why  loyalty to the party and the leader is the main trait of the  chuche-type revolutionaries, the basic characteristics of  loyalty to the party and the leader, concrete tasks and ways of  cherishing it as the revolutionary faith and obligation and all  other theoretical and practical matters arising in rearing  revolutionaries of chuche type.    In a by-lined article titled "Immortal Work Guiding People  To  Cherish Loyalty to the Leader as Their Faith and Obligation" the  paper says:    The work serves as a revolutionary textbook of our people in  struggle and life because it fully reflects the noble aspiration  and demand of the chuche-type revolutionaries to absolutely  trust and follow the party and the leader.    It is the main point of the work that only those who cherish  loyalty to the party and the leader as their revolutionary faith  and obligation can remain infinitely faithful to them through  generations in any adversities.    The validity and vitality of the idea expounded by the work  have been clearly proved through our revolutionary practice over  the past two decades.    Today our people are staunchly advancing along the road of  socialism indicated by the leader, regarding loyalty to the  party and the leader as their life and blood. Their loyalty to  the party and the leader is underlined by their faith,  conscience, morality and everyday life. It is also their purest  ideological feelings and something undisputable which remains  unchanged in any circumstances. There is no such a people in the  world as the Korean people, who remain loyal to the great leader  President Kim Il-song and the illustrious leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il with their faith and obligation.</p>

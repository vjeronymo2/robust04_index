			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / BA launches Pounds 442m rights issue as profits drop BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday launched a Pounds 442m rights issue after announcing a drop in profits and a doubling in debt. Pre-tax profits calculated in accordance with the new FRS3 accounting standard fell 57 per cent to Pounds 185m for the year to March 31. Borrowings rose by Pounds 1.281bn to Pounds 2.453bn. The one-for-four rights issue is priced at 245p a share, a 17.5 per cent discount to Monday's closing price. It will lower the company's debt-to-equity ratio from 160 per cent to around 100 per cent. In the last year BA has spent more than Pounds 600m on investments to strengthen its global presence, including stakes in USAir, Qantas and the French regional carrier TAT, plus the assets of Dan Air, the former UK regional airline. It has also announced it is to take over the activities of Plymouth-based Brymon Aviation. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said the financial performance last year was 'impressive' considering the tough trading conditions facing the industry. The future looked 'very promising'. BA's profits comparison was worsened by the restating of the previous year's profits in line with FRS3, to include the Pounds 149m gain that year from the sale of BA's engine overhaul business to General Electric of the US. Without that gain, pre-tax profits for the year to March 1992 were Pounds 285m. On that basis, last year's profits showed a 35 per cent drop from the previous year. Group operating profits fell 9.9 per cent to Pounds 310m on turnover of Pounds 5.566bn, which was 6.5 per cent higher than the year before. The airline had an operating loss of Pounds 25m for the fourth quarter against a Pounds 25m profit a year ago, partly due to one-off items including higher staff severance costs and an operating loss by the former Dan Air operations. Group expenditures rose by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 5.256bn last year. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's new managing director, said the company's cost reduction programme had made a significant contribution, producing more than Pounds 150m in savings last year. BA carried 28.1m passengers last year, an increase of 10.5 per cent. The passenger load factor rose by 0.6 per cent to 70.8 per cent. The airline said it was increasing its capacity this summer by 14 per cent and a further 3 per cent next year. Sir Colin said there was beginning to be some improvement in first and business class high yielding traffic. 'Given the measures we are taking to increase revenues and reduce costs, British Airways remains well positioned to take advantage of improved prospects for 1993 and 1994.' The total dividend for the year was 10.60p, a rise of 4.1 per cent. The company paid a second interim dividend of 7.54p a share last month in place of a final dividend. Earnings per share were 22.3p. BA shares closed in London 9.5p higher at 306.5p. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Government has adopted a cautious  stance concerning the news that the ousted president of Haiti,  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has apparently endorsed armed  intervention in his country.    This would be Aristide's solution for reinstatement as  president, from which post he was unseated in 1991 by a military  junta. The news was released today by an international news  agency. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated that the Brazilian  Government feels that the use of force would be an extreme  measure. Amorim believes this is a complex question, and one  first has to see whether the sanctions applied by the United  Nations against the Haitian military yield positive results. He  said:    [Begin Amorim recording] For the time being, the United  Nations, the UN Security Council -- the appropriate body to  apply coercive measures -- has renewed and stepped up sanctions  against the de facto Haitian Government. I think we have to  verify whether these more stringent sanctions are working.  Moreover, an armed intervention is a most complex question. It  is difficult... [pauses] We acknowledge the legitimate objective  of having President Aristide reinstated in office, and we have  supported this, but the use of force is something that always  inspires caution and needs to be examined with great care.

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / The old master of television shows his age: Alice Rawsthorn finds the French president looking increasingly like a man overtaken by history PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand is far too experienced a political player to be tricked into making the same diplomatic gaffe on television two nights in a row. When he returned last night to the theme of Europe's future in his second successive live question and answer session on French TV, he suggested that the UK government would find itself 'left on its own' for failing to sign the European Community's social chapter, rather than berating it for a 'lack of solidarity' as he did on Thursday. The 76-year-old president was rather less guarded in his comments on French domestic affairs. 'What's it got to do with me?' he snapped when quizzed about the re-opening of the Pechiney insider trading scandal. He then declared there had been 'no favouritism' in last Monday's deal whereby three state financial companies bought shares in Adidas, the German sportswear company, from Mr Bernard Tapie, the socialist minister of urban affairs. The TV appearances marked Mr Mitterrand's debut in the French parliamentary election campaign. The Socialist party, which he revived in 1971, has done so badly in the campaign that some polls predict it will not only be trounced by the conservatives in next month's elections, but beaten into third place by the ecologists. Mr Michel Rocard, former socialist prime minister, on Wednesday called for a 'political big bang' in which the left would abandon the Socialist party after the elections in favour of an alliance with ecologists and human rights activists. Mr Mitterrand has, in the past, been such a master of the television medium that he should have shrugged off such handicaps. His TV style is typically a brilliant blend of presidential gravitas, usually deployed when he wants to avoid answering tricky questions, peppered with colloquial references, which not only lend him a reassuringly avuncular air to the electorate, but enable him to flirt unashamedly with female interviewers. What the socialists needed was a repeat of his virtuoso performance in the three-hour TV debate before last autumn's Maastricht referendum. What they got was a president who looked worn, weary and even evaded a few questions. He stumbled over dates on Thursday and almost lost his temper last night. The tone of the questions was remittingly bleak. One unemployed man worried about his pension. A hospital worker deplored the 'dreadful deterioration' in medical standards. 'What will become of our Lorraine?' wailed one middle-aged woman. Another lamented the decline of the Ardeche. 'Our businesses are closing. Our farms are disappearing,' she said. 'That's demographics,' said President Mitterrand, looking increasingly like a man overtaken by history. Liberation, the centre-left newspaper, said in an editorial yesterday that he had seemed 'cut off' and that instead of delivering 'a big bang' like Mr Rocard, all the president could come up with was 'a black hole'.</p>

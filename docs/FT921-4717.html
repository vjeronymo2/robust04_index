			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Books: Low life on Broadway DAMON RUNYON: A LIFE by Jimmy Breslin Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 17.99, 410 pages IT IS a mixed blessing for a writer to have an -esque appended to his name. On the one hand, it is a sure ticket to immortality, an easy entry into general parlance. On the other, it tends to ensure a trivialisation of the work, an emphasis on certain superficial qualities at the expense of the core. This is surely the case with Damon Runyon. If someone refers to a robber who locks his keys in the getaway car as being Runyonesque, just about everybody gets the point. Yet who still reads Runyon's quirky short stories of the lovable lowlifes who inhabited Broadway during the Roaring Twenties? Jimmy Breslin's study of this remarkable writer does much to redress the imbalance, painting a vibrant portrait of a man equally representative of his times as more enduring writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald. Runyon was born in 1880 in Manhattan - Manhattan, Kansas, that is, a frontier backwater about as far from Broadway as you could get. His father was a drunken newspaperman who travelled with the US Army in the Indian Wars. Runyon was forced to look after himself after the early death of his mother, landing his first reporting job at the age of 12, covering hangings, fires and prizefights for a Colorado newspaper. By 18 he was sending back dispatches from the Philippine War, by 25 he was a well-respected journalist who had also published a few short stories. But it was not until he landed a sportswriting job with Hearst's New York American that he really hit his stride. While others were dutifully reporting scores and quoting managers, Runyon would trail the team drunk on his early morning exploits, earning him an entree into the Broadway netherworld that was to become his milieu for the next three decades. It was a career packed with astonishing incident. At one moment we see Runyon gaining an exclusive interview with Pancho Villa (in which he met the 12-year-old housegirl who was to become his second wife), the next has him trading jibes with Al Capone or Bugsy Seigel. In the one of the book's most remarkable episodes, Runyon is able to avenge himself on his wife's lover, a mediocre boxer, by using his journalistic pull to arrange a fight between the lover and an up-and-coming Joe Louis. Every night he would prowl Broadway, picking up bits and characters that he would later turn into countless short stories, many of which would subsequently be made into movies such as Little Miss Marker (which launched Shirley Temple), The Big Street and, posthumously, Guys and Dolls. As Breslin notes, 'the night gave Runyon material; he got it the only way you can, by hanging out with people for hours.' Breslin, New York's most famous living newspaperman, is a fitting biographer for Runyon, sharing with him both a love of the city's streetlife and a distrust for those in power. Here, he employs a breathless, anecdotal style that proves a far more apt mirror to Runyon's life than the more sober tones of a conventional scholar. His description of a dank newsroom is more useful than a hundred old photos: 'Yellow flypaper strung from the ceiling, leaving those searching for a word with dead flies for inspiration.' Breslin also possesses a wonderful sense of irony about the workings of New York itself, a city founded on larceny both grand and petty that manages nonetheless to maintain its charm and scruffy humanity. A Runyonesque city, that is. Breslin never romanticises his subject, however. From the moment we see our pre-teen hero sitting hand-in-hand with a whore to watch a lynch victim swing in the evening breeze, Runyon comes across as a cold fish indeed, a merciless observer who neglected wife and children, a ruthlessly ambitious writer whose steely blue eyes took everything in while giving precious little away. Perhaps it was for the better, though. After all, not many men could hang out with Al Capone and live to write about it.</p>

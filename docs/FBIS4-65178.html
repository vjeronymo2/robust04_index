			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In March, the money supply, M-3,  increased by 4.9 percent over the fourth quarter of 1993. This  leads to an extrapolated annual rate of 15.4 percent. With this  final figure, the Bundesbank on Tuesday [10 May] slightly  modified the figures it had originally predicted. The original  annual rate indicated for March had been 15.2 percent.    The M-3 money supply contains the circulation of notes and  coins, cash deposits, time deposits under four years, as well as  savings deposits. There was an extremely large increase in the  stock of money due to special factors at the beginning of this  year. This "basic effect" influences monthly figures. For  1994, the Bundesbank is aiming at a money supply growth rate of  4 to 6 percent.</p>

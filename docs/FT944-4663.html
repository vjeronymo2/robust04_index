			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: US performance helps lift Ransomes to Pounds 6m The turnround at Ransomes, the manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment and specialist industrial trucks, continued yesterday with the announcement that it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.11m in the nine months to September 30. The profits were the result of cost reductions and an improved performance in the US and came after Ransomes made a loss of Pounds 8.93m in the year ended December 31. The group has changed its reporting period to reflect the seasonality of its business. Turnover for the nine-month period was Pounds 132m (Pounds 166m) and earnings per share was 1p against a loss of 25.9p. Operating profit increased from Pounds 2.38m to Pounds 14.4m. However, operating profit for the three months to September, the slowest period of the year, was Pounds 1.87m, less than the interest charge of Pounds 2.46m. There is no ordinary dividend and the company is still one payment in arrears on the dividends from its preference shares. Net debt fell to Pounds 72.8m (Pounds 75.3m) giving the group gearing of 509 per cent. Mr John Clement, chairman, said: 'If we can maintain a period of stability, we can then set about restructuring the balance sheet.' The group made a profit of Pounds 690,000 on property sales, which are being used to lower debt levels. In November itex changed contracts with Sears Property Developments for the Pounds 8.55m sale of part of the Europark sight. Sales in North America improved to Pounds 64m (Pounds 72m), reflecting strong demand for Cushman trucks and operating profits from the commercial division advanced to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 4.38m). The consumer division recorded profits of Pounds 2.19m (Pounds 3.80m) because of poor market conditions and a movement towards the group's lower margin products. The group hopes to make savings of Dollars 1m a year from the new banking arrangements it has agreed with Barclays and NatWest.</p>

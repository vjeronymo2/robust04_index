			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Bonds: New paper adds to Ecu market's disappointment THE Ecu bond market, which has performed disappointingly for most of this year, is facing an overhang of paper after further supply of new issues yesterday was added to Denmark's Ecu1bn 10-year domestic offering launched on Wednesday. Dealers reported some selling of the Danish deal yesterday, which had not been fully placed. The price fell to 98.93, below the fixed reoffer level of 99.27, after the syndicate was broken. The decline was roughly in line with the rest of the market, although the spread widened a little from six to seven basis points above the 10-year French government OAT issue. Some dealers felt that the performance was disappointing, considering the long build-up to the transaction, while others said that the deal had done as well as could be expected, given lacklustre market conditions. Yesterday, two French borrowers added to the existing supply of five-year paper. Supply has been concentrated at the five-year area of the yield curve due to an improvement in swap spreads at that maturity as a result of an issue of CTE's - Italian domestic Ecu bonds - by the Italian government. Credit Local de France launched an Ecu225m deal, which will be added to an existing Ecu500m offering, while Caisse Centrale de Co-operation Economique (CCCE) brought an Ecu200m offering. The Credit Local deal was swapped into floating rate dollars, while the CCCE deal was swapped into a mixture of fixed- and floating-rate French francs and Ecu. Both deals were considered fairly priced, to yield 8.74 per cent and 8.67 per cent respectively, but are likely to take some time to place due to poor market conditions and poor investor demand. The Credit Local deal is expected to appeal to mainly institutional investors who prefer large transactions, while CCCE borrows infrequently, so its triple-A rating has some added rarity value. However, the deal is not likely to be very actively traded once it is placed. Also in the Ecu market, Bank of Greece launched an Ecu200m offering of floating-rate notes, Greece's first such issue, although the central bank has previously issued fixed-rate Ecu in the international markets, and has a domestic programme of both fixed- and floating-rate debt. In the Australian dollar sector, State Bank of New South Wales launched a ADollars 100m seven-year deal via Deutsche Bank, while General Electric Capital Australia launched a smaller ADollars 75m deal due 1997 via Hambros Bank. Although there is a fairly heavy level of maturing debt in the sector this year - with ADollars 1.5bn of Eurobonds redeemed this month - dealers report a disappointing level of reinvestment by investors. However, some fresh funds are going into the market.</p>

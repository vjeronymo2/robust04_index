			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Technology: Spotlight on flash memory With the launch today of a new generation of 'flash memory' chip products, Intel, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, has delivered the first serious challenge to the role of the magnetic disc drive as the standard data storage medium for personal computers. Flash memory retains stored information even when the power is turned off. It can be rapidly erased and rewritten, hence the name 'flash'. After five years of development efforts, Intel has come up with a flash chip that rivals the data storage capacity of a computer 'hard drive' at a comparable cost. The new 8 Mbit flash memory chip quadruples the data storage capacity of flash memory chips introduced just 16 months ago. Twenty of the chips, packaged in a 'memory card' not much bigger than a credit card, provide a 20 Mbyte storage device that is much smaller, lighter, more rugged and faster than a disc drive. The flash memory card also consumes far less power, thus promising to extend the battery life of portable computers. The 20 Mbyte card will sell for Dollars 600, less than half the introductory price of Intel's 4 Mbyte flash card in 1990. In conjunction with the Intel announcement, Microsoft, the leading personal computer software company, will announce an extension to its Dos operating system to work with the new memory cards. Intel expects to sell 500,000 to 700,000 of the 8 M bit flash memory chips this year and claims to have more than 20 customers lined up, including some of the largest US and Japanese portable personal computer manufacturers. The market for flash memory chips is projected to grow from approximately Dollars 130m today to nearly Dollars 1.5bn by 1995, according to Dataquest, the US market researchers. Intel currently holds an estimated 85 per cent share of the flash memory market. Products incorporating the new flash memory cards, ranging from hand-held 'pen computers' costing less than Dollars 1,000, to lightweight two-pound notebook computers priced at around Dollars 1,500, are expected from several computer manufacturers later this year.</p>

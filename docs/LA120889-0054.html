			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGES MAY ORDER COUNTY TO PROVIDE MORE COURT SPACE  </P> <P> Superior Court judges, pressing for new courtrooms in downtown San Diego, may  be forced to order county supervisors to provide them with more space,  Presiding Judge Michael I. Greer said Thursday.  </P> <P> On Monday, the court's 12-member executive committee will meet to take up  Greer's recommendation that the court proceed under a little-known state law  allowing judges to order a county board to provide "suitable rooms" and court  equipment, Greer said.  </P> <P> The cost of providing those facilities must be borne by the county general  fund, the law says.  </P> <P> "This thing's never been dealt with before," Greer said. "We may unfortunately  be out in front in San Diego County."  </P> <P> If the committee approves the idea, it would then be put to the entire  69-member Superior Court bench for a vote, likely within a week, Greer said. If  a majority of the full court also approves, the judges would form an advisory  committee and hire a lawyer to more fully research the state law giving them  the authority to order court facilities.  </P> <P> San Diego judges have known about the law for some time, but Monday's meeting  will mark the first time the court has formally considered invoking it, Greer  said.  </P> <P> "We've had the trump card for a long time," Greer said. "We've never, ever  played that trump card, and I hope we don't have to play it now. But we're in a  crisis."  </P> <P> Greer's concern centers on nine new courtrooms planned for downtown.  </P> <P> The county staff has recommended that the nine be placed at the former El  Cortez Hotel Convention Center, at Beech Street and 8th Avenue.  </P> <P> The city of San Diego has agreed to put up $3 million in redevelopment funds  for courtroom construction, and earlier this week the City Council voted to  recommend that the courtrooms be placed in the former Walker-Scott department  store at 5th Avenue and Broadway. Rehabilitation of that site would do more to  further overall downtown revitalization, the staff of the Centre City  Development Corp. contends.  </P> <P> The city declined to release the $3 million to the county, pending next  Tuesday's county supervisors' meeting, at which the board may discuss the two  sites.  </P> <P> The failure to release the money turned courtroom planning into an "emergency  situation," prompting consideration of the state law, Greer said.  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / MPs vote to reform shop laws The Commons last night voted by 311 to 26, a majority of 285, to reform Britain's antiquated and widely ignored Sunday shopping laws. The vote, on the second reading of the Sunday Trading bill, was hailed as a historic breakthrough by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, a key retail pressure group. The council, which represents mainly large stores, said the vote was 'a clear indication that when it comes to choosing between the three options for change, MPs will again do what shoppers and shopworkers alike are demanding'. The future of Sunday shopping was left wide open, however, by the announcement of complex procedural arrangements for the passage of the bill through the House. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, opening the debate, confirmed that Conservative MPs would have a free vote on three options for de-regulation: Full de-regulation, supported by Mr Howard, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and some other ministers. Limited opening for small shops, DIY shops and centres, with unrestricted opening on four Sundays before Christmas - supported by the Keep Sunday Special campaign and the Retailers for Shops Act Reform pressure group of smaller shops. Unrestricted trading hours for small shops, with a six-hour limit on larger stores - supported by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, mainly representing chain stores. The Commons will choose one of the options during the line-by-line committee stage debate, which will be taken on the floor of the House to give all MPs a chance to vote. The procedure adopted by the government will require MPs to vote in sequence on three groups of amendments to the bill, each of which would implement one of the options. This means that the first option to gain a majority of votes will be chosen even if a greater number of MPs supports an alternative option which has not been voted on. Mr Howard said: 'It is not a question of which option gets the biggest vote. Conceivably, only one option will be voted on if that secures a majority.' The procedural mechanism means that the choice of option could, in practice, rest with Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, who will determine the order in which amendments are debated. Mr Howard said the government would adopt a neutral approach to the options to encourage parliament to end the 'muddle' which has developed over Sunday trading since the defeat of the last attempt at reform in 1986. 'The government's aims are straightforward,' he said. 'We want parliament to choose one of these options. We want that option, whatever it is, to work in practice and command the respect throughout the country which the current regime sadly lacks.' The government has resisted Labour pressure for a free vote for Tory MPs on the employment protection provisions of the bill, which will apply to whichever option is chosen. Employment rights are expected to emerge as a key issue during the passage of the bill, in spite of government assurances that shopworkers' rights to refuse to work on Sundays will be protected. The government has refused to accept calls from Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, for compulsory premium payments for Sunday working. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said reform was urgent because the law had been widely ignored.</p>

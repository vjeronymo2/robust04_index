			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Azlan shares fall 10% on warning Shares in Azlan Group, a distributor of advanced computer networking products, fell 10 per cent yesterday following a warning that profits in the first half of the current year would not match those of last year. The shares were marked down from 280p to 252p despite results for the year to March 31 which saw sales rise 49 per cent, from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds 61.5m, and pre-tax profits grow from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 3.87m. Earnings per share came to 12.4p (8.4p). The group, which came to the main market last November at 230p, plans to pay a final dividend of 2p - as indicated at the time of the flotation. Mr David Randall, managing director, said the results were achieved by continued growth in the UK and improved performances in Germany and Denmark. He said profitability in the first half of the current year would be reduced because of a change in buying patterns among customers. They were moving from repair and maintenance of existing equipment to the purchase of new systems. This required a longer buying cycle. Orders and prospective orders were at an all-time high, Mr Randall stated. Azlan had, furthermore, decided to introduce new and more complex products and phase out older technologies: 'This strategy, while limiting UK sales growth in the short term, is enabling us to maintain product gross margin percentages while phasing in a series of new products', he said. Mr Randall added that the majority of the year's profits would be made in the second half.</p>

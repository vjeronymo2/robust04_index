			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / People: Cheung seeks further Fortune Barry Cheung - the new man at the helm of Fortune Oil, the London-listed oil company that has just completed its first joint venture in China - may be worth watching. He peppers his conversation with jargon about strategic perspective and streamlining Fortune's board: words to gratify a management school (he has a Harvard MBA and is an ex-McKinsey consultant), but which conceal a nuts-and-bolts attitude and solid understanding of running a company spanning two countries and cultures. Cheung, 36, was born in Hong Kong to which his parents had emigrated from the northern Chinese provinces of Hubei and Shandong, and educated at Sussex University. He spent many years living in the UK and Los Angeles and carries a US passport. However, he recently made his first ever trip to Beijing - and says it felt like going home. A former member of the Central Policy Unit, a Hong Kong government think-tank, Cheung nevertheless reels off a string of criticisms of the colony's government. He questions an educational system that produces students proficient in neither English nor Cantonese, and says Hong Kong's disputed port extension may turn out to be a white elephant. But his commitment to local culture appears rock solid. His children attend Chinese schools, rather than the international institutions favoured by expatriates and Chinese who have lived overseas. Less than a month after Cheung took over as chief executive, Fortune has just completed a Dollars 25m single point mooring oil terminal in Maoming which will enable the local oil refinery to increase its capacity substantially. It is the company's first joint venture in the world's third largest economy and Cheung is confident that it is just the first of many.</p>

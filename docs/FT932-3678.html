			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Watchdogs under fire THE NATIONAL Consumer Council this week published a report highlighting shortcomings in two ombudsmen schemes designed to help consumers resolve disputes without resorting to legal action. The report was based on a sample of nearly 1,000 consumers who had used the insurance ombudsman bureau and the office of the building societies' ombudsman. About half questioned the independence of the schemes, although their opinion was influenced largely by whether they had won their cases. Some 70 per cent of those who lost under the building societies scheme believed it was unfair but 81 per cent of those who won disagreed. Nevertheless, between 28-31 per cent of those who lost under both schemes still thought them fair. About 43 per cent of those complaining to the building societies' office found it took an 'unreasonably long time to make a decision' and 20 per cent of those using the insurance ombudsman agreed. Complainants must go through the internal complaints system of the building society or insurance company before approaching the ombudsmen but half those surveyed said they found this 'a complete waste of time.' The average time taken for disputes to be settled - including that taken by internal complaints procedures - was 52 weeks in the case of the insurance ombudsman and 91 weeks for the building societies' arbiter. The NCC suggests the ombudsmen should be given greater powers to speed up and set minimum standards for the internal complaints procedures of member companies. It also recommends establishing an independent organisation to oversee all ombudsman schemes. In general, though, those surveyed thought the schemes were approachable and cheap.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Alan Schwindt, 20, a pitcher for the University of San Diego baseball team, was  in serious condition at Sharp Memorial Hospital following an accident during a  pickup baseball game last Saturday.  </P> <P> According John Cunningham, USD's baseball coach, Schwindt underwent emergency  surgery Saturday to reduce a blood clot near his brain after he was hit in the  head by a line drive. He was upgraded from critical to serious condition  Thursday.  </P> <P> "It's still too early to tell," Cunningham said. "He's tried to open his eyes a  couple of times, but they're keeping him sedated. They're trying to keep his  brain activity down until they reduce the swelling."  </P> <P> Schwindt, a junior from Rancho Palos Verdes' Chadwick High School, was pitching  in the pickup game at USD when a line drive struck him behind his right eye.  Witnesses said Schwindt was conscious for about a minute before passing out.  </P></p>

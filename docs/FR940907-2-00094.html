NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74, which authorizes operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 (Palo Verde), respectively. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The Palo Verde facilities consist of three pressurized reactors located in Maricopa County, 50 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) of &sect;73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) states, in part, that ``the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (1) of &sect;73.55(d), ``Access Requirement,'' specifies that ``The licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Section 73.55(d)(5) requires that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' Section 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area .&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badge with them when departing the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated April 29, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are (1) authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and (2) are otherwise in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

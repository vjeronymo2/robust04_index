			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Heinrich Hemker under the rubric "Technology </F> Journal": "BRITE-EURAM Project in the Wind Tunnel. Integration  Problem for Super Jumbo Engines"; first paragraph is an  introduction]    [Text] The fan's diameter can be increased in order to  lower the fuel consumption of today's turbofan engines. However,  it will be ever more difficult to integrate the larger engines  into the aircraft. Now this problem has been studied in the wind  tunnel.    Today's passenger airplanes are propelled by turbofan  engines. Unlike jet engines that work with just one region--the  combustion region, in such a two-region engine an additional  turbine drives a fan. This has exclusively the task of  accelerating ambient air to the rear and thus of providing  additional thrust. Therefore, the bypass ratio (BPR) is an  important characteristic for rating these engines. It gives the  ratio of the air mass flow rate in the outside fan region to the  air mass flow rate of the inside hot region. The engines used  today work for the most part with a bypass ratio of between four  and six.    The principle of conservation of momentum of physics is used  in order to calculate an engine's thrust. As applied to a  turbofan, it means: The thrust is equal to the moving air mass  flow rate times the change in velocity between the inlet and  outlet planes of the engine. From this one can construe that  increasing the air mass flow rate makes it possible to reduce  the velocity difference with the same thrust. This has the  direct result that the requisite fuel consumption and  accordingly the emission of pollutants too are reduced  substantially. A reduction in consumption of 10 to 15 percent is  achievable in practice. Thus, in increasing the air mass flow  rate in turbofan engines there is considerable potential for  building more environmentally compatible engines.    If this principle is embodied, one arrives at so-called  very-high or, as the case may be, ultrahigh bypass (UHB)  engines. But a higher bypass ratio also means that the engine's  outside diameter increases as compared with that of today's  turbofans. This is their disadvantage. Because of the larger  dimensions, the problem of the interaction of the airframe and  engine becomes still more important, because the aerodynamic  interference brought about grows strongly in significance. On  that account, in order for the possible consumption advantages  not to be reduced because of the increasing drag of the overall  configuration of the airplane, it is necessary to provide, at  the preliminary stage of the development of new aircraft--super  jumbos, for example--the theoretical and experimental tools for  dealing with the integration problem.    The "Ducted Propfan Investigation" (DUPRIN) assignment has  been taken up as part of the European Community's BRITE/EURAM  subsidy program, in view of the importance of this problem.  Under the lead management of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, 14  European partners from industry, research and higher education  are working on supporting, through research on the integration  problem, the development of engines having a higher bypass  ratio. The DUPRIN team has managed a first step via wind tunnel  measurements in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW). Important  results for the UHB-engine integration problem have been able to  be obtained by the first successful employment of UHB simulators  with a contrarotating fan. Measurements in the same wind tunnel  model with conventional turbofan simulators had already preceded  these studies. The wind tunnel model and simulators were made  true to scale.    According to Heinz Hoheisel of DLR [German Research  Institute  for Aerospace] in Braunschweig, the development of the UHB  simulators was a particular problem. A compressed-air-driven  four-stage turbine having an output of 162 kW drives via a  reversing gear an eight-blade contrarotating fan having a  diameter of 254 millimeters. The prototype of the new engine  simulator, designated CRUF, is based on the MTU-CRISP [Motoren-  und Turbinen-Union GmbH [Engine and Turbine Union Limited  Liability Company] Counter Rotating Integrated Shrouded Propfan]  design and was developed by DLR in Braunschweig together with  Dynamic Engineering, Inc. of Virginia, USA. A second simulator  was developed and built by the Technofan company in Toulouse,  France, on the same basis within the framework of the DUPRIN  assignment.  <H5>  Encouraging Test Results </H5>   In contrast to conventional turbofan engines, whose optimal  position on a passenger aircraft's wing is known, an expectedly  favorable position has to be found first for the new engine  design. The capabilities of computer simulation, for one thing,  are helpful for this. The flow pattern around the wing and  engine can be assessed by means of its evidence. The drag  behavior is of quite special importance in the integration  problem for new engines having an increased bypass ratio,  because the installation drag must not be greater than for  conventional turbofans. The first measurements for the complete  model were made for this purpose in the German-Dutch Wind  Tunnel. The important aerodynamic forces--lift and drag--were  determined by means of a new weighing machine incorporated into  the wind tunnel model. In addition, pressure measurements were  made at a total of about 800 pressure points on the surfaces of  the fuselage, wing and engine cowling, in order to be able to  assess more precisely the flow behavior. This measuring  equipment had to be accommodated in the wind tunnel model, in  addition to the air, oil and coolant supplies for the engine  simulators.    The test results gotten in the measurement rounds have  encouraged the researchers. Additional assignments, designated  in the DUPRIN program, on the integration problem for UHB  engines are to begin now in the near future.</p>

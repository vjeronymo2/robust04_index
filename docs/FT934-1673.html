			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: High hopes of low rates It is a case of another day, another record for the UK equity market. Yesterday's 32 point rise seems to reflect a growing conviction that more interest rate cuts are on the way. Since average earnings are still growing by only 3 per cent, the government has little to fear from wage pressure, while Wednesday's retail prices data show inflation is well under control. On the surface, a 36,000 drop in seasonally-adjusted unemployment makes it look as though there is some growth about as well. Yet other indicators are not quite so auspicious. Manufacturing output shrank by 0.2 per cent in the last three months; employment in manufacturing actually fell by 10,000 in October. Nor do yesterday's figures for notes and coins in circulation suggest a bumper Christmas in the shops. So the equity market must be driven above all by interest rate expectations. That is also reflected in the vulnerability of particular sectors to specific worries - such as life insurers yesterday on pensions - which draws attention to how stretched individual valuations often are. The money markets do not expect another base rate cut immediately. But the equity market can afford to wait until the new year, especially since the perception is now growing that the next half-point cut may not be the last. The worrying thought is what will happen when the interest trough is reached and next year's tax increases start to bite. While low wage growth justifies lower interest rates, it also means real disposable incomes could well fall. Growth would then depend on consumers borrowing more. If not, equities could be high and dry, especially if higher US bond yields have staunched the international flow of funds.</p>

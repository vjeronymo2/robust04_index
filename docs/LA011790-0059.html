			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 90-day construction moratorium for more than 3,100 acres around Brown Field  was tentatively approved Tuesday by the San Diego City Council in an effort to  preserve the city-owned general aviation airstrip for possible expansion into a  major airport.  </P> <P> If it receives final approval, the moratorium proposed by Councilman Ron  Roberts will delay development while the San Diego Assn. of Governments  determines whether the Otay Mesa airstrip can be expanded to relieve Lindbergh  Field of some commercial airline traffic.  </P> <P> Sandag is reviewing a private consultant's report that indicates that two  southwest to northeast runways could be built on Brown Field, allowing a  possible "multiple airport solution" to the longstanding and worsening problem  of crowding at Lindbergh, the region's only major airport. The Sandag response  is due within 30 days.  </P> <P> Accordingly, land situated roughly in a swath where the two parallel runways  would be put was included in the building moratorium. However, 240 acres of  subdivisions where industrial projects are close to breaking ground were  exempted from Roberts' original ban, which covered about 3,400 acres.  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Fleet buying boosts car sales by 8.2% NEW-CAR sales for October rose 8.2 per cent over the same month last year, helped by a big jump in fleet sales. Registrations of new commercial vehicles also rose year-on-year by 5.3 per cent to 15,465, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Sales to retail car buyers remained weak, however, with an increase year-on-year of only 0.5 per cent. Ford, the UK market leader, said it had 'no optimism that the October sales figures are indicating a new trend'. Yesterday Vauxhall said it would raise prices of its 1993 models by an average of 3.25 per cent from midnight on November 29. The company said this would 'not reflect the full extent of the additional cost burden'. In spite of the continuing weakness of the market and widespread discounting, Vauxhall's actions could spark a round of car-price increases as manufacturers seek at least partial compensation for the devaluation of the pound. Ford last month raised the prices of its Sierra and Granada ranges, which are imported from Belgium and Germany, by 2 per cent. It also cut the prices of some of its UK-built Escort and Fiesta models. Ford said last month's increase in new-car demand came from the fleet sector (companies operating 25 or more cars), where registrations jumped 18.8 per cent to 49,200. The increase last month should be treated cautiously, as sales in October last year were weak with a year-on-year decline of 22.5 per cent. The increase in October car registrations was the second-biggest monthly rise this year after April's 9.1 per cent increase, bolstered when the Budget halved the special car tax. New-car sales tipped 1.4m in the first 10 months of the year, 1.9 per cent lower than a year ago. Sales of new commercial vehicles, at 173,111, were still 5.9 per cent lower than in the corresponding period last year. Vauxhall, Volkswagen and Nissan made the biggest gains among the leading carmakers in the UK market last month, while Ford suffered a further erosion of market share. Most leading car importers have been studying how best to raise prices after the pound's devaluation. They have delayed only because of the depressed state of the market. Several German and French producers have already raised prices in Italy following devaluation of the lira. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are expected to impose increases of up to 6 per cent, and Volkswagen has been considering an increase of around 5 per cent. Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB), said the company expected its dealers to 'share the pain' in minimising the increase through reduced profit margins. BMW has produced statistics claiming that UK prices 'of almost every BMW' are lower than in any other European country except Denmark. Only Rover said there would be no price rises this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              UK CAR REGISTRATIONS - JANUARY-OCTOBER 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               October 1992                Oct' 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Volume       Change%      Share%      Share%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market       109,373         +8.2       100.0       100.0 UK produced         49,368        +16.1        45.1        42.1 Imports             60,005         +2.4        54.9        57.9 Japanese makes      13,840        +10.9        12.7        12.3 Ford group          23,687         +2.9        21.7        22.8  -Ford              23,134         +2.2        21.2        22.4  -Jaguar               553        +45.9         0.5         0.4 General Motors      21,351        +29.3        19.5        16.4  -Vauxhall          20,684        +29.9        18.9        15.8  -

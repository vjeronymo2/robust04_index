			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of an interview with Prime Minister Dr. </F> 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali by Ahmad al-Hisban "published today in  AL-DUSTUR and the Lebanese magazine AL-USBU' AL-'ARABI;" place  and date not given]    [Text] [Al-Hisban] Let us begin with the most important  issue in the arena; namely, the relationship between Jordan and  the self-rule authority. What is the Jordanian concept of this  relationship?    [Al-Majali] First, we must reiterate the existence of a  special and distinguished relationship between Jordan and the  Palestinian brothers for many old, present, and future reasons.  We support the PLO, the sole and legitimate representative of  the Palestinian people, and do not interfere in its internal  affairs. We also hope it will not interfere in our internal  affairs.    We will deal with it the same way we deal with a friend,  dear  neighbor, and honorable brother. Therefore, we wish it all  success. We believe that it has achieved an advanced step, and  hope it will succeed in achieving other steps. We also hope the  Palestinian people will achieve their genuine right to  self-determination.    We also believe that once the Palestinian people have  achieved this right, they will freely call for establishing a  special kind of relationship with Jordan. Things will then be  addressed in an appropriate way.    [Al-Hisban] A new reality has been established on the  popular  level. There are Palestinians and there are Jordanians. Who is  the Jordanian and who is the Palestinian in light of this new  reality?    [Al-Majali] The people who carry Jordanian citizenship and  believe in the Jordanian system and state are Jordanians. This  is our Constitution and this is justice. There is no difference  between a person from a Palestinian or non-Palestinian origin.  The important thing is that the one who carries Jordanian  citizenship and believes in the country is considered a  Jordanian.    [Al-Hisban] Will those who carry the five-year passports be  given the freedom to make their choice?    [Al-Majali] Of course. They are Jordanians, and no force on  earth can tell them otherwise. However, those people have the  right to choose another citizenship.    We all know that the rights that were given to the refugees  who came to Jordan were in fact a trust to enable them regain  their rights and lands.    [Al-Hisban] What about those who carry two-year temporary  passports?    [Al-Majali] As you know, these are temporary passports that  were issued to serve the Palestinian brothers who were living in  the West Bank at a certain time or the West Bankers who were  living outside the West Bank. Those people were issued these  passports to facilitate their work and make life easier for  them. Regarding those people, if the PLO or the Palestinian  authority decide to issue passports I believe they will be  issued passports and their issue will be resolved.    [Al-Hisban] In light of the recent bridge measures, the  Jordanian interior minister said that the danger of displacement  has ended. Do you believe that this danger has really ended?    [Al-Majali] I believe so, particularly since the situation  inside the occupied territory has become different. The  displacement is either by force or voluntarily. Now that a  Palestinian entity has been established, the brothers who will  be living in this entity will not be subject to the pressures to  which they were exposed in the past. Furthermore, the occupied  territory should enjoy a very good economic situation. So, why  would they emigrate?    I believe that all causes of emigration will end. So, why  should we fear its continuation? The measures that were taken  came in light of the change that took place on the ground.  These measures aim at facilitating the movement of our brother  from one side to another.    [Al-Hisban] Concerning the issue of displacement, the  Lebanese proposed a plan to solve the problem of Palestinian  refugees in Lebanon. I believe this plan is based on settling  20 percent [in Lebanon], returning 20 percent [to the occupied  territory], and displacing 60 percent. It has also been  reported that a percentage of those displaced will be settled in  Jordan.    [Al-Majali] I have never heard of such a thing. If there are  proposals to this effect, I do not believe it is a matter of 20  percent or any other percentage.    The issue of refugees must be resolved within an  international framework. Jordan is the country that hosts the  largest number of refugees. So, is it reasonable to increase  their number here, particularly since Jordan's resources are  limited? This is not logical. We cannot speak about this  before deciding the issue of refugees within the multilateral  and bilateral talks.    [Al-Hisban] Has Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber  of Deputies, presented any ideas in this regard?    [Al-Majali] Not at all. He has proposed nothing, because  there is nothing between Jordan and Lebanon with regard to the  issue of refugees. The press, however, is fabricating stories  on this issue. This is a Lebanese and Palestinian matter.  Jordan has nothing to do with it.    [Al-Hisban] It has been reported that the  Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement has been obstructed  because of some points in it. Do you believe this is caused by  the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement?    [Al-Majali] Those points were addressed following the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. There was an agreement on most  of the points, in fact, on all of them. Following the  agreement, the Palestinian side asked for more time to discuss  two points and then to respond to them. We hope this will take  place as soon as possible.    [Al-Hisban] So far, how do you appraise what has been  reached  with the Palestinian side?    [Al-Majali] What has been achieved is good, responsible, and  promising. We must realize that the brothers do not have full  freedom to act in the economic arena. This is a transitional,  not a final, phase. In the final phase, we will talk with the  Palestinian brothers on different issues. We will hold talks  with the Palestinian brothers and the Israelis on the economic  issues that concern the three parties. We should wait to see  what will happen in the future.    [Al-Hisban] Regarding inter-Arab relations, you proposed a  rescheduling of Arab differences. What is new in this regard?    [Al-Majali] We hope for this. It would be better if we could  put our differences aside and cooperate to end the bloodshed in  Yemen. Is this issue not worth an Arab meeting? Therefore, I  reiterate that the only way is to reschedule our differences.  We do not deny the existence of differences, however, the  present time is not a suitable one to talk about them. We can  say that there are no differences over 99 percent of the issues.  So, why do we not stick to these points and close ranks to face  the current challenges in the region?    I believe that the best thing is to agree that there are  differences, but the solution should come after three to four  years. Meanwhile, we should continue cooperation.    [Al-Hisban] Some analyses indicate that Jordan has been  somewhat isolated due to many intransigent positions toward it?    [Al-Majali] It is rather the opposite. Except for two  brothers with whom some estrangement still exists, all other  Arab states are enjoying a good deal of amity. These two  brothers believe that differences should be resolved now. We  are ready for this but the circumstances are not opportune, and  we can postpone discussing our differences and document what has  been agreed.    [Al-Hisban] What about the siege of al-'Aqabah?    [Al-Majali] It is almost over, and is in its final stages.    [Al-Hisban] It is said, however, that there are differences  over who will pay the costs?    [Al-Majali] The costs will be paid by the parties concerned,  and there is a special fund to compensate for all repercussions  of the Gulf war. Cash, however, is not available, so Jordan is  entitled to retrieve the costs it may have paid.    [Al-Hisban] It was said that bilateral negotiations will  resume at the end of April. We are now at the end of May, and  they have not yet resumed?    [Al-Majali] As you know, the negotiations were suspended due  to the Hebron events, after which a Palestinian-Israeli  agreement was signed. There are now attempts to activate the  Syrian track in one way or another through U.S. mediation. If  we are invited once the simple points with the brothers in Syria  are resolved, we will proceed forward.    [Al-Hisban] There are rumors about a reshuffle in your  cabinet?    [Al-Majali] Each cabinet reconsiders its formation and tries  to renew itself. This is a routine matter. At this time,  however, there is no reshuffle.    [Al-Hisban] The [Government's] relationship with the House  of Representatives saw some tension at first. Afterward, it  became stable, but, apparently, some tension has surfaced again?    [Al-Majali] There is no tension between us and the deputies.  Naturally, the House of Representatives is a new house and most  of it consists of friends who have their own attitudes.  However, they are, in one way or another, unfamiliar with the  issue of representation. Thus, it is natural for such things to  happen in the first round of sessions. However, with the  passage of time, everyone would be convinced that all are  working for the public interest. Convergence is the predominant  feature. But if we search for differences and conflicts, we can  find them. Likewise, if we search for convergence, we can find  it.    In fact, there was no conflict. There is another viewpoint,  and this usually happens. We do not expect the deputies to  accept everything the Government submits. If they do so, the  House would no longer be necessary.    [Al-Hisban] Your cabinet raised the idea of a separation  among the branches of authority. Is this principle still valid?    [Al-Majali] I believe this is a principle. His Majesty King  Husayn has frequently referred to it. Separation of powers is a  basic issue, so no branch will encroach on another in any way  whatsoever. This, however, does not at all mean that a deputy  is prohibited from being a minister. There is no decision that  this matter is absolutely banned.    [Al-Hisban] King Husayn has criticized the Jordanian media,  however, no radical changes have thus far happened.    [Al-Majali] Do the ones who demand a radical change believe  that such a change should be made in the people or in the  policies?    [Al-Hisban] I believe the change should be made in policies.    [Al-Majali] The policy exists and it is clear but those who  carry it out are human beings and sometimes make mistakes. We  want the highest level of performance, but our potential is  limited.    [Al-Hisban] Let us return to the issue of negotiations. Is  there any comprehensive solution to what is taking place in the  arena?    [Al-Majali] Every one talks about and believes in a  comprehensive solution, but also agrees that progress differs  from one track to another because each track has its own  circumstances. The Palestinian track has only managed to secure  a document covering the first period. In other words, the  Palestinian track began late, at a point from where we started  two years ago. Can we say that it moved alone? The answer is  no, because its problems and issues are different. In light of  the agenda, we could have made rapid progress, but when we felt  that other sides slowed down their moves, we stopped for a  while. The same applies to the Syrian and Lebanese brothers.    Coordination exists, and we all believe in the comprehensive  solution. There are no unilateral moves, and we are  coordinating with each other because it is in the interest of  everybody to reach a comprehensive solution.    [Al-Hisban] Following the recent measures on the bridges and  the recent visits to Jordan by several delegations, several  semi-official Palestinian statements indicated that Jordan was  clearing the way to retreat from its disengagement decision in  one way or another.    [Al-Majali] The disengagement took place, the entity has  been  established, and retreat from disengagement is not considered at  all. Whether we want it or not, the issue is out of the  question. The entity has been established, the Palestinian  police have entered, and an agreement was signed with Israel.  Despite all this, some people say Jordan wants to retreat from  its disengagement decision. Of course, those who do not like  Jordanian-Palestinian detente and those who want to fish in  murky water and create problems are spreading such ideas. But  Jordan does all it can for the Palestinian brothers. Regarding  the delegations, you know that His Majesty King Husayn was  distressed by the tragic loss of the Queen Mother, and these  delegations came just to extend their condolences. How can we  explain feelings in light of politics?    [Al-Hisban] You promised to increase salaries after the  endorsement of the sales tax law. The law has been endorsed.  Is there any plan for such an increase?    [Al-Majali] We wanted to reach a radical solution to the  conditions of government employees, but this needs enough money,  which is not available. However, there will be a solution that  will improve their conditions, but not a radical one.    [Al-Hisban] One year after the formation of your government,  what are your major accomplishments in which you can take pride?    [Al-Majali] I cannot talk about my accomplishments and those  of may government. Everybody believes his accomplishments to be  the best. It is you who should talk about what you see.</p>

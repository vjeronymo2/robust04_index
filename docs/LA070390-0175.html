			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GLASNOST FOOTBALL TAKES A DRUBBING, TO SAY THE LEAST  </P> <P> It started looking bad for the first Soviet football team to play on American  soil when the players heard the Turkish national anthem played in their honor.  </P> <P> It went downhill from there.  </P> <P> The year-old Tacoma Express, a Minor League Football System team, whipped the  Soviet national champion Moscow Bears 61-0 Monday night in an exhibition game  before 1,303 spectators in the Tacoma Dome.  </P> <P> The game was billed by promoters as "Glasnost on the Gridiron."  </P> <P> Bears Coach John Ralston, a former Denver Broncos head coach, didn't talk game  strategy or give his players a fiery pregame pep talk. He was busy explaining  how to suit up in full pads.  </P> <P> "Don't forget, you need your thigh pads, your knee pads and your elbow pads,"  he said through an interpreter. "You don't want to land on that AstroTurf  without your elbow pads."  </P> <P> For the past eight weeks, Ralston has been trying to mold a group of Soviet  rugby players, shot-putters, javelin throwers and decathletes into a  professional football team. He knows after Monday night he still has a long way  to go.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed in our fundamentals," he said after the game. "I don't think  we do the fundamentals very well."  </P> <P> The team is playing four American exhibition games arranged by the  International Sports Connection, a sports promotion company based in Gadsen,  Ala. Besides Tacoma, the team will play in Fresno, Oklahoma City and Macon,  Ga., with a possible match in Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> The starting quarterback first touched a football seven months ago, and he's  the team's veteran. Ralston's biggest player tips the scales at 250 pounds.  </P> <P> Ralston had said he mainly wanted to ensure his players finished the game  intact -- especially his starting tight end, since both backups had been  detained in the Soviet Union by the KGB the night before departure.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ferfin stock recovers on speculative buying FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company which is staggering under total borrowings of L28,838bn (Dollars 17.8bn), staged a strong recovery in its share price on the Milan stock exchange yesterday. On the second day of trading after Tuesday's two-day suspension, Ferfin shares soared by 46 per cent to close at L328. Stock in Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial subsidiary, climbed by almost 5 per cent to L736.60. Trading in Ferfin shares was suspended earlier this week in advance of news of revised losses for the first five months of this year and plans to write down the nominal share price to L5 from L1,000. The impact of the write-down and scale of the problems at the group, which is labouring under allegations of political corruption, severe financial irregularities and vast debts, made it virtually impossible for analysts to judge a fair share price when trading in the shares resumed on Thursday. Dealers said that yesterday's strong recovery in the group's share price - which followed an official price of L224.40 on Thursday - was partly speculative. Trading was also fuelled by some upbeat forecasts for the fate of Ferfin's shares when its main creditor banks unveil their rescue plan next month.</p>

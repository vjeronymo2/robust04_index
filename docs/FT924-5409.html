			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Banks agree rescue deal for Rosehaugh Stanhope schemes BANKS OWED an estimated Pounds 1.25bn have agreed a five-year refinancing package with Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the owner of two of London's largest office schemes. The deal, which involves around 50 banks, was signed earlier this week. It was crucial to the survival of the company which is jointly owned by Rosehaugh and Stanhope, two of the UK's hardest hit property developers. Separately, an announcement is expected in the next few weeks about the acquisition by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew of the building it occupies and financed in RSD's Broadgate office complex. UBS, which is owed Pounds 200m by RSD, is negotiating the purchase of the building in order to secure the repayment of its debt next April. RSD is also in talks with Credit Lyonnais, another Broadgate tenant, about the sale of its building. RSD is expected to make further write-downs in the value of its assets, which comprise the Broadgate and Ludgate office schemes in the City of London, when it publishes its accounts for the year to June. In the year to June 1991, its net asset value fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 341.2m. Rosehaugh and Stanhope have been particularly badly hit by the depression in the London office market, where values have fallen by two-thirds from the peak of the market three years ago. Merger talks between the two companies were called off earlier this year. RSD's management is becoming increasingly independent of either parent company, although this will not involve a change to RSD's ownership structure. Earlier this year, Rosehaugh agreed a refinancing of its Pounds 310m debt until January 1994. Stanhope is currently discussing the restructuring of its debts with its banks, led by Barclays. The banks have been prepared to support companies like Rosehaugh, Stanhope and RSD because they are reluctant to sell assets at distressed prices in the severely depressed London office market.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Value of Hamas expulsions in doubt ISRAELI ministers are satisfied that the abrupt expulsion last month of 415 Palestinians to south Lebanon, in spite of damage to the country's international standing, was widely accepted at home as a damaging blow to Islamic extremist organisations bent on attacking Israel. However, there are strong doubts among foreign observers, Palestinians in the occupied territories and some Israeli commentators that the expulsions have achieved the aim of dislocating Hamas, the most prominent fundamentalist group in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Hamas seeks to disrupt Middle East peace talks and challenge the primacy of the secular Palestine Liberation Organisation. 'Our analysis is that the Israelis have done much less damage than they claim to have done,' said a western diplomat. 'If the security forces really had a list of 400 core members of Hamas they wouldn't have been at large - they would have been arrested a long time ago.' In addition to the 415 men dumped across the Lebanese border, the authorities rounded up hundreds more alleged activists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller fundamentalist group responsible for violent acts against the Israeli occupation. This sudden removal from the streets of around 1,000 people undoubtedly stunned the organisations. But those sceptical of the effectiveness of the mass round-up say the subsequent lull in armed attacks on the security forces is almost certainly temporary while the guerrillas lay low in the immediate aftermath. The killing of a Shin Bet secret service officer on Sunday, and a non-fatal stabbing of another Israeli the same day may have been the first signs of a revival of the violence. Government and military officials have acknowledged that the arrests and deportations did not include the killers of six Israeli soldiers by Hamas and Islamic Jihad in early December whose deaths prompted the expulsions. Most of those rounded up were either prominent local figures known for their advocacy of Islamic revivalism or people involved in little more than low-level intifada street demonstrations against Israeli rule. Large numbers of mosque officials, Islamic and other academics, physicians and professionals were included in the expulsion. 'These people were well-known for their public support and sympathy for Hamas. But they are not the real activists, who have to operate underground. They work in small cells and do not have any public face,' said a Palestinian journalist. To some extent, the army does not dispute this. But the military insists that by moving to remove the intellectual 'head' of Hamas it has paralysed the organisation, at least temporarily. The action, military sources argue, will dislocate the network of social and welfare support which Hamas operates and which gives it its essential lifeblood of public support. 'We will still move against the terrorist element,' said one, referring to the armed cells. 'We will get these people as well.' But western governments have expressed concern to Israel that the expulsions have increased sympathy for Hamas and its fellow Islamic groups at the expense of the PLO at a time when public support for the PLO-backed peace talks was vulnerable but was not perceived to be leaning towards the extremists. 'We are worried about the longer term effect on Hamas - on the ability of clandestine organisations to recruit. We think these developments will only help them,' said a diplomat. Western diplomats say they would prefer to see Israel act more clinically against channels of financial and material support said to be flowing to Hamas from Iran and, to a lesser extent, from Saudi Arabia.</p>

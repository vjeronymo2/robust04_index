			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Teachers continue boycott of tests THE TWO largest teachers' unions yesterday said members would continue boycotting national curriculum tests in September. This intensifies pressure for drastic changes to the tests. A review being conducted by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, is expected to produce preliminary conclusions at the end of the month. Boycotts by the three main teachers' unions this year meant that scarcely any pupils took the tests. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, made clear his union would end the boycott if the review cut their workload significantly. 'The government could solve this problem by either slimming down the national curriculum immediately or by limiting the number of hours teachers could be called to work.' He indicated possible disagreement between the unions by saying the boycott would end even if Sir Ron recommended introducing simple externally marked 'paper and pencil tests'. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said his union was taking action on educational content as well as workload.</p>

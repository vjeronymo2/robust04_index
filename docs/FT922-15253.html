			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Delaney cuts loss to Pounds 474,000 Delaney Group, a furniture maker and shopfitter, progressively reduced its loss during 1991 to finish with a deficit of Pounds 474,000. In 1990 the loss was Pounds 825,000. At the end of the first half of 1991 it had been cut to Pounds 646,000 and at the three-quarter stage stood at Pounds 507,000. Mr Nathu Ram Puri, chairman, said it would be imprudent to speak of revival but he believed the second half represented a 'significant milestone on the road back to full recovery'. In 1987 and 1988 group pre-tax profit topped Pounds 2.8m. Turnover in 1991 fell by nearly 20 per cent to Pounds 21.8m. Losses per share were 0.6p (2.4p).</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / RJB seeks to cut Pounds 35m off bid for British Coal regions RJB Mining, the coal company chosen by the government as preferred bidder for British Coal's English regions, is seeking to shave at least Pounds 35m off its Pounds 914m bid after finding coal stocks are below expectations. It told institutional investors that British Coal's English stockpiles are 1.3m tonnes of coal down on when it made its bid, and this should enable it to negotiate a Pounds 35m reduction in the purchase price. The coal stock change provides a fillip for the company's efforts to raise up to Pounds 1.05bn through borrowing and selling shares. RJB was given further cheer when Mr John Jermine, executive chairman of NSM, another coal company which bid for British Coal assets, expressed support for the bid. Other failed bidders have attacked RJB's assumptions on future sales as unrealistic but Mr Jermine, whose company bid unsuccessfully for the south Wales region, said he thought the plans would work. In City presentations, Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, has told institutional investors that the 'due diligence' process, through which it is inspecting the assets, could produce further reductions in the price, on top of the Pounds 35m it expects to save on coal stocks. However, the company is not expecting cuts of more than Pounds 100m. Mr Budge told investors there could be savings of tens of millions, not hundreds. Government advisers are said to share that assessment. Although the lower coal stocks will reduce the value of the regions being acquired, they will also ease RJB's fund-raising task. It could be seeking less than Pounds 1bn for the bid. The company is valued at just Pounds 157m on the stock market. In the face of strong criticism from rival bidders and analysts, Mr Budge is presenting a highly confident face to the City. He acknowledges that his company would fail to make the money it has projected - Pounds 220m in pre-tax profits in 1999 alone - if coal demand at the end of the century was as low as it has allowed in 'conservative case' assumptions. Those figures are viewed by some analysts as too high, but Mr Budge points out they include forecasts that gas-fired generation will take the place of up to 50m tonnes of coal equivalent - more than most expectations. The figures also allow a high market share, 8.3m tonnes of coal equivalent, for the burning of orimulsion - a bitumen-based fuel. Mr Budge says he is also making conservative assumptions on cost-cutting, 3 per cent a year, for achieving profit projections. He assumes, however, that coal can be sold to electricity generators at an average of Pounds 1.25 per gigajoule after 1998 and Pounds 1.32 in 1999. These projections, and those for sales of 34m tonnes in 1999, are seen as extremely optimistic by rival bidders. RJB refused to comment but Mr Budge has told institutions that at least 90 per cent of debt, possibly all of it, would be paid when existing contracts with generators expire in April 1998. The company is also planning to buy two pits, Ellington in Northumberland and Thorne in Yorkshire, in addition to the 15 which are part of the three regions it is buying.

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: PROBE CONFIRMS SHERRILL PAID FORMER PLAYER  </P> <P> Texas A &amp; M officials said Friday that an investigation into allegations  that former football Coach Jackie Sherrill made illegal payments confirmed that  he gave a former player money, but they said that evidence did not support  "hush money" allegations made by the player.  </P> <P> The results of the internal investigation have been turned over to the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn., school President William H. Mobley said.  </P> <P> Robert Smith, the university's vice president of administration and finance,  said the investigation confirmed that five overnight letters were sent to  former player George Smith after he left the university, starting in November  of 1986 and ending in September of 1988. Sherrill has admitted that three of  the letters contained $500 each.  </P> <P> But the report concludes that the evidence does not support any of the  allegations made by George Smith, including the allegations that the payments  constituted "hush money." The former player since has recanted the claim.  </P></p>

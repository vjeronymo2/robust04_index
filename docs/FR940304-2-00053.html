			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The consent order would, if finally accepted by the Commission, settle charges that the acquisition may substantially lessen competition in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market. The complaint alleges that Columbia and HCA are competitors in the market for acute care hospital services in Augusta-Aiken. The Augusta-Aiken hospital market, according to the complaint, was already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The complaint alleges that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture of HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center in Aiken, South Carolina. The purpose of the divestiture is to ensure the continuation of HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Columbia, and to remedy the lessening of competition in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market resulting from the acquisition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order allows the respondents to divest HCA Aiken Regional medical Center to one or more acquirers with the prior approval of the Commission. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture would be completed within twelve months of the date the order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the twelve-month period, the respondents would consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have eighteen additional months to effect the divestiture. The hold separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires the respondents, until the completion of the divestiture or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets and businesses of HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of the Commission, HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any other acute care hospital in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order would prohibit the respondents from acquiring any acute care hospital in Augusta-Aiken without the prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit the respondents from transferring, without prior Commission approval, any acute care hospital they operate in Augusta-Aiken to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of the respondents with those of any other acute care hospital in Augusta-Aiken, unless the respondents convinced the Commission that a particular transaction would not endanger competition in the Augusta-Aiken hospital market. The provisions would not apply to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions would expire ten years after the order becomes final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For ten years, the order would prohibit the respondents from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital in Augusta-Aiken to a non-respondent without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee to be bound by the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the respondents that their proposed acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's compliant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

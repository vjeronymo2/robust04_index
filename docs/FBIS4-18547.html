			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfred Schwarz] </F>   [Text] According to the Austrian authorities, a UN request  for help with the reconstruction of Tuzla airport was turned  down for technical reasons. Austria was asked to provide a  certain type of stacker trucks, which the Austrian Army does not  have. Purchasing such devices would have cost millions of  Austrian schillings.    Another UN request, to train Pakistani troops in an Austrian  training area, proved impossible for technical and legal  reasons. The Pakistani UN soldiers should have been trained on  old GDR tanks that are being used by UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] in Bosnia. But as Austria does not have such tanks, the  army would have had to import them and train Austrian  instructors to use them first, so as to be able to train the  Pakistanis. Foreign troop maneuvers on Austrian territory would  also have required a state treaty between Austria and the UN.  This could not have been concluded within a few weeks, as would  have been necessary, the Austrian Government said.</p>

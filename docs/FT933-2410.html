			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: How to provide for a sweet life of retirement - With many new pension schemes on offer, do not take it for granted that your company provides the best option THOSE OF us who are members of company pension schemes should not assume automatically that we are adequately provided for. The new breed of 'money purchase' pensions includes flexible alternatives to the traditional 'final salary' arrangement, and some of the schemes are much better than others. To assess your money purchase company pension it is important to understand how the different schemes operate. Traditional final salary schemes, as the name suggests, link the value of the pension to the employee's salary at retirement. The employer's contribution is unrestricted, while employees can pay in up to 15 per cent of pensionable earnings per annum (restricted in certain cases). The maximum pension is two-thirds of final salary (also restricted in certain cases). Death-in-service benefits of up to four times salary can be paid. Contributions are directed into a fund which is invested to meet the scheme's liabilities such as pensions in payment, lump sum death benefits and preserved pensions for early leavers. The main point to remember about final salary schemes is that the employer bears the risk. If there is not enough money in the fund to meet liabilities, the employer is obliged to top it up. Moreover, the pension provides an ideal hedge against inflation through its link to final salary as wages tend to outstrip prices. By contrast, money purchase pensions - whether on an individual or group basis - shift the financial risk to the individual. The contribution and benefit rules vary but in most cases there is no central fund. Contributions build up in individual funds and are used at retirement to purchase annuities to provide income. Although some money purchase schemes aim to provide a pension that is expressed as a proportion of final salary, there is no guarantee. The level of pension will depend on how well the money was invested, inflation, the provider's charges and annuity rates at the time of retirement. If these factors are unfavourable, the employer is under no obligation to top up the pension. If your employer provides a money purchase pension it is important to find out if it represents good value for money and whether it needs topping up either by increasing contributions to the main scheme or through additional voluntary contributions. These are the relevant factors to consider: Type of scheme Most money purchase schemes will fall into one of three main categories. Contracted out money purchase schemes (comps) are Inland Revenue approved occupational pensions and as such will follow the same contribution and benefit limits as final salary schemes. A comp scheme must have a trust deed and rules and there must be a board of trustees who, as with final salary schemes, must provide annual accounts and are there to protect the interests of scheme members. Comps are contracted out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) and receive a rebate of employee and employer national insurance contributions. Contracted in money purchase schemes (cimps) are similar to comps but employees remain in Serps and the scheme provides benefits on top of the state earnings related pension. Younger employees can join a cimp and contract out of Serps on an individual basis using an 'appropriate' personal pension to receive the NI rebate. Group personal pensions (GPPs) are not occupational schemes but are simply a series of individual personal pension plans which can be used to contract out of Serps and to invest additional regular or single premiums to boost the pension provided by the NI rebate. The rebate for personal pension plan holders is marginally higher for employees over 30 compared with the rebate available under a comps. The combined employee and employer contribution must not exceed 17.5 per cent of earnings (more for older employees but there are restrictions for high earners). The retirement income provided by the personal pension is not linked to final salary. Death in service benefits are not compulsory, although the personal pension itself may provide a return of contributions plus interest. Extra life assurance can be taken out to increase this benefit. Contribution level This is where you start to separate the wheat from the chaff. Money purchase schemes can match or even exceed final salary pensions provided enough contributions are paid. Unfortunately, these arrangements have earned a reputation for giving employers a cheap alternative to final salary schemes and in some cases the combined employer/employee contribution is too low to provide an adequate pension. Actuaries at Godwins, the employee benefits consultants, provided the following approximate guide to the total combined contributions needed to match a typical final salary scheme. Between the ages of 21-34, total contributions should be 7 per cent; ages 35-44 9 per cent; ages 45-54 11 per cent; ages 55-63 15 per cent. The 'typical' final salary for this purpose is one where the pension builds up at a rate of one sixtieth of final salary for each year of service, allows for 5 per cent annual increases to the pension and provides a spouse's pension of 50 per cent. Death in service benefits would vary according to the type of scheme but as a rule of thumb, in order to achieve a benefit of three to four times salary you should add 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent to the above figures. Clive Grimley, senior manager at consultants Gissings, said: 'Contribution-matching in money purchase schemes is a valuable feature. The scheme basis might, for example, require a contribution of 5 per cent from both employer and employee. On top of this some employers agree to match any further contribution the employee makes up to an agreed limit.' The provider The money purchase pensions market is dominated by the life offices, although several unit trust groups also offer arrangements. Your employer should have taken expert independent advice and conducted an analysis of different providers' financial strength, the management and commission charges, administration facilities and investment record. Employers advised by a salesperson or tied agent would have received details of only one provider. Investment options It is important to check that the right funds are available. Experts generally agree that a fairly high proportion of equity investment is sensible during the early part of an employee's career (75 per cent or more depending on age) but that it is essential to have a phased switching facility to move funds into cash and bonds in the run-up to retirement. This protects the fund against a stock market crash during these crucial years. The charges The scheme provider's charges may have a direct impact on the investment return and flexibility of your pension scheme. Where a standard life office package is used there are likely to be high commission costs to the salesperson or adviser and a complex series of management and investment charges. Many advisers are prepared to rebate part or all of the commission in return for a fee. A good adviser will establish the most cost-effective contribution method. Flexibility Flexibility has been put forward as one of the main attractions of money purchase pensions because the employee has an easily identifiable and apparently portable pot of money. The important point to check here is what happens if you leave the scheme when you change jobs. Long term, regular premium life office contracts are notorious for their early termination penalties. Ideally your contract should have been established on a non-commission basis. Alternatively, contributions should be paid on a recurring single premium basis, as the upfront charges are modest and there are no early termination charges. There are no hard and fast rules on the merits of comps versus group personal pensions. Personal pensions can be used to secure a very high level of benefits for senior executives but they are also sold to employers who want the cheapest and simplest structure available. Barry Johnson, senior assistant director at Godwins, said: 'In practice a comp scheme tends to be more generous and more cost-effective to the average employee than a group personal pension. 'This is because under a comp the employer is likely to bear the administration charges and the cost of life assurance and will probably pay in a more generous contribution. Moreover, with a comp the employer is not restricted to using a life office administration and investment package with its associated higher and more complex charging structure.'</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / European Government Bonds: Prospect of mini-Emu sets markets buzzing WILL a mini-Emu arise from the ashes of the Maastricht treaty? Certainly the prospect of closer economic and monetary union (Emu) between the hard-core European currencies has set the bond markets buzzing, and some market participants now regard a two-speed Emu as an attractive route to follow. The events of the last month have given the idea of a mini-Emu some currency. In the run-up to the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, tensions within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European monetary system (EMS) led to a forced devaluation of the peseta, while both sterling and the lira pulled out and floated. The turmoil continued last week after the French voted in favour of Maastricht - but with only a very slender majority for the Yes vote. As the weaker European currencies came under renewed pressure, Spain, Portugal and Ireland tried to crush the speculators by introducing new controls on capital or by tightening existing ones. But the French franc managed to survive the week, thanks to heavy intervention by both the Bank of France and the Bundesbank. On Friday, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the governor of the Belgian central bank, was quoted as saying that monetary union between the five hard-core European currencies could start immediately. According to Belgian radio, Mr Verplaetse said Germany, France and the Benelux countries - Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - were economically ready to start monetary union. Ever since the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty on June 2, investors have focused more closely on the D-Mark bloc and greatly reduced their exposure to high-yielding European bond markets such as Spain and Italy. Before the Danish vote, the prospect of European economic and monetary union had convinced investors that they stood to make considerable gains as inflation and interest rates in Spain and Italy converged towards German levels. Denmark's rejection of Maastricht shattered investors' faith in the convergence argument. However, if a form of mini-Emu takes place now, investors in the hard-core European currencies should see convergence towards German yields in the bond markets. Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg Securities, points out that the first step towards Emu would be a move towards much narrower fluctuation bands between the currencies. 'A necessary requirement is to fix even more strongly than before those currencies which are able to fix' he said. The five countries involved would have to issue a statement of intent to lock their currencies more closely than before. 'In effect, Germany, France and the Benelux countries could eventually hijack the single currency for themselves,' he said. Yield spreads over German bunds for the other hard-core members would narrow considerably. Traders pointed out that following Mr Verplaetse's comments on Friday, the 10-year French-German yield spread fell dramatically. With the formation of a mini-Emu, the spreads would fall further. Mr Jeremy Hale, economist at Goldman Sachs, said: 'If the separate currencies continued to exist but were irreversibly fixed, the risk premium in Dutch, French and Belgian bonds would disappear and the bond yields would converge.' However, he added that in practice, French, Dutch and Belgian bonds would probably carry a small residual risk premium reflecting worries that the union might fall apart.</p>

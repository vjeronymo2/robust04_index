			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENENDEZ TAPES CRUCIAL, REINER SAYS  </P> <P> Tape-recorded conversations between two Beverly Hills brothers and the  psychologist who treated them after the savage shotgun slaying of their parents  are crucial evidence in the case against the pair, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said  Monday.  </P> <P> Reiner defended the prosecution's attempt to use the tapes, which were seized  by police last week and precipitated the arrests of Lyle Menendez, 22, and his  brother, Erik, 19. The brothers had been suspects since the slayings last  August.  </P> <P> However, defense attorney Gerald L. Chaleff, who represents Lyle Menendez, said  later that "It is our position that the material taken from the psychotherapist  is privileged and cannot be used in any way."  </P> <P> At a news conference at his office, Reiner said the confidentiality usually  accorded therapist-patient exchanges does not apply "where there is a  continuing threat of violence to others and, understand, this is a case of  murder."  </P> <P> Although Reiner did not amplify on his comment about a threat, Deputy Dist.  Atty. Elliott Alhadeff said later that threats were made against L. Jerome  Oziel, the Beverly Hills psychologist who made the tapes.  </P> <P> Oziel, who had been counseling the Menendez family, is cooperating with  authorities, the district attorney's office said.  </P> <P> The Menendez brothers, who are being held without bail, were to have been  arraigned Monday afternoon, and the district attorney's office moved to unseal  a search warrant affidavit revealing details about the controversial tapes.  </P> <P> However, at the defense's request, the arraignment, affidavit decision and bail  motions were postponed by Beverly Hills Municipal Court Judge Judith O. Stein  until March 26. The prosecution turned over a four-inch stack of evidence to  the defense.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys said they need time to prepare their argument that the  therapist-patient relationship was violated by the seizure of psychotherapy  records and to determine whether statements in the affidavit are privileged and  should remain sealed.  </P> <P> Robert L. Shapiro, who represents Erik, said his client -- who was playing in a  professional tennis tournament in Israel when he learned that he was wanted --  was "quite concerned. I think his actions (in returning to surrender  voluntarily) show great character and great strength."  </P> <P> The two young men, somber-faced and dressed in business suits, appeared briefly  in the packed Beverly Hills courtroom to hear the charges, as family members,  who have rallied behind them, looked on.  </P> <P> Each brother faces special circumstance allegations of multiple murders,  killing for financial gain and lying in wait. If convicted, they could be  sentenced to death.  </P> <P> "We are alleging as a motive financial gain," Reiner said at his news  conference earlier. "I don't know what your experience is, but it's been our  experience in the district attorney's office that $14 million (the estate the  sons stood to inherit) provides ample motive for someone to kill somebody."  </P> <P> The victims, Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment of Van  Nuys, a video and music distributor, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were found dead  in their Beverly Hills mansion last Aug. 20, hit numerous times with blasts  from two 12-gauge shotguns fired at close range.  </P> <P> The sons told authorities they found their parents' bodies when they returned  from a night out.  </P> <P> There was no sign of forced entry into the home. Nor was there any indication  of a robbery, and no murder weapons were found.  </P> <P> Shotgun shell wadding was found at the scene of the murder and police later  obtained an expended 12-gauge shotgun shell casing that sources said had been  found in one of Lyle's jackets.  </P> <P> Although speculation immediately after the killings centered on the possibility  that it was an organized crime hit, police said they also began looking at the  sons' possible involvement early on.  </P> <P> "From the very outset we had suspicions of the boys' involvement," said Lt.  Russ Olson, the Beverly Hills Police Department's chief of detectives. "As more  evidence developed, it pointed only in one direction."  </P> <P> According to the terms of a 1980 will, Menendez, in the event of his and his  wife's simultaneous deaths, left his entire $14-million estate to his two sons.  After estate taxes were subtracted, the brothers stood to receive $3 million  each.  </P> <P> Additionally, a $400,000 life insurance policy on Jose Menendez already has  been distributed to Lyle and Erik.  </P> <P> During their investigation, detectives also discovered that the family's home  computer had been tampered with after the murders to delete a reference to a  will. They believe that the will, whether old or new, was intentionally  destroyed by Lyle, according to several sources familiar with the police  investigation.  </P> <P> Relatives told The Times that in recent years Jose Menendez was discussing  changing his will to take into account his rapidly growing wealth. But  relatives said there was no evidence that a new will was ever written.  </P></p>

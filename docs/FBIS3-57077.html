			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova article under the "In Parliament" rubric: </F> "Federation Council: Parkinson's Law in Action"]    [Text] After one week's work, the upper chamber of  parliament completed its first session Saturday [15 January].  Having roughly formed committees and appointed several  chairmen, the Federation Council members went their separate  ways (on foot and by transport) until 31 January. The previous  day, Friday, had been possibly the least quiet day: The list of  committees was being approved, in other words our senators were  deciding on the range of questions which they intend to tackle.  Attempts to reduce the number of committees to a minimum were  not crowned with success. Two trends were at odds: Toward  reducing the list and, conversely, toward extending it -- if not  up to the number being proposed in the Duma, then close to it.  The arguments of the supporters of the "minimum": The number  of internal structures must correspond to the chamber's powers  enshrined in the Constitution. They also tried to persuade  people to take into account the small size of the corps of  deputies of the Federation Council, compared with the Duma. The  opponents emphasized the importance of state problems, which  cannot be resolved without corresponding structures. The  speaker played a considerable role in the outcome of the debate.  At first he curbed the senators' appetites, but gradually he  not only yielded to pressure from the "extenders" but also used  his own levers of influence in order to support them. The  levers are well known: A return to decisions not made earlier,  repeat votes, "information," and commentaries (incidentally, in  violation of the standing orders -- for which several deputies  reprimanded Vladimir Shumeyko).    As a result, two additional committees were set up: one on  science, education, and culture, the other on agrarian policy.  The possibility cannot be ruled out that at its next session  the chamber will return once again to the "very important"  question of a committee "on the norths," and there will  certainly be a proposal to set up a committee to combat crime,  and so on. It seems that the Federation Council, like any  structure, will be inclined, according to Parkinson's law, to  expand its functions and to complicate its internal organization.    The chamber will undoubtedly be organized also along  political lines. Despite the chairman's firm intention to  prevent the Federation Council from splitting into factions, it  will hardly be possible to curb political differentiation. The  Communists' representation here is strong (although officially  12 people ascribe themselves to the Communist Party), and the  national patriotic idea has its adherents. The creation of  groups along sectoral and professional lines (directors,  farmers, and so on) and the forming of territorial blocs are  possible. Understandably, all these deputies' associations,  registered or unofficial, are needed to lobby for the real  interests of large groups of the population. The point is that  national interests should not get lost behind party,  professional, and regional interests.</p>

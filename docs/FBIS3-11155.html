			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Gregoire Eugene, spokesman for the coordinating  committee of the parties and groups hostile to President  Aristide, called on 17 March for a general mobilization of the  masses to cope with the embargo and fill the institutional  vacuum created by the exile of President Aristide and the  resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval. This mobilization  may take the form of a people's demonstration within the next  few days, according to Eugene, who plans to call on other  political groupings to reinforce the defensive line. In his  opinion, we are in complete anarchy, and without the courage of  the Haitian people the country would sink as conditions coalesce  into social explosion. [passage omitted]</p>

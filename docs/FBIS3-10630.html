Anselmo Sule was designated president of  the Radical Party (PR) to deal with the crisis created by the  results of the latest intraparty elections and to prepare for  internal elections called for 30 May. The solution was reached  after lengthy and tense negotiations with the sector led by  Ricardo Navarrete and Enrique Silva Cimma, with the group  obtaining a vice presidency and strong representation on the  Governing Board.    In the tumultuous Council meeting, held in the Diego  Portales  building, only the regional councillors, members of Congress,  and the Governing Board took part. Mid-level PR officials and  rank and file militants were not included, in accordance with  the bylaws.    This caused severe criticism from the Radical rank and file,  who gathered outside the building with signs. The leadership  summoned the Carabineros to disperse the demonstrators and  encourage them to make an orderly entry into the building.    The final agreement on the Governing Board was reached after  1930, following complex negotiations in which Navarrete's group  conditioned its support on obtaining an important position, such  as the General Secretariat or a vice presidency, and a  significant presence in the directive bodies.    The outcome was that the faction led by Navarrete and Silva  Cimma will fill six of the 14 seats on the Emergency Board,  while the group led by the current president of the PR, Carlos  Gonzalez Marquez, and Sule, will hold the remaining eight.    The Governing Board was constituted as follows: president,  Anselmo Sule; vice presidents, with equal authority, Ricardo  Navarrete and Sergio Carrasco; secretary general, Ernesto  Velasco, one of the party's new faces; secretary of organization  and control, Aldo Bruzzone; and the national directors: Mireya  Alfaro, Gaspar Bernales, Jaime Campos, Jorge Millan, Moises  Signorelli, Wilson Tapia, Milton Vergara, Mario Weitzel and a  fourteenth director to be designated tomorrow.    The Political Committee will be made up of Alex Acosta,  Mario  Cabezas, Patricio Tombolini, Sergio Villegas, and members of  Congress Mario Devau, Dionisio Faulbann and Jose Pena.    Outgoing President Carlos Gonzalez Marquez congratulated the  councillors for the manner in which they conducted the difficult  negotiations. "This agreement was proposed basically by the  leadership of the party's rank and file, the regional  councillors. We want the rank and file to regain sovereignty and  this is why we are going to have an election on 30 May, so that  the rank and file can elect its new national officers.... There  has been a profound, frank, serious, and painful examination,  but it was worthwhile doing."    The new president, Anselmo Sule--the only Radical senator  who  will retain his Senate seat after March--announced that the new  Governing Board's work program and the Council's final accords  will be made known next Tuesday, 11 January. He expressed  appreciation for the support and concern of militants, "at such  an important moment, when the Radical Party is passing through a  serious crisis. We expect to come out of it strong, with great  vigor, and we hope that in the next national election we will  again become, in number of votes and elective offices, one of  the country's principal forces."</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON'S HIGH-TECH PROMOTER TRANSFERRED  </P> <P> Craig Fields, who as director of the Pentagon's advanced research arm advocated  greater government support for high-technology industries, has been reassigned  to a new position, the Defense Department disclosed Friday.  </P> <P> Fields, as head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, had several  run-ins with top Administration officials over his advocacy of a more active  government role in support of such projects as high-definition television. He  also backed the industry-government sponsored Sematech cooperative, aimed at  improving U.S. computer chip manufacturing capability.  </P> <P> Fields, who did not return phone calls, joined DARPA in 1974 and has been its  director for about a year.  </P> <P> The Pentagon initially denied that Fields was being dismissed. In response to  press inquiries, it later issued a statement acknowledging that he was being  moved to a new position.  </P> <P> "Dr. Fields is not being fired from any position and any such characterization  unfairly impugns his years of fine service to the nation," the Pentagon said.  "The department plans to transfer him to the position of deputy director of  defense research and engineering for defense management report implementation."  </P> <P> Congressional sources said the new position amounted to a demotion and would  give Fields little real authority.  </P> <P> Fields' dismissal as head of DARPA is likely to stir controversy in Congress.  </P> <P> "The firing of Craig Fields represents a death blow for U.S. competitiveness,"  said Fred Branfman, director of Rebuild America, a group that advocates  industry-government projects. "The Bush Administration has DARPA solely  building weapons to meet the waning Soviet military threat instead of helping  to develop economic weapons to meet the Japanese challenge."  </P> <P> DARPA, which was established in the wake of the U.S. panic over Sputnik more  than 30 years ago, awards hundreds of millions of dollars each year to  corporations and universities to conduct financially high-risk research.  </P> <P> DARPA currently is funding private R&amp;D in such technologies as  superconductivity, advanced semiconductors, high-definition TV, neural networks  and similar ventures. While DARPA is confined to projects with a military  application, many of the technologies it funds are also expected to help U.S.  industries.  </P></p>

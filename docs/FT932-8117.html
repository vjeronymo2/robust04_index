			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: 'Best guess' of profits better than analysts' estimates Sir, Following the public censure by the stock exchange of London International Group ('Crackdown on private briefings for analysts', May 15), is there any overwhelming reason why companies should not publish a 'best guess' profits and earnings per share estimate for the coming year at the time of their preliminary results statement, updated if necessary at their AGM and on publication of their interim results? Only if the company considered that the actual results were likely to differ by more than a given amount (say 10 per cent) from their latest estimate, would they be required to make a statement to the stock exchange. More frequent information would not only help reduce the number of profit warnings made, with the associated stigma and often devastating effect on share price, but would also ensure that the playing field was seen to be level. Far from diminishing the role of the analysts, who are after all at liberty to publish their estimates, it would perhaps free them a little from number gazing and allow them to concentrate more fully on areas of concern to investors about which the company itself cannot be expected to be entirely impartial, for example its strategy, competitive position and management quality. It would also help in placing a realistic value on the shares of the many small companies not covered by analysts' research, perhaps even enhancing the market for them.

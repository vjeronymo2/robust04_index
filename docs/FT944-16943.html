			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Observer: Soft boiled Knock Knock. Who's there? Egbert. Egbert who? Egbert no bacon. Try cracking that joke next time you take the Eurostar express train service, which from next month starts taking travellers through the Channel tunnel. Anyone lucky enough to make the trip will find no fried eggs and bacon, a traditional feature of British Rail's early morning journeys. The caterers are unable to keep fried food hot, so international passengers will have to make do with scrambled eggs. Cracking good service.</p>

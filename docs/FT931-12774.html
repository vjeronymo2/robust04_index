			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Boeing declines 6% to Dollars 377m in fourth quarter BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer which yesterday announced a sharp cut in its production programme, also reported a 6 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, but a 4 per cent increase for 1992 as a whole. The company's shares, which have fallen sharply this month because of its deteriorating aircraft delivery outlook, closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 35 1/2 after yesterday's news. Boeing reported net earnings before accounting changes of Dollars 377m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with Dollars 403m, or Dollars 1.17 a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales were Dollars 7.5bn, against Dollars 7.8bn. For 1992, it reported earnings of Dollars 1.635bn, or Dollars 4.81 a share, compared with Dollars 1.567, or Dollars 4.56 a share, in 1991. Sales rose from Dollars 29.3bn to Dollars 30.2bn. Mr Frank Schrontz, the chairman, said it expected 1993 sales to drop to around Dollars 26bn, with commercial aircraft deliveries dropping to about 340 units, against 441 in 1992. Mr Schrontz said the increase in 1992 net earnings before an accounting change was mainly attributable to increased commercial aircraft sales and an improved operating performance, particularly in Boeing's space and defence business. The latter returned to profitability, with operating earnings of Dollars 204m on sales of Dollars 5.4bn. However, these factors were partially offset by higher research and development expense, particularly for the company's 777 airliner, lower interest income and a higher tax rate.</p>

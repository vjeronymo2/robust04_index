			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / DTI held up probe to let SFO act THE appointment of Depart-ment of Trade and Industry inspectors to investigate the Maxwell companies was delayed until the Serious Fraud Office told officials of the direction its inquiry was taking into the affair, it emerged yesterday. It was not until two weeks ago - more than a year after the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers and seven months after Robert Maxwell died - that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided the time was right. Gathered with Mr Heseltine in his office were Mr Vivian Brown, head of the DTI's investigations division, and Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister. In front of them was a proposal for action. The SFO inquiries would not encompass the extent to which company law may have been breached during the MGN flotation in May last year, the report said. That justified appointing DTI inspectors. The two ministers and Mr Brown agreed. An announcement was delayed to coincide with the Department of Social Security announcement on Monday of an independent review of pension law. Part of the value of launching an investigation, particularly when political pressure is growing at Westminster, is the impression given of a government acting on as many fronts as possible. The DTI had been anxious to build its case carefully. Officials were concerned about the cost - appointing inspectors can involve millions of pounds - and the consequences of a wrong decision, both for the company and for the DTI's reputation. The official argument until this week - including under the tenure of Mr Peter Lilley, former trade and industry secretary - was that there was no point in the DTI's organising an investigation that might clash with that of the SFO. DTI officials meet the SFO formally four times a year, but are in closer contact informally. The timing of the appointment of DTI inspectors into the Maxwell affair was  -according to insiders - therefore not a question of Mr Heseltine shaking the department into action. The argument being spread around Whitehall yesterday was that it was simply propitious.</p>

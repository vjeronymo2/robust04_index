			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: A testing time for micro-organisms - Worth Watching Food companies now have a one-step test to ensure their production equipment is clean before manufacture begins. Biotrace, of Bridgend, Wales, specialists in rapid microbial testing systems, has developed the Uni-Lite test for detecting micro-organisms or product residue in three minutes. The surface is swabbed and the cotton swab dipped in an enzyme. This reacts to any ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in the sample - all living cells contain ATP - by producing light. By measuring the light the degree of contamination on the surface can be quantified. Biotrace: UK, 0656 768844.</p>

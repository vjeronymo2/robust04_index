			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dasa to take stake in Loral venture DASA, the aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz, is paying Dollars 57m for a 12 1/4 per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral, the US commercial satellite manufacturer. Loral, the defence electronics company and the biggest shareholder in Space Systems, is injecting another Dollars 59m into the company to maintain its stake at 51 per cent. Dasa is joining three other European space industry companies - Alcatel and Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy - which also have stakes in Space Systems. With the arrival of Dasa, each will have 12 1/4 per cent. The move by Dasa had been triggered by increasingly tough international competition, Mr Rolf Arnim, Dasa's managing director of communications satellite programme, said yesterday. 'The European satellite industry must collaborate, and we have decided to do it with the US.' US satellite builders have repeatedly beaten their European rivals in winning contracts to build civil telecommunications satellites. Hughes Aircraft of Los Angeles is the industry leader with a market share of more than 60 per cent. Dasa's decision is also the latest step in the consolidation of the European satellite manufacturing industry. British Aerospace this month halved capacity at its satellite manufacturing plant at Stevenage, north of London. Competitive pressures have also prompted it to enter merger talks with Matra-Marconi, an Anglo-French rival. Space Systems was established in late 1990 by Loral, Alcatel, Aerospatiale and Alenia. The company got off to an encouraging start by winning a Dollars 500m contract for a Japanese satellite programme. Dasa decided to join them last month and is awaiting US regulatory approval. 'We do not believe this will be a problem because the other three European companies have already been approved,' said Mr Arnim. Dasa's stake will be satisfied with the issue of new shares, he said. Loral, the parent, had sales of Dollars 2.9bn in 1991 and profits of Dollars 122m. Mr Bernard Schwartz, its chairman and chief executive, said last month that the company wanted to become further involved in non-military markets. In March, Mr Schwartz visited Europe looking for potential acquisitions and collaborations. In 1990 Loral paid Dollars 750m for Ford Aerospace and elbowed its way into the commercial space arena. Previously Loral had systematically acquired some of the defence activities of leading US 'blue chip' companies which had decided to diversify into the military sector and are now refocusing activities on their core operations.</p>

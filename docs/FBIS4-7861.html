			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "Z.M.:" "Permanent Growth; Economic Situation </F> in March 1994"]    [Text] The economic situation in Poland improved in  March. The economic situation's indicator increased by 2 percent  compared with what it was in February of this year. Those are  the conclusions drawn from the most recent research poll by the  Main Commercial School's Institute of Economic Development.    The production output indicator increased substantially over  the month of March. Enterprises are predicting that the trend  will continue over the next three to four months.    An increase in the in-flow of new domestic orders, which has  been reported by enterprises, is also a positive phenomenon.  All signs are that we will have a similar situation over the  course of the next three to four months.    After its January increase and a stabilization in February,  the indicator of price increases on ready-made products  experienced a drop. Enterprises are predicting a slowdown of  the rate of increases of prices on their products also over the  next three to four months.    Last month, a decrease of reserves of ready-made products  was  reported, even though the reserves' levels were rising on a  regular basis beginning in December 1993.    The indicator of production of merchandise for exports rose  for the second month in a row; the same applies to the portfolio  of new export-bound orders. This kind of rate should hold over  the next few months.    The rate of growth of unemployment decreased in March, and  the financial situation of enterprises improved slightly.    The increase in production levels, the increase of domestic  and export orders, the decline in the levels of reserves of  ready-made products, and an investment revival--all these are  signs of permanent economic growth occurring in Poland.</p>

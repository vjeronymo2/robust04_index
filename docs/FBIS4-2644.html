			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee and provincial  government yesterday afternoon held a provincial telephone  meeting on rural work. The meeting was presided over by  Governor Zhu Senlin. Vice Governor Ou Guangyuan briefed the  participants on the guidelines laid by the national meeting on  rural work, and gave some opinions on the actual circumstances  of the province.    Ou Guangyuan said: Party and government cadres at all levels  must treat agriculture, especially grain production, as a major  task that must be accomplished to stabilize society and the  country. He stressed that this year's task of growing grain  over 49 million mu of land must be completed. This is  mandatory, he said. If the early rice-growing quota is not  fulfilled, then the deficiency must be made up by growing more  late rice. He pointed out that how well the grain-growing task  is completed must be taken as a principal criterion for the  assessment of the performance of leading people at all levels.    Ou Guangyuan said: While completing the grain-growing task,  we are to apply the method of subsidizing agriculture with  profits earned from industry to increasing grain growers' income.    Addressing the meeting, Governor Zhu Senlin stressed that it  is necessary for people to be fully aware that grain production  is an important factor to ensure social stability. Grain and  food supply is an important matter in our efforts to keep  commodity prices stable. All local authorities must  persistently implement the system by which designated officials  assume responsibility for production, supply, marketing, and  storage of grain, as well as the relevant performance assessment  system. Since grain production promises low economic returns,  one cannot totally rely on market regulation with regard to  grain trade, instead, one must strengthen macroeconomic  regulation by administrative and economic means.    Zhu Senlin said: In order to implement all the measures for  increasing grain output and returns, all kinds of services must  be introduced in good time, thus ensuring that peasants' income  will increase. We can no longer tolerate cases such as those in  which grain growers' income remains constant or even decreases  despite increase in grain output.</p>

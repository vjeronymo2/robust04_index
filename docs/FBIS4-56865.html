			<p>BFN     [Text] With the approval of two-fifths of Congress, 52  legislators from the National [Blanco] Party, the Radical  Battleist Ticket No. 15 [Battlismo Radical Lista 15], and the  Colorado and Battleist Union (UCB) will promote in early May a  constitutional reform project that will be subjected to a  plebiscite along with the national elections scheduled for  November.    Congressional sources told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that this  proposal also is allegedly approved by legislators of the Party  of the Government by the People, who disapprove of the agreement  with the Battleist Forum.    The main proposal reportedly approves multiparty votes [voto  cruzado], involving the election of a presidential candidate  from a party and a mayor from another party.</p>

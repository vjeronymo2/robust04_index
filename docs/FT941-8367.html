			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Nijinsky's last work recreated - Clement Crisp reviews 'Tyl Eulenspiegel' as part of the Paris Opera season of tribute to 'a genius' Vaslav Nijinsky made four ballets for Diaghilev's company. Of these, his first, L'Apres-midi d'un faune of 1912, has survived through direct transmission from dancer to dancer. The others - Jeux and Le Sacre du printemps of 1913, and Tyl Eulenspiegel of 1916 - each lasted a season, and were then dropped from the Ballet Russe repertory. Nijinsky's break with Diaghilev, following his marriage in 1913, and his descent into madness in 1918, inhibited revivals. Nijinsky's genius as a dancer is unquestioned, and speaks to us even through the thin evidence of roles he created, and photographs which so hold the gaze and astonish the eye. His choreographic reputation is more vexed. Faune is a work of rare originality, the first innovative dance-making of our century, with movement flattened and given a thrilling two-dimensional power. Jeux, and especially Sacre, were no less bold in theme (the sub-text of Jeux was homosexual flirtation - and this in 1913) and in choreographic realisation (Sacre's dance insisting upon a weightiness and rhythmic virtuosity far beyond contemporary imagining). Sympathetic observers, when these pieces were new, convey something of the force of Nijinsky's vision. Marie Rambert, who worked with him on the preparation of Sacre (the young and inexperienced Nijinsky was dealing with the most taxing and complex ballet score yet written) told me quite simply that 'he was a genius'. These three works were made while Nijinsky was still sheltered by Diaghilev's protective love: in them the impresario saw that novelty which he so valued and so urged upon his artists. But in 1913 Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky, was summarily dismissed from the Ballet Russe, and went into the wilderness. After the outbreak of war in 1914, Diaghilev had to re-establish his troupe, and American tours were a means of survival. His American impresario insisted that Nijinsky be part of the ensemble. Released from internment, Nijinsky, his wife and child, arrived in New York, his terms for returning being that he should have command of the Ballet Russe and would make a new work. Diaghilev went back to Europe, and Nijinsky - by now showing signs of mental unease - took charge. His creation was to be a long-contemplated realisation of Strauss's Tyl Eulenspiegel. The work's genesis was difficult, as we learn from the writings of Robert Edmond Jones, a brilliant young American designer who was entrusted with sets and costumes. After delays (Nijinsky was injured) and stormy scenes, Tyl was seen at the Manhattan Opera House in October 1916. It was well received, though Lydia Sokolova, who was in the cast, said that the final moments were improvised by the dancers during the premiere. (Nijinsky in his memoirs noted that it was 'taken out of the oven too soon'). Tyl was, nonetheless, a success, a brilliantly grotesque picture of the mediaeval German prankster and the world he held to anarchic ransome. Robert Edmond Jones peopled the stage with fantasticated townspeople, and through the hurly-burly Nijinsky as Tyl raced and capered and caused mayhem. But after three New York showings, and a further 20 on the Ballet Russe's American tour, Tyl was never seen again. Now the Paris Opera ballet has brought a Tyl back to the stage, in a Nijinsky tribute that includes Petrushka, his greatest role, and that evocation of his Sacre which was the fruit of years of research by Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer. I have reported on this re-creation previously. Based upon the notes that Marie Rambert made when working on the original staging with Nijinsky, it is rather like those period rooms in museum where all the furniture and artefacts are right, but the place has no sense of being lived in. Even so, the Hodson/Archer Sacre can be seen as a guide to what Nijinsky could have created, albeit style, ways of dancing and ways of teaching, have radically altered performers' skills since 1913, and it looks quaint rather than convincing. If Sacre can be seen as something 'like', what can be said of Tyl, which Hodson and Archer have now evoked through their researches. There are no real indications of text, save written descriptions and the memory of one last survivor (aged 95) of the premiere. There are, happily, records of Robert Edmond Jones' dazzling designs, and these have been given convincing life at the Opera. But, summoned from the mists of time, what do we see of Tyl? Nothing of much consequence. There are crazily leaning buildings; expressionistically grotesque characters (ladies wearing hennins that double their height); a mad bustle of townsfolk through which Tyl tears like a whirlwind - and Patrick Dupond does a great deal to galvanise the role. But the dance is fuss, unfocussed, curiously blank. The air is heavy with formaldehyde. This is grave-robbery rather than restoration. Ironically, the problems of bringing the old ballets to life was highlighted by the Opera's view of Petrushka. The text is that copy of Fokine's creation mounted by Bronislava Nijinska (Nijinsky's sister) for the de Cuevas Ballet in 1950. It looks markedly inferior in many respcts to the versions provided by Serge Grigoriev (who was Diaghilev's regisseur for 20 years) and detail is muddled, incident traduced. The central interpretations are, as a result, less compelling than they should be, and as Diaghilev artists - Markova, Danilova, Dolin, Massine - marvellously showed them to us after the war. Like the rest of the programme, it seems more impression than fact. Musically, the evening was tremendous, with superlative playing by the Opera orchestra under Myung-Whun Chung. Sonorities, rhythms, were brilliant; tempi were those of the concert-hall. In Petrushka this made a few heels busy - reminiscent of Beecham whisking a ballet along and observing 'That kept the buggers on the hop]'. The programme book for this evening - as always at the Opera - is exemplary: very handsome, very informative. The Nijinsky programme can be see at the Opera Garnier on February 14,16,17,19,22,23, 25,26,28.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 22, 23-29 May </F> 94]    [Text] As a result of an international conference, which  Kiev hosted on May 23 through 25, the Agency for International  Cooperation and Investments together with the UN Office in  Ukraine drafted national strategies for technical aid's  applications, which has been increasingly flowing to Ukraine  from UN specialized institutions and agencies.    UN experts are to be broadly involved in scrutinizing  Ukraine's technical aid requirements under the thus drafted  strategies, as well as in assessment of further cooperation  prospects.    A number of technical aid projects are reported to have been  drafted by UN, which might be reduced to basically two types, to  wit, immediate capital investment and technical cooperation  designed to improve and upgrade Ukrainian experts' professional  skills.    The UN-sponsored "Systemic Reforms" project envisages aiding  Ukraine in development of a national strategic-scope reform  program based on comprehensive studies of Ukraine's domestic  prices and markets.    The "Human Resource Development" program focuses on  Ukraine's  human resource evaluation and social welfare to protect the  society's underprivileged strata. It also covers health care,  education, R&amp;D support, copyright and intellectual property  rights' protection in Ukraine.    The "Environment, power industry and resource management"  program encompasses the following areas:    - nuclear safety policies;    - the Chernobyl NPP's shut-down;    - routine nuclear safety;    - radiation monitoring and protection;    - Chernobyl victims' rehabilitation;    - Ukraine's power industry and fuel extraction.    The latter area involves more specialized subprojects  including "Development of national power industry strategies",  "Systemic approaches to environmental effect appraisal", "Power  industry management", "Application of power-saving  technologies", "Conversion of power industry to coal- and  gas-fired plants".    The program's environmental section involves comprehensive  ecological studies of the Dnieper River's basin and the Sea of  Azov.    The "sector reforms" project provides for aiding Ukraine in  its infrastructure's modernization, industries' reorientation  toward market demands.    According to Inna Grigoyeva, Ukraine's chief expert with the  National Center for International Technical Aid Application, the  amount of UN financing has not been defined yet.    The Agency for International Cooperation and Investments,  which was instituted in September 1993, is in charge of  coordinating the West's technical aid to Ukraine. It has its  representations in Ukrainian regions and abroad.    In accordance with the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada's  resolution,  it is also in charge of implementation of the state program for  foreign capital investment attraction, and of registration of  foreign investments in the state register of foreign investments  involving the EU and other international organisations.    The Agency's chairman is Vice-Premier Valentin Landik.</p>

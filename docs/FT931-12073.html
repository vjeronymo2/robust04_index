			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Being incorrect with buxom hackettes I LIVE in Notting Hill, where I often see a rat, a large and friendly rat - Rasta, I call him. For all I know there may be 20 or 30 rats involved, coming and going, performing their chores and tasks, but to me he is a composite, droll and disconnected. I imagine he lives on dope. My affection for Rasta the rat is not shared by Miss Lee, my executive assistant, a Yorkshirewoman and a Thatcherite. Whenever I say I have seen Rasta she flies into a rage and telephones Westminster City Council, demanding to speak to the rat-catcher. Westminster City Council lives in awe of Miss Lee, and immediately sends a rodent officer (or operator, or operative) who peers down manholes and leaves bits of cheese that he and the other rodent officers have soaked in poison. But they never catch Rasta. Quite by chance, I discovered this week that it was Westminster City Council, back in 1944, that first started calling its rat-catchers rodent officers - a feat for which it gets a star mention in The Politically Correct Phrasebook by Nigel Rees, which Bloomsbury has just published (Pounds 12.99). Until I read this book I had assumed, lackadaisically, that PC and its terminology were as doomed as they are execrable - an American invention that would shortly wither and die, so long as people like me continued to use vigorous words vigorously. Here, for example, are some words and phrases I use often which are now judged to be politically incorrect: knacker, subnormal, menopause, victim of, unemployed, vagrant, sunset years, spinster, stout, mature woman, Christmas, jungle, human, history, homosexual, hackette, handicapped, fat, buxom, fleshy, plump, obese, cleaning lady, dwarf, bonny, broke, burglar and boring. Boring? To be politically correct, we should say differently interesting. Fat? Stout? Plump? Buxom? Fleshy? Obese? According to Nigel Rees: 'Differently sized appears to be the front-running substitute at the moment, with differently weighted somewhat to the rear. Or you can talk about a person with an alternative body image.' Spinster? Use, rather, single-by-choice. An old maid is now a single-by-choice senior citizen. Jungle? It has derogatory associations. Use tropical rain forest. Hackette? The addition of '-ette' to any standard (male) word is now far beyond the pale. So out go suffragette, hackette, bachelorette and, especially, says Rees, majorette. Yet I am fond of majorette. It is a word with resonance. I am even fonder of hackette. To put things bluntly, hackette is not a word I plan to stop using. It is a beautiful word that means female journalist, and is apposite in the extreme. The reason I say this is that all the female journalists I know wear exceedingly short skirts, fishnet stockings, down-at-heel boots and orange make-up. They are strident and manipulative. Many of them bite their nails. Their hair can be quite greasy. They smoke and they curse and often, at lunchtime - I have seen this with my own eyes - they consume erotically-named cocktails and Pounds 30 bottles of wine while thrusting their blowsy charms on anyone who will listen to them. They are . . . hackettes, and ever more shall be so. Nor do I ever plan to stop using beautiful, brassy words like fat, buxom, fleshy, vagrant, spinster, human, burglar, broke or boring. Nigel Rees explains that many PC coinages are but jocular inventions, including the -challenged suffix designed to portray personal disadvantages in a more kindly light - ethnically challenged for Jewish, morally challenged for criminal, metabolically challenged for dead. And he picks his way with care in explaining how PC in its weirder, more threatening forms should be distinguished from efforts to find appropriate and inoffensive expressions - justified euphemisms - for describing, for example, people with physical or mental disabilities ('Down's syndrome' for 'mongolism'). But he warns us of the consequences when everyday realities are dressed up over-tastefully and ambiguously so as to pander to the squeamish. And he laments the tendency of the PC movement to replace direct and colourful words with dull, lifeless ones. Next week I plan to use the word hackette 90 times a day. And fat. And fleshy. And buxom. Buxom buxom buxom buxom buxom. I also quite like wop.</p>

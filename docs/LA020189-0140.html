			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAI EXTENDS OFFER, SAYS 72.6% OF PRIME SHARES ARE TENDERED  </P> <P> MAI Basic Four said Tuesday that 72.6% of Prime Computer's common stock  outstanding has been tendered under its $970-million takeover offer for Prime.  </P> <P> At the same time, the company extended its offer until midnight EST on Feb. 15.  </P> <P> As of midnight Monday, 33 million Prime common shares had been surrendered,  together with 1.9 million shares already owned by MAI and an affiliate.  </P> <P> MAI has said its offer is contingent upon at least 67% of Prime's 61.8 million  common shares and equivalents being tendered. When all types of Prime shares  are taken into account -- including bonds convertible into stock -- only 57% of  Prime's shares have been tendered.  </P> <P> MAI, a Tustin computer company, launched its $20-a-share buyout offer on Nov.  15. Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer manufacturer, has strongly resisted  the offer. DAVID OLMOS  </P></p>

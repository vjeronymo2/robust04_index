			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Egyptian cabinet reshuffle completed MR ATEF SIKDI, Egypt's prime minister, yesterday completed a cabinet reshuffle, shifting 15 ministers and dropping 11 from the 34-strong government, but leaving the powerful defence, interior and central economic portfolios unchanged. The reshuffle, Egypt's first for two years, follows the former cabinet's formal resignation on this week's opening of President Hosni Mubarak's third six-year term as head of state. The change keeps largely intact the team that has overseen the first stages of International Monetary Fund and World Bank economic reforms, with Mr Atef Obeid, cabinet affairs minister, Mr Mohammed al-Razzaz, finance minister, and Mr Kemal al-Ganzoury, planning minister, all staying put. Mr Yousef Boutros Ghali will remain a key interlocutor in the IMF and World Bank negotiations, moving from a ministry of state to that of international co-operation. However, Mr Mahmoud Mohamed Mahmoud, a banker, replaces Mr Yousry Moustafa as minister of economy and foreign trade. Mr Fouad Sultan, tourism minister, is replaced by Mr Mamdouh Beltagui, formerly head of state information services. Mr Sidki, who has served as prime minister since 1986, said on Wednesday that Mr Ismail Hassan, chairman of the Bank of Alexandria, would replace Mr Mohammed Salheddin Hamid as governor of the central bank. Eleven ministers are unchanged, including defence, energy, information, interior, foreign affairs, culture, justice, and petroleum. New portfolios have been created for population, immigration, and housing, and one for 'follow up' - a post so far ill-defined. Independent commentators suggested the changes, though numerous, did not signal any fundamental deviation from Mr Mubarak's cautious approach to economic and political reforms. 'The basic characteristic of this is continuity; they don't want to do anything drastic,' one political analyst said. Case for reform, Page 20</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: ASH sees US growth following Sonitrol buy AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), the supplier of burglar alarms and other security devices, has agreed to buy Sonitrol Corporation, the largest franchiser of audio alarm verification systems in the US, for Dollars 42m (Pounds 21.1m) cash. Sonitrol has 170 franchises in North America and Europe covering 100,000 systems. The alarms are connected to a central station which verifies the threat is real rather than a system failure. ASH raised Pounds 150m in July from the sale of its European security and specialist CCTV business to Sensormatics Electronics. This eliminated borrowings, although the company still has Pounds 57m of convertible capital bonds. Some of the proceeds from the disposal will be used to fund the acquisition, although it intends to refinance the purchase into dollar borrowings. Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, said that about one third of revenues following the acquisition would come from North America. However, this could rise to a half in the next three to five years as there was more scope for growth in the US than in the UK. Following the acquisition, ASH will also own 22 Sonitrol franchises, with minority holdings in a further four. The company will have first refusal if any are sold. Mr Buffett said the company was keen to acquire more franchises, but only where they fitted in with its existing network.</p>

The survey was conducted nationwide, and 1,753 people were  polled from 25 to 27 February. This is the first poll conducted  since 8 February when the Electoral Tribunal closed the  registration period for candidates to elective office. According  to the poll, Perez Balladares continues to be the favorite  candidate, with his support increasing by 5 percent. The poll  revealed that if the elections were held today, 37.3 percent of  the people would vote for Perez Balladares. This reflects an  increase in the number of followers of the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] candidate. He registered a 32.1 percent  popularity rate in the last poll taken on 27 January.    Meanwhile, Ruben Carles, presidential candidate for Molirena  [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement], Morena [National  Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal parties, came in second  place with 20.5 percent. Carles' popularity rate rose 7.3  percent from the previous poll, in which he placed third with  13.2 percent of the votes.    Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement's presidential candidate,  suffered the largest decrease in popularity in this poll by  registering only a 9.9 percent popularity rate, which placed him  third among the candidates chosen to win the 8 May election.  Blades registered 18.9 percent in late January.    As for the other presidential candidates, the poll showed,  in  descending order, that Mireya de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party  registered 8.1 percent, Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian  Democratic Party (PDC) registered 3 percent, Samuel Lewis  Galindo of Solidarity Party registered 2.8 percent, and Jose  Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party registered  0.2 percent. Compared to the previous poll, Gruber's popularity  rating decreased by 1.7 percent. Vallarino, meanwhile, in his  first appearance in a poll showed a 3-percent popularity rate,  which is lower than the 4 percent that his fellow party member  Ricardo Arias Calderon registered before withdrawing his  candidacy due to health problems. As for Lewis Galindo, his  popularity increased by 2 percent, while Munoz appeared for the  first time in the voters' preference list.</p>

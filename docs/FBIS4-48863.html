			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Civilians in the Liberian town of Tubmanburg are in  an increasingly desperate state because of the continued  fighting between the Roosevelt Johnson and Alhaji Koromah  factions of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia]. Tubmanburg fell to Johnson's forces last week in the  latest flare up of fighting, but Alhaji Koromah claims to be  fighting back and there have been allegations that ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] troops are helping the Johnson faction. And, as Nii  Nartey Allison reports in this fax from Monrovia, there have  been more clashes in Tubmanburg today:    UN officials said here today that the Mandingo and the Krahn  factions were occupying the hills surrounding the city, and that  no particular group appears to be in control of Tubmanburg  center. According to one UN official, the situation changes  every hour and it is quite desperate for the civilian  population. The UN official said that at least 10,000 people  have fled Tubmanburg and were now seeking refuge at the only  government hospital and at the base camps of the African  peacekeeping force. He added that there was no water and that  food and medicine supplies were running out. He said that there  was also a problem of shelter, with more people still flocking  into the safe zone. A planned UN convoy carrying 21 metric tons  of badly needed food and medicines, scheduled to have been  escorted today into Tubmanburg by heavily armed African  peacekeeping troops, is being delayed by the fighting.</p>

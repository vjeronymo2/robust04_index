			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDEFINITE WAIT IN GULF IS OUT, BUSH AIDE SAYS  </P> <P> The United States cannot afford to allow the conflict with Iraq to drag out  indefinitely and is determined to bring it to a head, a senior Bush  Administration official said Friday, explaining the President's decision to  virtually double the size of the U.S. force in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> And an actual ultimatum to Iraq's Saddam Hussein could be the "next step" once  all the new troops are in place by early January, said the official, who has  been involved in every facet of Bush's plans for the gulf operation.  </P> <P> "It is important to put some finite perspective" on the current standoff, the  official said. "We're not prepared to give this guy unlimited time." With so  much now at stake, he added, failure would be "pretty catastrophic."  </P> <P> While some officials had suggested that war is likely, others in the  Administration and in allied governments had stressed the possibility of an  extended stalemate -- one lasting well into next year and perhaps longer --  during which the United States and its allies would wait to see if economic  pressure would force Hussein to yield.  </P> <P> The decision to send massive new American forces to the gulf marks a rejection  of the latter strategy. The Administration, officials made clear, is now set  inexorably on a path that will lead to war unless Hussein backs out.  </P> <P> While economic sanctions have had some impact on Hussein, they have not reached  "the point where he is seriously constrained," said the official, who spoke on  condition that he not be named. "Waiting two, three years to starve him out is  not a good idea," he said.  </P> <P> "It is still not crystal-clear that Saddam Hussein is taking us seriously," the  official said. "He's still playing games -- some of them with considerable  skill -- to divide the coalition."  </P> <P> And at least until Thursday's announcement of the expanded U.S. deployment,  Hussein's apparent belief that "time is on his side" might have been  "rational," the official said.  </P> <P> The U.S. force in the gulf, he noted, faces two major constraints. On the one  side, Saudi Arabian officials cannot tolerate a huge U.S. presence in their  country for as long as would be needed to "starve him out." On the other, U.S.  commanders cannot afford to keep huge forces in the gulf for an extended  period.  </P> <P> "As weeks grow into months, you lose your edge, morale goes down," he said.  </P> <P> Outside analysts have expressed similar sentiments. "The United States will  either have to go to war early next year or face extremely difficult  decisions," said Marvin Feuerwerger of the Washington Institute for Near East  Policy. "The United States will not be able to maintain 400,000 troops in the  Persian Gulf region for long without drastic measures," such as resuming the  draft, Feuerwerger said.  </P> <P> Administration officials essentially agree with that analysis. As a result,  they deliberately have designed the second phase of the U.S. buildup to allow a  military strike to be made quickly, before public support for Bush's policy  begins to erode seriously.  </P> <P> In Vietnam, the official added, the United States deployed troops without being  able to say that "in the end, we're going to be able to wrap this up." This  time, the Administration is determined to "make sure we can deliver whatever it  is that is necessary."  </P> <P> Until now, the official said, "no one" of the many foreign governments that  have sent emissaries to Iraq "has come back with any sense that Saddam Hussein  is wavering . . . that there is any hope."  </P> <P> The decision to add more than 200,000 troops to the deployment was designed  partly to get ready for war if Hussein refuses to withdraw from Kuwait and  partly as a dramatic gesture "to affect (Hussein's) thought processes . . . to  convince him that we are serious."  </P> <P> The events leading up to the decision began weeks ago with the realization that  Iraq had deployed far more troops in Kuwait than U.S. military officials  initially had foreseen.  </P> <P> U.S. planners originally had believed that an American force of about 230,000  troops would be adequate both to defend Saudi Arabia and to invade occupied  Kuwait, if necessary. But after the deployment began, Hussein started sending  in reinforcements, eventually doubling his forces to an estimated 430,000  troops on the ground.  </P> <P> "A force that is now adequate for defense, in late August was (believed to be)  adequate for more than that," the official said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have retained the option of expanding the American force even  more if necessary, but they do not believe that Iraq is capable of further  escalation.  </P> <P> At the United Nations, meanwhile, the steering committee of the General  Assembly rejected an attempt by Iraq to persuade the Assembly to debate the  Administration's expanded military buildup in the gulf.  </P> <P> Ten speakers objected to Iraq's bid, and the 29-member committee eventually  approved without taking a vote on a motion by the Canadian ambassador to take  no action on the request by Hussein's government.  </P> <P> In lobbying to add the new item to the General Assembly's agenda, Iraq's  delegate, Adnan Mohammed, charged that the Bush Administration "blew the horns  of war" and "was leading the world toward a catastrophe."  </P> <P> But Saudi Arabia's ambassador, Samir S. Shihabi, countered that Iraq's motion  was an "immoral act" and a "distortion of the facts."  </P> <P> His view was seconded by U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, who called the  Iraqi requests "so improper, so ill-founded, so mendacious and so tendentious  that it is simply impossible to recommend that the General Assembly deal with  them."  </P> <P> In the weeks ahead, U.S. diplomats are expected to push for U.N. Security  Council approval of a new resolution that would provide standby authority to  use military force if Iraq's occupation of Kuwait continues.  </P> <P> Bush consistently has maintained that the U.N. Charter's provisions for  self-defense provide authority for U.S. forces to attack Iraq at the request of  Kuwait's government. But the Administration believes that approval of a more  explicit U.N. resolution would help solidify the international coalition  against Iraq.  </P> <P> Under the standard monthly rotation of the Security Council's chairmanship, the  United States heads the council this month. On Dec. 1, however, it will turn  over the chairmanship to Yemen, which has mildly supported Iraq. As a result,  U.S. diplomats hope to complete action on a new resolution this month.  </P> <P> The extent of support that American diplomats will be able to bring to an  eventual vote is uncertain. Some Security Council members, including China, are  cautious, preferring to give existing sanctions and private diplomacy a chance  to work for several more months.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John J. Goldman, at the United Nations, contributed to this  report.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: A6-A16  </P></p>

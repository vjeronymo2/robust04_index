			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Malaysia air plan shelved Plans announced earlier this year for the formation of a second Malaysian airline have been indefinitely postponed, Mr Ling Liong Sik, transport minister, said, Kieran Cooke reports from Kuala Lumpur. Mr Ling gave no reason for the move. In January, the government announced the go-ahead for the airline, to be called Air Asia. It was expected it would take over a number of domestic and regional routes from Malaysia Airlines, the national carrier. Hicom, the government's heavy industrial investment company which has recently been partially privatised, has a 45 per cent stake in Air Asia.</p>

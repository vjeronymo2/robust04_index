Trifonova, A.A. Nazaryan, L.T. Sushkova, </F> and S.M. Arakelyan, Vladimir Polytechnic Institute; UDC 551.501]    [Abstract] Comprehensive studies of the environment  covering specifically the populated territory of Armenia, had  been made by these and other authors using optical methods. The  purpose was to explore the interaction and interdependence of  three factors: 1. ecological state of the still natural part of  the geosystem, 2. human agricultural and industrial activity, 3.  indirect transitory technogenic action on the geosystem. The  method used in these studies was laser-fluorescent remote  sounding of the earth surface and appropriate subsequent  processing of the data. The conventional correlation coefficient  was used for simplest and fastest rough identification of  objects. Pattern recognition algorithms were used for a more  informative but also more laborious identification of their  spectra, which included use of four already known vegetation  spectra as reference: 1. herbaceous monocotyledons, 2.  herbaceous dicotyledons, 3. arboreal pinophyta (needle trees),  4. arboreal magnoliophyta (leaf trees). Natural objects  contributing to global transitory contamination of the  environment, specifically rocky river beds and water basins  forming along their paths, were of particular concern. The  creation and evolution of these objects were simulated with the  aid of aerial photographs, the role of geometric factors also  being accounted for. The thus constructed ecological model is a  rather universal model describing the physics of destruction of  solid bodies and particularly of their breakdown by laser  action. References 34.</p>

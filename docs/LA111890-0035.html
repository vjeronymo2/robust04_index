			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOLDY OLDIES  </P> <P> So the British have to listen to new records on the radio instead of the ones  they already own (Jeff Kaye, "It's Not Only Rock and Roll," Oct. 21).  </P> <P> Maybe that's why young bands like the Pixies can develop big followings in  Europe, while still being outsold by the Doors over here.  </P> <P> Pretending that yesterday's pop is "serious" rock is only a rationalization by  thirtysome- things who still like the radio but hate the new "bubble-gum" music  -- just as their parents did 20 years ago. The British Radio Authority is  right: We don't need to hear "Stairway to Heaven" on the radio anymore. We can  hear it on elevators now.  </P> <P> JEFF ROSS  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

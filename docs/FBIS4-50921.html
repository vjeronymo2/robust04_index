			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The United States and  France differ over the lifting of the international sanctions  against Iraq, according to a MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY (MENA)  report from Paris today.    The MENA report, citing the Paris weekly "L'EVENEMENT DE  JEUDI," said that the United States, backed by Britain, still  thinks it premature to lift the international embargo against  Iraq, which was imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of  Kuwait.    However, the weekly said that France, backed by Russia and  China, stands for lifting the sanctions.    MENA said that the change in the French stand came slowly  after much hesitation.    Currently, French companies are preparing to secure the  lion's share in Iraqi contracts after American companies  clinched two big contracts in Saudi Arabia, the weekly said.    The economic incentives might have been the reason that  prompted Paris to accelerate its steps toward lifting the  embargo on Iraq, it added.    According to MENA, two events have shown the improvement in  France's position on Iraq. The first one was an announcement by  the French Government to terminate its participation in  monitoring the embargo, and the second is the tendency to open a  section to look after the French interests in Iraq.    "The Iraqis believe that the change in France's stand is a  positive step toward better bilateral relations, and they are  awaiting more to come in the coming few weeks," the news agency  said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complexity of the legal opinions will vary according to the extent and nature of the bank's involvement in rate contracts. For instance, a bank that is active in the international financial markets may need opinions covering multiple foreign jurisdictions as well as domestic law. The FDIC expects that in many cases a legal opinion will focus on whether a contractual choice of law would be recognized in the event of default, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances in a particular jurisdiction rather than whether the jurisdiction recognizes netting. For example, a U.S. institution might engage in interest rate swaps with a non-U.S. institution under a netting contract that includes a provision that the contract will be governed by U.S. law. In this case the U.S. institution should obtain a legal opinion as to whether the netting would be upheld in the U.S. and whether the foreign courts would honor the choice of U.S. law in default or in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a bank that engages solely in domestic rate contracts, the process of obtaining a legal opinion may be much simpler. For example, for an institution that is an end-user of a relatively small volume of domestic rate contracts, the standard contracts used by the dealer bank may already have been subject to the mandated legal review. In this case the end-user institution may obtain a copy of the opinion covering the standard dealer contracts, supported by the bank's own legal opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments require a bank to establish procedures to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law. This review would apply to any conditions that, according to the required legal opinions, are a prerequisite for the enforceability of the netting contract, as well as to any adverse changes in the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with all of the provisions of the risk-based capital standards, a bank must maintain in its files documentation adequate to support any particular risk-based capital treatment. In the case of a bilateral netting contract, a bank must maintain in its files documentation adequate to support the bilateral netting contract. In particular, this documentation should demonstrate that the bilateral netting contract would be honored in all relevant jurisdictions as set forth in this rule. Typically, these documents would include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, legal opinions and any related English translations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

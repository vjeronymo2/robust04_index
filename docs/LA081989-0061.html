			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELTA 2 ROCKET ORBITS 3RD SATELLITE IN A ROW  </P> <P> An Air Force Delta 2 rocket, chalking up its third straight success, hurled a  $65-million military satellite into orbit Friday in a pre-dawn flight visible  for miles along the Florida coast.  </P> <P> The Air Force reported 30 minutes after liftoff that the 128-foot-tall rocket  had performed flawlessly and had propelled the satellite into an initial  elliptical orbit.  </P> <P> "The Delta 2 has put its payload into a successful orbit," said Lt. Col. Ron  Rand, the launching control center commentator.  </P> <P> Ground controllers will command an on-board motor to fire Sunday to shift the  satellite into a circular orbit 11,000 miles above the Earth.  </P> <P> The $30-million Delta rocket carries a Navstar Global Positioning System  Satellite, the third in a new series of spacecraft that enable military units  such as aircraft, ships, submarines, tanks and field troops to determine their  location within 50 feet.  </P> <P> The satellites, effective in any kind of weather, also keep track of military  units' speed within a fraction of a mile per hour.  </P></p>

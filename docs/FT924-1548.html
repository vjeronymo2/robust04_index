			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wentworth action against ex-chief WENTWORTH International Group, led by Mr Robert Gill, has launched legal proceedings against Mr Haque Khan, former chairman and chief executive, who left in July. The USM-quoted plastic packaging products group, whose shares have been suspended at 3p since October 20 pending its delayed results, has obtained an injunction against Mr Haque, with the aim of recovering Pounds 1.5m, most of which relates to the acquisition of Exmapla. The new board yesterday announced that in the year to March 31 pre-tax losses came to Pounds 4.05m, against restated profits of Pounds 63,000 or Pounds 1.21m as previously reported. Losses per share emerged at 3.89p (losses 0.13p or earnings of 1.7p respectively). Turnover was Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 18.4m). There is no dividend. The new board is refocusing the group, which is 61.3 per cent owned by an arm of Banque Indosuez. Edwards, the Belgian corrugated packaging company, is to be sold and Exmapla is to be closed. In the six months to September 30 pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.82m on turnover of Pounds 14.6m after interest charges of Pounds 1.03m. Losses per share totalled 1.68p.</p>

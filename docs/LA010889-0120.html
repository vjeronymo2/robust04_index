			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE WRONG CHOICE BY KING COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Some time ago, a group of community leaders began a quest to honor the civil  rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Out of this noble intention grew the  embarrassment of Market Street, in which citizens petitioned and overturned the  City Council's decision to rename the street for Dr. King. Angered and more  determined, this group began a catharsis in the form of a committee, the Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute Committee, to seek out a new, and perhaps better  and more successful effort, to honor Dr. King.  </P> <P> One of the first tasks was to outline the details to be considered if the goal  was to be reached. Given priority was the agreement not to change the name of  anything. Instead, the committee decided something new should be created.  Meetings were held, politicians pursued, support from the business community  garnered and opinions sought.  </P> <P> The task must have been too formidable for the committee. Instead of something  really creative and unique, the easier, less costly route of renaming the  convention center was decided. No money needed to be raised, total community  consensus could be bypassed and the committee didn't have to get it built or  decide what it should look like. It was just a simple matter of a name change.  To do that, all they needed was to lobby the San Diego Unified Port District,  acting as the developer of the structure, and the City Council, acting as the  tenant and operator.  </P> <P> The convention center was named more than two years ago as a part of the lease  between the port and the city. That name, San Diego Convention Center, was  decided after much thought. The center's purpose is to attract conventions that  bolster our economy. An easy-to-say name that clearly identifies the community  is a marketing plus. To that end, San Diego has already spent two years and  almost $2 million promoting the San Diego Convention Center name across the  country.  </P> <P> The Dr. King memorial committee must have been oblivious to the simple fact  that, not only does the center already have a name, but that a great effort has  already been made to promote that name. They probably knew but decided to go  for the name change anyway. It certainly makes their task easy.  </P> <P> The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute Committee should be challenged to spend  the 10 years that the visitor industry spent to get the convention center built  to arrive at its goal. Its challenge is to develop a new, original memorial to  Dr. King, not to steal another group's project.  </P> <P> STEVE WEATHERS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

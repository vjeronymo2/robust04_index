			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Hit by Wall Street's devastating overnight performance, stock index futures had nowhere to hide and retreated rapidly from the outset in heavy two-way trading, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the end of pit trading, the FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,025, down 54 for a three-day drop of 115 points. It closed at a two-point discount to the cash market and more than seven points below fair value. For once the price action was fully reflected in levels of volume, with contract numbers jumping to 19,932 - compared with 11,220 on Tuesday and less than 7,000 on Monday - having been above 8,000 in the first two hours of trading. Activity was at times frantic, notably when the US market came in at 2.30pm London time with further heavy losses. But traders said there was little panic, citing the relatively unadventurous cash market discount which seldom extended beyond two points throughout the session. Wall Street continues to dictate immediate direction. If the December contract falls through 3,000, the next support level is around 2,980. In late screen-based trading it hit 3,015. The volatility washed over into traded options, where volume powered ahead to 80,982 lots, up from 35,852 on Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE turnover accounted for almost 50,000 contracts.</p>

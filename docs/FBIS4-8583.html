			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Koev: "Bulgarian Minister's Visit to </F> Macedonia Ends With Scandal"]    [Text] Skopje, April 14 (BTA) -- The two-day official visit  of Bulgarian Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov to  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  was broken off yesterday [13 April].    Having conferred with his Macedonian counterparts Selmani  and  Bajaldziev on April 12, at the end of his visit Todorov was to  sign a protocol on cooperation between the similar ministries of  the two countries. The document, coordinated in advance with  Macedonian experts in Sofia, said that the protocol was to be  signed in the official languages in Bulgaria and Macedonia.    Yesterday the Macedonian side demanded that this established  wording in bilateral practice and documentation be substituted  for "the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages." The Bulgarian  side refused to sign the document which marked the end of the  visit which also envisaged a meeting with Macedonian Prime  Minister Branko Crvenkovski.    Returning to Sofia, Minister Marko Todorov made a statement  for the media saying there is no Macedonian language. In his  opinion, it will be a betrayal of the Bulgarian language to  recognize Macedonian as a foreign language. "I maintain that  the formulation which Bulgaria suggests, `the official languages  of the two countries,' is flexible and acceptable enough as it  places Bulgaria and Macedonia on an equal footing," he said.  Mr. Todorov expects that the language problem will be settled  by signing the governmental agreement on cooperation between  Bulgaria and Macedonia in science, education and culture, and  that this will help make an adequate political decision. In  Minister Todorov's view, the differences are temporary and it is  to the interest of both Bulgaria and Macedonia to maintain good  relations.</p>

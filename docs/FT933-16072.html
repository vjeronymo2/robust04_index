			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Return to tender - New legislation which should make it easier to secure EC public-sector contracts Envopak Group, a manufacturer of reusable mail pouches and mail room equipment, has had mixed experience of selling to public authorities in continental Europe. 'We have had fewer successes than failures,' admits Ric Skoulding, international director of the Sidcup, Kent-based company. Even for a business which has been exporting for nearly 30 years and which achieves a quarter of its Pounds 15m turnover overseas, the tendering process for public-sector contracts is fraught with difficulties. 'You only have to fail on one point and you are out,' says Skoulding. Undeterred by these problems, Envopak has been honing its techniques. 'We have been building up a fund of information and we will be ready for the next one.' One lesson Envopak has learned is the importance of having a good local source of information, in the shape of a distributor or agent, on forthcoming tenders so as to be able to respond in time. A recent invitation to supply mail sacks to the German Post Office did not leave enough time to research the materials and produce samples. It is to overcome at least some of the problems associated with winning foreign tenders that a raft of new European Community legislation has been introduced over the past five years. No fewer than six directives have been passed to open up public procurement markets. The aim is to extend the workings of the single market to the public sector by preventing governments, local authorities and the water, transport and power companies from discriminating against foreign suppliers. The often secretive tendering process is being opened up and buyers are being forced to apply objective criteria in choosing suppliers. 'One of the purposes of the directives is to sever the link between the politicians and the buying decision,' comments Jeremy Miles, chairman of Quasar Microwave Technology, which exports 60 per cent of its Pounds 3m turnover. Previous attempts to open up the public procurement market, which accounts for no less than 15 per cent of the European Community's domestic product, achieved only limited success because the rules for enforcement were inadequate. The latest legislation is backed by tougher compliance directives and, while most companies are reluctant to go to court against potential customers, lawyers report an increase in litigation in this area. The latest directive, covering public services, took effect in the UK as recently as last week, on July 1. UK legislation covering public works, supplies and utilities, both publicly and privately-owned, was introduced earlier while an extension of the utilities directive, to cover services as well as works and supplies, is due to take effect in July 1994. Key to the new regime is the requirement that public authorities publish the details of their contracts. This they are obliged to do in the S series of the EC's Official Journal, available on subscription. The information is also available through an EC electronic database, Tenders Electronic Daily, which classifies contract notices by product and industry. The publication of tender information occurs at three stages in the life of a contract. Periodic indicative notices (PINs) provide advance warning of forthcoming tenders. These are followed by details of individual contracts. Finally, an announcement that a contract has been awarded must be made within 48 days. Under the new directives public authorities must provide enough information for all potential bidders to take part and must not use, for example, trademarks which would exclude some suppliers. Technical specifications must not be used to exclude bidders and if a European standard exists it must be used. Progress towards this goal is still only partial, reports Ian Anderson, general sales manager of Houseman, a supplier of water treatment systems. Some contracts still specify membership of a national professional body or certification by a particular organisation, he says. To avoid imposing an impossible burden on public authorities the EC has set minimum thresholds for contracts which must be publicised. Works contracts valued at less than Ecu5m (Pounds 3.5m) need not be notified. A threshold of Ecu 200,000 applies to supplies contracts unless they are awarded by a utility, in which case the threshold is Ecu 400,000 (Ecu 600,000 for telecommunications contracts). For services contracts a minimum of Ecu 200,000 applies. The temptation for public authorities and utilities would be to break up contracts to keep them below the thresholds, though EC lawmakers have attempted to prevent this. Repair work on different parts of the same building would probably have to be aggregated into a single contract but a contract to repair buildings spread over different faculties of a university campus might be considered separate contracts. 'The authority must make a sensible decision based on whether the works are close enough together in place or time or if they would all be handled by one main contractor,' Mark Lane, a partner of solicitors Masons, told a conference arranged by ICM Marketing last week. Public authorities must also decide on which of the three possible procedures they will follow. They have a choice of the open procedure, whereby all interested contractors or suppliers may submit a tender; the restricted procedure, when only invited suppliers may tender; and the negotiated procedure, whereby the authority consults suppliers of its choice and negotiates the terms of the contract with one or more of them. If the purchaser is a utility it has greater freedom in its choice of procedure providing it has published a contract notice, a PIN or details of any pre-qualification system it operates. This is an area where the European Commission's desire for more open public procurement clashes with the wish on the part of many utilities to develop closer links with chosen suppliers, sometimes known as 'partnership sourcing' agreements. Utilities are allowed to operate qualification systems for would-be contractors or suppliers, providing they are based on objective criteria. Once the purchaser has assessed all the bids it must then award the contract either on the basis of the lowest price or 'the most economically advantageous' tender. This allows the public authority or utility to take into account more subjective factors but the criteria used must be published, where possible in descending order of importance, Lane suggests. Abnormally low bids may not be rejected without the purchaser having first found out why the bid was so low. Even after these legislative changes, tendering for cross-border public-sector contracts can be a daunting process. Independent Facility Management, a Berkshire-based company which provides building consultancy and management services, first looked at the European contracts market in earnest in February and now subscribes to the Official Journal. But the company, which employs 29 people and has fee income of Pounds 1.4m, has focused its efforts on breaking into the UK public contracts market. 'We have concentrated on getting our name in front of as many government departments as possible,' says James Whitehouse, sales director. 'We would tender for an overseas contract if one came up but would then face the language problem and the cost of attending interviews in continental Europe. It would be a poor use of our resources to tackle Europe when we have yet to develop our home market.' It may well make sense for companies new to public-sector markets to start at home. But in the longer term, if the EC's initiative is successful, a very large European market place will be opened up. The Official Journal can be ordered from government publishing organisations such as HMSO in the UK or consulted at Euro Info Centres and chambers of commerce.

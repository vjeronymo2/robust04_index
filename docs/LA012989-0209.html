			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG FIRM STOCK UP ON NEWS OF POSSIBLE RECONSIDERATION OF ITS AIDS MEDICINE  </P> <P> Newport Pharmaceuticals International, which 2 months ago halted its research  on a potential AIDS medication called Isoprinosine, said Friday that its  decision could be reconsidered in light of a new study by an affiliate in  Denmark.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach drug company warned, however, that the results of clinical  trials in Scandinavia are "very preliminary" and have yet to be reviewed by the  firm.  </P> <P> Despite those reservations, Newport stock soared 71% after the preliminary  findings were disclosed late Thursday. The stock closed Friday at $3 a share,  up $1.25, on heavy over-the-counter trading of 1.1 million shares.  </P> <P> Newport stock had fallen from $5.75 to $2.25 a share in November when the  company announced that it would discontinue its research efforts in the wake of  a disappointing clinical trial in the United States and Britain.  </P> <P> The more recent Scandinavian tests, conducted at 21 hospitals in Denmark and  Sweden since late 1986, involved patients infected with HIV, the virus that  causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> Half of the 866 patients were treated with Isoprinosine and half were given  placebos. The preliminary results, as reported by Newport's licensee in  Denmark, Leo Pharmaceutical Products, showed a "significantly smaller number of  patients in the (Isoprinosine) group developed AIDS, as compared with the  placebo group."  </P> <P> "But this is only the initial result," said Judith Woodward Archbold, Newport's  vice president and legal counsel. "We haven't seen the data and cannot comment  on whether it will warrant our filing for approval with the FDA."  </P> <P> She said Newport's research department remains closed but could be reopened if  the review of the Scandinavian data is positive.  </P> <P> Newport has been trying for several years to gain Food and Drug Administration  approval to market Isoprinosine in the United States. The drug -- the company's  only proprietary product -- is marketed in 70 foreign countries for treatment  of several viral diseases, including herpes. It also has been approved for use  as an AIDS medication in New Zealand and the Philippines.  </P> <P> But clinical trials in this country have not produced results that have  satisfied the FDA, and the test results announced in mid-November seemed to end  Newport's domestic efforts.  </P> <P> The tests, conducted over a 6-month period in hospitals in the United States  and the United Kingdom, failed to show any significant differences between  patients with AIDS-related complex who were treated with Isoprinosine and those  treated with a placebo.  </P></p>

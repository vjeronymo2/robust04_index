			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Schools - An A-Z Guide (1): An image that is blurred by diversity - Though there are signs of a pick-up in demand for MBA courses and executive programmes, management institutions in the US and Europe are still hesistant Logically speaking, business schools should thrive in a period of uncertainty and rapid change. The knowledge, ideas and high octane brainpower with which the best ones are blessed, after all, are potentially priceless assets for companies seeking a competitive edge. Yet for all the campus insights into derivatives trading, global markets and how to harness information technology - not to mention 'softer' issues such as leadership and teamwork - management education institutions in the US and Europe are in a hesitant mood. There are tentative signs, to be sure, that demand for executive programmes has picked up and that more young managers may again be prepared to invest in their own futures by embarking on a full- or part-time Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree. But amid the fragile hopes for an early recovery, anxieties remain. Have business schools yet done enough to dispel their old image of inward-looking institutions semi-detached from the real world? If so, how do they retain the best academic values of the universities from which many were spawned while addressing the pressing short-term needs of their commercial customers? Is co-operation with competitors the only way to achieve critical mass internationally? And like the companies they advise, how do they hang on to, and manage, their own top talent? At least schools appear to be shaking off one persistent shadow, namely the never-very-convincing argument that formal management education is a waste of time, that there is no substitute for seat-of-the-pants learning. Few would quibble with the second part of that statement - hence the rethink of MBA courses to include more project work and the growth of short 'company specific' training programmes - but the ever-growing complexity of general management these days and the speed with which new ideas and information flow across national boundaries have also reinforced the value for executives of stepping outside their own immediate working environment from time to time. That message, however, now has to be powerfully sold by business schools in a way which was almost unnecessary in the more free-spending 1980s: the marketing of courses of all kinds is an increasingly sophisticated, time-consuming and expensive activity. The extra effort is partly the legacy of a recession which slashed corporate training budgets, reduced through 'delayering' the pool of middle managers who traditionally fill most seats in classrooms, and left those remaining in work so preoccupied with the task of self survival that 'time-outs' at business school became impractical. The job market, moreover, became markedly more difficult for graduating MBAs  -and salary premiums less juicy - requiring schools to invest much more energy in helping students with their careers. Even if there is anecdotal evidence of recessionary pressures starting to ease, the direction, scale and sustainability of demand remains far from clear. While top European and US schools are reporting more interest in executive programmes, the extent to which this has affected so-called company specific programmes as opposed to open ones (where participants come together from different organisations) seemingly varies from institution to institution. The MBA outlook is equally patchy. Professor George Bain, principal of London Business School, concedes that there has been an important shift in the market from full-time programmes to part-time courses which can be combined with a full-time job. LBS reduced the size of its recent full-time intake - 'to preserve the quality of participants' - but Prof Bain says the school is experiencing 'buoyant' demand for its (part-time) executive MBA. Prof Leo Murray, director of Cranfield School of Management, says demand for his full-time programme has recently been 'much better' - but he agrees that the market as a whole has continued to grow in the UK only because of the various part-time delivery mechanisms, notably distance learning. To a large extent, such diversity should be welcomed: it makes management education accessible to a far wider range of participants, not least managers in the public sector (or former public sector) who are much better represented on courses offered by the new universities or former polytechnics than they are in the more established business schools. On the other hand, the bewildering range of MBA suppliers today - the number of business schools increased fivefold in the UK in the 1980s - has altered the image of what was once a relatively uniform and internationally tradeable passport to business success. The market is no doubt the most reliable judge of quality and the American system of independent business school accreditation sometimes cited as a model far from ideal; nevertheless calls for tougher standards and better consumer protection are unlikely to fade away. 'It would be nice to be able to distinguish the real thing, like champagne,' says Mr Ludo Van der Heyden, co-dean of Insead. One issue which schools can no longer duck is the changing nature of their relationship with companies. As with all businesses, the customer is getting closer. To some extent this is a funding issue - Insead last year went out to corporate sponsors to build up an endowment of permanent capital - but it is also what big companies increasingly expect. 'In the past businesses looking for a company specific programme wanted just that - a programme,' explains one dean. 'Now it is a mix of learning, consulting and research. The course we run would be a catalyst for change throughout the whole organisation and would typically be preceded by a lot of consultancy.' Mr Mike Osbaldeston, chief executive of Ashridge in the UK, says that consultants and management educationalists now often work together. 'The dividing line is becoming increasingly blurred,' he suggests. 'Whether you are developing individual managers or organisations doesn't matter - companies themselves are trying to do both'. Mr Osbaldeston believes that business schools on the whole have thrown off their 'remote, academic and insufficiently practical' image, though he says the picture lingers on in some sections of the press. Nevertheless, formidable challenges remain as schools try to make sense of today's corporate quicksands, as much for themselves as for their clients. The need to be more international - in terms of students, faculty and course content - is one clear imperative but achieving the right balance has not been easy for institutions with mostly strong domestic roots. Hence the popularity of exchange programmes and alliances, a trend which is likely to lead to closer cross-border co-operation between schools. Business school curriculums, meanwhile, require more than just an international flavour. Much soul-searching has already been devoted to translating the old vertical approach (marketing, finance, economics, etc) into a more integrated, cross-functional teaching style (better reflecting real world problems). The experimentation phase has yet some way to go. The remaining contents of this survey - which concentrates largely on the MBA rather than company programmes as such - are an attempt to spell out some of these issues for would-be participants and recruiters alike.</p>

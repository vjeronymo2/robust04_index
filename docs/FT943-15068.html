			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Caracas exchange remains paralysed Most foreign exchange operations remained paralysed in Venezuela yesterday as the banking system began implementing a complicated exchange control system, backed by stiff penalties. The system was approved by the government at the weekend. Representatives of the country's main commercial banks met exchange control officials late on Sunday to discuss the details of the new system, but said it would take time to train employees and implement the controls effectively. Venezuelans have been unable to carry out exchange operations since the last day of foreign exchange trading on June 23. President Rafael Caldera announced the government's decision to impose controls on all foreign exchange transactions on June 27. Some bankers fear it may take another 10 days for many companies to obtain foreign currency. The Caldera administration is drawing up a law carrying stiff penalties, including jail sentences, for violations of the foreign exchange rules, and this has made the banks extremely careful in implementing the rules. There is no system yet in place that would guarantee customers did not abuse the foreign exchange regulations, for example by applying for the maximum limit at several different banks. Commercial banks were yesterday not buying or selling foreign exchange, and only one large exchange house said it would sell dollars to clients if they met the new official requirements. Most foreign businessmen and tourists are being forced to change small amounts of foreign currency at hotels, or on the street. Under the new system, commercial banks will sell foreign exchange to eligible clients at 170 Venezuelan bolivars per US dollar, plus a commission. The last trades on June 23 were at around 200 bolivars per dollar. See Leader Page feature</p>

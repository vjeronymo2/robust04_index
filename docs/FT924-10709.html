			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Economic growth remains sluggish A MIXED bag of economic reports yesterday signalled sluggish growth for the US economy. Orders in September for durable goods fell for the third consecutive month, while increases in personal incomes and consumption overstated the economy's underlying strength, according to Commerce Department reports. New orders for durable goods fell 0.4 per cent last month, surprising most analysts, who had forecast a modest rebound after declines of 0.4 per cent and 2.7 per cent in August and July respectively. However, the weakness last month mainly reflected sharp declines in the volatile sectors of defence and aerospace. Excluding defence, orders rose 0.5 per cent; excluding transport, they rose 2.1 per cent. Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts - the figure generally regarded as the best guide to trends in civilian investment  -rose a sharp 5.5 per cent in September. Personal income and consumption both rose 0.7 per cent - larger increases than expected. But the income figures were distorted by a rebound after Hurricane Andrew in August, and by subsidy payments to farmers. Excluding distortions, personal incomes rose only 0.1 per cent last month after a 0.6 per cent increase in August. Official figures indicated that the apparent rebound in consumption last month principally reflected price changes. After allowing for inflation, personal consumption spending rose 0.1 per cent, after remaining constant in August. The figures were consistent with other recent data indicating the underlying pace of economic growth is about 1.5 to 2 per cent, rather than the 2.7 per cent reported this week by the Commerce Department.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Philip Morris to shed 14,000 jobs Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, plans a drastic restructuring to defend its brands from low-cost competitors. It is to close or scale down 40 plants worldwide over the next few years, resulting in the loss of 14,000 jobs, about 8 per cent of its 168,000 workforce. The immediate effect of the action will be to produce a Dollars 457m (Pounds 307m) charge against net earnings in the fourth quarter of 1993. Another Dollars 495m will be wiped out by an accounting change relating to the treatment of severance payments. The combined effect will be to leave full-year 1993 net earnings 16 per cent lower than last year's Dollars 4.9bn, the company said. But Philip Morris said the longer-term effect of its action would be to reduce operating costs by Dollars 1bn a year, producing extra funds for investment and increasing after-tax profits by about Dollars 600m a year by 1997. Investors appeared to welcome the cost-cutting plan. The company had already warned that the current year's earnings would take a restructuring charge, and the shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 1/2 in anticipation of future profits growth. Philip Morris's action comes as further evidence of the pressure facing manufacturers of branded goods as consumers in depressed international markets switch to cheaper products. The group's brands include Marlboro - the world's biggest-selling cigarette  -Kraft cheese, Maxwell House coffee, Vegemite spread and Toblerone chocolate. Earlier this year Philip Morris showed its determination to defend its US cigarette market against inroads by low-cost competitors by reducing the price of Marlboro and its other premium brands by 20 per cent, so provoking a price war. Yesterday, however, the company emphasised that the cost-cutting plans were aimed not just at cigarette manufacturing but at all its products. Mr Michael Miles, chairman, said they reflected the company's determination to be the lowest-cost producer in all its core operations. Philip Morris refused to say which plants would be closed or to offer any geographical breakdown of the job cuts. It said most of the job losses would come in the consolidation of manufacturing resulting from more efficient manufacturing methods. Some of the planned actions will be started before the end of this year, with the company seeking to minimise the need for compulsory redundancies. US stocks, Page 37</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dirk Van Eeden] </F>   [Text] General Basie Smit, the SAP's [South African Police]  second in command and alleged commander of the "Third Force",  yesterday denied any involvement in criminal activity and said  he was outraged at being put on mandatory leave by President  F.W. de Klerk. "In all my years as a detective, even while  working in the drug squad, I have never treated anybody in this  manner, not even a prostitute," he said.    Flanked by two legal representatives at his Pretoria home  yesterday, General Smit said he had a good idea of the identity  of the mysterious Mr Q, the key witness who gave evidence to the  Goldstone commission against three top generals.    The generals were waiting for a senior advocate to come back  to them before taking legal action.    General Smit, one of a number of officers suspended  yesterday, denied claims before the Goldstone commission that he  had overseen the manufacture and distribution of weapons to  Inkatha. "Not in a million years would it be possible,  practical or true that I would get involved in deliberately  destabilising my country. It is utter nonsense," he said. "I  am not a man who deals in allegations. I deal in facts. The  Goldstone report refers to `information', but `information' is  not proof. No court will convict a man on the strength of  `information'".    This is exactly what is upsetting him: he was put on  mandatory leave and a shadow was cast over his career, without  him being able to respond to the allegations made against him.  He went through his copy of the report paragraph by paragraph.  Notes in the margins say: "Nonsense", "no proof", "hearsay  allegations".    The only allegation put to him when he and generals Johan le  Roux and Krappies Englebrecht went to see the Goldstone  commission on Wednesday was that he had been involved in  smuggling guns to the IFP. He went to the commission without  legal representation and answered all question openly. "It was  only later that I learned from General Englebrecht that I was  also accused of manufacturing weapons and training IFP members  in the handling of guns," he said. "Until this day, I am not  sure of the commands I was supposed to have given or what  exactly I am accused of."    General Smit also denied he had been involved in giving  golden handshakes to former members of the notorious Vlakplaas  unit to buy their silence. Retirement packages were a political  decision, and he had offered to provide the commission with a  memorandum to prove his innocence. The document was written by  General le Roux and General Engelbrecht, and approved by the  commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, and the  minister.    General Smit was shocked to learn of the drastic measures Mr  de Klerk had taken against him, and the reference that the  generals would have been arrested if proof could be found was  difficult to swallow for a policeman who had been in the force  for almost 40 years.    General Smit did not think the president would be influenced  to such a degree by a mere "skenderstorie" (gossip).    General le Roux said in an interview at his office yesterday  he was completely astonished by the report. When he spoke to  the commission, no allegations were made to him and he had  answered all questions openly. An allegation that he had  ordered the killing of a certain Maponya had been dealt with at  a judicial inquest and by the Harms commission, without any  incriminating evidence being found against him.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Lloyd's agents pessimistic about Merrett Group's survival LLOYD'S agents were pessi-mistic yesterday about the survival prospects of the Merrett Group, which owns one of the largest managing agents at the insurance market and administers two of its biggest syndicates. Merrett was hit this week by the withdrawal of a US plan which would have compensated for a sharp fall in the number of Names  - the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's  - prepared to back the agency's syndicates. Efforts to drum up support from members' agents, which allocate Names to syndicates, appear to have been unsuccessful. One members' agent said that Merrett's biggest syndicate, number 418, needed a minimum of Pounds 50m of capacity (capital supporting underwriting) from Names to survive. But by yesterday morning only between Pounds 32m and Pounds 33m had been secured. 'I don't think it will fly,' said the agent. 'I just can't sell the syndicate to Names.' Without more support it appears that the syndicate will not be big enough to accept a 'reinsurance to close'  - an arrangement used by Lloyd's syndicates through which outstanding liabilities are transferred from one year of account to the next. If this occurred, 418 would be forced to stop accepting new business in 1994 and would be likely to leave the accounts of its 1991, 1992, and 1993 years 'open'  - because of uncertainty about the scale of future claims. The same fate could also be in store for syndicate 1067, which has also suffered a decline in backing from agents. This is a crisis for the Merrett Group that would have seemed inconceivable in 1988 when 418 had 7,537 Names, a capacity of Pounds 285m  - and was regarded as a flagship for the Lloyd's market. Traditionally specialising in marine insurance and areas such as war risks, Mr Stephen Merrett, underwriter and chairman of the group, had spearheaded diversification into one of the most rapidly growing areas of the international market  - US legal liabilities ranging from pollution and workers' compensation to the professional indemnity risks of accountants and company directors. The syndicate became an important market for US brokers such as Marsh &amp; McLennan, leading giant coverages for US corporate buyers. In the US Mr Merrett won a reputation as a leading international specialist on issues such as environmental liability. At Lloyd's, although he was never a popular figure, Mr Merrett won a reputation as a tough and knowledgeable underwriter. Earlier this year Mr Merrett became deputy chairman of the market, but his reputation had already been damaged as the scale of losses suffered by 418 in 1985 on a series of large US reinsurance contracts became clear. In one of the biggest legal actions at the market, 2,000 Names are claiming substantial damages in actions against their agents and Mr Merrett. The management of the Merrett agency has also come under fire because of delays in the reporting of 418's 1990 losses  - which amount to about Pounds 67.3m compared with capacity of Pounds 213.5m. Bad publicity, much of it stemming from the legal action, has made matters worse. In August, following intense pressure from senior figures at Lloyd's, Mr Merrett resigned as deputy chairman. Agents are playing down the potential impact on the market as a whole. They are confident, for example, that other Lloyd's agencies will take over administration of the three remaining syndicates and say much of the business now led by 418 and 1067 could be picked up by rival syndicates at Lloyd's. Following the successful attraction of corporate investors, many syndicates are now relatively flush with capital for the first time for three years. 'I know it can't do the market any good to lose the name of Merrett,' said one members' agent. 'But brokers will simply place the business elsewhere.' Several thousand Names would pick up the bill for 'running off' the syndicates (paying and administering claims on existing policies). Here too, though, agents are optimistic that the extra costs would be limited. Both 418 and 1067 are currently expected to make profits in 1991 and 1992, and agents suggest that the Lloyd's Corporation  - which regulates and administers the market  - may conduct the 'run-off' of 418 and 1067's 'open years' between 1990 and 1993. The biggest loser would be the Merrett Group itself. The loss of income from its two biggest syndicates would stretch the resources of the agency and raise questions about its capacity to manage its three other syndicates  - 179, 332 and 1184  - as well as about the future of the group as a whole. As for Mr Merrett, the affair completes a disastrous year. Earlier this week Mr Bob Clements, the president of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, and one of the most influential figures in the US insurance industry, offered a vote of confidence, when he described much recent criticism of Mr Merrett as 'personalised' and 'without regard to fundamentals'. It is evidently a view that many Names and some of their agents do not share. 'Like Thatcher or Gorbachev, Mr Merrett is lauded overseas but not in his country of origin,' said one agent.</p>

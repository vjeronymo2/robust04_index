			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just learned unofficially that Justice  Minister Miha Kozinc has offered his resignation to Prime  Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek because of the affair with the  government housing loans, issued under favorable conditions.  His action is not in response to the opposition party demands  that have accompanied the outbreak of the affair, since the  justice minister allegedly offered his resignation on Monday [20  June], immediately after the publication of the names of the  recipients of loans.    There have been many pressures for his replacement in the  past, however, none of these demands referred to his work as  justice minister. It is not known yet whether Prime Minister  Janez Drnovsek will accept his resignation. Last night Drnovsek  merely stated that he would demand a report from the incumbent  service and resort to replacements if need be.</p>

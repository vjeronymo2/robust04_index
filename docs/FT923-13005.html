			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Carter calls for peace-making MR Jimmy Carter, a defeated Democrat welcomed by his party, attacked his Republican successors late on Tuesday for fostering poverty at home and bloodshed in Latin America. He expressed doubts about the need to make war on President Saddam Hussein in Iraq last year, agencies report from New York. 'The world cries out for peaceful resolution of conflict,' the former president told the Democratic party convention in New York, 'but our country is seen as more warlike than peace-loving. Our country should seek greatness in peace, not war.' He portrayed the US government, since his tenure in 1977-81, as driven by expediency and impatience with negotiation, as well as being indifferent to poverty and callous toward the environment. 'This has got to change,' Mr Carter said. He did not mention ex-President Ronald Reagan or President George Bush by name, but his targets were clear. Earlier, in an interview, the Democratic senior statesman said he believed Mr Ross Perot, the independent billionaire preparing a tilt at the presidency this year, would be a big factor in the election and could ensure the election of Governor Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, or throw the race to a decision by the House of Representatives. Mr Carter said the Democratic party this year was 'coming back to a more moderate position', similar to the one he had advocated. He said he would have a 'limited role' in the campaign.</p>

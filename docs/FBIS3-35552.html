			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, Feb 25 (AFP)--A group  of up to five Jewish settlers carried out Friday's [25 February]  massacre of Palestinian worshippers and not just a lone gunman,  Palestinian witnesses said.    'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb  of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four  to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in  prayer.    "Other Palestinians I spoke to also said they saw five," he  said, without being able to explain what happened to the killers  afterwards.    The Israeli army said the killing was the work of one  settler  who apparently committed suicide afterwards.    Another witness, Husayn 'Isa al-Rajabi, 42, said he saw a  second settler feed the gunman with ammunition as he raked the  worshippers with gunfire.    Imam Ibrahim 'Abidin, who was leading Friday prayers, said  the shots came from "several directions."    "It can only be a planned operation because there were a lot  of settlers inside the mosque," he added.    A Palestinian told Israeli radio he saw a gunman firing from  behind a pillar.    "I'm sure that settlers outside the building threw  cartridges  to the killer who could keep on firing," the Palestinian said.    Military radio said the gunman was Barukh Goldstein, a  doctor  from the settlement of Qiryat Arba'.    Settlers from there have made death threats against  Palestinians following a rash of anti-Israeli attacks on the  West Bank.    A Jewish extremist network, mainly from Qiryat Arba', killed  four Palestinian students from Hebron and committed several  other attacks. [passage omitted]</p>

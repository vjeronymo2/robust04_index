			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Currencies resist pointers A HANDFUL of signals from the world's financial leaders did little more than leave international currencies wallowing yesterday, writes Peter John. Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hinted he was unlikely to raise interest rates. The Bundesbank stamped on hopes that it might cut interest rates soon. Japanese ministers worked to slow the rise of the Yen. And in the UK, the 'Seven Wise Men' stood out against higher taxes, a move that might prompt a base rate cut. However, the respective currencies did little to reflect the comments and it was left to the Swedish Krona to make a decisive shift while ministerial resignations in Italy prompted heavy selling of the Lira. The dollar spent most of the day around the DM1.63 level and ended little changed in Europe at DM1.6360, up from DM1.6335. The generally stronger pound rose to Dollars 1.4530 from Dollars 1.4455. In Japan, the Yen failed to respond to comments by Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister for International Trade and Industry, that it had risen too fast. After closing at Y119.30 against the dollar in Tokyo overnight it rose to Y119.10 with one one economist forecasting Y115 shortly. Sterling rallied from recent doldrums as expectations of an early rate cut faded. The pound was almost three pfennigs higher against the D-Mark at one stage but sellers moved in toward the close and it ended the day 1.75 pfennigs better at DM2.3775. There was a feeling that it could breach DM2.40 soon. However, Mr Neil Mackinnon, the senior economist with Citibank commented: 'The bounce in retail spending and the recent recovery in bank lending were one-offs. Given the upward trend in unemployment a further rate cut is on the cards.' In Sweden, the central bank intervened to support the krona for the third day running after it hit a record low of SKr4.66 against the D-Mark. Nevertheless, some economists predict that with inflation falling and the economy in recession, the currency will fall to SKr4.80 within the next six months. The krona rallied to SK4.6172 against the D-Mark from SKr4.6208. Meanwhile, the Lira was under pressure after an announcement that two government ministers had resigned, generating worries about the stability of prime minister Giuliano Amato's administration. The Lira closed at L959.2 against the D-Mark, down from L953.4. In Spain, the central bank intervened to support the peseta which has been falling steadily against the D-mark. The Spanish currency rallied to Pta71.70 from Pta71.78.</p>

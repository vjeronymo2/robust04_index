			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (Han Sang-u), deputy chief of the DPRK mission in  the UN Headquarters in Geneva, yesterday denounced the United  States for having unilaterally canceled the DPRK-U.S. high-level  talks and hindered the thorough resolution of the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula. (Han Sang-u) stated that the attitudes  of the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] had complicated this matter and that it was difficult to  predict their consequences.    On 16 March, the IAEA denounced Korea for having rejected  the  IAEA specialists' [words indistinct] inspection of nuclear  facilities. Using this as an excuse, the United States later  declared that it would cancel the 21 March DPRK-U.S. high-level  talks. The ROK and the United States are reportedly holding  negotiations on the Team Spirit joint military exercise.</p>

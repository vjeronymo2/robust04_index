			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DRUG INTERACTION SHOULD BE DISCUSSED BEFORE SURGERY  </P> <P> Question: Several months ago my wife ruptured a disk in her back and was in  agony. Her doctor recommended surgery and after a second opinion, she decided  to go ahead with it.  </P> <P> Before the operation, she met with the surgeon and they reviewed all the  medications she was taking, including an antidepressant called Parnate. In  fact, she had to give the same information over and over again to different  doctors.  </P> <P> She scheduled the surgery and steeled herself for it. But just before they  wheeled her into the operating room, the anesthesiologist came bustling in to  review her chart one last time. When he saw that she was on Parnate, he called  the operation off.  </P> <P> I don't understand why somebody didn't know weeks ahead of time that she  couldn't have surgery while she was on Parnate. They certainly knew all about  it, so why didn't anybody tell us?  </P> <P> Answer: It is shocking that such lack of communication could occur in a  hospital, but this isn't the first time we have heard of such problems. We  believe it is crucial that patients meet their anesthesiologist well in advance  of surgery to discuss potential medication interactions.  </P> <P> In your wife's case, blood pressure control could have been more difficult  while she was on Parnate.  </P> <P> Q. Can you tell me about Ansaid? My mother has just started taking it for  arthritis, and now she says she is free of pain. Is this pain reliever  addicting?  </P> <P> A. Ansaid (flurbiprofen) is a relatively new arthritis medication. Like most  other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), this type of medicine  reduces inflammation and swelling in the joints as well as relieving pain.  </P> <P> NSAIDs are not addicting, but they do have side effects, including stomach  irritation, ulceration, diarrhea, headache, skin rash and kidney problems.  </P></p>

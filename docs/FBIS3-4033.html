He made the comment as  the Government has been reminding legislators that time is  running out for the court of final appeal to be set up before  the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. But the Chinese official  said the Govermnent should just set up the court in accordance  with the 1991 Sino-British secret deal on the composition of the  court. It stipulates that only one overseas judge out of five  may sit in the court of final appeal after 1997, a point which  has been a bone of contention between the two countries.    The Legislative Council has passed a motion which stated  that  a bill for the court would be rejected.    "Everybody knows that the Legislative Council is just a  consultative body to the Governor, who has the right to withhold  his consent to Legco decisions," the official said.    "It is like the Joint Declaration. Can the Government put  the Joint Declaration to the Legco? "Is it the case that only  after receiving the approval from the Legco can the Government  implement the Joint Declaration?" The comment was echoed by  Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the New China News Agency  (Xinhua) yesterday.    Speaking at a function, Zhang said that by seeking Legco's  approval on the issue, the Government was "binding its own hands  and feet" and "asking for trouble". "Britain and China have  already reached agreement on the court of final appeal. Britain  should just act in strict accordance with the agreement," Zhang  said. "The Legco is being placed by the Government at an  inappropriately high level."    Richard Hoare, the director of administration, called the  Chinese comments a "misunderstanding". "You can't set up a  court without legislation. You can't pass legislation without  putting it to the Legco," said Hoare. He said the Joint  Declaration certainly did not need to be put to the Legislative  Council.    "But there are a lot of things that come out of the Joint  Declaration that have to be put to Legco for implemention where  the change of law is required," he said. He said China ought to  feel pleased because the Government was not proposing to go back  on the agreement.    "We have drafted the bill on the basis of the composition we  agreed with the Chinese side," he said. "But we still need to  pass the legislation. It is not something that you can just set  up. "You've got to set out the composition of the court, the  power of the court, the supporting of the court bill, like  registrar. There are all sorts of things like these which need  to be clearly specified in the legislation."    It is understood that the Government has started lobbying  legislators to pass the bill once it is approved by the  Executive Council next month. China will also be consulted on  the draft bill before it is put to Legco. An appointed  legislator, Christine Loh, said it would be technically  incorrect if the court of final appeal was set up without Legco  approval.    "What we are talking about is having legislation to set up  the court which is something Hong Kong does not have the  moment," she said. "In our system we need to sever the links  with the Privy Council and to set up the court. So we need  legislation. "Perhaps Chinese officials don't understand how  our system works," she added. "There is nothing the Government  can do without law giving it power."</p>

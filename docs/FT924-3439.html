			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Observer: Ganging up It's been a rough year for Japanese gangsters. They have been accused of consorting with the country's scandal-tainted politicians, and have watched in frustration as their often large, if speculative, investments in golf resorts landed deep in the bunker of bankruptcy. Perhaps nothing has angered the yakuza more than the acclaimed film-maker Juzo Itami, who mocked their manhood in a perceptive work entitled Minbo no Onna. For his wicked wit, Itami was done over by five thugs in a car park last May, leaving him physically and mentally scarred - last week five gentlemen were arrested for the crime and gave their place of work as Goto-gumi, an affiliate of the country's largest gang, the Yamaguchi-gumi.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Recession pushes Sun Alliance to Pounds 466m loss SUN ALLIANCE, the largest and financially strongest UK general insurer, sank deeper into the red by posting pre-tax losses for 1991 of Pounds 466.2m and completing a gloomy reporting round for the UK's insurance sector. All leading composite groups have reported increased pre-tax losses over the past six weeks and, like its competitors, Sun Alliance has been hit by the UK recession, the depressed housing market and a rise in crime leading to increased claims. The pre-tax loss was at the bottom end of expectations and compared with a deficit of Pounds 180.9m in 1990, when results were adversely affected by heavy storm damage in January. The loss further eroded Sun Alliance's financial strength reducing net assets to Pounds 1.68bn, compared with Pounds 2.03bn the previous year. The group's solvency margin, which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income, dropped to 63 per cent at the end of 1991 compared with 83 per cent last year. Losses were concentrated in the domestic mortgage indemnity and household account, an area which until recently was considered low risk by insurers. Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity, which arise when mortgage lenders are unable to recoup the full value of outstanding loans on sales of repossessed property, amounted to Pounds 320m and accounted for more than half UK underwriting losses of Pounds 491m, compared with losses of Pounds 267m last year. The average cost of domestic mortgage indemnity claims amounted to Pounds 15,000. Subsidence claims were Pounds 117m, up from Pounds 146m, and theft dogged the household contents and private motor accounts. Motor losses amounted to Pounds 72.4m, up from Pounds 50m, in spite of rate increases of 25 per cent during the year. Increased fire and theft claims produced losses for the group's commercial business, and the group's liability business was also hit by a large number of claims against surveyors for faulty valuations. The group announced a maintained final dividend, giving a total for the year of 14.25p, an increase of 1.8 per cent. Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, said: 'In the light of this phenomenal loss it was inconceivable to think of increasing (but) we will seek to re-establish real growth in the dividend as soon as we can.' The markets reacted calmly marking the share up 2p initially before it fell back to finish unchanged at 250p. Lex, Page 16</p>

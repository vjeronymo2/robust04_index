			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline buys Rider for Pounds 38m - Takeover creates UK's largest private sector bus and coach operator The rapid consolidation of Britain's bus industry moved up a gear yesterday with a Pounds 38m agreed offer by Badgerline, the Avon-based operator, for Rider, the leading supplier of bus services in West Yorkshire. Badgerline, which came to the market in November, said the enlarged group would be the largest private sector bus and coach operator in the UK. Last month it agreed to pay Pounds 23m for PMT Group, the Staffordshire-based coach company. Rider operates 1,100 buses. It was the subject of a buy-out from the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive in 1988. About 90 per cent of Rider's 3,200 employees own shares in the private company, and their average holding will be worth about Pounds 5,000. The offer is 16 Badgerline shares for every 5 Rider shares held. Badgerline shares closed at 118p, down 1p, valuing each Rider share at 377.6p. Rider shareholders will be entitled to take up to half of their consideration in cash or loan notes. The offer has been recommended by the Rider board and holders of a majority of the shares have already agreed to accept. Badgerline currently operates 2,800 buses and coaches in the West Midlands, the Potteries, south Wales and the south of England. Mr Trevor Smallwood, Badgerline's executive chairman, said: 'The acquisition of Rider is expected to be significantly earnings enhancing in the next couple of years as the enlarged group takes advantage of the opportunities to increase margins.' He added: 'I see this in many ways as a merger of two of the bus industry's leading operators.' Rider made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m on turnover of Pounds 83.9m in the year to March 31 1993. Net assets at March 31 last year were Pounds 19.8m. Mr Bill Cottham, Rider's chairman, said: 'For some time we have been considering how, in the current environment, we might best develop our business.' 'We have examined a number of options and have concluded that Rider can best be developed as part of a larger bus grouping.' Badgerline said this deal would make it bigger than Stagecoach, the Perth-based group which came to the market last April. Last week a third bus operator, the Go-Ahead Group, based in Gateshead, said it planned a flotation this summer with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m.</p>

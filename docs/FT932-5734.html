			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Constantia declines 35% CONSTANTIA, the diversified Austrian manufacturing group, reported a 35 per cent decline to Sch350m (Dollars 31.3m) in net income for 1992 on turnover little changed at Sch11bn, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich. The fall in profit was exaggerated by the way that 1991 earnings were inflated by the sale of the group's paper factory. Constantia, 75 per cent owned by the Turnauer family, expects flat sales again this year and a slide in cash flow from last year's Sch950m to between Sch800m and Sch900m.</p>

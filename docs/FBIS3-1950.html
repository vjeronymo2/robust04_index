The "rules for the implementation" clearly define that the  Ministry of Radio, Films, and Television is in charge of the  management of satellite ground receiving equipment. The  ministry and the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of  State Security are jointly responsible for the national  management of satellite ground receiving equipment. The radio  and television administrative departments of local governments  at all levels are responsible for the management of local  satellite ground receiving equipment. They and public security  departments and state security departments of local governments  at all levels are jointly responsible for the management of  satellite ground receiving equipment within their jurisdictions.    Concerning the installation of satellite ground receiving  equipment, the "rules for the implementation" stipulate that any  units are eligible to apply to install satellite ground  receiving equipment to receive domestic television programs  transmitted via satellite.    The following units and places can apply to install  satellite  ground receiving equipment to receive foreign television  programs: (1) educational, scientific research, press, banking,  economic, and trade units of a relatively high level and large  scale with a need for the information; (2) guesthouses for  foreigners with a level of three stars or the second standard of  the state or higher; and (3) offices or apartments especially  for foreigners as well as persons from Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan.    Any units that need to install satellite ground receiving  equipment to receive domestic television programs shall apply  with radio and television administrative departments above the  county level (including the county level), which will submit the  application to the radio and television administrative  departments at the prefecture or city level for examination and  approval. Units directly under provincial, regional autonomous,  and municipal governments can apply directly to radio and  television administrative departments of provincial, regional  autonomous, and municipal governments for examination and  approval. Units whose applications have been examined and  approved can buy satellite ground receiving equipment with  certificates issued by the examination and approval organs.  After satellite ground receiving equipment is installed and  passes the test conducted by the examination and approval  organs, the examination and approval organs shall issue a  "license for receiving domestic programs transmitted by  satellites" (abbreviated as "license").    Any units that need to install satellite ground receiving  equipment to receive foreign television programs shall apply to  radio and television administrative departments above the county  level (including the county level). Such applications, after  radio and television administrative departments as well as state  security departments at the prefecture or city level write their  comments, shall be submitted to radio and television  administrative departments of provincial, regional autonomous,  and municipal governments for examination and approval. Units  whose applications have been examined and approved can buy  satellite ground receiving equipment with certificates issued by  the examination and approval organs. After satellite ground  receiving equipment is installed and passes the test conducted  by radio and television administrative departments as well as by  state security departments of provincial, regional autonomous,  and municipal governments, radio and television administrative  departments of provincial, regional autonomous, and municipal  governments shall issue a "license to receive foreign television  programs transmitted by satellite" (abbreviated as "license").    As for the installation of satellite ground receiving  equipment by individuals, the "rules for the implementation"  stipulate that no individuals may install or use satellite  ground receiving equipment.    But individuals living in areas where the programs of local  television stations, television relay stations, television  delayed- relay stations, and cable television stations (posts)  can not be received can apply to install satellite ground  receiving equipment to receive domestic television programs.    Any individuals who need to install satellite ground  receiving equipment shall seek permission from local units and  shall file an application, accompanied by a certificate issued  by their local unit, with the radio and television  administrative department above the county level (including the  county level). Such an application, after radio and television  administrative departments as well as state security departments  at the prefecture or city level write their comments, shall be  submitted to the radio and television administrative departments  of provincial, regional autonomous, and municipal governments  for examination and approval. Individuals whose applications  have been examined and approved can buy satellite ground  receiving equipment with certificates issued by the examination  and approval organs. After satellite ground receiving equipment  is installed and passes the test conducted by radio and  television administrative departments as well as state security  departments of provincial, regional autonomous, and municipal  governments, radio and television administrative departments of  provincial, regional autonomous, and municipal governments shall  issue a "license to receive domestic programs transmitted by  satellites."    No satellite receiving antenna installed by individuals  shall  occupy public places or affect the surrounding view and  neighbors' daily lives.    Satellite ground receiving equipment installed by units  before the promulgation of the "management provisions" shall be  removed if such equipment do not conform to the requirements for  the application to install satellite ground receiving equipment  as stipulated in the "rules for the implementation." If the  installation of such satellite ground receiving equipment meets  the relevant requirements of the "rules for the implementation,"  the due formalities should be met in accordance with the  "management provisions" and the "rules for the implementation"  within six months from the time of the promulgation of the  "management provisions."    Units and individuals without a "license" are prohibited  from  installing satellite ground receiving equipment to receive  television programs transmitted by satellite.    Working units for installing satellite ground receiving  equipment shall have a "license to install satellite ground  receiving equipment." Conditions and measures for filing the  installation application shall be formulated by the radio and  television administrative departments of provincial, regional  autonomous, and municipal governments themselves.    Units and individuals who need satellite ground receiving  equipment installed shall use the installation and repair  services of units that have a "license to install satellite  ground receiving equipment."    As for the reception and use of satellite television  programs, the "rules for the implementation" stipulate that  units and individuals with a "license" shall receive and use  satellite television programs in accordance with the  requirements stated in the "license," including those concerning  receiving purposes, contents, methods, and the watching by  viewers.    Guesthouses for foreigners with a "license to receive  foreign  television programs transmitted by satellite" can transmit  foreign television programs to guest rooms through their own  cable (closed-circuit) television systems.    Other units with a "license to receive foreign television  programs transmitted by satellites" shall limit the watching by  viewers in accordance with the needs of their work. No  terminals of such receiving equipment shall be installed in  places other than those stipulated.

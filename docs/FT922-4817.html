			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Observer: Food for thought Take 16 large egos, two legal eagles, a few bottles of good Beaujolais, and the resulting debate should be interesting, especially when the subject is whether nasty restaurant critics can be taken to the cleaners. Last month's Pounds 15,000 damages ruling against the Irish Times and its restaurant reviewer for maligning the output of a local restaurant, has certainly set some journalistic tummies rumbling. Yesterday, the owners of the Soho Soho restaurant hosted a lunch in London to try to settle same while fuelling a debate on whether it's possible to prevent similar financial penalties from spilling over into the much more expensive market in mainland Britain. Eleven restaurant writers and five restaurateurs were plumped down at the same table with Alastair Brett, a Times libel lawyer, and journalist Adam Raphael, keeping the score. Not surprisingly, there were almost as many verdicts as there were diners. Richard Shepherd from Langan's, who set an unprofessional example by not eating the grilled salmon with basil sauce but smoking throughout, called for more understanding of the emotion of eating out. By contrast, Pizza Express's Peter Boizot quoted Shakespeare and St Augustine to back his thesis that critics should at least have to inspect the kitchens before sounding off. The writers' team seemed to be under the impression that - as long as they got their facts right and, when inaccurate, allowed the restaurateur the right of reply - there should be no problem. However, there is a growing lobby which believes it is only a matter of time before a particularly nasty review detonates a law suit. Unless our libel laws are changed, they can only hope that the case comes up before a judge who, forsaking his chambers, enjoys eating out.</p>

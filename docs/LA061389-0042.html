			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> DESTRUCTIVE STORMS HIT TEXAS, OKLAHOMA  </P> <P> Fierce thunderstorms raked northern Texas and Oklahoma, uprooting trees and  knocking down power lines with winds of up to 76 m.p.h. The storms, born in  humid and unstable air ahead of a cold front, rumbled toward the lower  Mississippi Valley, prompting forecasters to post a tornado watch for much of  Arkansas. Early in the day, wind gusts were clocked at 76 m.p.h. at Wichita  Falls, Tex., 62 m.p.h. at Tulsa, Okla., and 60 m.p.h. in Oklahoma City, the  National Weather Service said. Trees were felled by 60-m.p.h. winds in Rogers  County, Okla., and winds tore down power lines at Sentinel, Okla. Hail ranging  in size from dimes to half dollars pelted towns in Oklahoma, including  Glenpool, Catoosa, Tiawah and Oklahoma City. More than half an inch of rain hit  Abilene, Tex., in 90 minutes, officials said.  </P></p>

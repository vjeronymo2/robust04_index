			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nokia beats market expectations Nokia, the Finnish tele-communications group, yesterday outstripped market expectations when it announced a preliminary operating profit of FM854m (Dollars 155m) for the first four months, more than double last year's FM362m. Rising profits in the group's two main divisions, fixed telecommunications and mobile phones, were the main reason for the upturn. There was a sharply reduced loss from the troubled consumer electronics division and a better result from the cables and machinery activities. Sales climbed 21 per cent to FM8.56bn from FM7.09bn. Underlying sales growth - which strips out the effects of currency movements, acquisitions and disposals - amounted to 33 per cent. Nokia said fixed telecommunications and mobile phones sales had risen strongly, although it did not supply figures. Consumer electronics sales declined slightly, while cables and machinery sales were largely unchanged. Nokia, which is the world's second largest supplier of mobile telephones after Motorola of the US, said last week it planned to raise more than FM2bn of new equity through an international share issue.</p>

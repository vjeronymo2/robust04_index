			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY BORES  </P> <P> I recently returned from Sacramento after having taken a tour of the Capitol.  One highlight is the display from each California county, showing pictures of  beautiful vacation spots in that county, or businesses in the county such as  agriculture or wine. Most had small maps with popular locations marked.  </P> <P> All were interesting, informative and created a desire to visit that county  except one. It was a shrine to the county supervisors, with their names and  pictures as the focal point. It was L.A. County. Gee, I wonder whose idea that  was?  </P> <P> ROD CLARIDA  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Dreaming of a dry Christmas - Heavy rain and flooding have damaged the UK's potato and sugar beet harvests and delayed the planting of next year's cereal crop I'M dreaming of a dry Christmas, just like the ones we had before. For if Britain's weather does not improve very soon, losses of this year's crops still in the ground, and some of next year's crops not yet planted, could rise to alarming levels. Some commentators have put part of the problem down to the complacency of farmers. After a series of dry, easy autumns, they say, farmers thought that this was the pattern for the future and forgot how to plan ahead and deal with a wet one. Undoubtedly these allegations contain an element of truth. But it should also be remembered that many areas have had a full average year's rainfall in just four or five months and that some entire valleys in Wales and the West Country have been flooded for many days. In the east, where I farm, natural drainage through the soil has not been able to cope with the quantities of rain that have fallen. The other day we had reason to dig a hole in a field and, though the surface of the soil was like thick soup, a couple of feet down the subsoil was only just moist. This gives credence to the water authorities' claims that water tables have not yet been replenished after four years of drought. Worst affected have been root crops like potatoes and sugar beet. In order to harvest them it is necessary to dig them out of the saturated soil. Needless to say this has been a frustrating and at times impossible task this year. Hundreds of horsepower has been harnessed to the front of lifting machines and trailers in an attempt to drag them along and salvage such crops. But still substantial acreages remain unharvested. These, often abortive operations have damaged the soil structure considerably. All over the potato growing areas there are part harvested fields characterised by deep water-filled tractor wheel ruts. Many of the potatoes which have been lifted under such appalling conditions have themselves been so badly damaged and bruised that they would be unlikely to keep in store. Pushing them on to the spot market while they were still saleable has contributed to the rock bottom prices growers have had to accept this year. Indeed it has been a thoroughly bad year for potatoes. Yields grown have, ironically, been far too high for profitable prices. At no time during the season has there been any prospect of a shortage and, even if many of those still locked in the land are never lifted, there will be plenty of potatoes to satisfy demand. And now the Potato Marketing Board (PMB) is under threat. Its statutory powers to control the area grown are regarded by many farmers as vital to the relative stability of the UK market compared with those in the rest of the EC. As president of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, Mr John Gummer, UK minister of agriculture, has proposed a so-called 'light' EC regime for potatoes. If adopted, it would create a virtually free market, with no controls. Mr Jim Godfrey, the newly-elected chairman of the PMB, has rejected the proposals and he claims they have also been rejected by most other European potato growers on the grounds that the UK's system is envied all over the Community and should be extended, not abolished. It seems unlikely, however, that growers' antagonism will prevent the proposed EC regime, or something very close to it, from being adopted. But to return to the wet weather. A few days ago I received from British Sugar, the monopoly processor of all the sugar beet grown in this country, a letter reminding me that the optimum date for completing the beet harvest was the fifth of December; that I should, by then, aim to have my whole crop in clamps and covered to protect it from frost. For some of this year's big crop of roots will have to be stored on farms until next March because the processing factories will not be able to deal with them earlier. A couple of very wet days later I learned that British Sugars' estimate of the quantity of sugar beet still to be harvested was 30 per cent of the acres planted. Clearly growers, myself included, had been unable to respond to the message because of the wet soil. We will now have to take every opportunity to harvest the rest of the crop - if that proves possible. For some land is so badly waterlogged that it is impossible to run a tractor across it, let alone pull heavy harvesting machinery. But it is the knock-on effect of all this that is potentially the most worrying. Significant acreages of the land still carrying unharvested root crops were planned to have been planted with wheat and winter barley for harvesting next July and August. It has, in fact, been calculated that UK planting is 20 per cent behind schedule and it is now highly questionable, even if the roots are gathered successfully, whether it will be wise even to try to plant cereal seeds into cold wet land that has been subjected to such mechanical abuse. Germination in near freezing conditions will be slow, if it occurs at all, and potential yields will be much reduced. Indeed many of the autumn cereals already planted are suffering from the cold and wet and this in turn makes them more vulnerable to attack by predatory slugs. This has, in fact, been the worst year I can remember for slug grazing damage to cereals. Slugs love wet weather. They also enjoy the residues of chopped straw in the soil which is now more widely available since the straw burning ban. There is little doubt that this has combined to create an ideal environment for the slimy little vandals. All this means that next year's potential UK cereal harvest is already severely reduced. Taken together with set-aside, it could mean that the UK produces 25 per cent less than last year and that would take it from sixth biggest cereal exporter to barely having sufficient to satisfy domestic demand. And given that the same kind of weather conditions have been experienced in most of the northern European corn belt, it would not seem unreasonable to suggest that the 1993 harvest across the Continent will be significantly reduced. Indeed I will speculate that the combination of set-aside and bad weather could cut the total EC cereal yield by at least 15 per cent and perhaps up to 20 per cent. Should that happen, the EC would go from an 'embarrassing surplus' of cereals to modest shortage in just one year. Is this what CAP reform was intended to achieve? Did the Euro politicians really want to risk cutting production by that much? Or did they, as they sat in their Brussels ivory tower, take it for granted that the farmers of Europe together with the Almighty would continue to increase production no matter what? As an old farmer once said to me, the trouble with the Almighty is that he has no sense of proportion.</p>

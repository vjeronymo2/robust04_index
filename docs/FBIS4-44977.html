			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, May 3.    The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao today announced  his Government's intention to set up a National Security Council  [NSC] which would take into account all matters that impinge on  national security.    "It will not just have defence in its ambit but have a much  wider scope than that," he said while replying to a discussion  on the working of the Defence Ministry in the Rajya Sabha.    The Prime Minister said he had got the matter examined and  "we have come to the conclusion that it should be set up." "In  its new variegated form it will take into account all matters  impinging on national security."    Mr. I.K. Gujral, JD [Janata Dal], intervened to ask if the  NSC was any different from what had been proposed in 1990. He  said he did not find any difference in what the Prime Minister  had outlined and what had been proposed in 1990.    The Prime Minister said in 1990 it was narrow in scope and  included only finance, home, defense. However if the member felt  there was no difference then he could have the copyright, he  said in a lighter vein.    The Prime Minister said that the security environment had  changed very much since 1990 which necessitated a wider scope  for the NSC.    Referring to the changed scenario after the end of the cold  war, Mr. Rao said if business was as usual even after the end of  the cold war, then it had no meaning.    "We have to be pragmatic about the changes ushered in by the  end of the cold war and it required greater vigilance on the  part of all countries particularly India and the role it had  play, he said. [sentence as published]    "We cannot abandon this role," he said adding we have to  work  for peace and resolution of problems is going to be much easier  than before since the end of the cold war.    The Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mr. Sikander  Bakht, said the Prime Minister's statement still did not dispel  their misgivings at all. He said the Agrii missile programme had  been discontinued on several occasions and he suspected this was  due to us pressure. [sentence as published] -- PTI</p>

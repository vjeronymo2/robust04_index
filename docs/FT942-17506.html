			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Eclectic and elusive - The curious case of Hans Krasa's 1930s opera Of all the works suppressed by the Nazis, one of the most curious is Hans Krasa's two-act opera Verlobung im Traum (Betrothal in a Dream), which has just been staged by the Prague State Opera - formerly Prague's German theatre. It was first staged there in 1933 by the young George Szell and won the Czechoslovak State Prize, a rare honour for a German-language work. By the end of the decade Krasa, a German-speaking Czech from a wealthy Jewish family, was in the Terezin concentration camp, where performances of his children's opera Brundibar (Bumblebee) helped to raise the morale of inmates. He died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz in October 1944. Along with Viktor Ullmann and several other Jewish contemporaries, Krasa is now being rediscovered. Decca has just issued a recording of his string quartet, his symphony has been played in Berlin and Brundibar was staged last year at London's South Bank. Verlobung im Traum owes its revival to two people: 83-year-old Pavel Eckstein, a long-time Prague correspondent of Opera and now adviser to the State Opera, who remembers the 1933 premiere and wanted to see a modern staging; and Israel Yinon, a young Israeli conductor based in Mannheim. Krasa's publishers, Universal Edition, had told Yinon the music was lost but allowed him to rake through the cellars of their Vienna headquarters. It was here that he found the score with Szell's pencil markings. One question which surrounds such rediscoveries is whether their brutal and poignant history masks a mediocrity of talent. There can be no qualms about the libretto, compactly drawn from Dostoyevsky's Uncle's Dream by two journalist friends of Krasa's, Rudolf Fuchs and Rudolf Thomas. Set in a small Russian town in the mid-19th century, it tells of the beautiful young Zina, her bourgeois family and three rival suitors - including a decrepit old prince who is persuaded to believe his betrothal to her was a dream. The action is in flashback, framed by a brief prologue and epilogue in an archivist's library. Krasa's music is eclectic, reflecting the harmonic modernism of his teacher Zemlinsky, his cosmopolitanism and technical fluency. There are motoric rhythms, jazz inflections, neo-classical passage-work, schmaltzy dance tunes and snatches of Janacekian beauty. The most notable features are the light orchestration and a vocal quintet built out of Casta diva, with which Zina charms the prince. An air of comic irony hovers over the whole, but Krasa's personality remains elusive. At less than two hours, the opera outstays its welcome. The State Opera's production, staged by Karel Drgac, designed by Rainer Sinell and sympathetically conducted by Yinon, preserved the period setting and looked good, thanks to an ingenious turn-table set and some well-characterised ensembles. But the principals needed stronger direction. The Romanian soprano Anda-Louise Bogza was an ideal Zina for the occasion, sounding like the young Julia Varady and capturing a wealth of conflicting emotion behind the outward composure. Jaroslav Horacek gave a fine cameo as the Archivist, but the other players were disappointing, in particular Rudolf Konstantin's Prince. I left the theatre applauding the effort, but somewhat doubtful about the result. The production, sponsored by BMW and the Czech Commercial Bank, moves to Mannheim in June.</p>

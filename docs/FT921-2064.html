			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Supersonic statesman stays on the ground FLY KINNOCK] The soaraway statesman yesterday took to the skies over England on a daylight mission to drop propaganda across the kingdom. Stick with Captain Kinnock and his crew for economic lift-off and blue skies all the way. On the tarmac at Heathrow Airport Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive, twiddled his fingers while the Concorde flight-deck crew fiddled with the aircraft's droop snoot. Both were obliged to await the arrival of the Labour leader, given the inexplicable absence of Lord King, the airline's chairman, whose fanaticism for all things Labour is only restrained by his notoriously shy and retiring demeanour. The VIP guest, on autopilot a week into the campaign, leapt up the steps to give the supersonic beast the once-over. Aides explained he was not actually going anywhere (precisely what the Major camp claims) but was merely taking a look at the sort of state-of-the-art avionics technology which put the Great into Britain - not to mention Mr Tony Benn, who was Labour's technology minister in the 1970s before his wings fell off. Sir Colin plugged the successes of his profitable, privatised national carrier while Captain Kinnock stuck his head out of the cockpit window - a practice not to be recommended at Mach 2. Concorde, it is said, will remain fully operational until 2010, given a regular overhaul, which more or less reflects Mr Kinnock's approach to the business of keeping his party in the air. After a chat to engineering apprentices, who aspire to earning the sort of salaries that Labour wants to clobber, it was off for a first sight of Mr Kinnock's own airborne campaign craft. Red Rose 1, alas, is no pencil-thin supersonic masterpiece, more a pot-bellied BAe 146, particularly favoured by members of a gradually depleting royal household. Hailed as the world's quietest, cleanest airliner, it does not have the rusty charm of its 1987 predecessor, a clapped-out Viscount with flat batteries. A bumpy drop into Birmingham, the setting for one of those immaculately orchestrated, impromptu rallies. Our man reached new heights of rhetoric before heading back to his whispering machine. Apparently the BAe 146 is available in several models to suit all needs. Reports that Captain Kinnock has one on order remain speculation.</p>

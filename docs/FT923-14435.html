			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Taiwan eases entry curbs on dissidents TAIWAN yesterday cut from 282 to five the number of dissidents barred from returning to Taiwan from abroad, AP reports from Taipei. 'The government allows entry of all Taiwanese living abroad, except those with records of violent acts,' said Mr Wu Poh-hsiung, interior minister. Officials have said up to 800 people were barred from entry three years ago. Wu declined to identify the five still on the blacklist. But they are believed to be pro-independence group leaders, including Mr Shih Ming, head of the Tokyo-based Independent Taiwan Association. The announcement came after MPs yesterday approved revisions to the National Security Law, which was enacted after Taiwan lifted 38 years of martial law in 1987.</p>

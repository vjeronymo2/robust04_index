			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Banque Indosuez considers listing for Gartmore shares BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French investment bank, announced yesterday that it was considering listing the shares of Gartmore, the UK fund manager, on the London Stock Exchange. Banque Indosuez will retain a controlling interest and is expected to sell anywhere from 25 per cent to 49 per cent of its stake. Gartmore was purchased from British and Commonwealth for Pounds 132m and it is now capitalised at between an estimated Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m. Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, said that so far there were no immediate flotation plans and investment advisers had not yet been retained. 'We made an announcement at an early stage because in the nature of our business we regularly have to answer questions from clients about our ownership,' Mr Myners said. The company felt a public announcement was preferable to allowing a leak of a planned flotation to raise questions about Gartmore's future. Over the past five years Gartmore has become one of Britain's most successful fund management companies. Assets under management have soared from Pounds 6.3bn in April 1990, when it was acquired by Banque Indosuez to Pounds 14.5bn in April 1993. It now ranks as one of the so-called 'Big Four' of UK fund managers handling pension fund accounts which have attracted a disproportionate amount of the business due to consistently above-average investment returns. Its performance in its long-term balanced pools have been well above the median for the past 4 1/2 years and last year the median return on its segregated pension fund pool was 26 per cent. This compares with an industry median of 21.8 per cent according to Combined Actuarial Performance Services, a performance measurement group. Roughly 80 per cent of the company's assets under management are those of UK pension schemes, and Mr Myners said Gartmore is seeking to diversify the source of its business.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Five major nonferrous  metal bases have taken shape in Gansu Province of northwest  China with state assistance during the past decade.    Last year, the output of nonferrous metals in the province  was nearly 400,000 tons, 95 percent of which came from the five  bases, and the amount accounted for 12 percent of the country's  total nonferrous metals output.    Dozens of rare earth materials and nonferrous metal  products,  including silver, copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, barium, nickel  and cobalt, are being sold on world markets.    Local government officials attribute the achievement to the  state's large sum of investment during the past decade when the  central government injected some five billion yuan (about 574.7  million U.S. dollars at the present exchange rate) to upgrade  such metals manufacturers.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Smaller states defend Brussels against big guys - Commission survives attempt to restrict its freedom of action THE European Commission appears to have survived a power-grab by the EC's big member states seeking to dilute its sole right to initiate Euro-legislation. The Commission has become the scapegoat for popular hostility to the Maastricht treaty, encouraging expectation that its powers would be badly blunted, mainly by application of the principle of subsidiarity. Community leaders hope that subsidiarity - ensuring that the EC acts only where measures taken nationally or locally will be ineffectual - will recapture popular support for European integration. This week, ambassadors of the Twelve agreed new measures to apply the principle of subsidiarity. But Germany, Britain and France, which had pushed for a formula whereby the Commission would have to submit its proposals to member states for scrutiny at the draft stage, were rebuffed. Their efforts were vigorously opposed by the nine other member states, with the smaller countries in particular concerned that their more powerful partners would get a lockhold on the Commission - and tilt legislation in their favour. 'The smaller countries rely on us to defend their interests,' said one senior Commission official. 'Without a Commission which performs, their stake in Europe is devalued.' What has been agreed 'forces the Commission to think twice before coming up with something,' said a Dutch diplomat, 'but member states will not be able to force their opinions on the Commission.' Under existing EC law, the Commission proposes, the Council of Ministers (of the Twelve) decides, subject to some amendment from the European parliament. But responsibility for EC legislation is obscure because Commission measures are often taken at the request of member states. Under the compromise unanimously agreed this week, a single state can raise objections to Brussels proposals by invoking subsidiarity. But in most cases it would require a simple majority to block them. Foreign ministers will decide in Luxembourg on Monday whether to endorse this compromise, and subsidiarity will be at the top of the agenda at the Birmingham summit of EC leaders on October 16. The Commission itself is already screening all proposed legislation in the light of subsidiarity. But senior officials including Mr Jacques Delors, the president, have been shaken by the virulence of recent attacks on 'Brussels'  -particularly those by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hitherto viewed as a reliable ally. This week's compromise, however, is merely 'a working procedure', according to a senior official of the current UK presidency of the EC. Defining the scope of subsidiarity, and fleshing it out with more open decision-making and democratic accountability, is a battle still to come. EC members hope that a full exposition of the principle of subsidiarity will help to convince Danish voters to reconsider their opposition to the Maastricht treaty. Under one scenario circulating among senior diplomats in Brussels, a solemn and binding declaration could be prepared by the Twelve, promising to preserve national identities and to restrain centralising tendencies in Brussels. This companion text to the Maastricht treaty could then be put to Danish voters in a second referendum next year, without the need to submit it to ratification in other states. The force of popular opposition to Brussels has encouraged national leaders to examine other ways to open up decision-making in the Council of Ministers. Professional civil servants accustomed to working behind-closed-doors are reluctantly preparing studies - though many are appalled at the prospect of proposals such as televised hearings of Council proceedings currently being reviewed in European capitals.</p>

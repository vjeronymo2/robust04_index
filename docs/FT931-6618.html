			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / G7 finance ministers rediscover harmony: Weekend meeting was free of quarrels but it is too soon to signal a revival in the group's fortunes THEY came to rebuild international economic co-operation. When they left London after five hours of informal talks on Saturday, the finance ministers from the Group of Seven countries were congratulating themselves on a successful meeting free of quarrels. But it remains to be seen whether the brief meeting of ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will revive the G7 after two years in which its gatherings have been marked more often by bickering than agreement. Saturday's meeting was not intended to decide any blueprints or set up mechanisms to help the industrialised world deal with the problems of high and rising unemployment, recession and slowing growth in continental Europe and Japan, or the economic crisis in Russia. There was no appetite for returning to the tightly co-ordinated policies of the 1980s when the G7 tried to limit exchange rate fluctuations among its members or set domestic economic policy objectives for members of the group that were rarely adhered to. Instead, the G7 countries will continue to frame their policies very much with their own interests in mind, according to the 'Sinatra Doctrine' of 'doing it my way'. But there was much talk of a 'positive spirit' after the meeting. The hope is the gathering will have enabled the ministers to exchange views frankly and gain a better insight into each other's economic problems and domestic political constraints. 'It doesn't mean that we have to have identical economic policies for our countries,' said a senior US Treasury official. 'But it does mean that each will be concerned as to how our policies contribute to sustained growth without inflation.' The decision not to issue a communique or take decisions helped Saturday's talks to run smoothly. There was no repetition of last April's G7 meeting in Washington when Japanese objections to one sentence of the final text prolonged the meeting for an acrimonious two hours. But the absence of a communique could allow differences among nations to persist. Although the ministers went out of their way to avoid megaphone diplomacy and deliberately refrained from putting partner countries under pressure for specific policy commitments, there were signs of strain beneath the surface on Saturday. A senior US Treasury official said after the talks that Washington would like Japan to go beyond present plans for stimulating its economy by fiscal means. That sentiment was echoed by Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, and other European G7 representatives. However, Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japan's finance minister, said he had no intention of introducing another package besides the existing budget that is being debated in the Japanese parliament. The US, Britain and France made clear they would like to see further cuts in Germany's short-term interest rates but were given no assurances by the German delegation. Mr Piero Barucci, the Italian finance minister, said that all his G7 colleagues had told him they thought the lira was undervalued. These tensions did not flare up into open dispute as the ministers were determined to be on their best behaviour and because Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US Treasury secretary, chose to adopt a softly-softly approach to America's allies. With compliments flowing in from all sides for the US administration's deficit-reduction package and strong approval from other G7 countries for President Bill Clinton's pledge on Friday to support the multilateral trading system, Mr Bentsen decided to treat the meeting genuinely as a 'get to know you' session. He seems willing to wait a few months for any improved spirit of international co-operation to yield results. The senior Treasury official said the US hoped to see some positive fruits of co-operation by July's G7 summit in Tokyo, rather than the next G7 finance ministers' meeting in April. It also remains unclear how far the G7 countries will set up an institutional framework to promote co-operation. Mr Bentsen, who has been making the running in pushing for a revived G7, appeared to have no plan on offer. His one suggestion, endorsed by the other countries, was that there should be fewer communiques and that they should be brief when issued. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, appeared to be the only minister with concrete plans to strengthen the G7 structure. Like Mr Bentsen, he said communiques should be shorter and not necessarily issued after every meeting. He also called for: the G7 to meet four times a year; the managing director of the International Monetary Fund to be more deeply involved when the group has its periodic 'mutual surveillance' discussions; and the IMF to submit carefully focused papers about the world economy to help the group's discussions. Mr Waigel also suggested that trade and economics ministers should join one of the finance ministers' future meetings to discuss ways to promote the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. His ideas and other suggestions will be taken up by senior officials from the G7 countries. By the time they report to their ministers it will be clearer whether the positive atmosphere of London marked a revival in the group's fortunes or was just part of President Clinton's political honeymoon.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Warning over land price rises Sharply rising land prices caused by shortages of land where people most want to live are inhibiting the housing market recovery and stoking inflationary pressures in the economy, says a survey of more than 450 housebuilders. The survey, published yesterday by the Housebuilders Federation, found that more than a third of those questioned last month reported that land prices had increased by more than 10 per cent since the beginning of this year. Another 22 per cent reported increases of between 6 per cent and 10 per cent. In all, three-quarters of builders said that land prices had increased during the three months. Mr John Stewart, editor of the federation's housing market report, said: 'The impact of land price increases, coupled with constraints on the supply of land for housing, pose a threat to recovery and may well be the early signs of another inflationary cycle in the housing market.' The federation has blamed restrictive planning policies by central and local government for creating a shortage of good sites, forcing up the price of land as the housing market recovers. Mr David Wilson, chairman of builders Wilson Bowden, said that land prices nationally had risen by about a fifth and by up to half in parts of south-east England. The federation's survey said more than 90 per cent of builders in south-east England and 95 per cent in London had reported price rises since the start of this year. More than 80 per cent of builders nationally expect house prices to rise over the next 12 months. More than half expect annual increases of under 5 per cent; more than a quarter forecast rises of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. Just under three-quarters expect the number of homes sold to increase this year. Mr Stewart said: 'Recovery in the housing market has been sustained over the first three months of this year. At this stage it appears April's tax increases have had little effect on the market.' Builders could face serious difficulties if land price rises continue to outstrip growth in house prices. Halifax Building Society says the average price of homes rose by 2.6 per cent to Pounds 63,122 during the 12 months to the end of March.</p>

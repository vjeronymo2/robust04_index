			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all hospitals and ESRD facilities are considered to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Payment Exception Requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this portion of the proposed rule is to codify in regulations existing policy concerning an ESRD facility's request for an exception to its prospectively determined payment rate. This policy is contained in chapter 27 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM). This proposed rule would affect all ESRD facilities, including hospital-based and freestanding, that file for an ESRD exception request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our records indicate that as of December 31, 1990, there were 1,968 facilities eligible to file exception requests. Of these, 275 or 14 percent of the facilities filed exception requests during the December 1, 1989 to May 29, 1990 exception period. This resulted in 194 granted requests (mostly partially granted) and 81 denials. During our most recent exception request cycle, for the period March 1, 1991 through August 27, 1991, 135 facilities filed exception requests. This resulted in 87 requests being granted at least in part and 48 denials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current procedures, an ESRD facility requesting an exception to its prospective payment rate complies with the instructions contained in chapter 27 of the PRM. A facility whose request is granted only partially or is denied an exception may appeal its request to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). The PRRB is bound by the statute and regulations and, in interpreting them, may come to a different conclusion than if it followed program instructions. If we codify in regulations details now found in the PRM instructions, the PRRB would be presented with more specific bases for adjudicating an appeal of a partially denied or denied exception request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Organ Acquisition Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1992, there were 66 hospitals certified to perform heart transplants and 33 hospitals certified to perform liver transplants. These amount to less than two percent of all Medicare participating hospitals. In 1991, there were 182 liver transplants and 335 heart transplants performed on Medicare beneficiaries. Although the number of Medicare transplants represents less than one-fourth of the total number of heart and liver transplants, a preliminary review of cost report data indicates the average Medicare acquisition cost per liver and per heart is higher than the average non-Medicare acquisition cost. Most organ procurement costs are incurred before a recipient is identified as a Medicare beneficiary; thus, we do not believe the Medicare program's share of acquisition costs should exceed the non-Medicare share. We believe that the current method of cost reimbursement contains the potential for transplant centers to include some non-Medicare costs in the Medicare costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would extend the formula used to compute kidney acquisition costs to other organs, including hearts and livers. Acquisition costs would be based on the ratio of the number of usable organs transplanted into Medicare beneficiaries to the total number of usable organs. It would not affect our obligation to pay allowable organ acquisition costs, but would prevent Medicare from bearing costs associated with non-Medicare procedures. Based on the number of Medicare organ transplants, we anticipate annual Medicare program savings associated with this provision of less than $5 million. Facilities that have been correctly reporting non-Medicare acquisition costs would not be affected by this proposal. Facilities that have not would find their Medicare payments reduced to better reflect Medicare's share of allowable acquisition costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated above, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

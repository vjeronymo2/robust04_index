			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guadalajara, 21 Jan (AFP)--The Mexican Episcopal  Conference (CEM) today urged the "correction" of "unfair  structures" and "abuses of power," factors that "caused" the  misery in the State of Chiapas. In a communique published in  Guadalajara, the bishops condemned violence and announced a  National Drive for Peace and Justice in Chiapas to be held on  Sunday to collect money and other contributions for people  affected by the armed conflict.    The document says the Chiapas conflict "should serve as a  warning of the inherent danger of abandoning the poor lower  classes," and that "the misuse of riches can be an insult to the  poverty of others. In this case, extreme poverty is caused by  abuse of power and unjust structures that must be corrected,"  states the eight-point report prepared today. This report is  based on a meeting held by the Catholic Church hierarchy on 10  January to analyze the Indian rebellion unleashed in southern  Mexico 20 days ago.    "We know, above all, that the extreme poverty, abandonment,  and scorn under which the peasants and Indians of Chiapas and  other areas live are the roots of the violence that has erupted"  says the CEM. In this sense, "we believe the economic system  rising from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) must  keep in mind the needs of the peasants and the Indians and  promote a more humane economy", the bishops added.    The bishops deny church involvement in the rebellion, which  according to initial government reports had the support of  "priests and catechists" in the area, including Samuel Ruiz, the  bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. Ruiz immediately denied  the charges and condemned the methods used by the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN). "We cannot allow any suspicion  to fall upon our clergymen, priests, or the bishop himself. We  know he has always condemned violence," stressed the episcopal  communique.    After pronouncing itself in favor of a negotiated solution  to  the armed conflict, the CEM said it would be "reprehensible if  the Mexican Army were to transgress while in pursuit of its  duties," and asked that the "civilian population be respected,  arbitrary acts not be committed when searching for the guilty,  and that prisoners be treated" according to international rules.    The bishops also appealed to "businessmen, landowners,  cattlemen, and all those who influence life in Chiapas," asking  them for "actions to alleviate the poor," since extreme poverty  is "completely opposed to God's plan."</p>

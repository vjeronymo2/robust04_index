Of late, Sieng Lapresse, ancillary spokesman of the  two-heads-three-eyes government, has stated that the NADK has  burned people's rice fields.    2. The NADK spokesman totally rejects this accusation by the  ancillary spokesman of the two-heads-three-eyes government.    3. The NADK spokesman wishes to clarify that the NADK is the  defender of the nation, people, and peasants. It is also the  peasants' helper and liberator opposing aggressors who oppress  them. This is the NADK's longstanding tradition which cannot be  distorted.    On the contrary, it is only the communist Vietnamese  aggressors and the communist Vietnamese puppets as well as their  foreign cronies who have exploited the nation and people. They  are pocketing foreigners' money and colluding with them to  oppress and destroy the nation, people, and peasants. This is  why they have no support from the peasants' force.    As for NADK and Democratic Kampuchea [DK], they have  support.  This is because the DK and NADK are defenders of the nation and  people and liberators of the peasants.    [Dated] 15 January 1994    [Signed] NADK spokesman</p>

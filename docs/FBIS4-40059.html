			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stupishin, ambassador extraordinary </F> and plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation in the Republic of  Armenia, by Armen Khanbabyan; place and date not given: "`I Have  Felt at Home in Armenia'"]    [Text] [Khanbabyan] Vladimir Petrovich, what is it like  for you working in our country?    [Stupishin] Excellent. I have complete mutual understanding  with the leadership of Armenia, and there are contacts daily,  which is an essential condition for productive work. I should  say immediately, incidentally, that there are close relations  also between all official authorities of our two states--at the  parliamentary, governmental, ministerial, and departmental  level. This is making it possible to decide a mass of urgent  questions promptly.    What I have just said does not mean, of course, that  everything is ideal. Moments of choppiness arise also, but they  are quickly smoothed over to our mutual satisfaction, thanks to  the fact that there are today no political problems between  Russia and Armenia.    The climate for the operation of the Russian Embassy in  Armenia is altogether highly favorable. I have felt at home here  since day one. And not only among officials, I would say. The  attitude toward Russia [word illegible] and toward me  personally, as toward all the embassy staff, is [three words  illegible] most warm and cordial in all circles of society.    [Khanbabyan] Well, this is good to hear. But certain  difficulties also arise from time to time in this connection? An  ambassador is exclusively an official, after all....    [Stupishin] There are difficulties. And one of them is that  it is hard for some people as yet to get used to the idea that  the representative of Moscow is no longer the former "party  Gauleiter," to whom it was possible to complain about the local  authorities. Some people would clearly like to see me wearing  this cap, and this is why some people are today disappointed.  They are uncomfortable, as it were, with the absence of a  "Gauleiter," with the fact that the times when it was possible  to "run down" one's own people have gone, never to return. They  would like me to put pressure on the leadership of the  republic--de jure or, at least, de facto. Yet the diplomat's job  is something else--to contribute to a strengthening and  development of diverse and productive interstate relations. This  is what we are working for. And some people would clearly like  to see the ambassador of Russia "on their side," make him a  participant in some internal political intrigues, and link him  with some internal collisions. This is absolutely ruled out. I  see as my job the realization of the interests of Russia in the  host country. Of Russia, not this political force or grouping or  the other. I believe that it is to the advantage of Moscow and  Russians getting to know Armenia and the realities of the life  of its people and their problems better. This will enable them  to answer the question, "What do we need Armenia for," and will  enable them to identify Armenia and Armenians as their sincere  friends. This is the true state interest for both Russia and, I  believe, for Armenia.    [Khanbabyan] It is no secret that in a number of republics  of  the former Union there are organizations of the so-called  "Russian- speaking population" that, to put it mildly, are in  none too benevolent a frame of mind with regard to the local  authorities. It is known also that certain political circles in  Russia are endeavoring to make use of these organizations in  their own interests, thereby turning them, as it were, into a  fifth column threatening the young independence of the new  states....    [Stupishin] I am categorically opposed to the inevitable  difficulties of a socioeconomic order being experienced in the  present transitional period by the new states of the near abroad  being used by anyone at all for his own political ends.  Manipulating the fate of millions of people by playing on  difficulties and resuscitating a bankrupt ideology is the height  of irresponsibility. Unfortunately, it is this that  "national-patriotic" organizations like, for example, Ragozin's  "Congress of Russian Communities" or Barkashov's Nazi Party are  doing. I would note that it was at the instigation of the  notorious "Congress..." that what is now called the "Russian  Community of the Republic of Armenia" appeared in Armenia.  Forgive me, but this is nonsense; declaring oneself a community  is impossible! A national community takes shape historically and  cannot have political characteristics. It is no accident that  this notorious "Community" has nothing in common with the  "Russia" Society--the largest, mass organization of Russians in  Armenia.    I have to say, in general, that the difficulties that are  affecting inhabitants of Armenia who are Russian by nationality  (and we, the embassy, are endeavoring to the best of our  abilities to minimize these difficulties) should and can be  overcome only in cooperation with the government and the  authorities of the republic. And we are aware of their support.    [Khanbabyan] But there are in Armenia, unfortunately, not  only the "Russian Community" but also other, no less odious,  organizations and personalities. While not ethnic Russians and  having, as a rule, no real idea of present-day Russia and its  people, they are insistently attempting, nonetheless, to play  the part of that fifth column. I believe that in their  unconcealed aspiration to discredit the existing authorities  they have as of late overstepped certain bounds, namely, they  have attempted to use in their unscrupulous political game the  name of the Russian ambassador and to damage the prestige of the  Russian state and its leadership. A clear example of this was  the publication in GOLOS ARMENII of 2 June of this year. I  believe that this publication did palpable damage to  Armenian-Russian relations. What can you say in  this connection?    [Stupishin] Well, first, I regard the said publication as a  cheap and vulgar denunciation and a clumsy attempt to discredit  me in the eyes of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Russian Federation and our national parliament.  But these are idle endeavors. It is not for them to teach the  authorities in Russia how they should evaluate the activity of a  Russian diplomat.    The GOLOS authors lie when they claim that Russia is their  home. Not Russia, merely a particular, and far from the best,  part, what is more, of Russian society: neofascists of all  stripes, revanchists, political gangsters--these are the Moscow  friends of GOLOS ARMENII. This newspaper, which lays claim to  the appellation "independent," has publicly taken the part of  the most reactionary and most suspicious and regressive forces  both in Armenia and in Russia. And I have the impression that  the GOLOS authors are simply intoxicated with delight at their  political choice. It is not fortuitous that personal assaults  and attacks leveled not only against the president and  government of Armenia but also of Russia are so frequent on the  pages of this newspaper. Although "what is Hecuba to them," it  would seem! Only now, finding it necessary to recall my  interview of eight months ago, are they, without a moment's  doubt, attempting to accuse me of having used "derogatory  epithets" in respect to the Russian people--for having after the  October putsch in Moscow openly called things by their proper  name: gangsters--gangsters, fascists--fascists, and killers and  provocateurs--killers and provocateurs. How should I have acted?  Put the executioner and victim on the same footing? Treated  equally the Barkashovite sniper and the innocent citizen that  fell from his bullet? This would be the same as equating in  "all-forgiveness" Talaat and Enver and the people they killed.    And what about the constant attempts to "privatize" Victory  Day! Disgusting attempts, there is no other way to put it. It is  as though these people forget that not only members of the  Communist Party, but also peasant toilers ruined by  collectivization and true patriots repressed by the regime--in a  word, all to whom the fatherland is dear--fought and died for  the motherland. And in this connection this article contains  also an absolute lie in regard to me and my position. After all,  both last year and this year we employees of the Embassy of the  Russian Federation participated in conjunction with  representatives of the civilian and military authorities of  Armenia in solemn ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier  and in other activities. And this was a splendid symbol of our  friendship, our brotherhood in arms. I cannot imagine how  General A. Kazaryan, whose signature stands beneath the  publication in GOLOS ARMENII, could have "forgotten" this. It  remains to be regretfully assumed that some forces and people  who have never been anywhere near combat are cynically using the  distinguished veteran--a hero and combat general--in their own  interests and shamelessly manipulating his name.    The name of the holiday and its status is another matter.  Each state decides these matters in its own way, independently.  And the attempt by any methods to compel a diplomat to interfere  in the internal affairs of the host country is unethical,  therefore.    [Khanbabyan] GOLOS essentially accused you of neocolonialist  manners, of allegedly undertaking to "lecture" the local press  and public, and in an "offensive form," what is more, in a word,  of behaving as the Moscow party emissary--the second secretary  of the Central Committee--would not have dared to behave in the  former times. But at the same time you are attempting here to  play "the part of advocate for a bankrupt regime...."    [Stupishin] I do not know what the authors of the  publication  mean in speaking about "lectures" and so forth. After all, these  people were simply not present at the Yerevan State University  when I met the university's professorial and lecturer staff. In  the apt expression of Anna Andreyevna Akhmatova, "They were not  there." If for no other reason, they are not entitled, I  believe, to make evaluations of my words in the course of a  meeting or to comment on them. And I did not attempt,  incidentally, to lecture anyone; I answered the questions put to  me. It is GOLOS that is constantly attempting to lecture  everyone, in the most pushy fashion, what is more, shifting the  whole blame onto others, distorting the facts, and taking out of  the context of a speech individual words and expressions, as  they did, for example, in respect to my words concerning the  possibilities of a solution of the Karabakh crisis. They  probably greatly disliked the fact that I passed a comment on  their newspaper without any great enthusiasm. Excuse me, but  this is my right, the right of a reader. And, as ambassador, I  may say objectively that many of the publications in GOLOS  ARMENII, particularly that of 2 June 1994, do not contribute to  the strengthening and development of Russian-Armenian relations  and are sowing between the two peoples grains of hostility,  hatred, and suspicion. Nor do they in any way serve a civilized  solution of the tragic Karabakh conflict.    [Khanbabyan] Sowing hostility, hatred, suspicion--this is  altogether highly characteristic of publications that adhere to  neofascist, nationalist positions....    [Stupishin] Yes, this, by all accounts, is precisely how  they understand political struggle. They speculate on people's  ignorance, their insufficient knowledgeability. And I can say  plainly that many urgent matters for Armenia are being tackled  today with the help of Russia precisely because a high level of  mutual understanding has come about between Moscow and Yerevan.  The Government of Armenia has no need of advocates, but, knowing  the true state of affairs, I am duty bound to emphasize that the  president of the republic and the parliament and the Cabinet of  Ministers are doing everything possible for the continued  development and intensification of bilateral interstate  relations. And people like the GOLOS authors, although swearing  their love for Russia, are in practice doing everything to  hinder this work, since for them the worse things are, the  better. They are, alas, giving no serious thought to the needs  of their people and their true interests.    [Khanbabyan] The licentiousness, in the full sense of the  word, that GOLOS ARMENII has been demonstrating constantly as of  late in its evaluation of phenomena and individuals would seem  to me personally to be a consequence, frankly speaking, of a not  entirely comprehensible timorousness on the part of the law....    [Stupishin] Democracy should be defended, of course. This is  axiomatic. Otherwise, it degenerates into license, chaos, and  anarchy, that is, things that are the direct opposite of  freedom. But the whole point is that both with us, in Russia,  and with you, in Armenia, democracy is still very young, still  in diapers. And we are all only just learning democracy as yet.  Learning how to defend it included. It is our inexperience of  which publications like GOLOS ARMENII are taking advantage. They  frequently abuse each and everything without proof and falsely,  but with impunity here, and do they forget, in addition, to  shout about the lack of "true freedom." It is easy to appear  intrepid and high-minded if you know full well that there is no  threat to you from this. A convenient position, there is no  denying. Convenient, but, essentially, harmful and  unconstructive. And simply unscrupulous also.    I would say this: God is their judge. And as far as the  "timorousness of the law" is concerned, I repeat: It is not the  business of an ambassador to interfere in intrastate matters.  You yourselves and you alone must decide to what extent this  publication or the other of GOLOS and its ilk are in keeping  with the requirements of the press act and other laws of the  Republic of Armenia.</p>

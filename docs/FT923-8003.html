			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Sluggish growth in US retailing REPORTS of weak growth of US retail sales and almost flat consumer prices yesterday provided further evidence of sluggish economic conditions. In a separate report, the Congressional Budget Office said the economy had yet to enter a 'self-sustaining recovery' but appeared to be on the verge of one. It forecast growth of 1.9 per cent this year, rising to 3.1 per cent next year. Like most other forecasters, the CBO, an independent advisory body for Congress, has consistently over-estimated economic growth in the past couple of years. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, after seasonal adjustment, slightly more than expected in financial markets. However, its estimate for June was revised sharply down to show a contraction of 0.3 per cent instead of a gain of 0.5 per cent. Retail sales have made no significant headway since February. The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 3.2 per cent in the year to July - a smaller increase than expected. The increases followed average gains in consumer prices of 0.2 per cent in the preceding three months. Excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile, consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.7 per cent in the past year. Many analysts expect the underlying rate of inflation to fall to 3 per cent or less in the coming year. C J Lawrence, a New York broker, said the retail sales figures were consistent with economic growth of 1.5-2 per cent in the third quarter - a slight improvement on the second quarter but well short of the 3-4 per cent the Bush administration had hoped for earlier this year. The CBO said the recovery was hobbled by high levels of household debt, a glut of office space and fiscal retrenchment by state and local governments.</p>

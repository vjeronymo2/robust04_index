			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (7): Posh Gorbals - Slum Transformation GLASGOW, like most other big British cities, made big efforts after the Second World War to disperse its population from the centre to the suburbs. One result was a fall in population - from 1.12m in 1939 to only 700,000 today. Another was the so-called doughnut effect: Glasgow has a rich centre and a poor periphery. The metaphor does not work completely since not all council tenants were moved to the peripheral estates, where until the 1970s most housing was built by the public sector for rent. But most recent inner city residential developments have been privately developed. In the Merchant City, attractive but derelict warehouses and factories close to the City Chambers (city hall) were handed over to private developers by the city council and made into residential units which are either unsuitable for families or beyond the pocket of working class people. In 1980s terminology, it was 'yuppified'. Now, however, an ambitious pilot scheme, backed by the Glasgow Development Agency, the Glasgow District Council and Scottish Homes, the housing enabling body, aims to develop a low cost housing community close to the city centre. The project, called the Crown Street regeneration project, is to take place in part of the notorious Gorbals, which is a microcosm of Glasgow's changing fortunes over the past 100 years. The Gorbals, on the south bank of the River Clyde only five minutes from the city centre, was once a respectable middle class area. Then from the 1860s the once fashionable four storey tenements in the area were occupied by Irish immigrants and Highlanders driven to the big city by famine and clearances. So overcrowded were the buildings that a system known as 'ticketing' was introduced, which stipulated the numbers who could live in a four storey building. By the 1880s one seventh of Glasgow's population lived in ticketed buildings. With industrialisation people continued to pour in. By the early 1900s, the still elegant stone facades of Hutchesontown in the centre of the Gorbals concealed a hidden Glasgow. Families ate, slept, gave birth and died in one room. The cheap housing attracted further immigrants from Ireland and Eastern Europe and from Pakistan. These added their own cultures to the distinctive street life of the area. But the area became best known for the violence of the so-called razor gangs. By the 1950s the Gorbals had the worst slums north of Naples. The post-war planners in Glasgow decided to start from scratch. The first area in the city to be tackled was Hutchesontown/ Gorbals. The Hutchesontown Redevelopment Plan was finally approved in 1957. The area was to be a green city of tower blocks. It was not a success. The communities felt cut off and alienated. Within a short time the tower blocks - built using the 'tracoba' method of system building imported from Algeria - suffered from dampness and condensation. Lifts broke down. The dampness proved incurable. By 1982 the last residents were moved out. Five years later Hutcheson E - the most notorious of the blocks - was demolished. There are 40 acres standing empty in Hutchesontown owned by the city council. It is here that the Crown Street regeneration project will take place. The plan is to build 1,000 four storey tenements. The first two floors will be three and four bedroom maisonettes with gardens back and front. The top two floors will form single level one and two bedroom apartments. Twenty five per cent of the dwellings will be for rent with the rest for owner occupation. The entire project will cost Pounds 80m. Scottish Homes has put up Pounds 9m as seed money (in England it would be defined as city grant.) Because the council owns the land, and there is a high level of subsidy, the housing that is not for rent will be cheap. Maisonettes will start at Pounds 50,000 and flats at Pounds 32,000. Mr Mike Galloway, the director of the project which is only at the stage of examining design tenders, says, 'what we are attempting here is revolutionary. We are going for urban regeneration without gentrification. We are going to build a genuine lower middle class community here. There will be shops and community centres. We even have plans for a budget hotel. People from different walks of life will want to live here because it is so close to the city centre.' The peripheral estates which have tens of thousands of residents are a different problem. The estates, consisting of a mixture of three to four storey blocks of flats and tower blocks, have become almost as infamous as the Gorbals. They are characterised by high unemployment (30 per cent in some cases), by alienation and loss of community spirit, by vandalism, drugs and other symptoms of deprivation. It is unfair to say, however, that because the estates are out of sight they are out of mind. Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University sits on the partnership committee for the Castlemilk estate, to the south of the city. This is one of four partnership areas in Scotland designated by the secretary of state for Scotland - joint ventures between central government and local community organisations. Professor MacGregor says, 'Over 10 years hundreds of millions of pounds will be channeled into the estates in all kinds of areas, housing, training, employment and training. One of the things we are doing is to improve links between Castlemilk and East Kilbride where there are good employment prospects after the recession.' In other areas organisations such as the Glasgow Development Agency, the Glasgow District Council and the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland are involved in initiatives on the estates. Professor MacGregor says, 'it is early days for the initiatives. But it is not true to say that the city council is spending money on tarting up the centre and on the arts that it should be spending on the estates. It is doing both.'</p>

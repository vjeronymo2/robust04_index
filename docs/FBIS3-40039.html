			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jorma Poysa report: "GDP Drops to 1986 Level"] </F>   [Text] Finland's gross domestic product shrank last year by  2.6 percent. Total production was therefore actually 13 percent  lower than in the best year, 1990, and on the same level as in  1986. This is shown in the preliminary figures published by the  Central Statistical Office yesterday. However, the drop in GDP  was clearly slower at the end than in early part of the year.  The figures only show a halt in a long downhill trend in  overall production rather than a decent recovery, Heikki Salmi,  deputy manager of the Central Statistical Office, said: "I  would still wait two to three months before interpreting this as  the beginning of a recovery."    Salmi points out that all December figures, except for those  on unemployment, have yet to be confirmed. Production figures  arrive next week, but the December figures on trade and  construction are still about a month away. Salmi thinks that a  consolidated upward trend can only be confirmed when the figures  for January become available.  <H5>  Signs of Upturn </H5>   Salmi points out that expectations of an upturn are now  unusually high. Business-cycle expectations within the industry  are approaching an all-time high and similarly positive  expectations can also be seen at consumer level. Conditions for  recovery have improved at domestic as well as international  level.    The debt volume has shrunk considerably at both consumer and  enterprise levels. Consumer household debt has dropped over 10  percent from its peak figure at the of the 1980's. This  indicates that, on the basis of current interest rates,  consumers should be able to afford new loans for housing and  consumption. But last year's all-time high in savings indicates  that people were not tending to borrow money. Courage may grow  when there is a halt in the unemployment trend.    The financing surplus in the enterprise sector was 7 billion  Finnish markkas last year.    "The enterprises should be able to afford investments, but  whether they have the will is another question," Salmi added.    But interest in investments is spurred by continuing growth  in the export industry and last year's positive upturn in other  industrial sectors. There was also an upturn in the transport  and communication sectors at the end of the year. Salmi thinks  that the "taxi index," i.e., the rate of taxi drivers' actual  service time, is another recovery indicator.    Statisticians believe that GDP must be positive for at least  three months before an upturn can be confirmed.  <H5>  Energy, Financing, and Communications Begin To Grow </H5>   The forest and metal industries, which continued to grow  vigorously last year, have been joined by the sectors of energy  production, financing, and communications. The decline in  construction was, on the other hand, even greater than the year  before.    An upward turn in construction used to be one of the  clearest  indicators of a recovery. Statistics Manager Markku Suur-Kujala  believes that the recovery pattern in construction may now be  different: Residential building picks up, but the construction  of such things as shopping centers will hardly increase for a  while.  <H5>  Exports Already at Record Level </H5>   The export of goods and services grew by 17 percent last  year. Exports as a proportion of GDP rose to almost 34 percent,  higher than ever before. Imports during the same period stayed  at 1992 level.    Domestic demand decreased last year by more than 7 percent.  Investments dropped by more than 18 percent to keep the  investment level down to a record low of 15 percent. Private  consumption fell by just below 5 percent and public consumption  a little less than 6 percent.    The wage volume of the national economy dropped 7 percent  due  to growing unemployment. Capital and entrepreneurial income  rose by 9 percent. The real buying power of private households  dropped 4.5 percent.    The deficit of the total public sector was 8 percent of GDP.  The municipalities managed more or less to balance their  revenues and expenditures, which means that the deficit  originated at state level.    The tax rate -- taxes and social security costs as a  proportion of GDP -- was 46.7 percent, the same as in 1992.</p>

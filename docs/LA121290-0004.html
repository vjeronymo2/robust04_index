			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEFT TURNS  </P> <P> The good news is that there are many intersections with left-turn green arrows  that provide motorists with time-saving and frustration-saving protected left  turns. The bad news is that there are nowhere near enough of them.  </P> <P> There must still be hundreds of busy intersections in the Los Angeles area  where drivers wanting to turn left form a line almost a block long, and only  one car can make the left turn with each change of the light. In some cases,  sufficient complaining will bring a traffic engineer to the site. The engineer  will arrive with a clipboard and stopwatch to study the intersection's traffic  patterns. Then comes the conclusion: Yes, a left-turn arrow would save several  minutes for those wishing to turn left, but for the oncoming motorists going  straight, it would add three seconds. Decision: No green arrow.  </P> <P> I'm not an engineer, but I have enough science in my background to handle  arithmetic. This is madness. I cannot imagine any reason not to install left  turn arrows at all busy intersections. It would save time and reduce the  accident risk.  </P> <P> STEPHEN SOBEL  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

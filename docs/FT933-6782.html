			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Acquisitions give boost to Wolters Kluwer WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, yesterday reported a 26.6 per cent rise in net profit for the first half of 1993 and predicted that full-year net results would rise by more than 20 per cent. Net profit totalled Fl 138m (Dollars 72.66m) against Fl 109m a year earlier, on sales up 8 per cent at Fl 1.25bn. The company said a series of acquisitions since mid-1992 accounted for over half of the 25 per cent rise in first-half operating profit to Fl 225m. Recent acquisitions, plus financing for educational activities in Sweden, helped push financing costs up to Fl 17m from Fl 10m a year earlier. Wolters Kluwer's first-half results were slightly above expectations, and its shares rose by Fl 0.70 to close at a year's high of Fl 99. In its forecast for 1993, the company said also said net earnings per share would rise by about 17 per cent this year on a full-diluted basis. In 1992, net profit rose 20.4 per cent to Fl 257.6m, while net profit per share increased by 19.9 per cent to Fl 4.15 a share.</p>

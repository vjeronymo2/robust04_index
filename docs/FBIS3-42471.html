			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer under the "Army" rubric: </F> "Ministry of Defense Sees Normal Call-Up, Armed Forces Up to  Strength by 1995"]    [Text] In a press conference held yesterday in the Ministry  of Defense, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian General Staff, stated that this is the third month that  he has been starting his day at 7 AM by reading the latest  call-up tabulation. This past autumn the Army discharged at the  same time those men who had served 18 months and those 24  months, a situation that could have brought on a disaster in the  form of a virtually total loss of combat capability, if the  call-up were unsuccessful. This would hold true for Army large  units proper and for the other Armed Forces in Russia (MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs], Border Troops, etc.).    Therefore, the abovementioned undesirable event was  prevented  and the Army manpower stabilized. The Army's average strength  presently consists of conscripts in the amount of 54 percent,  while in especially important, elite large units (VDV [Airborne  Troops], strategic nuclear triad), this figure runs at 70 to 90  percent.    The present call-up plan is 73 percent fulfilled. This,  however, is not the final tally, since students about to  graduate from tekhnikums and PTU's [professional and technical  schools], who were granted the opportunity to undergo  accelerated instruction for the purpose of earning their  diploma, will be called up for induction into the service as far  in the future as April.    The poorest situation obtains in the case of manpower of the  Russian troops stationed in foreign countries. The General Staff  has virtually ceased sending replacements to Germany and the  Baltics, whence troop withdrawal is nearing completion, and to  the Dniester area, where, in the words of Mikhail Kolesnikov,  "Army Commander Lebed persists in causing us problems." The  Troop Grouping in the Transcaucasus (Georgia, Armenia) is  receiving a minimum of replacements, and only volunteers, at  that, since the Russian General Staff is of the opinion that the  situation in that area poses no threat. At the same time the  Ministry of Defense is attempting (also on a volunteer basis) to  improve the strength of the 201st Division stationed in  Tajikistan, the spot that is the "hottest" at the present time.  There is a distinct manpower shortage there (the 201st Division  consists of slightly more than 5,000 men - P. F.).    By and large, on 12 December Russian citizens voted for the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], communists, and for  other ultra-and simply patriotic candidates, but, when it comes  to the personal level, they tend to shy away from civil deeds  associated with sacrifice, continuing in the General Staff's  opinion to employ on a mass scale any means at their disposal to  avoid being called up. The Ministry of Defense (working with law  enforcement agencies) is taking measures to apprehend deserters,  and, in addition, will do all it can to restrict the legal means  for obtaining a draft deferment.    Also to continue in 1994 is recruitment of professional  soldiers: contract servicemen. They presently number somewhat in  excess of 120,000 men in the Army (amounting to 10 percent of  the total number in the lower grades). In this connection, the  1993 contract servicemen recruitment plan was fulfilled in  literally several months. The Ministry of Defense generally did  not anticipate such a large number of persons desirous of  serving in the Army for money (the minimum pay for a contract  private as of 1 January 1994 was 110,000 rubles.) On 18 January  President Yeltsin signed a ukase calling for the recruitment of  150,000 additional contract servicemen for 1994. By the  beginning of 1995, the General Staff hopes to bring the total  number of professional soldiers, including women and personnel  in extended service, to 400,000 (to 32 percent of the authorized  strength).    In addition, the Ministry of Defense officially submitted to  the government a proposal calling for additional cuts of the  Armed Forces manpower limit to 2 million men to replace the  2.1-million manpower figure that was planned for 1994. As a  result, assuming that the call-up will be successful, the  manpower needs of the Army, MVD, and Border Troops by the end of  the year will be met in the amount of 90 to 95 percent. In that  case, all Russian Armed Forces subordinated to the government  will assume complete combat readiness, standing, if necessary,  fully ready to deal with possible difficulties and conflicts,  whether the latter occur on the borders or in nearby countries.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA platinum mine opens to chorus of dissent amid static prices SOUTH AFRICA'S Northam platinum mine opens today against the background of a static platinum price and considerable dissension among local analysts as to the merits of the project. Disagreement centres around what sort of grades the mine will produce, whether or not it is a high cost producer and the timing of the opening. Although the mine will not be a particularly large producer - between 230,000 and 250,000 troy ounces a year at full production, about 6 per cent of world supply - its progress is being keenly watched. Not only does it represent the first venture into platinum for Gold Fields of South Africa, but recent attempts to expand platinum capacity in South Africa have met with mixed fortunes. Although Rustenburg, Impala and Lonhro, the three main producers, have all increased capacity in recent years, the weak state of the market has caused Impala to defer development of the Messina and Barplats projects, and Lebowa Platinum has also encountered problems with the expansion of its Atok mine. Critics of Northam, like Mr Kevin Kartun of stockbrokers Frankel Pollak Vinderine, cite four main concerns: that the mine is unequivocally a high cost producer and therefore vulnerable in any price squeeze; that ore reserves below 2,000 metres may not be accessible because of heat problems, shortening the mine's life; that considerable gambles are being taken with various new technologies; and that the grades claimed by the company are excessively optimistic. Mr Dave Russell of brokers Irish &amp; Menell Rosenberg takes a more optimistic view. He argues that the planning and design of the mine has been methodical and well proven, and that the predicted grades make the mine a medium-cost rather than high-cost producer. He is also confident the company has the requisite technical expertise to deal with any mining problems that might arise. Although a platinum price of Dollars 360 an ounce is probably considerably lower than that envisaged when the mine was conceived in the mid-1980s, Mr Jeremy Coombes of Johnson Matthey says the rationale behind its development is still valid. Although much of the increased autocatalyst demand the mine sought to cash in on has already taken place, widespread and stringent emissions legislation should ensure this market continues to grow. Mr Coombes says the supply/demand situation for platinum in 1993 looks balanced. He predicts more metal from South Africa - Rustenburg has completed the Amandebult expansion, Impala is recovering from a severely disrupted year and Lonhro's expansion continues - but believes this will be absorbed by increased demand for exhaust catalysts from the motor industries in Europe and the America. He predicts jewellery and industrial off-take at similar levels to 1992.</p>

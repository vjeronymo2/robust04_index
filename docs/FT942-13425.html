			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / UK Company News: May float for Nightfreight Nightfreight, the Liverpool-based delivery business which specialises in industrial and just-in-time markets, is to float on the Stock Exchange next month. The listing is expected to value the group at about Pounds 50m and raise around Pounds 17m. Nightfreight, which also distributes The Independent newspaper, will use most of the money to clear debts of about Pounds 10m. One incidental beneficiary of the flotation is likely to be Everton Football Club. Mr Peter Johnson, Nightfreight's part-time non-executive chairman, is also chairman of Park Foods and owner of Tranmere Rovers. He will be selling some of his 33 per cent holding in Nightfreight at about the time he is likely to take control of Everton, when he will need immediate cash to inject into the struggling football club. Another beneficiary of the flotation will be 3i, which will sell some of its 9 per cent holding. Nightfreight began as a struggling regional newspaper carrier called Hernway Transport, which Mr Russell Black, founder and chief executive, bought from the receiver for Pounds 138,000 in 1984. Nightfreight now has 38 depots around Britain and Ireland and an additional northern hub at Burnley. It franchises 23 of the more remote depots to 21 regional independent carriers. Last November it bought Greenline, a member of its network, and PHS Group, which brought with it a Gatwick-based international freight forwarder called Jetspeed. Last year's operating profit of Pounds 2.28m - up 46 per cent on 1992 - was made on Pounds 21.35m turnover. Greenline made Pounds 523,000 on turnover of Pounds 10.24m and PHS Pounds 516,000 on Pounds 7.12m of turnover in the respective 10 and nine months before Nightfreight bought them.</p>

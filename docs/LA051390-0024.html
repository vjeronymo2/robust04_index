			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: ISRAEL HOROVITZ RETURNS TO GLOUCESTER  </P> <P> Playwright Israel Horovitz thinks Los Angeles is a wonderful place to work out  a new play. But not for the reasons one might imagine.  </P> <P> "L.A. is so focused on TV and film that theater is kind of an arcane sport,"  the Obie- and Emmy-winning writer said. "People look at you like you're doing  something cute."  </P> <P> Despite those external perceptions, his own commitment perseveres. "As a  playwright, I'm very close to the work," said Horovitz, author of "Strong-Man's  Weak Child," opening Friday at Los Angeles Theatre Center. "And now, being the  director too, it's right at the end of my nose . . . though with my nose,  that's not so close."  </P> <P> "Strong-Man" is the latest in Horovitz's "Gloucester plays" (he counts "9 or  10" of them), a cycle of works rooted in Gloucester, Mass. Horovitz visited the  town as a child; as an adult, he traveled back "to this place I loved so much  and went to work in this little Victorian house on a hill." Formerly a  working-class area, Horovitz has seen "Boston yuppies" drive the real estate  prices up; at the same time, local businesses -- some of them five generations  old -- began to founder and disappear.  </P> <P> With local suicides on the upswing, morale at a low ebb and drugs taking fierce  hold, Horowitz began thinking of the community as a microcosm of society's  contemporary ills.  </P> <P> "It seemed if I could write about life in this little dot, it might be a  metaphor for what's going on in the larger world," he said. "So with the  Gloucester plays, I started to make (the setting) as important as the story. I  had the feeling that if I got it right for Gloucester, it would work for the  entire world."  </P> <P> "Strong-Man" was inspired by Horovitz's time at a gym there.  </P> <P> "I've been a runner since I was 13; now I'm 51," he said. "I've been working  out in gyms because I don't want to look like other writers -- but since I run,  I'm very thin.  </P> <P> "I've been around gyms forever, and I really love them. What you see in  Gloucester are these lampers (stevedores), big, beefy strong men who're not  trained for anything else -- and now the shipping industry is closing down. I  loved the metaphor of the men keeping their bodies in shape, almost as an  antidote for the work going away."  </P> <P> The piece, which features Meg Foster, Peter Iacangelo, Nick Mancuso and Don  Yesso, tells of a body-builder whose daughter is stricken with bone-marrow  cancer. "I used bone-marrow because it's the deepest possible rotting,"  Horovitz noted. "The story sounds like a soap opera, but when you see it, it's  larger than that. You have these uneducated people discussing deeply  philosophical issues without a sophisticated language -- dealing with questions  like 'What is a father?' 'What is a parent?' "  </P></p>

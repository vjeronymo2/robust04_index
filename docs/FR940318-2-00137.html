Purpose and Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice announces the proposed availability of funds for grants for targeted assistance for services to refugees in counties where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations, high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of resources for services to this population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available $49,397,000 in FY 1994 funds for the targeted assistance program (TAP) as part of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health and Human Services (Pub. L. 103&hyph;112).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The House Appropriations Committee Report reads as follows with respect to targeted assistance funds (H.R. Rept. No. 103&hyph;156, p. 93):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program provides grants to States for counties which are impacted by high concentrations of refugees and high dependency rates. The Committee intends that $19,000,000 of the total be provided to continue the current program of support to communities affected as a result of the massive influx of Cuban and Haitian entrants during the Mariel boatlift. The Committee also intends that 10 percent of the total appropriated for targeted assistance be used for grants to localities most heavily impacted by the influx of refugees such as Laotian Hmong, Cambodians, and Soviet Pentecostals, including secondary migrants who entered the United States after October 1, 1979. The Committee expects these grants to be awarded to communities not presently receiving targeted assistance because of previous concentration requirements and other factors in the grant formulas, as well as those who do currently receive targeted assistance grants. The Committee intends that the State of California shall be held harmless in the formula allocation of targeted assistance funds as a result of any reductions to the total amount appropriated for the targeted assistance program. California's total share of funding under the formula allocation in fiscal year 1994 should be no less than the percentage share of California's allotment under fiscal year 1993 appropriations. In determining the hold harmless allocation to California, the total amount appropriated for targeted assistance will be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Senate Appropriations Committee Report (S. Rept. No. 103&hyph;143, p. 162) is less specific than, but consistent with, the above-quoted House Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) proposes to use the $49,397,000 appropriated for FY 1994 targeted assistance as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;$25,457,300 is proposed for allocation under the updated formula, as set forth in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

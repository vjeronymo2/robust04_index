			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Unions move closer to merger ballot THE MAIN union in British Telecom and its opposite number in the Post Office are expected to hold a merger ballot at the end of 1994 after several years of talks. The National Communications Union and the Union of Communication Workers have been discussing since 1988 the formation of a larger union representing more than 300,000 communication workers, but the talks have intensified over the past few months. A proposal recommending the ballot will be put to both unions at their annual conferences this year, and if it succeeds, a ballot on the merger will be held in autumn 1994. The move comes among widespread union attempts to amalgamate to gain financial and bargaining strength. Some have moved in the direction of large general unions while others have sought mergers on industrial lines. Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the NCU, said: 'Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW, and I see this as an opportunity to form a communications-based union. Since our respective conferences last May and June we have been finding areas of agreement on significant parts of the new structure including the executive.' He said although the majority of the NCU's members worked in BT and the majority of the UCW's were employed by the Post Office, both had an important group of members in each other's territory and faced common issues. They included privatisation, liberalisation and new technology. The UCW has about 180,000 members and the NCU about 130,000. Mr Young said that if the existing executives merged, the new body would be about 70-strong. He said both unions were looking to reduce their executives' numbers.</p>

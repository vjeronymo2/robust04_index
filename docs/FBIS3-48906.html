May the year 1994 bring joy, happiness, harmony and great  prosperity for your families, and your children and friends.    The year which is going out was a good year for us. It was a  year of efforts, challenges and successes for the whole Albanian  nation. At the age of a nation every minute, hour and day is of  great importance. But I would distinguish among all ages that  democracy is the most important and it itself has its most  significant and decisive moments. The year 1993 was determinant  to the reforms program in Albania. By the end year let us think  for a moment of the position of the Albanian society in the  past, the troubled waters it was in two or five years ago. If  we do this we will all feel a great joy that our ship was able  to come to anchor towards freedom. Thus we joyfully celebrate  the new year being sure and optimistic for the future of free  Albania. Tonight let us recall Albania of some years ago and if  we do this we will never forget the price of freedom we enjoy  today. However bitter Albania's past history, we can see the  progress we have made. If we throw a glance on the road we have  traversed in such a time we will see that the progress of  Albanian people during a year of work and efforts is enormous.  Albania of 1993, despite the great troubles and hardships has  quite completely changed its view and sees to the new year with  a higher standard than 1993.    We rightfully call the year 1993 as the year of great  turning  point on the road of all-sided consolidation of reforms in  Albania. During this year we were able to transform Albania, the  country of chaos, anarchy, organized state corruption, poverty  and hunger, gallopant inflation and paralyzed economy into a  country of free citizens, private farmer, free enterprise, free  creators. Albania is now a country where political legislative,  institutional and economic reforms are successfully carried out.  So Albania is moving towards the establishment of a genuine  civilized society.    Brothers and sisters,    During 1993 harmony and understanding among people have  increased. Both of them were an empty notion without freedom.  The human rights and freedoms charter was endorsed and these  rights and freedoms are developing constantly. The necessary  legislation for the transition into a market economy was  drafted, the institutions of the rule of law were consolidated,  economic reform marked a great turning point. A paralysed  Albanian economy was replaced by free market economy, inflation  was put under complete control, lands, houses and hundreds of  enterprises were privatized.    The growth of gross production is the greatest achievement  of  the reform. Compared to a year ago, goods turnover is several  times higher, export and import increased by 3-5 times. Albania  which two years ago counted its witch-hunters has now its rich  men.    Human dimension of Albanian society have increased and will  continue to increase in the future due to the social component  of market economy, social assistance and economic support, the  reduction of work days and several other achievements.  Spiritual and cultural life, the genius of Albanian creators  recorded a great development and their talent was in blossom  during 1993. But I would say that what has changed more is our  psychology. In this way the psychology of totalitarian society  was replaced by psychology of free market. Tolerance, respect  for man and his freedoms, understanding and optimism  characterize the individual and national psychology. During  1993 Albania and Albanians, through efforts, pains, sacrifices  and achievements for the establishment of the rule of law and  market economy, moved closer to Europe and the civilized world,  deserved their generous aid, support and respect. Albania's  image in the world at present is quite different.    Historic progress was made in cooperation with our  neighbours, member countries of the European Union, the United  States, Islamic countries and international institutions.  Albanians proved to be serious partners and displayed their  determination for building a free and democratic society. They  are determined to follow a foreign policy which intends to  integrate Albania into Europe, to prevent conflict in the  region, and resolve correctly the issue of Albanians in former  Yugoslavia. The year 1993 was another year of terror for  Albanians in Kosova.    Police violence, savage dictatorship, poverty, and  persecution kept growing. In front of this barbarous stand,  which relies on the ideology of crime, massacre and annihilation  of another nation, is the civilized, determined and wise  attitude of self-controlled Albanians who know that freedom is  eternal while violence and terror have their days numbered. The  just issue of Albanians in Kosova and former Yugoslavia was  presented to the UN. The European Union and international  community appreciate more and more the role of Albanians as a  factor of stability in the region and today it is clear to them  that without the correct solution of Kosova issue, without  guaranteeing the human rights and national freedoms of Albanians  in former Yugoslavia, the resolution of Balkan crisis is  impossible.    In spite of our great and incontestible achievements during  1993 we are aware of the great problems and difficulties lying  in store for 1994. Priority will be given to reduction of  unemployment, construction of infrastructure, attraction of  investors, privatization of mid and large-sized enterprises and  the establishment of vouchers' market. In regard to foreign  policy Albania will give priority to its integration into Europe  and international community, the correct solution of the  Albanian nationality issue.    Ladies and gentlemen,    Great challenges lie in store during 1994. But our  capabilities to solve them are several times greater. The new  year will be a year of the vigor of freedom because a great  vigor has burst out today among all Albanian citizens wherever  they work and live. The year 1994 will be a touch stone for us.  Success will depend on how wise and capable we will be to make  use of constant vigour of freedom to step up the development of  Albania and make for the lost time. In fact we have a long way  to go through in order to get there where we wish to. But  Albania is a young nation and young nations have great energies,  they progress quickly in freedom. I am optimistic and sure that  in 1994 we will fulfil our hopes and will meet the established  goals. Let us make use of the vigor of freedom to be closer  each other, and be more united than ever, as brothers of blood,  spirit and freedom to build a more prosperous present and future  for our children and outselves. Let us use the vigor of freedom  to raise high the name and honour of Albanians and Albania, and  to integrate Albania more and more into Europe and the world.    I appeal to all your brothers and sisters, to toast and wish  Albanians in Albania, Kosova, emigration, diaspora, wherever  they are, in city or countryside, in their homes,in military  units, in navigation, in hospitals, prisons or in the border, as  well as their friends in the Balkans, Europe and the world : A  happy new year! I also wish them all good health, happiness and  prosperity.    God bless Albania and the year 1994.</p>

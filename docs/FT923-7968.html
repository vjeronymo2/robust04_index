			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Rescue of Canary Wharf hits snag STRONG opposition to the US consortium bid for control of Canary Wharf, the east London property development, was voiced at yesterday's meeting of the project's 11 bank lenders. A European banker said yesterday that the consortium's insistence that any money it puts into the project should be repaid ahead of the banks was 'a big problem'. However, the banks have not rejected the offer. After a meeting lasting most of the day, the banks set up a sub-committee of three banks, including Lloyds of the UK and Credit Suisse of Switzerland, to negotiate with the consortium's US adviser, Smith Barney. In a separate development, Hanson, the conglomerate, dropped plans to make an offer for Canary Wharf, which is in administration under UK insolvency procedures. Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, explained: 'A big investment like Canary Wharf could have added an extra Pounds 1bn to net debt; it would have been negative to our profit and loss account for several years and there was no payback for 10 years.' The US consortium is led by Mr Larry Tisch, the media billionaire, and was formed by Mr Paul Reichmann, the Canadian developer who set up the project. It is proposing to inject Pounds 350m (Dollars 668m) into Canary Wharf to complete the project and contribute to building the Jubilee Line underground train extension to Docklands. The interest rate paid on the Pounds 350m would be a normal bank rate of interest. However the consortium would also receive a 50 per cent equity interest in the project. The remainder of the equity would be split between the 11 banks and Olympia &amp; York, Mr Reichmann's company which built Canary Wharf. The banks, owed Pounds 576m, are concerned that they would be relegated to 'a second mortgage position' if they accept the consortium offer, a banker said. At yesterday's meeting, the banks accepted that there is a month left for the private sector to find Pounds 160m if the Jubilee line is to be built. A banker admitted that the consortium bid is the firmest rescue plan for Canary Wharf yet, although banks are looking at five other proposals. 'If the banks turn it down, there is a risk that there will be no Jubilee line and the project will be liquidated', a financier said.</p>

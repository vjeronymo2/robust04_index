			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow becalmed ahead of inflation data Wall Street MIXED trading patterns surfaced yesterday, with losses in the consumer products sector countered by gains in oil and motor shares, writes Nikki Tait in New York. However, by the close, the former trend dominated, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was showing a modest 1.62-point loss at 3,377.57, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index was 1.13 easier at 441.16. The Nasdaq composite index, which measures the over-the-counter market, fell more heavily, by 6.57 to 664.14, largely because of a number of very weak stocks, with few positive situations to offset their impact. Trading volume on the New York SE was 291.7m shares, while declines outweighed advances by a small margin. In terms of general economic trends, the stock market remains focused on the inflation numbers due to be released on Thursday and Friday, and it paid little attention to yesterday's wholesale sales figures, or to the big carmakers' relatively cheerful March sales data released on Monday afternoon. But many of the larger consumer products companies continued to drift lower, as investors fretted about the strength of 'brand loyalties' generally - a concern triggered by Philip Morris's decision to defend the market share position of its best-selling Marlboro label at an enormous cost to profits. Coca-Cola, for example, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 , while PepsiCo, its big soft drinks rival, lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 40. Colgate-Palmolive was Dollars 2 1/8 weaker at Dollars 60 and Procter &amp; Gamble slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 . In the tobacco sector itself, Philip Morris continued to lose ground, dropping Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 . RJR Nabisco eased a further Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 , while American Brands gave up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 29 7/8 . Wal-Mart Stores, the top-selling US retailer, shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 27 3/4 in fairly heavy trading. There have been worries recently that the company may not be able to sustain its phenomenal growth record. Many medical shares were sliding. US Surgical dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/4 . Broker Hambrecht &amp; Quist downgraded its rating on the stock to 'hold' from 'buy'. In the auto sector, the three Detroit manufacturers put on a strong performance in the aftermath of Monday's sales figures. General Motors gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 38 3/8 , Chrysler Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 41 and Ford Dollars 2 at Dollars 54. Oil issues, meanwhile, continued to build on Monday's gains during the morning session, although some of the advances had been shed by the close. However, Chevron ended Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 84 3/8 and Exxon up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 67 5/8 . Turner Broadcasting 'B' rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 on reports that Time Warner and Tele-Communications - both big shareholders in Turner - may divide the company's assets. However, Corning, the first major company to issue first-quarter earnings figures, hardly got the reporting season off to an auspicious start. The New York State-based glass company saw its shares slip Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 on news that the quarter's profits before extraordinary items were down from Dollars 65m to Dollars 47.2m. Canada TORONTO closed flat to slightly lower after heavy trading, dragged down by a decline among gold shares. The TSE 300 index dipped 5.5 to 3,598.8 and volume amounted to 55.1m shares valued at CDollars 434.3m. Half of the 14 sub-group indices lost ground, with golds shedding 1.3 per cent following a weakening in the bullion price, which closed USDollars 1.50 down at USDollars 337.55 an ounce in New York. The transportation group had the day's biggest rise, of 1.0 per cent.</p>

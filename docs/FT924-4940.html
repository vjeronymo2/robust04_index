			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Bucking the trend: Furnishing a surprising example - Neil Buckley meets two brothers who prospered by not borrowing A THRIVING furniture company is something of a rarity these days. To find one in Essex, one of the counties worst-hit by the recession, is a double surprise. Essex Furniture, which specialises in making and selling three-piece suites, brought some much-needed cheer to the business pages last month. For the year to June the company saw turnover increase 52 per cent to Pounds 7.15m and pre-tax profits increase 46 per cent to Pounds 727,000. UK furniture sales rose 5.5 per cent last year. Essex Furniture achieved like-for-like growth of about 28 per cent. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits for this year of Pounds 1m. The philosophy that has enabled Mr Michael Franks, chairman, and his brother Martin, the chief executive, to achieve this success can perhaps be summed up in one phrase: a desire to be masters of their own destiny. Two important decisions underpinned that philosophy. The first was to give up selling to the trade and instead to retail directly to the public. The second was never to borrow money. Mr Michael Franks says: 'A lot of companies that borrowed heavily in the 80s now spend 75 per cent of their time working out how they are going to service the debt. We spend our whole time thinking about how to expand the business.' The brothers began helping in their father's furniture workshop in Shoreditch, east London, when they were still in their teens. By the 1970s the business had become Shoebury Upholstery, with factories in Shoeburyness, Essex, and Scotland. In 1972 it went bankrupt. The brothers say it was a shattering but important experience which helped instil their suspicion of borrowing. The brothers and their father decided to try again with Essex Furniture, selling initially to the trade 'because that was what we knew'. A second setback brought a change of tack. A trade customer went bankrupt owing Essex Furniture large sums of money. The Franks experimented with direct retailing. On Friday afternoons they would lay out some of their finished goods in a corner of their factory at Rochford, Essex, before delivering to retailers and offering to duplicate and sell direct anything on show. The local council stopped this because the factory was not designated a retail zone. But in 1975 Essex Furniture rented a vacant 3,500 sq ft shop near the factory and began selling only to the public. A second shop opened at Grays, Essex, in 1977. Others were added every two or three years until, in 1987, the brothers received an offer of a buy-out. They rejected it, but began to consider how best they could expand the company more rapidly. The boom years of the late 80s had tempted many businesses to borrow heavily, but the brothers resisted. They sought a flotation on the unlisted securities market, even though with a market capitalisation of only Pounds 3.5m they were considerably smaller than the average size for USM companies. Essex Furniture was successfully floated in September 1989. This provided the capital needed to expand the business as well as raising awareness of the company. Since then the company has opened eight showrooms - five of them outside Essex, trading under the name The Furniture Workshop - taking the total to 14. The company is now capitalised at Pounds 7m and employs nearly 800 people. Essex Furniture took advantage of the weak property market to obtain favourable terms for new showrooms. It also plans to open at least three more showrooms next year, armed with Pounds 1.1m from a rights issue in June. Mr Michael Franks envisages that by 1996 there will be a chain of 20 to 30 stores as far as 200 miles from the factory and head office at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Part of the company's formula is to trade through showrooms of 10,000 sq ft  -large enough to show an extensive range but intimate enough to avoid the feel of a 'shed'. The company offers a number of standard designs but customers choose from a range of fabrics from which curtains can also be made to measure. Another strategy is to hold no stocks, which cuts warehousing costs, and manufacture only to order. Customers wait six to 10 weeks from paying their deposit to receiving their furniture. Mr Michael Franks says the company has had considerable success in ironing out the peaks and the troughs of seasonal demand through carefully timed marketing campaigns. This does not fully answer the question of why consumers are flocking into the company's showrooms in spite of the economic downturn. Mr Franks will not reveal what he thinks the secret is. 'All I can say is that it's like two women going into the supermarket and buying the same ingredients to bake a cake. The cakes will always taste different. It's the way you put the ingredients together.'</p>

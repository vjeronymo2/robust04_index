			<p>BFN     [Text] In accordance with the Constitution, the elections  of the first Belarusian president will take place tomorrow. In  this connection, the Cabinet of Ministers has issued a statement.    The popularly elected president should become a guarantor of  the sovereignty, national security, and territorial integrity of  our state, as well as ensure political and economic stability,  peace, and accord within society, and implement urgent tasks  related to foreign policy and foreign trade. In the process of  preparations for the elections, especially during its final  stages, some candidates for the highest state position have made  the government the prime target of their criticism, mounting the  most incredible charges against it. It is being drilled into  the people that the government has no course of action to  resolve many complex economic problems. Subject to attacks, the  statement reads, are even attempts by the Cabinet of Ministers  to support state-run industrial and agricultural enterprises, as  well as measures intended to reduce price increases,  unemployment, and social deregulation of the market. The  government, the statement stresses, considers it a task of  national importance to restore the Republic's economic potential  and ensure its integration into the international system of  economic and political relations. Its integration policies have  been accepted by the international community. Their most  important element is economic union with Russia. The concluded  agreements have already produced concrete results. As never  before, the Republic needs mutual support, understanding, and a  uniting of the efforts of all people to overcome the difficult  situation.</p>

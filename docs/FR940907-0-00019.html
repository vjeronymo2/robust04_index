The comment period ended July 19, 1994. The Coast Guard received three letters commenting on the proposal. Prior to publishing the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule, the Coast Guard also published Public Notice 5&hyph;818 and the original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Pamunkey River, West Point, Virginia, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (58 FR 62303). The comment period ended January 10, 1994. The Coast Guard received 66 letters commenting on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The original Notice of Proposed Rule announced that a proposal was being considered to restrict openings of the Eltham Bridge to all vessels during morning, noon, and evening rush hours, between the hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., 12 noon to 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday; except Federal holidays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the proposed rule and the public notice, comments were received from the maritime community and the motoring public. The motorists all were in favor of the proposed restrictions during peak traffic hours to reduce traffic disruption, delays, congestion and minor accidents. The commercial marine industry was opposed to restricting the openings, based on economic impact concerns, safety and tidal navigational requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following further investigation by the Coast Guard, it was determined that the major cause of traffic congestion due to bridge lifts for the Eltham Bridge was contributed by commercial fisherman, crabbers and recreational boaters requesting frequent bridge lifts during rush hour traffic periods. These mariners, for the most part, could pass through without a bridge lift, by lowering their antennae. The remainder of the maritime industry, consisting of piloted vessels and large tugs and barges, passing through this bridge is very sporadic. The bridge tender's logs only reflected 4 or 5 bridge lifts per month for these vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Virginia Department of Transportation, in an effort to improve this situation, has requested these revised regulations. It agreed to changing the original request by excluding larger classes of maritime vessels from the restrictions, and to placing new restrictions on commercial fishing and crabbing vessels and recreational vessels which create most of the problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The three comments received as a result of the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule issued by the District Commander are all in favor of the new restrictions for the Eltham Bridge. No new or additional changes are being made to the regulatory language of this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The economic impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This opinion is based on the fact that the regulations will not unduly cause a hardship on commercial/military vessels who will be able to plan their vessel transits around the hours of restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received concerning small entities or on the economic impact this rule would have on small entities. Since the impact on these regulations is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. et seq.), that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though commercial crabbers and small fishing vessel operators would be restricted under the proposed regulations, the Coast Guard believes the proposed opening schedule for these operators is not unduly restrictive. These vessel operators can still crab and fish, but they will have to time their requests for openings of the bridge to coincide with the proposed new schedule. This should not cause any economic hardship. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bridges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F> Information Department, by Faridah al-Shubashi; place and date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO  Information Department, following the intensive meetings held by  PLO in Tunis with the Israeli delegation, the U.S. delegation,  and the Danish mediator, what is the situation now?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, these meetings have not achieved any  positive results. We have not achieved progress on the issues  we discussed. The U.S. side still seeks to link the issuance of  a Security Council resolution to an agreement on a date to  resume the talks.    We reiterated that the Security Council resolution will only  be of value if it ensures practical steps on the ground to  guarantee international protection for the Palestinian people.  The issuance of such a resolution is a responsibility  shouldered by the international community, not a bargaining card  to resume the talks. Therefore, I can say that no progress was  achieved in the talks with the United States. Anyhow, the ball  now is in the U.S. court. The Americans are required to give  answers regarding the Security Council resolution, which should  be issued immediately after a delay of approximately three  weeks, as well as regarding their stand vis- a-vis the provision  of international protection for the Palestinian people.    We believe that the issue of negotiations is not a  procedural  matter. We believe that the objective of the talks, in fact the  whole peace process, is to provide security for the Palestinian  people and to guarantee their rights. If the security of the  Palestinian people will continue to be endangered -- as was  proven by the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- what then is  the value of the talks and their resumption in this case?    Regarding the talks with the Israeli delegation, the  delegation that came [to Tunis] was not authorized to hold any  serious discussion. What was conveyed to us was no more than  formal and secondary decisions issued by Israeli Government and  about which we heard. Such decisions will not change the  situation on the ground. The settlements and settlers continued  to be a source of continuous and daily danger to the life of the  Palestinian people as well as a source of threat to the peace  process and to any agreement that might be reached regarding the  transitional period.    The Israelis now know our position very well. The peace  process is linked with effective measures on the ground,  foremost of which is ending the settlers' presence in the heart  of Hebron and in a number of settler centers that represent  permanent hotbeds of tension and explosion. Measures include  tackling the issue of the presence of armed settlers, especially  in Palestinian towns and villages, and providing international  protection, especially in Hebron where Palestinian security is  exposed to permanent threats.    [Al-Shubashi] Has the Palestinian leadership succeeded in  presenting all these issues to the U.S. side? Is the U.S. side  still insisting that the Palestinians are the ones who should  offer concessions?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] The U.S. side expressed understanding of  Palestinian demands, but wants talks to resume and wants a date  for this to be fixed. For our part, we said the Palestinian  people and all the forces that want the peace process to succeed  in the region hold the view that the success of any negotiations  is now linked with practical measures on the ground, sponsored  by the international community. On the one hand, this is  international protection, and on the other hand, this is Israel  shouldering the responsibility to end the armed settler presence  and the activities of the settlers. Therefore, the the United  States is looking for formal measures. We are looking for  substance, so these measures can lead to the successful  conclusion of resuming negotiations.    [Al-Shubashi] Perhaps the United States has monitored the  overwhelming popular anger in the Arab and Islamic worlds.  There is also the suspension of talks by Syria, Lebanon, and  Jordan pending the resolution of this issue, or until the  Security Council issues a resolution on the Hebron massacre. Do  you think these factors have had any effect on the developing  U.S. position?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, the United States is now facing Arab,  Islamic, and even Christian indignation on a very large scale in  our region and the world. The United States is hindering the UN  Security Council resolution and is trying to use this resolution  as a bargaining chip for the sake of resuming negotiations. The  United States does not take the dire conditions in the  Palestinian territory with any seriousness -- conditions liable  to explode at any moment. Therefore, the U.S. reaction is not  commensurate or in line with the serious implications of the  current situation. Therefore, we hold the United States  basically responsible for any negative developments that might  appear in the phase.    On the other hand, we now welcome the call to hold a meeting  of the foreign ministers of the five Arab states concerned with  the peace process. We hope it will be held within the next few  days to implement stands among us, especially in light of the  results of the U.S. position and Israeli intransigence.    [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you.</p>

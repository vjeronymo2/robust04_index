			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> NUNN REPORTEDLY WANTS BETTER CONTRACT  </P> <P> Middleweight champion Michael Nunn, now of Agoura Hills, is said to be unhappy  with manager Dan Goossen, trainer Joe Goossen and the rest of the Reseda  management firm, Ten Goose Boxing. Dan Goossen, whose management contract with  Nunn expires in November, denies there is a problem. But Nunn's longtime  adviser, Bob Surkein, of Ft. Myers, Fla., confirmed that Nunn has become  unhappy with the percentages in his Ten Goose contract.  </P> <P> Boxing sources in Las Vegas and Davenport, Iowa, Nunn's hometown, also  indicated Nunn's heretofore happy relationship with the Goossens has turned  sour and that he wants a new contract or he wants out.  </P> <P> The same sources also question the validity of Nunn's "wrenched back" he is  said to have suffered on his staircase at home. That injury, and not a  Nunn-Goossen dispute, Goossen said, forced the cancellation of the Jan. 27 bout  against Marlon Starling at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> "I have no problems with Michael that I know of," Goossen said. "All we're  concerned about now is getting Michael healthy and back into training."  </P> <P> Surkein, a longtime amateur boxing official who sponsored Nunn's amateur career  and still advises him, said Friday that Nunn wants a new contract.  </P> <P> "Michael tells me he will honor his present contract with the Goossens, but  that if he re-signs with them in November, the percentages must change," he  said.  </P> <P> "And frankly, I think Michael's not entirely happy living in Southern  California. He grew up in Davenport in a very tight-knit family, and he misses  that. Basically, this is a guy who went from nothing to a million-dollar  fighter, and even though he may be 26, he's still growing into his situation.  </P> <P> "Under this contract, the percentages are two-thirds for Michael, one-third for  the Goossens. If Michael signs a new deal with them, it'll be 70-30, and the  Goossens will pay for all the training expenses and for Joe Goossen's share.  </P> <P> "It should be said that for the first two years of Michael's career, the  Goossens didn't take a nickel. It was an investment for them for a long time  with no return.  </P> <P> "The Goossens have done a good job with Mike. They took a kid who didn't make  the '84 Olympic team and turned him into a million dollar fighter."  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Nunn Thursday and Friday through Goossen were unsuccessful.  "His line's busy," Goossen said.  </P> <P> Ron May, a lawyer in Davenport and longtime friend of Nunn's, said Nunn has  spoken with him lately about his relationship with Ten Goose.  </P> <P> "I won't tell you exactly what Michael and I have discussed, because that would  be breaking a confidentiality," he said. "But I can tell you that the subject  was his contract with them (Ten Goose)."  </P> <P> Goossen had signed an agreement with the Mirage Hotel whereby Nunn would fight  three times at the hotel. Nunn is supposed to have been paid $500,000 up front  for the deal. But the pact is reportedly up in the air now.  </P> <P> Also airborne is Starling, who was to receive $800,000 for fighting Nunn.  </P> <P> "We're aggrieved," said Starling adviser Morton Sharnik.  </P> <P> "I have no reason to believe Nunn's injury isn't legitimate, but we feel we're  owed at least an explanation (from Ten Goose). Marlon put his career on hold  for this fight. He's a welterweight and had put on weight. He's also out  $15,000 out-of-pocket expenses for training."  </P> <P> Nunn, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, has been  managed by Ten Goose since he turned pro in 1984.  </P> <P> With Dan Goossen managing his career and his brother, Joe, training him, Nunn  has won 33 consecutive professional fights, including a technical knockout of  Frank Tate in July, 1988. That win gave him the IBF title, which he has  defended successfully three times.  </P> <P> "Uno Mas," or Leonard-Duran III, may have been a dull fight, but it does go  into the trivia book on one count: It became the first high-definition-TV  telecast of a sports event in America.  </P> <P> The HDTV version of the fight was shown at five closed-circuit locations in  North America, but visitors to Leonard's and Duran's Las Vegas workouts could  watch the fighters on HDTV monitors. The image was sharp enough to see each  drop of sweat fly off the boxers and strike the canvas. One other thing is  clear: Everyone did well on Uno Mas except the pay-per-viewers. The fighters,  promoter, Mirage and pay-per-view promoters all made a lot of money. In  Southern California, the fight was purchased by 120,000 households. Boxing  Notes  </P> <P> Don King, Mike Tyson's promoter, appeared at George Foreman's training camp in  Marshall, Tex., two weeks ago armed with contracts for a Foreman-Tyson fight,  providing that Foreman beats Gerry Cooney on Jan. 15. "George was polite, but  he told King that he wouldn't consider or sign anything until after the Cooney  fight," said Foreman adviser Morton Sharnik. King was talking about "$3 million  to $5 million" for a Tyson fight, he added.  </P> <P> Seven boxers from the Soviet Union have arrived in Toronto and begun training  for pro boxing careers in Canada and the United States. They are being trained  by Boris Gitman, who emigrated from the Soviet Union, and will be promoted by  Lou Falcigno of New York.  </P> <P> Featherweight champion Jorge Paez, the Forum, the Las Vegas Hilton and NBC have  entered into a boxing agreement, under which the colorful Paez would defend his  International Boxing Federation title up to four times in 1990, starting with  Troy Dorsey on Feb. 4. The Hilton will play host to the fights, and NBC will  televise them. NBC's Aug. 6 telecast of the Paez-Steve Cruz bout was the  highest-rated network boxing show of 1989.  </P> <P> The California Athletic Commission won't decide on heavyweight Tony Tubbs' fate  until its Jan. 19 meeting in San Diego. Tubbs, who tested positive for and  admitted to cocaine use after his November decision over Orlin Norris, didn't  show up for the Dec. 15 commission meeting, and the commissioners, acting on  advice of counsel, postponed a ruling.  </P></p>

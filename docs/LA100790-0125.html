			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE  </P> <P> I stand up and salute Shane Black ("Portrait of a Young Millionaire," by James  Greenberg, Aug. 19).  </P> <P> He and the other writers who are cashing in on the era of spec scripts deserve  every penny not skimmed by 10-percenters and greedy producers.  </P> <P> I was writing on spec long before Bart Simpson was born, and I've also been  rejected more than Elvis has been sighted, so I can appreciate this new wave of  hope for the unknown and unrecognized.  </P> <P> I just need to know: Who do these writers know that I don't know?  </P> <P> JON BLOSDALE  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Japan extends parliament Japan's coalition government yesterday pushed through a 45-day extension to the current session of parliament, giving Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa extra time to keep his promise of reforming the scandal-stained political system before the year's end, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. The opposition Liberal Democratic party boycotted the parliamentary sitting, but four members of the party in favour of political reform disobeyed a party directive to stay away and sat in the otherwise empty opposition benches. The extension was approved with less than an hour remaining of the parliamentary session.</p>

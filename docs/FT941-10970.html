			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Dalgety feels the supermarket rub  -Other companies On Monday Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group, is likely to report interim pre-tax profits little better than the Pounds 56.2m made in the six months to December 1992. Nevertheless a small dividend increase is expected. The difficult area has been consumer foods, where pressure from the supermarkets has been hitting many food manufacturers. That should have been offset by improvements in agribusiness, food distribution and ingredients. Prospects for the second half are better, particularly as recent acquisitions such as BP's petfood operation, chip in. Even so it will not be a bumper year.</p>

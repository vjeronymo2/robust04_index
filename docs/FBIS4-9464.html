			<p>BFN     [Text] Belchatow, April 25 -- "Even if the government  withdraws or annuls the decision concerning transformations in  brown coal mining and establishment of three holdings, the  Solidarity strike committee of the brown coal mines will not end  the strike but will only suspend it," Jozef Polkowski, a member  of the strike committee, told a press conference at the  Belchatow mine on Monday [25 April].    This would mean an increase of coal deliveries to power  plants which now receive only strategic amounts of fuel  necessary to keep them going.    Polkowski added that after the decision has been either  suspended or annulled, the strike committee might start  negotiations concerning nation-wide demands of the trade union.</p>

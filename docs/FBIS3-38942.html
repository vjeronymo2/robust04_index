Speaking  after a meeting with the Famagusta mayor and municipal  counselors, Mikhailidhis said the government is not discussing  the contents of the measures package, but its implementation.  He added: These measures very clearly refer to Famagusta's  fenced-off area.    Asked about the safety of Famagusta's residents,  Mikhailidhis  said this is one issue that will be discussed. He said: We  want enough security so that whoever returns to Famagusta will  feel that they are returning to their homes permanently.  Mikhailidhis said the implementation of the CBM's would allow  15,000-16,000 residents to return to Famagusta.    Famagusta Mayor Andreas Pouyiouros said the citizens of  Famagusta number 60,000, adding that the Municipal Council's  position is that the whole town should be returned in accordance  with UN Security Council Resolution 550. Pouyiouros described a  UN experts' report on the implementation of the CBM's as  unacceptable and intolerable, adding that the world's powers and  the United Nations see the measures as the first step toward an  overall Cyprus solution.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRINK'S GUARD KILLS HOLDUP MAN; 2ND FLEES  </P> <P> A Brink's armored car guard shot and killed a holdup man in a shoot-out inside  an electronics store in Koreatown late Friday afternoon, but a second suspect  grabbed a money bag and fled into a street bustling with holiday shoppers,  police said.  </P> <P> It was not immediately known how much money was in the bag, picked up at ITC  Electronics Supermarket, according to police, but the escaping holdup man may  have also paid a price for the robbery. Blood was found on the sidewalk outside  the store.  </P> <P> "He ran with the bag down Olympic Boulevard," said Lt. Bob Ruchhoft. "We  believe he was shot."  </P> <P> The guard, whose identity was not released, was also wounded in the holdup. He  was later reported in good condition at Good Samaritan Hospital with a leg  wound.  </P> <P> Police also declined to release the identity of a second guard, who stayed at  the wheel of the armored truck. Officials said he was following Brink's policy  by remaining in the vehicle.  </P> <P> According to Ruchhoft, the Brink's guard made the cash pickup and was  descending from a second-floor office when the two robbers met him, at least  one pointing a .44-caliber revolver that police recovered at the scene.  </P> <P> In the ensuing gunfire, Ruchhoft said one of the holdup men was hit at least  once in the chest and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police have not  released his identity.  </P> <P> The other man grabbed the bag containing cash and credit card receipts and  fled, Ruchhoft said.  </P> <P> An employee who asked not to be identified said that as the second robber ran  past him near the front of the store, "He had a smile on his face." He was  described as about 25 to 30 years old, of average height and wearing a brown  suede jacket.  </P> <P> The wounded guard limped outside to the armored car. Police said it was not  clear whether the robbers wounded the guard or he may have accidentally shot  himself.  </P> <P> Ruchhoft said that Friday's holdup -- which occurred about half an hour before  the store's 6 p.m. closing -- did not appear to be linked to recent armored car  robberies in the Los Angeles area. There have been six holdups of armored cars  in Los Angeles this year, he said, compared with a dozen last year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Lee contributed to this story.  </P></p>

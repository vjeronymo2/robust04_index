			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Xinyan (0151 1800 6056): "Whose `Human </F> Rights' Are They Concerned About?"]    [Text] Some Westerners always use the big stick of "human  rights" against us. They repeatedly talk about "human rights"  as if only they are concerned about the rights of the Chinese as  men, the truth were with them, we Chinese were not concerned  about the rights of our own compatriots as men, and we remain  stubborn and extremely ignorant despite their repeated urging  (which is in fact coercion).    However, we cannot but doubt whether these Westerners are  really concerned about us and whether they are concerned about  the rights of we Chinese as men. Because we remember very well  that it was they (perhaps their fathers and grandfathers) who  came to China to slaughter us Chinese, rob us of our property,  rape our women, and trample on the rights of us as men. Now  they say their human rights concept is a great, consistent, and  globally recognized value. Moreover, they also say that they do  not have any intention of imposing it upon us. There always  seems to be some contradiction here.    The history of China's humiliation by Western imperialism  dates back to the year 1840. In that year, China fought a war  with Britain called the "Opium War." Did the war have anything  to do with "human rights?" The Chinese fought for the right to  prevent themselves from opium poisoning. Perhaps the two sides  stood by their own human rights. Was there justice in the  matter? Anyway, China was defeated. Imperialists throughout  the world held that the principle of "fair trade" had won. The  result of the war was the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing,  whereby Hong Kong was occupied by Britain for over 100 years.  The history of China's entry into a semicolonial society began  here.    However, it is completely wrong if one thinks that the  British imperialists were only concerned about the "human  rights" of British merchants and were unconcerned about the  "human rights" of Chinese. One should know that their human  rights concept has really been "consistent."    Article nine of the Treaty of Nanjing reads:    "All Chinese who have inhabited a city occupied by the  British, who have dealings with the British, and who follow and  attend to British officials, will have their guilt completely  pardoned by the grace of the great emperor through a royal  decree and such things will be made known to the world. All  Chinese who have been arrested and imprisoned on British  business will also be forgiven."    Such wonderful wording was perhaps the first official record  of how Western imperialists showed concern about China's human  rights, or it was at least the first record of a Sino-foreign  diplomatic treaty.    It is said that the Western concept "human rights" means  that  all men are born with equal rights. Therefore, Westerners have  adopted an attitude of general concern for China's "human  rights," and the phrase they used in the first place was "all  Chinese."    However, any genuine concern for the rights of the Chinese  is  out of the question. Otherwise, they would not have come to  China with guns and cannons and forced opium on the Chinese. In  the words that followed, they concretely explained the four  types of people they were really concerned about: All "who have  inhabited a city occupied by the British," "who have dealings  with the British," "who follow and attend to British officials,"  and "who are arrested and imprisoned on British business." In a  word, they were traitors who helped the British fight the  Chinese and harm the Chinese. In what way were they cared for?  "Guilt completely pardoned," and those arrested to be  "released" and made "known to the world" so that their names  would be known all over the world and that glory would be with  them, thus encouraging more Chinese to follow their example and  facilitate them exploit Chinese of all their rights as men.    The Treaty of Nanjing was signed by the Chinese under the  coercion of British gunboats. Nonetheless, those crafty  imperialists never forgot equality in form. In article nine,  there was no such phrase such as the "British demand" nor the  "two sides agree." The "initiative" all rested with the emperor  of the great Qing Dynasty. What fine-sounding phrases as "royal  decree" and "by the grace." Why did the British not  reciprocate? Why could the guilt of the British working for the  Chinese not be pardoned and why could their names not be made  known to the world? It should have been the internal affair of  the Chinese themselves to punish Chinese who committed crimes in  China. But an internal affair had been written down in a  diplomatic treaty. With this as a precedent, some Westerners  often say: You have arrested so-and-so and violated human  rights. We are unhappy about this and must impose sanctions on  you. Is this strange? No. They have always done this.    Nevertheless, it seems that their "human rights" pretext  needs to be changed to "traitor's rights." It is the right  phrase. Of course, they will never make such a change. If they  did, they would find it difficult to deceive people. But the  Chinese pay attention to reality, and, for the sake of the  rights of more than 1.1 billion Chinese as men, we cannot but  deprive a few traitors of their rights. There is no way out  other than this.    The Chinese have already had dealings with imperialism for  over 100 years and this is valuable wealth. Not forgetting this  historical episode makes one a little clearer.</p>

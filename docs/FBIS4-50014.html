			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 13 (XINHUA) -- "Let the Chinese  decide for themselves what is best for their country", "do not  impose foreign standards and criteria on them" -- this is what a  Malaysian newspaper said today.    Malaysia's sole financial newspaper BUSINESS TIMES said,  "just as one man's meat is another man's poison, what works for  one country and community may not be at all applicable in  another."    In an editorial entitled "The China Express", the English  daily said, "a concerted push by some developed economies for  China to accept and implement policies that are alien to it and  not acceptable to the 1.2 billion Chinese citizens...would only  result in driving China into isolation -- and this would  certainly not benefit anyone."    "On the other hand, the region and indeed the world will  stand to benefit from a wealthy and strong China."    "In the final analysis, as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed  said, its leaders and intelligentsia themselves must pick and  choose from the methods of other countries which could possibly  fit in with the conditions in China," the paper said.    Mahathir, who ends his three-day working visit to China  today, said on Wednesday that "Southeast Asia should welcome a  wealthy China as it "will become the engine of growth firstly  for east Asia including Southeast Asia."</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Intel plans Chinese technology venture Intel, the world's leading producer of computer chips, plans to form a technology partnership with China's largest electronics company. The aim is to establish Intel's microprocessor technology as the standard for personal computers in China. In an agreement to be signed today, China Electronics Corporation (CEC) will promote Intel microprocessors in China. In return, Intel will contract with Huajing Electronics, a CEC subsidiary, to test and assemble Intel 386SX microprocessors and microcontroller chips at its plant in China. The US company will deliver the devices to China in the form of pre-processed silicon wafers. Huajing Electronics will dice the wafers, package and test them, and the microprocessor chips will be used in personal computers and point-of-sale equipment. The joint venture is a pre-emptive move to take advantage of the emerging personal computer market in China, Intel said. The US chip maker regards China as a market with huge potential. Currently, the majority of computers used in China are based on Intel microprocessors: most, however, are imported. China Electronics is that country's largest electronics enterprise group, with assets of Yn7.8bn (Dollars 896.6m). In another move to promote its technology, Intel has donated 40 computers based on its latest high-powered Pentium chips to the Qinghua and Beijing universities.</p>

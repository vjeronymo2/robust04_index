			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Shakhray article: "Strategy Needed for Relationship </F> With China"]    [Text] Reform began in China seven years before it began  here, and it has been more successful. The reason is that the  Chinese had already had their fingers burned once from trying to  introduce a foreign (Soviet) development model and had paid a  huge price for it.    The successful progress of reform in China should generate  close interest from us. We should hardly be expected to blindly  borrow the experience of "special economic zones" -- we do not  have a Russian diaspora able, like the "overseas Chinese," to  pay for 60-90 percent of the development of their native  provinces. We should not copy the experience of creating "small  industries" in the countryside -- we do not have a  200-300-million surplus peasant labor force. Even the very  attractive "open-door policy" could hardly be replanted here --  the Chinese did not have such highly developed industry,  science, and technology when they gave the "green light" to  foreign exports and capital investment in strategically  important sectors.    Instead we should learn the political techniques of  preserving the unity of the state and stability in society. The  Chinese miraculously averted the collapse of power during the 10  years of turmoil that were the "Cultural Revolution," and are  now showing their skill in combining the interests of elites in  the capital, regions, and sectors, the party and military  nomenklaturas, and state, private, and foreign enterprises. It  is this political stability that has made China attractive to  foreign investment and loans -- which came to $110 billion in  1993.    One way or another, the Chinese success stands out  particularly against the backdrop of the prolonged crisis in  Russia and the even more disastrous situation in the adjacent  regions of Siberia and the Far East. Around 32 million people  currently live there, but by 2010, if there is no change in the  current unfavorable economic and demographic trends, there will  be no more than 8-10 million people left in the endless expanses  east of the Urals. By then Russia's GNP, according to certain  academic estimates, will be only 75 percent that of China. For  the first time in the four centuries of Russo-Chinese relations  the Middle Kingdom will have overtaken us in its development.    A new batch of problems has been created by the rapid  development of economic ties between Russia and China,  particularly border regions. Real estate is being illegally  bought up by entrepreneurs from the other side of the Amur, and  illegal immigration has become widespread. In certain  population centers the number of "guests" already exceeds the  number of Russians. Typically, even the relevant organs have no  accurate figures on the scale of this phenomenon. But  unofficial estimates range from several hundred thousand to 2  million! Meanwhile the local authorities are giving the  "go-ahead" to the creation of permanent "Chinatown"-style  settlements -- Chinese "ghettos" such as exist in certain cities  in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. In developing  "fraternal" ties with adjacent Chinese regions, the leaders of  our settlements and cities are often guided by immediate  advantage and proceed solely on the basis of local interests.  And general state interests are suffering. I see the main  reason for this as being that these -- state -- interests have  not yet been clearly formulated.    Yet another problem has been brought about by the  disintegration of the Soviet Union and the formation of  sovereign Central Asian states in the area where Russia and  China meet. Additional factors -- primarily ethnic and religious  -- have emerged to complicate an already difficult situation.  It seems that China is a clear winner -- after all, the  subdividing of the "soft underbelly of Russia" gives it  extensive opportunities to make economic and other inroads. But  the prospect of an ethnic and religious "renaissance" in the  Central Asian states -- and still more the prospect of an  interstate union being set up on the basis of the idea of the  economic, cultural, and religious integration of "Greater  Turkestan" -- cannot fail to put Beijing on its guard. It knows  that relatives of the Kazakhs, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Kirghiz [Kyrgyz],  and Uighurs make up a considerable proportion of the  representatives of PRC "ethnic minorities" -- who account for 90  million of the PRC's 1.2 billion citizens and inhabit around 60  percent of its national territory.    Some of the problems of Soviet-Chinese relations --  primarily  border problems -- have been transferred to the Central Asian  states. But they do not yet have the potential to effectively  resolve these problems. As a result, Russia has to all intents  and purposes been left with its former level of political  responsibility in this region. The military-strategic area is  being preserved here within the borders of the former USSR --  this was confirmed by a recent conference of the leaders of  border services in the CIS countries. Moreover, the Russian  Federation is continuing the traditions of the Russian Empire  and the USSR in their many centuries of relations with the  Middle Kingdom.    Thus, there are obvious problems in our ties with our  largest  neighbor on the Eurasian landmass. They can only be solved by  having a unified state strategy that envisages at least  short-term programs for developing relations with China for the  federal center and Federation components, as well as a policy  agreed with the sovereign states of Central Asia.    In elaborating a federal program, we undoubtedly need to  proceed on the basis of the major documents signed during  President Yeltsin's state visit to Beijing in December 1992.  This program should include measures for the priority  development of Siberia and the Far East, including incentives  for migration, tax breaks for enterprises of all forms of  ownership and for investors, and improvements in the provision  for the military. We should recall the experience of the  settlement of the Far East in the Russian Empire and allocate a  proper role to the Cossacks, whose forebears opened up the  region and served the state in protecting its borders. We need  to tighten up procedures on the border and in the adjoining  region, and prevent the creation of "Chinatowns" that could  become a major irritant to locals and a source of complications  on an interstate scale. Of course, Moscow will also have to  undertake some major spending, including subsidies from the  state budget. The vagaries of market relations will not be  evenhanded in the competition between our economic structures  and those of China -- Russian entrepreneurs will have to be  protected by corresponding laws and administrative measures,  while not "cutting off the oxygen supply" to our partners on the  other side of the Amur.    I would like to say a few words about the other problems on  the Russo-Chinese border, which stretches for 4,375 km. In  deciding the issue of the ownership of several islands on the  Amur and Argun Rivers we need once again to take account of both  state and local interests. In our talks with the Chinese I  think we should also use the tactic of joint economic  exploitation of disputed territories.    Special mechanisms of collaboration with China should be  created for Russian Federation components directly participating  in Russo-Chinese cooperation. Clearly, it would be expedient to  develop such mechanisms in the form of targeted federal regional  cooperation programs that include a system of preferences and  exemptions. The federal authorities should provide the program  participants with a clear-cut plan for cooperation, changes in  regional quotas, tax breaks and customs concessions, and access  to centralized credit resources and subsidy funds. Particular  attention should be devoted to the system of the functioning of  Chinese citizens on Russian territory -- capital inflows should  not be accompanied by the Chinese population becoming  established.    As for cooperation with the Central Asian states, Moscow  must  take the initiative in concluding a range of bilateral and  multilateral treaties on mutual relations with the PRC. For  instance, the idea of economic development for the Semirechye  zone in the area where the Russian, Kazakhstani, and Chinese  borders intersect looks attractive.    We need to do everything in our power to ensure that the  processes of rapid Chinese development, the coming revival of  Russia -- of which I am confident -- and the inevitable process  of the creation of a Eurasian union or confederation of Eurasian  states do not counteract each but interact, complement, and  strengthen each other. Relations with China are too important  to Russia to be allowed to drift.</p>

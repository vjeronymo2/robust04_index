Va'ezi said his trip is intended to promote Iran-Spain  relations in economic and cultural areas as well as on the  international scene. He said his talks with Spanish officials  would encompass topics as wide as those of Russia, Central Asia,  Karabakh, Tajikistan, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, the European Union  and current developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Commenting on an Iranian loan outstanding to Spain, Va'ezi  said the loan is not reallly substantial and commented that in  just the same way as agreements had been reached with Germany on  outstanding loans, so too, a similar agreement would be arrived  at with Spain. He said Spain is a major buyer of Iranian oil,  and that in addition there is very good prospects for export of  Iran's non-oil products to that country. He said the two  countries can also exchange students and artists and also  establish departments of Persian and Spanish at their respective  universities.    The Iranian official said since Spain is due to become  chairman of the EU [European Union] next year, he would also  discuss cooperation with Spanish officials in this field.</p>

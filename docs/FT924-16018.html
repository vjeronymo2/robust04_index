			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Moody's puts Spanish rating under review THE Kingdom of Spain faces a possible cut to its credit rating, days after launching its first USDollars Eurobond issue. Moody's Investors Service, which currently rates the country AA2, said it had put Spain on review for a possible downgrade. The agency said the review was 'motivated by the imbalances that have been accumulating for some time in the Spanish economy, and the less favourable external environment faced by the country'. The announcement took the lead managers of Spain's recent Dollars 1.5bn issue by surprise. 'We asked them whether they were happy with the ratings, and they said yes,' one banker in London said yesterday. News of the possible downgrading came on the day the bond issue was formally closed. Earlier this month, NatWest Capital Markets withdrew a Eurobond issue for Spintab the day before it was due to close when a possible downgrade of the company was announced. Yesterday's development added to the woes of the ill-fated Kingdom of Spain issue, handled by J P Morgan and Merrill Lynch. The launch came at a time of economic turmoil and pricing of the bonds was delayed a week. During that time, a further change in withholding tax rules in Italy pushed up yields on many Eurobonds, forcing the yield on the Spanish issue to be raised to prevent a flop. 'At least 80 to 90 per cent of the bonds have already been sold,' one of the lead managers said yesterday. 'This is obviously not something you want to happen to one of your transactions.' Explaining its decision, Moody's pointed to Spain's rising fiscal and current account deficits. 'Recent events in European currency markets are likely to make an economic adjustment in Spain more difficult, and could ultimately lead to higher external indebtedness for the country,' it added. In a quiet day for new issues, Goldman Sachs announced a rare straight Eurodollar bond offering from a Korean borrower, Pohand Iron and Steel. The bonds for the A2/A plus borrower will be priced on Friday to yield 115 basis points above five-year Treasuries.</p>

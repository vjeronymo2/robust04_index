			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAIN LAWYER FACED CHARGES OF BILKING FIRM AND CLIENTS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles criminal defense attorney killed in his office was facing  allegations of embezzling money from a former law firm and misappropriating  clients' fees, court records showed Tuesday, but investigators said they are  unsure if there is any connection between the accusations and the slaying.  </P> <P> Nathan Arnold Richardson, 34, was gunned down about 12:15 p.m. Monday in the  lobby of his office at 5455 Wilshire Blvd. -- only nine days before he was to  stand trial for allegedly embezzling nearly $4,000 from the Jacoby &amp; Meyers  law firm, according to court documents.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Department Detective Dan Andrews said police believe that a  disgruntled client may be involved in the slaying, but added: "There may have  been other reasons. A disgruntled client is what (police) are looking at.  There's nothing connecting (the allegations) to the shooting."  </P> <P> According to court records, an arrest warrant issued April 22, 1987, alleged  that Richardson stole $3,900 from Jacoby &amp; Meyers, the national law firm  where he worked from June, 1985, until he was fired a year later.  </P> <P> In July, 1985, court documents show, a woman named Adrienne Robbins paid  Richardson in cash and checks to represent her in a lawsuit against an auto  dealership. Instead of depositing the money in the firm's accounts, Richardson  pocketed the money, Jacoby &amp; Meyers officials alleged in the documents.  </P> <P> During an interview Tuesday, Leonard Jacoby, a senior partner in the firm,  described Richardson as "a good lawyer, very charming, very bright. . . . He  just wasn't honest."  </P> <P> In addition to the embezzlement indictment, documents show, the State Bar had  accused Richardson of three instances of financial impropriety and of failing  to cooperate with a Bar investigator.  </P> <P> Richardson had not responded to the charges and, consequently, was on the verge  of being declared in default, according to State Bar records.  </P> <P> State Bar documents show that a woman gave Richardson a $725 check in August,  1987, to prepare a property settlement agreement in a divorce case. He cashed  the check without depositing the money in a bank, but he never prepared the  papers, it was alleged.  </P> <P> In July, 1987, another woman hired Richardson in a breach of contract action  and paid him $4,800 in advance, it was alleged in additional documents. She  hired another attorney a month later, and he asked that Richardson give him the  money, which was to be deposited in the client's trust account.  </P> <P> Richardson sent a check for $500 that bounced, according to court documents.  </P> <P> In January, 1988, Richardson wrote a $120 check from a client's trust account  to pay for a filing fee in his own personal lawsuit, the court documents said.  That check bounced, too.  </P> <P> A graduate of Stanford University and UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall, Richardson  practiced both criminal and civil law in Los Angeles and outlying cities.  </P> <P> Efforts to contact colleagues at the Richardson &amp; Associates law office  Tuesday were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

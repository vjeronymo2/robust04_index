			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Financial advice: beware the hidden strings - 'Independent' advisers may not be all they seem. Remuneration by commission can cost an investor dear LOOK through the contract note for an investment product and you will find a revealing little phrase. Typically, it goes like this: 'The adviser who sold you this product is an employee of XYZ Services, and has been remunerated by us.' Few people think of their advisers as being the employee of someone else - particularly if that adviser is 'independent'. But if you are accepting advice from someone who is paid by commission from the product provider, rather than by a fee from you, then that adviser is not employed by you at all. If there is any logic to remuneration, then he owes his loyalty to the company. Looked at this way, it seems startling that anyone accepts advice from a commission-charging adviser. However, the British aversion to writing a cheque to a mere 'intermediary', coupled with a reluctance to make financial plans, has ensured that the bulk of investment products have been sold via the commission system. British consumers have the intermediary system they deserve. Some products, such as National Savings and gilts, do not pay any commission and are often overlooked. Unit trusts, appropriate for many, do pay commission, but at 3 per cent they cannot match the commission on similar life insurance company bonds. A commission-charging IFA therefore needs to be most philanthropic before he will steer a client towards one of these products. He has a strong incentive not to do so. Cost is also an issue. Fee-charging advice is not necessarily an expensive luxury - it can work out much cheaper for the consumer than commissions would be. Commission is usually charged as a percentage of the total investment, which gives the salesman an incentive to encourage you to invest a large sum. Insurance companies prefer investors to pay small sums of money regularly, so monthly premium contracts are particularly expensive. For example, a survey earlier this year by Lautro found that the average commission paid for a 25-year mortgage-linked endowment policy with a premium of Pounds 50 per month was Pounds 498, if bought through an independent financial adviser, and Pounds 570 if bought via a tied agent. The highest commission was Pounds 641 - more than a year's premiums. Compare this with fee-charging advisers. At Chamberlain De Broe, a London-based broker, there is a flat fee of Pounds 14 for buying a guaranteed income bond, Pounds 50 for buying a unit trust, and then from Pounds 50 to Pounds 150 for buying a pension or an insurance product. A survey by the Institute of Financial Planning, a small professional body which covers the sector, found that the average fee per hour charged by fee-charging members was Pounds 80, while more than a third charged less than Pounds 75. Buying an endowment, a mainstream product which most offices will be well-geared to sell, is unlikely to take more than two hours' work. Commission thus begins to look like a wholesale scandal. But it is not fair to heap opprobrium on the UK's financial advisers just for accepting commission. Most of them are only reacting to the fact that consumers have not been prepared to pay fees. However, a trend towards fee-charging advice has now emerged, fuelled by new, low commission products and greater disposable wealth. People today have a greater understanding of finance and are happy to pay for advice. But moves in this direction have encountered roadblocks which should be dismantled. Two life offices are wholly non-commission paying - Professional Life, established in 1990, and Provident Life, which opted to restructure its operation to aim at non-commission charging advisers after a survey by McKinsey, the management consultants, had suggested that this was the way forward for the industry. The attitudes of other offices vary. It need not matter to them how intermediaries are paid, but the difficulty of adapting computers to cut out commissions can stop them. Awkward facts can also be revealed by the practise some fee-charging advisers have of rebating commission to consumers. By rebating commissions on some with-profits bonds, advisers gave customers an instant 2 per cent profit, which provided a strong stimulus to surrender early - the life offices were not amused. Tax is a problem when commission is paid and then rebated. Commission is paid as an income to the intermediary, who then has to pay income tax on it. If it is then passed to the consumer, the income tax liability goes with it. VAT is payable on fees, which adds to the difficulties the tax authorities put in the way of fee-charging. Another problem is that non-commission products need not be the cheapest if their costs incorporate heavy payments to their own sales force. For example, fee-chargers direct much ire at Equitable Life, easily the most successful office which does not pay commissions to intermediaries, because charges are deducted even if the investor approaches the company direct. According to Pensionline, a fee-charging pension service, Equitable has the lowest charges, including commission, on 25-year unit-linked regular premium personal pensions - these charges account for 16.97 per cent of the final fund. However, with commission rebated, Scottish Life's charges are only 11.18 per cent, and 13 other offices also undercut Equitable. The issues are complex. There is no homogenous profession of 'fee-charging advisers'. People who answer to this description include accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers, benefits consultants, consulting actuaries, and a wide range of more traditional independent advisers with hybrid methods of charging fees. It is vital not to end up paying more than you would via a straight commission, and to understand exactly what you are paying for. Jim Roberts, general manager of Professional Life, outlines some of the options: Hourly Rate. This would be most financial advisers' ideal. But people still have an aversion to coming in off the street and paying money to be told not to do something. Thus, many advisers will offer you a free first hour of consultation and provide an estimate of the work to be done, and its likely cost, at the end of it. Annual Fees. Clients effectively pay a 'membership' fee, and in return receive sustained advice including an annual meeting and regular reports. Further action, however, would cost extra money. This may be more the kind of over-arching 'service' which those who are less financially self-confident will need, but it can work out more expensively. Investment or Portfolio Charges. This makes a step back to the world of incentives offered by commission, but there is no conflict of interest between adviser and client. The adviser wants to make the portfolio grow, as this will increase the amount he is allowed to take in fees. Most fee-chargers end up using a combination and in some cases admit that they only become substantially cheaper than commission-based advisers for high amounts. David Kauders, who changed his business from 99 per cent commission to 98 per cent fees in four years, charges on three different bases: a transaction tariff; an hourly time charge; and a portfolio management charge. Some commission-based advisers offer 'hybrid' products to make the commission transparent. Hargreaves Lansdown offers the Savers' Association, which in return for a fee keeps customers informed of best building society, National Savings and bonds rates. The company has spiced the offer with holiday discounts to overcome the dislike of fees. Baronworth Investment Services always rebates at least 50 per cent of commission to customers. For some products, or negotiated large deals, it will often rebate more. Baronworth is prepared to grit its teeth and buy non-commission products - from companies such as Equitable Life or Acuma - without charging a fee. As Colin Jackson, its managing director, says: 'We'll perform the service for them, and hope they come back. We're casting our bread upon the waters.'</p>

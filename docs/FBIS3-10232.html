			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jaime Mejia Mazuera and Clara Ines Rueda of EL </F> TIEMPO's economic staff]    [Text] In recent days two of the biggest privatizations  ever reported in Colombia have been finalized. The Banco de  Colombia [Bank of Colombia] has been transferred to a group of  Cali businessmen, and the cellular telephone service was turned  over to private operators. These two deals generated revenues of  about $1.7 billion for the government.    What is this government's record on privatizations? Since  early 1991 state holdings in about 15 companies have been  transferred to the private sector, earning the state a little  over 1.1 trillion pesos.    However, these were not large privatizations. In most cases  they were small enterprises in which the IFI [Industrial  Development Institute] held shares. In the last two years, the  IFI sold its shares in six enterprises for approximately 12.398  billion pesos.    The state has been successful, though, in turning over to  private enterprise some major areas that were traditionally  considered the state's responsibility: railways, highways,  ports, expansion of the gas system, and social security.    It is estimated that in the next few years the private  sector  will invest close to $392 billion in plans to rehabilitate the  railway system, highway construction projects, ports, and the  construction of gas pipelines.    In addition, for electricity generating projects, private  companies plan to invest resources that will easily exceed 592  billion pesos.    By doing so, the state will no longer be involved in  providing public services and it will turn over shares to  private investors, who should apparently be more efficient.    That is, in essence, the primordial objective of  privatization in Colombia. They want to turn over part of the  economy that the state now runs in order to promote competition  and the free market.    In other Latin American countries, governments have been  forced to sell state enterprises to shrink the gap between  public spending needs and revenues or to cover massive external  debts.    In Argentina, for example, between September 1992 and  October  1993, 45 enterprises were privatized. This easily produced $7.5  billion fresh dollars for the government. And the government no  longer has to transfer about $2.1 billion a year from the budget  to prop up bankrupt public enterprises.  <H5>  The Objective </H5>   In Colombia, privatization was not undertaken to make the  state smaller. If that were the objective, the results would be  dismal: public spending, 24 percent of the economy's total  production of goods and services or GDP [gross domestic product]  in 1988, will be up to 30 percent in 1994. This means that the  state has grown.    Here the plan seeks to concentrate government action on  activities like justice and security that, for obvious reasons,  cannot be turned over to the private sector.    The numbers speak for themselves: defense and security  spending have risen from 1.9 percent of the GDP in 1990 to 2.5  percent last year. Military investments were up 82 percent.    Given the spending increase, the revenues from privatization  will help to maintain sound finances; the state will be able to  pay its debts without difficulty.    Nevertheless, turning certain activities like health care,  pensions, and public services over to private companies does  entail some risk. Private investors will take the profitable  part of the business, and the state could be left with the  obligation to handle sectors that do not generate profits.  <H3>  Where Privatization Now Stands  Banks Sold </H3>   The biggest banking reprivatization took place this week:  the  Banco de Colombia was sold for a total of 401 billion pesos in  simultaneous transactions on the three stock markets.    Its new owners are Isaac and Jaime Gilinski, who own 75  percent of the shares, bank employees and retirees, and small  investors.    Colombia's banking system began its round of privatizations  in 1991 with the sale of the Banco de los Trabajadores [Workers  Bank] to the Mercantile Bank of Venezuela for 3.225 billion  pesos. Then the Tequendama Bank was acquired by the Construction  Bank of Venezuela and Intercon Financial Bank of Aruba for  20.723 billion. In addition, the Banco de Comercio [Bank of  Commerce] was sold to the Luis Carlos Sarmiento organization, to  employees, and other investors.    Next month the privatization of Corpavi [Savings and Housing  Loans Corporation], the Banco del Estado [State Bank], and the  Banco Popular [Peoples Bank] will begin.  <H5>  Road Construction Projects </H5>   The system of building highways through licensing  arrangements is going to surge ahead this year: the government  has 20 projects ready to be turned over to the private sector,  and it is studying another 11 projects. About 3,000 kilometers  of roadways will be built with an investment of about $1.25  billion. This will rehabilitate 40 percent of Colombia's road  system.    There are plans to restore highways: the major road system  and access roads for major cities, like the road between Bogota  and Meta. Other plans cover the road between Medellin and the  Rionegro Valley; Espinal and Neiva; La Paila, Armenia, and  Calarca.    In terms of construction, the plans include expanding  roadways in places with heavy vehicle traffic. These are  projects like the highway between Bogota and Villavicencio; the  Perimetal de la Sabana; the road between Bogota and Puerto  Salgar; and the Guataquia River bridge.    During 1993, bids for two projects were awarded: the  construction of the Buga-Tulua-La Paila roads and the  rehabilitation of the road between Barranquilla and Cienaga.    Now under study are a second road between Armenia, Pereira,  and Manizales, and the bypass between Girardot and Ibague.  <H5>  Electrical Sector </H5>   Although the electrical sector's major privatizations still  remain to be done, three private initiatives have already been  implemented in a sector that had been considered to belong  exclusively to the public domain: generating energy.    The first successful private generating project was  developed  by Proelectrica in Cartagena: a 90-megawatt plant was installed  in the Mamonal industrial zone with a $60 million investment.    Then the CCI [Colombian Industrial Consortium] and Spain's  Sevillan Electricity Group invested $150 million in building the  Flores thermal power plant in Barranquilla. This plant has a  100-megawatt capacity.    The most recent project was upgrading Termobarranquilla  [Barranquilla Power Plant], so it can generate 750 megawatts.  The investment was $520 million. Corelca [Electric Corporation  of the Atlantic Coast] joined with Distral and the private  Swiss-Swedish consortium ABB [Asea Brown Boveri] for this  project.    The next step will be the sale of the Betania Hydroelectric  Power Plant for a price close to $300 million.  <H5>  Ports and Railroads </H5>   Transportation is one of the sectors that has undergone the  greatest structural modifications in the privatization process  initiated by the government.    The National Railroads and Ports of Colombia have ceased to  exist. The assets of both entities were placed in corporate  liability funds, and the management of rail transport and the  ports has been turned over to the private sector.    For the railroads, the government created Ferrovias  [National  Railroads Enterprise], through which it will channel resources  to improve the track and stations.    The STF [Railroad Transport Company] has begun to provide  service.    For the ports, cargo management has been turned over to the  regional port companies located in each of the maritime  terminals (Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Buenaventura,  and Tumaco).  <H5>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Bottlenecks </H5>   Privatizing is not easy. There have been failures in  Colombia, so some problems the government faces in trying to  sell a company can be identified.    The attempt to privatize Telecom [National Enterprise for  Telecommunications] illustrates one such bottleneck: union  pressures. As a solution, in France and England a system was  used that has also been tried in Colombia: offering the workers  shares of the company at a price below the market price.    Experts say Colombia has no serious privatization plan, so  it  is likely that mistakes may be made in the design and  implementation of the process, and it may take a long time to  become a reality.    Another fear is exchanging public monopolies for private  monopolies. There is such a risk in Colombia, where few economic  groups are able to buy big enterprises. One solution is for  midsized investors to form associations with foreigners. That  creates another problem: analysts say that attitudes in Colombia  still foster a reluctance to use foreign capital.  <H5>  Negotiators </H5>   A major protagonist in a privatization process is the  investment bankers group. These firms serve as liaisons and  facilitators in the transfer of a state enterprise. The  investment bank evaluates the company and determines the sales  mechanism (auction or bidding, as well as other methods).    The most time-consuming part of their work is the  negotiation  process.    Reaching agreement between the parties is generally  complicated by factors like union protests and criticisms from  various factions that oppose the sale of state assets.    The bankers also have the job of appraising the company  based  on its financial position and the revenues it may generate in  the future, in order to set a minimum price.    In every such process two groups of bankers are involved:  those who present the sales package for the government and those  whose client is the private investor. The purchaser's  representative has to study acquisition alternatives and obtain  financing.    This, among other things, explains why foreign investment  banks have been hired for large privatization processes: the  Colombian buyer needs foreign investment to purchase the  enterprise.    In these cases, the bankers help to obtain investors, who  insist that the firm be internationally known.    One method recently used a great deal in Colombia is an  association between Colombian firms (which bring their knowledge  of the country) and foreign firms, which have experience and a  well-known name.    This is because Colombia's investment banks are still  getting  started.</p>

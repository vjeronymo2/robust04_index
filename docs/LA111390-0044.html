			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL RELEASES OFFICER WHO SURVIVED SHOOTING  </P> <P> Patrol officer Diane Hall, 40, who was wearing a bulletproof vest when shot,  was released from Mercy Hospital Monday afternoon in good condition, after  surviving wounds in the chest and abdomen, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> "Because she was wearing the bulletproof vest, she suffered only powder burns,  as well as bruising and abrasion where the bullets hit the jacket," the  spokeswoman added. "She's very fortunate to have been wearing that vest."  </P> <P> Police said Hall was shot by Jimmie Ray Reeves Jr., 23, who was shot and killed  by police as he tried to escape.  </P> <P> Hall and another officer had been dispatched to 30th Street and Central Avenue  in East San Diego at 8:54 p.m. Sunday to investigate the report of a burglary  in progress, said Lt. Dan Berglund, who heads the homicide division of the San  Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> Berglund said the "ballistic vest" worn by Hall, a five-year veteran of the  force, saved her life.  </P> <P> Sgt. Jim Clear, a spokesman for the department, said Monday that bulletproof  vests were optional when first introduced in 1980 but were made mandatory a  year later.  </P> <P> In Sunday's incident, the first officer on the scene, Ed Rosenbloom, checked  the exterior of the residence and noticed a screen had been taken from the rear  of the house, Berglund's report says. Rosenbloom then walked to the front yard  just as the two-officer cover unit -- Hall and partner Cheryl Dean -- were  arriving.  </P> <P> The three officers walked to the back yard and heard a noise, which came from a  man who appeared to be hiding in a cardboard box beneath a tree, Berglund said.  As one officer attempted to make contact, the man ran away. When he was finally  apprehended, he struggled with the three officers, Berglund added.  </P> <P> Reeves then pulled Rosenbloom's gun from his holster and began firing, striking  Hall in the chest and abdomen and on the handle of her gun, Berglund said.  Reeves continued firing until the officers wrestled the weapon away, he added.  </P> <P> When the man then attempted to flee, all three officers fired their weapons,  killing him, Berglund's report says. Reeves died of "multiple gunshot wounds,"  a spokesman for the San Diego County medical examiner said Monday.  </P> <P> Reeves, described by the spokesman as an unemployed transient, was dead at the  scene.  </P> <P> Besides Hall's injuries, Rosenbloom injured his hand, thumb and back. Officer  Dean escaped injury.  </P></p>

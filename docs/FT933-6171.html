			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Israel backs peace pact with PLO: Extremists from both camps threaten to derail agreement ISRAEL last night committed itself to a historic peace agreement with Palestinians which could be a first step to ending a conflict that has wracked the Middle East for decades. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said Israel would sign an unprecedented accord with Palestinians at peace talks which resume in Washington today. This is expected to provide for a degree of Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and conditional Israeli recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, according to Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, who concluded the agreement in secret talks with a PLO representative in Norway last week. Following the announcement by Mr Peres and Mr Rabin, an extraordinary session of the Israeli cabinet approved the peace plan by an overwhelming majority. Ministers said that 16 members of the cabinet were in favour and two abstained. Mr Peres said: 'It's a beginning and there is a lot of work ahead of us. We are determined to bring peace to the whole of the Middle East.' A senior official of the PLO confirmed the agreement and said it could be signed within 48 hours. Egypt welcomed the move, but Palestinian and Israeli extremists condemned it and warned of violent opposition. In Washington, Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said: 'We hope and expect that this progress will now be reflected in the next negotiating round and will lead to an early agreement on a draft declaration of principles.' President Bill Clinton warned, however, that 'we've still got a long way to go'. The agreement is a comprehensive package providing for: A five-year interim period of self-rule for 1.8m Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. A partial Israeli military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and an undefined enclave around the West Bank town of Jericho. Mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. If signed, and not derailed by Israeli and Palestinian extremists, the plan could hasten progress towards a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement between Israel and all its Arab neighbours. Mr Rabin told ministers it was 'a great step forward to advance Israel towards peace with all the neighbouring states and especially Palestinians. I believe this will happen'. The Palestinians will be granted full authority over their internal affairs, including policing in Gaza-Jericho, but will have lesser powers in the rest of the West Bank. Jericho, a small dusty town in the parched Jordan Valley, will become the administrative capital for the expanded elected Palestinian authority. Bethlehem will be the site of the lesser authority governing the rest of the West Bank. Israel will redeploy troops out of population centres in Gaza-Jericho, but will still provide a security role for the estimated 6,000 settlers on the outskirts of Gaza and Jericho. Israel will keep full control of occupied Arab East Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements and the Israeli-Jordanian and Israeli-Egyptian border crossings, at least until talks begin on permanent arrangements two years after the interim pact is signed. Mr Peres said yesterday Israel could recognise the PLO as part of the deal if the organisation completely renounced violent acts and gave up parts of its charter calling for the extermination of the Jewish state. Once signed, the deal could trigger progress on stalled bilateral peace talks between Israel and Syria, and Jordan and Lebanon. Public announcement of the deal yesterday sparked immediate protest. Rightwing parties in Israel's parliament heckled and shouted down Mr Peres as he tried to explain the peace package and last night up to 2,000 demonstrators protested outside the cabinet meeting. On the Palestinian side, the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement, the PLO's main rival, accused the PLO of betraying Palestinian aspirations and warned of a Palestinian civil war. Another extremist organisation, Mr Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, threatened to assassinate Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran PLO chairman who pushed acceptance of the peace plan through his hostile executive committee. Mr Rabin moved to deflect potential criticism among Israelis by arguing that Israel had made no concessions on the two most sensitive issues: East Jerusalem and the settlements. 'Jerusalem remains under Israeli sovereignty and is its capital. The settlements remain. None will be uprooted,' he said. An overnight poll for Hebrew tabloid Yediot Ahronot showed 54 per cent of 523 Israelis interviewed backed the plan and 45 per cent were opposed.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition Senator Dr. [name indistinct] has called  for the immediate resumption of hanging. Speaking in the Senate  a short while ago, he said the country is in a state of crisis  and the security budget needed to reflect the seriousness of the  situation. Dr. [name indistinct] was speaking against the  background of the recent killing of an American tourist in  Runaway Bay. [Words indistinct] (?due to the fact) that a  television crew from the BBC was now in Jamaica with regards to  that crime. He said their coverage of it was likely to do major  damage to Jamaica's reputation.</p>

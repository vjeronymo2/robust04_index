			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish on 5 June  publishes on pages 6-7 an unattributed 2,000-word article on  voting preferences for the upcoming elections. The article says  the Colorado Party, which now includes the voting preferences of  the Party of the Government by the People, PGP, followers who  support the Julio Maria Sanguinetti-Hugo Batlle ticket, now  would "receive 33 percent of votes nationwide; the Broad Front,  FA, would receive 24 percent of the votes; the National Party  would receive 22 percent of the votes; the dissident PGP, the  Civic Union, and the Christian Democratic Party would receive 2  percent of the votes; the Green Party would receive 1 percent of  the votes; other parties (including the Blue Party as well as  other leftist groups not linked to the FA) would receive 2  percent of the votes; and 16 percent of the voters have not yet  decided for whom they would vote."    The article adds: "The National Party, which received  significant support in April, continues growing and has  improved, but by only one percentage point. The Colorado Party  has grown 3 percentage points compared with last month's  support, probably thanks to the PGP followers who will vote for  the Sanguinetti-Batlle ticket. The FA standing has remained  unchanged since April."</p>

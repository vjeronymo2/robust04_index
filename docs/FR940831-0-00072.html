			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IPHC, in conjunction with NMFS, determined that the optimum length for the concurrent halibut/sablefish opening would be 2 days in the Western and Central Areas and in the West Yakutat District. The halibut that is caught as bycatch in the sablefish fishery will be counted against the Pacific halibut quota. A minimal amount of unavoidable discards of undersized halibut will occur in the sablefish fishery. The IPHC estimates that minimal discards of halibut in the directed sablefish fishery could also occur as a result of operators of vessels participating in either fishery attaining their halibut trip limits. However, these discards would not be expected to exceed 10 mt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the daily catch rate of sablefish in the May 1994 directed sablefish fishery, the September sablefish fishery could potentially harvest 90, 1246, and 542 mt (round-weight equivalent) in the Western, Central, and West Yakutat areas, respectively. The headed-and-gutted (Eastern cut) sablefish product is valued at approximately $2.00/lb (or $4.40/kg).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine an approximate value of the expected sablefish harvest in September, the anticipated round-weight harvest amount (in pounds) is multiplied by a product recovery rate of 0.63 to convert the weight to a headed-and-gutted weight equivalent. This value is multiplied by the $2.00/lb ($4.40/kg), headed-and-gutted value for the sablefish. Using these calculations, the Western, Central, and West Yakutat Areas could potentially generate approximately $250,000, $3,461,000, and $1,506,000, respectively, during the 2-day September opening. This would bring an additional revenue of approximately $5,217,000 to the GOA sablefish industry without significantly increasing halibut discards. Complete harvest of the remaining TAC amount of 455 mt in the Southeast Outside District, under the revised directed fishing standards, would contribute an additional $1,264,000 to the sablefish revenue, for a total of $6,481,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The value of dressed, head-off halibut is estimated to be $1.50/lb (or $3.30/kg). Based on the price difference for halibut and sablefish, a significant number of vessels would likely target on sablefish during the concurrent 2-day opening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Framework Authority to Increase the Directed Fishing Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This emergency rule also establishes the authority for the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) to increase the directed fishing standard for sablefish (&sect;672.20(g)(4)(iii)) during any subsequent opening of the halibut fishery. The directed fishing standard for sablefish could be increased in areas closed to directed fishing for sablefish, based on the following criteria: (1) The increase would occur in a GOA regulatory area or district and during a time period that the IPHC has authorized an opening for Pacific halibut, under 50 CFR part 301; (2) a sufficient amount of sablefish TAC would remain unharvested in the area to support an increased harvest of sablefish consistent with any increase in the directed fishing standard for this species; and (3) the duration of the Pacific halibut fishery opening and the anticipated fishing effort would not result in an overharvest of a sablefish TAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of the framework authority would give NMFS the flexibility to allow further harvest of sablefish and hence increase revenue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS concurs that the above regulatory measures must be implemented by emergency rulemaking to provide the economic opportunity for the sablefish industry to realize revenue that would otherwise be foregone had a directed sablefish fishery not been authorized in September 1994. Comments on this action are invited through September 15, 1954. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis because it is issued without opportunity for prior public comment, and none has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds that the immediate need to provide an opportunity to optimize the harvest of sablefish in conjunction with the IPHC announcement of the re-opening of the Pacific halibut fishery in September constitutes good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), as such procedures would be impracticable. Further, the AA finds that the re-opening of the directed fishery, increase in the directed fishing standard for sablefish, and the regulatory amendment, relieve a restriction and, therefore, pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), this rule is effective concurrent with the re-opening of the Pacific halibut fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles Karnella, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 672 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 672_GROUNDFISH OF THE GULF OF ALASKA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

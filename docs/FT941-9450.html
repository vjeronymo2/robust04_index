			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Workers 'losing access to decisions' The increasingly unregulated labour market is returning to the way it was in the 19th century before trade unionism, according to a government-commissioned survey of workplace industrial relations published today. Its author - Dr Neil Millward of the Policy Studies Institute - argues the country is approaching the position where most workers lack any any means of influence in the way their workplace is run beyond their own job. The report was commissioned by the Employment Department as part of a long running inquiry into Britain's changing industrial relations. The third report in the series says: 'The recent growth in inequality in wages and earnings which has been widely observed to be greater in Britain than in almost all other developed economies is being matched by a widening in the inequalities of influence and access to key decisions about work and employment.' The study suggests the sharp decline in workplace trade unionism since 1980 (with a fall from 58 per cent to 40 per cent in membership) has not led to any spontaneous move by employers to introduce alternative forms of worker representation or joint consultation. Instead, the author argues British industry and commerce 'appear to be moving towards the situation in which non-managerial employees are treated as a 'factor of production' '. Management is growing increasingly autocratic in its wielding of unilateral power. At the same time, Dr Millward points out that no laws have been passed in Britain - unlike in 'almost all other developed economies' - to 'provide a basic floor of employment rights and minimum labour standards' for workers. The comprehensive survey covers 1,500 establishments with more than 25 employees in industry and commerce in 1990. Dr Millward found few companies were following human resource methods of management. Only 10 establishments had 'new style agreements' that included 'management control over work organisation' combined with a functioning consultative system; single status in benefits for blue and white collar workers; and 'final offer' arbitration. The survey found few companies had introduced profit sharing or share ownership schemes to strengthen the commitment of their employees. It also found human resource management techniques were more common in unionised than non-unionised enterprises. 'We could find little evidence the very substantial growth in non-unionism was accompanied by a growth in human resource management or more 'progressive' management practices,' says Millward.

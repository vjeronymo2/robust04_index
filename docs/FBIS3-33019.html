More than 9,200 members of the  National Association of Small Farmers [ANAP] participate in the  surveillance of livestock and cultivated areas, and 1,250 assist  the police as volunteers.    Despite all this, crime rates in rural areas are still high.  In the second half of 1993, 330 crimes were reported, of which  only 50 percent were solved.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 3.6 per cent as yen falls and rates rise A LOWER yen and higher short-term interest rates erased most of the Nikkei's gains accumulated since the cut in the Japanese discount rate on December 30, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. Widespread rumours regarding a fresh scandal involving a speculative investment group and leading politicians also sent jitters through the market. The Nikkei closed 851.39 or 3.6 per cent lower at 22,715.00 after a day's high of 23,539.53 and a low of 22,704.68. Volume eased from 215m to 200m shares. Declines led gains by 897 to 104, with 104 issues unchanged, and all 36 TSE first section sectors retreated. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 53.28 to 1,693.39 but, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 0.52 firmer at 1,275.39. The stock market opened higher on New York's overnight stability, but selling flooded the floor as the government bond market lost ground and the yen went into reverse after its recent strong gains against the dollar. Investment trusts were among the leading sellers. Later in the day, futures and options-linked arbitrage selling added to the losses. 'People had high expectations of almost another Plaza Accord but it is not going to happen,' said Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at Warburg Securities, of hopes that Japanese and US officials would take steps to boost the yen. Equities also came under pressure from the Bank of Japan's tightening of credit, which sent short-term interest rates sharply higher. After lowering its official discount rate late last month, the central bank guided the unsecured overnight call rate as high as 6.5 per cent yesterday. Although declines were widespread, interest rate-sensitive issues were among the largest losers, with Fuji Bank down Y150 to Y2,400 and Sumitomo Bank Y120 to Y2,110. Leading electricals were also depressed, with Pioneer shedding Y230 to Y3,360 and Sony Y220 to Y4,080. In Osaka, the OSE average dropped 625.80 to 24,116.57 on volume of 32.9m shares. Nintendo, the electronic game maker,fell Y400 to Y11,800. Roundup TOKYO'S fall unsettled most of the Pacific Rim yesterday. TAIWAN continued its advance, the weighted index rising 53.80 or 1.1 per cent to 4,772.61 as turnover swelled to TDollars 42.3bn from TDollars 35.1bn, the largest in six months. Shares benefiting from the rise in the local currency included President Enterprises, up TDollars 2 to TDollars 50, and Charoen Pok Phand Enterprises, which rose TDollars 2.70 to TDollars 41.60. HONG KONG gave up early gains to profit-taking. The Hang Seng index lost 10.26 to 4,337.67 in turnover of HKDollars 1.66bn, after HKDollars 1.41bn. Trading hongs continued to attract overseas buying. Jardine Matheson held its ground at HKDollars 40.25 while Hutchison Whampoa put on 20 cents to HKDollars 15.10. SEOUL tumbled on news of problems at small manufacturing companies. The composite index fell 19.42 to 625.82 in turnover of Won337.2bn, after Won482.8bn. Hyundai fell its daily limit on rumours that the government has ordered state-controlled banks not to make loans to the group. AUSTRALIA slipped in spite of the government's 11th cut in interest rates in two years. The All Ordinaries index eased 4.3 to 1,663.4. Turnover rose to ADollars 229m from ADollars 195m. SINGAPORE focused on Overseas Union Bank (OUB) on renewed talk that Lien Ying Chow, the OUB chief, was reducing his stake in the bank. OUB closed 20 cents higher at SDollars 4.90 with 2.8m shares traded. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 6.54 down at 1,494.55. Volume eased to SDollars 135m from SDollars 137m.

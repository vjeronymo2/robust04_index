			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: FANCY FOOTWORK GIVES BARGAIN SLEUTH AN EDGE ON FASHION  </P> <P> Sue Harmon dashes into a dressing room at The Fashion Statement in Santa Ana  with her latest catch: a black-and-white polka-dot suit that will cost her only  one penny -- if she buys a red striped suit by Jones of New York for $149.  </P> <P> Moments later, she emerges from the dressing room resplendent in her polka  dots.  </P> <P> "This is my penny suit," she says. "I'm really paying $70 each for two outfits.  My husband can't cry over that."  </P> <P> Harmon makes it her business to hunt for bargains.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old Huntington Beach woman publishes "Hidden Values," a directory  of outlet and discount merchants in Orange County who sell everything from  bridal gowns to Bibles at below-retail prices. The booklet includes ads for  discount clothing, perfume, lingerie, men's suits, jewelry and miscellaneous  goods.  </P> <P> In compiling the guide, Harmon faces an unusual occupational hazard: She could  go broke snapping up bargains.  </P> <P> "I have to be really good," she says. "It's very difficult not to shop. You  really have to direct your time."  </P> <P> Like a shopping sleuth, Harmon hunts down off-price stores, resale shops and  authentic factory outlets, where manufacturers sell their overrun or off-season  merchandise directly to shoppers, eliminating any middleman markups.  </P> <P> "Some outlets are really hidden," she says.  </P> <P> Often they are tucked away in a corner of a warehouse in an industrial park.  </P> <P> She tracks them down through tips from other outlet owners, or by cruising  around the parks in her car, searching for signs of the boutiques.  </P> <P> "All of my friends know I do this so I find out about the stores through word  of mouth."  </P> <P> That's how she discovered Newport Blue, one of her favorite outlets for men's  sportswear that operates out of a chained-off section of the manufacturer's  warehouse in Tustin.  </P> <P> Harmon, who also shops for her husband and 16-year-old son, picks through racks  of tank tops for $4.99, cotton shorts for $8.99, and striped sweat shirts  marked $4.99 that still have their original price tags of $21.99.  </P> <P> "Stuff like this I have a hard time passing up," she says, fingering one of the  sweat shirts.  </P> <P> With deals like these, outlets must be careful about throwing open their doors  to the public. They set up the outlets in out-of-the-way places and keep a low  profile to avoid taking business away from their clients, the retailers.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons my job has been so tough is the manufacturers don't want to  compete with their clients," Harmon says. "A lot of them don't want to be known  because it would hurt their business, so they don't advertise."  </P> <P> Newport Blue, for instance, had to close its larger factory outlet because "we  were doing too well. We were starting to hurt our accounts," says Deborah  Williams, outlet manager.  </P> <P> Still, manufacturers want to sell off leftover merchandise. Williams decided to  promote her outlet in the "Hidden Values" directory because the small  publication provides just enough publicity to attract shoppers without  competing with retailers.  </P> <P> "Considering the few hours we're open and our location, we're doing great  business," Williams says.  </P> <P> Harmon works hard to persuade outlet owners to advertise in her guide.  Pretending not to see the "no solicitations" sign taped on the door of Two  Potato, a maker of casual cotton clothing for women that is located in Tustin,  she ventures inside and introduces herself to the few employees absorbed in  paper work.  </P> <P> Whether it's her sweet, Southern accent or outgoing personality, she soon has a  worker giving her a tour of Two Potato's factory outlet. It's nothing fancy,  just a roped-off section of the clothing manufacturer's warehouse with a  concrete floor and racks of colorful clothes. Harmon checks the price tags: $5  for cotton skirts, $11 for shorts. She's sold. Before leaving, she asks for the  name of the outlet owner.  </P> <P> "I'll have to work on them harder," she says, tucking his card in her purse.  </P> <P> There's an outlet for almost everything, if one knows where to find it. Harmon  buys her dressy clothes at Sutter Place and her slips at Lingerie for Less,  both in Huntington Beach. She buys her suits at The Fashion Statement and her  son's shorts and T-shirts at PCH Clothing Co. in Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> She never shops in malls or department stores.  </P> <P> "I'm amazed some people pay those prices. There are very few things you can't  buy at a discount. A suit would have to be extraterrestrial for me to pay $150  to $200 for it."  </P> <P> Fortunately for the survival of her business, she's stopped bagging every  bargain she sees.  </P> <P> "You learn that everything is not for you. Some things are too old and some are  too young," she says. "I think of clothing more as a necessity now. You have to  have clothes for work and recreation. It's wonderful when you can find them at  a good bargain."  </P> <P> She distributes 12,000 copies of her guide a month to assorted outlets, hotels  and discount stores. After one year in operation, the guide now runs 16 to 24  pages, and Harmon hopes to make it as successful as its 80-page parent  directory in Dallas.  </P> <P> For a free copy of the directory, call (714) 840-2056 or visit any of the  following outlets (eight of Harmon's hidden values):  </P> <P> Newport Blue: A factory outlet for a division of Ocean Pacific that carries  sportswear and beach styles for men.

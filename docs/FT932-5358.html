			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Japan's surplus up 14.6% in April: Tokyo believes rise is exaggeration given the appreciation of the yen JAPAN'S current account surplus, which this week came in for renewed criticism from the US adminstration, rose by 14.6 per cent to Dollars 11.27bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in April compared with the same month last year, the finance ministry said yesterday. The surge in the Japanese surplus was this week strongly criticised by US officials in Paris for meetings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary said the surplus was a drag on world and US growth, while Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, insisted Washington wanted trade agreements with Japan which would deliver measurable results in cutting the surplus. The current account surplus, which many Tokyo economists believe will reach Dollars 140bn this financial year, rose from Dollars 9.8bn last April. The trade surplus jumped by 16 per cent to Dollars 11.71bn from April 1992. However, the Japanese authorities believe the rise in the surplus in dollar terms is an exaggeration given the recent appreciation of the yen against the dollar. The yen, which closed at Y107.87 to the dollar in Tokyo yesterday, has risen from about Y125 since the turn of the year. Much of the most recent rise in the surplus is due to the rise in value of dollar-denominated exports. In yen terms the current account surplus fell by 3.6 per cent to Y12,678bn, while the trade surplus was 2.4 per cent down at Y13,168bn in April compared with the same month last year. In dollar terms exports were 11.9 per cent up in April on a year before at Dollars 29.78bn, while in yen terms they fell by 5.8 per cent to Y33.49bn. The rise in exports outstripped the increase in imports, with were worth Dollars 18bn in April, a 9.4 per cent increase on a year before. The yen's appreciation has prompted a renewed outflow of long-term capital from Japan, to recycle its trade earnings. There was a net outflow of long-term capital worth Dollars 7.5bn in April, almost double the amount in April last year. The outflow was mainly due to investment in bonds.</p>

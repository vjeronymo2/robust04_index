Industrial and Commercial Solvents and Coatings_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Source category description. The industrial and commercial solvents and coatings source category includes emissions from dry cleaners; degreasing operations; and all types of coating and/or solvent clean-up operations. Examples of coating operations include, but are not limited to: aerospace component coating; automobile and light-duty truck assembly-line coating; can and coil coating; paper, film, and fabric coating; flatwood products coating; large appliance coating; magnet wire coating; marine vessel coating; metal and wood furniture coating; miscellaneous metal parts and products coating; motor vehicle and mobile equipment refinishing; plastic parts coating; and graphic arts (printing) operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Issues. The major issue on which EPA seeks comment is whether these emissions should be covered by the cap rule as proposed or by a manufacturers bubble approach (see section (i) for discussion). The FIP cap rule approach would provide the owners or operators of facilities using industrial and commercial coatings and solvents the most compliance flexibility. Owners or operators could use a variety of methods to comply with the rule. Such methods include installing new emission control systems or increasing the efficiency of existing control devices, process modifications or substitutions, or limiting the amount of solvent used at the facility. Process modifications including installing new, more efficient processes, increasing the efficiency of existing processes, or limiting process operating time. Substitutions include the replacement of solvent-based coatings with low-VOC coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. VOC Emissions Associated with the Manufacturing of Products_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Source category description. The rule for this source category will regulate VOC emissions from manufacturing and fabrication processes used to produce organic chemicals, gases, rubber and miscellaneous plastic products. Examples of products manufactured or fabricated by processes that would potentially be covered by this rule are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Industrial organic chemicals and gases. Industrial organic chemicals include, but are not limited to, gum and wood chemicals, cyclic organic crudes and intermediates, organic dyes and pigments, and 280 organic chemicals (listed in the TSD).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Drugs which include, but are not limited to, medicinal chemicals and botanical products, pharmaceutical preparations, in vitro and in vivo diagnostic substances, and biological products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Soaps; detergents; cleaning, polishing, and sanitizing preparations; surface active agents, finishing agents, sulfonated oils, and assistants; and perfumes and cosmetics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Food additives and sweeteners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, inks, primers, paint removers, thinners, stains, shellacs, cleaners, putty, coatings, adhesives, fillers, sealants, explosives, and carbon black.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fabricated rubber and miscellaneous plastics products including, but not limited to, tires and inner tubes; rubber and plastic footwear, hose, belting, gasket, packing, and sealing devices; and molded, extruded, and lathe-cut mechanical rubber goods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule for this source category contains an exemption level of 10 pounds per day of VOC emissions. While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Disposal of Materials Containing VOCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category would regulate VOC emissions at organic waste disposal facilities. Organic waste disposal facilities include any facility which is operated as a business or owned by a state or municipality and is used to treat, store, or dispose of organic wastes that contain VOCs or to reclaim or recycle organic compounds or gases from organic wastes that contain VOCs. Examples of organic waste disposal facility include: landfills; publicly owned treatment works (POTWs); hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities; and sewage sludge, solid waste, and hazardous waste incinerators. Waste solvents, coatings, and other products which contain VOCs are the major source of VOC emissions at these facilities. The VOCs contained in consumer products which are flushed to POTWs after use may be a major source of VOCs at POTWs. Given the limited data available on emissions from these facilities, no exemption level is included in the proposed rule. Upon receipt of baseline data in 1999, EPA will evaluate an exemption level for this source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Issues. EPA is requesting any information which can be used to characterize the number, size, and location of, and VOC emissions from organic waste disposal facilities located in the FIP areas. EPA is also requesting public comment on the need for this rule because the reductions associated with the industrial and commercial solvent use and the consumer and pesticide products rules may result in a reduction in VOC emissions at organic waste disposal facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Commercial Food Preparation and/or Baking_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category will regulate VOC emissions from commercial food preparation facilities. Commercial food preparation facilities include commercial bakeries and commercial charbroiling, fruit and vegetable preservation, grain mill production, malt beverage production, vegetable oil production, and wine- or brandy-making facilities, and restaurants involved in any of the aforementioned activities. The rule for this source category includes an exemption level of 10 pounds per day of VOC emissions. While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Issues. EPA is requesting public comment on methods for adjusting requirements for sources which barely exceed the exemption levels. For these small sources, it will become increasingly onerous to reduce emission levels. EPA is considering implementing the initial emission reduction requirements at a later date (though within a timeframe consistent with the attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the FIP areas) for these sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction, Processing, and Storage_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category would regulate VOC emissions from all VOC sources at oil and natural gas drilling wells (both on-shore wells and wells located offshore that, by virtue of the rule for onshore wells, would then be regulated by EPA's Outer Continental Shelf regulations in 40 CFR part 55); oil refineries; and petroleum, gasoline, and natural gas storage facilities. Storage facilities include extraction and refinery facilities, bulk gasoline plants and terminals, or any other facility which distributes petroleum, gasoline, or natural gas to retail outlet and wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of this proposed rule is to reduce VOC emissions associated with petroleum and natural gas production, processing, and storage without limiting gasoline supplies. Retail gasoline service stations are exempted from this rule because these facilities already are complying with existing regulations. <FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Service stations will be further regulated through category specific regulations proposed elsewhere in this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Issues. EPA is undecided on whether wholesale purchasers/consumers should be subject to the VOC limitations of this rule. A wholesale purchaser/consumer includes any business which is the ultimate consumer of natural gas, gasoline, or other petroleum-based fuel. Examples of wholesale purchaser/consumers include airports and fleet vehicle operations. Public comment is requested on potential control methods for wholesale purchasers/consumers (other than restricting the amount of petroleum, natural gas, or gasoline purchased) which could be applied under the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

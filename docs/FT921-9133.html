			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont faces growing cabinet pressure for tax cuts - Conservative General Election campaign MR NORMAN LAMONT is facing growing pressure from cabinet colleagues to launch the Conservative campaign for an April 9 election with a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax and a  1/2 -point cut in interest rates. Senior ministers believe most cabinet members now favour the chancellor cutting the basic rate of income tax from 25p to 24p and substantially raising tax thresholds in the March 10 Budget. With ministers acknowledging that the economic recession remains far deeper than they had anticipated, a significant number of ministers believe the Budget should include tax cuts worth up to Pounds 3bn. The prospect that tomorrow's official figures for unemployment last month will show another large rise has meanwhile strengthened the conviction that Mr Lamont should take the first opportunity that presents itself to cut interest rates by  1/2 a point. Mr John Major told businessmen in Portsmouth yesterday that he was no doubt that the prospects for recovery were 'very bright indeed'. But he conceded that it was impossible to put a precise date on a revival in consumer confidence, which is seen as the essential element in that recovery. Labour yesterday underlined its determination to keep the recession - and the consequent rise in unemployment - at the heart of the political debate. It published a detailed analysis of the rise in the jobless total since 1979 in every parliamentary constituency. In the 80 most marginal seats - which will be the main election battleground  -the increase ranged from 2 per cent to 312 per cent. In more than half the rise was more than 100 per cent. In the wake of the announcement by British Aerospace that it was shedding 2,350 jobs, Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said the opposition would continue to highlight the surge in unemployment as a key indicator of 'the failure of the Thatcher-Major government'. Even though opinion-poll evidence shows that most voters do not blame Mr Major for the recession, Mr Blair said that Labour expected the rising jobless total to emerge as a key indicator of the government's economic competence. A Pounds 3bn package of tax cuts would allow both a reduction in the basic rate (costing Pounds 2bn) and the above-inflation increase in tax thresholds which many in the government believe is essential to demonstrate its commitment to the lower-paid. In spite of strong signals from both the Treasury and 10 Downing Street that a sharp rise in borrowing means Mr Lamont will have to present a prudent Budget, ministers believe that Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn of tax cuts would be consistent with the government's image of responsible economic management. The prime minister and the chancellor, however, are likely to delay their decision until the end of this month. Barring a spectacular reversal in the opinion polls over the next few weeks, Mr Major plans to announce the election within days of the Budget, probably on Thursday March 12. Parliamentary business managers said that the Commons would then have until Monday March 16 to complete or abandon any remaining legislation.</p>

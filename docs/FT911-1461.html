			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / More cash for poor EC members sought SPAIN has snubbed EC attempts to get north-south economic disparities within the Community off the agenda for European union, by re-presenting its ideas for an equalising budgetary fund on federal lines. Madrid's renewed bid for more money for the EC's laggards 'greatly complicates' the already difficult negotiations being conducted on economic, monetary, and political union, senior EC officials and diplomats said yesterday. In a hardened version of the ideas it put to the inter-governmental conference (IGC) on political union in early March. Spain is insisting on: An 'inter-state compensation fund' to invest in 'physical and human capital' in those EC members whose gross domestic product per capita is below 90 per cent of the EC average. A progressive system of taxation for the EC budget, with contributions by member states measured by their 'relative prosperity'; A change in policy for aid to backward regions, which would loosen member governments' current obligations to contribute to the financing of EC-backed projects, instead matching this to their 'financial capacity'. Madrid's proposals for revising the Treaty of Rome were re-submitted to the IGC on Thursday, as Spain's price for agreement on the economic and monetary union accord. A compromise suggested by the Luxembourg presidency was last week dismissed as 'unacceptable' by a senior Spanish official. Unlike its poorer colleagues at the bottom of the EC development division - Ireland, Portugal and Greece - Spain gets little out of the EC budget in net terms. In 1989 it put in Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) and got back Ecu3.5bn.</p>

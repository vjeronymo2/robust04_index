			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Russian directors urge old-fashioned remedies on Kremlin A GROUP of Russian manufacturers yesterday demanded that the government reverse its course of radical economic change or resign. The meeting of 1,460 directors, representing only part of the country's industrial lobby, approved a series of demands including price controls and the indexation of wages and enterprises' working capital, but it fell short of its original plan to call for the immediate resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister. The conference was the latest lobbying effort on the part of enterprise managers to get more government money as it tries to come to grips with the debt crisis hurting much of Russian industry. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs - who sees himself as more progressive than the Industrial Union parliamentary faction which organised the meeting - told delegates he understood their anger but that new policies could not be elaborated in one day. Not all directors shared the meeting's angry tone. Mr Alexei Novikov, director of the GAZ car plant in Nizhny-Novgorod, said that although 'corrections' of policy were necessary, the government was on the right track. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze sent 3,000 troops yesterday to hunt out anti-government rebels who rejected an ultimatum to free Mr Roman Gventsadze, the kidnapped interior minister, Reuter reports from Zugdidi. The ruling State Council said the troops were heading towards rebel strongholds in the west of the country. The Georgian government blames ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, toppled in a bloody revolt last January, for masterminding Tuesday's abduction of a dozen officials including the interior minister. Mr Gamsakhurdia has denied responsibility.</p>

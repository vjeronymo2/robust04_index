			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Out go new initiatives - Off the Wall BAD, BUT it could have been worse, is the fairly predictable reaction to the real cuts in funding for the arts, the museums, and the heritage generally, announced in the autumn statement. The new Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, is reported to be well pleased with the outcome. The sad thing is that as theatres go dark; museums sack staff; and dance companies close, fingers can be pointed at innocent scapegoats. The obvious one is the British Library. In a desperate attempt to finish off the job the Government is pumping an extra Pounds 30m over the next three years into this benighted project. If things had gone according to plan British Library expenditure would be an historical blip by now. As things stand it is absorbing the resources which could have saved the performing arts, eating up Pounds 136m in 1995-96. Also in the firing line must be the costs of setting up the new Department of Heritage. The move to the new building, and additional staff, means that 250 civil servants will consume Pounds 26m next year from a Pounds 991m total budget. For the Arts Council there is a brief reprieve. Next year it will receive almost 2 per cent more, at Pounds 225.63m, and chairman Lord Palumbo has pledged that existing clients will be taken care of. But out go new initiatives; new inspirations; new artists. Then the Government starts axing like a lumber jack, and four years from now the Council is set to receive marginally less than its current year's grant, a massive cut in real terms. It will mean a choice between withdrawing subsidy from many smaller arts groups, or chopping one or two major arts flagships - or doing away with the Arts Council as we know it. Of course there are alternative scenarios. Lottery money should be trickling through by late 1994, which will be a Pounds 100m plus annual lifeline for the arts. And this week's planned expenditures may be fattened up in subsequent years. It is an interesting footnote that since Arts Minister Richard Luce introduced three year funding for the arts in 1989 in an attempt to enable companies to plan with confidence, not once has a planned budget become a reality. For the museums the misery is now. They are invariably getting cuts in real terms. To distract them Brooke has changed their funding so that instead of special allocations for maintenance, running costs and purchase grants, the museums will receive a lump sum to spend at their discretion. At a stroke he has eliminated the plaintive and embarrassing criticism that the Government has frozen purchase grants since 1985. But few directors will be buying another Picasso at the expense of redundancies, or patching up the roof. The expectation is that the museums will survive because around 90 per cent of their running costs are absorbed in wages and the 1.5 per cent freeze in public sector pay will reduce this burden to less than the sums budgeted. The staff will be paying for the new Stubbs or the new gallery. The grand plans to shore up the museums by 2000 and make them a national glory look tarnished. The heritage is the biggest loser from the cuts. English Heritage is actually getting less money next year, while the National Heritage Fund, the last bulkwark against losing arts treasures overseas, sees its grant cut from Pounds 12m to Pounds 8.2m in 1994-95 and even less in the next year. Or is it Lottery money again? After three fat years the arts are to be skinned. Lets hope they stored away some provisions. The sigh of relief at Christie's' Park Avenue saleroom on Wednesday night reverberated around the art world. At last there were buyers again for expensive pictures. The most important auction of Impressionist and modern pictures for over two years went well, with 59 out of the 76 lots finding buyers and the total of Dollars 70.6m (Pounds 46.7m) safely within Christie's pre-sale estimate. There was even an important record when Matisse's colourful interior of his model asleep sold for Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m). The decline of the art market has been built around a lack of confidence and an unwillingness of owners to sell. This week death forced on to the rostrum major pictures, and American private buyers, obviously confident that the recession is ending, were buying again. Not all are confident. Dealers are not around to underpin the bidding and no Japanese were visible in New York. Christie's did much better than Sotheby's  -whose sale totalled Dollars 35.6m. and was over 30 per cent unsold - mainly because it attracted better pictures but also because it persuaded sellers to place lower reserves. Only the good pictures are moving, like a rare complete version of Monet's waterlilies which made Dollars 12.1m at Christie's, but the folk wisdom is that the fall out from a good Impressionist sale in Manhattan trickles quickly down to Portobello Road. Meanwhile back in London Christie's best Victorian picture sales for some time saw disappointment after disappointment yesterday. Lord Leighton's 'Moorish garden', a young girl leading two peacocks, was unsold at Pounds 340,000; so was 'The Bracelet', also by Leighton; and Alma-Tadema's cheeky nude, 'The Sculptor's Model'. Even Watts famous portrait of Tennyson failed to sell. Perhaps the potential buyers do not quite believe in Mr Lamont's economic miracle.</p>

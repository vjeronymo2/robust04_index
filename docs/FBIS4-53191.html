			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kawit Chongkitthawon entitled: "Still Suspicion </F> Over Thai Role in Cambodia"]    [Text] Thailand is shooting itself in the foot again over  Cambodia's appeal for arms assistance from the West to combat  the Khmer Rouge.    Comments made by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and  National Security Council Chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit were  preposterous, not to mention the less than candor remarks by  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. Chuan, who can make a difference  in Thai-Cambodian relations, instead has chosen to sit on the  fence with increasing antipathy.    In essence, the Thai leaders were saying all the same thing  -- providing arms now for the Phnom Penh government would  jeopardize the peace process in Cambodia. Thailand, they  argued, would be affected by the ongoing fighting along the  Thai-Cambodian border and the situation would worsen if more  weapons are given to Phnom Penh. And these arms could be put up  for sale along the Thai border. Finally, what Cambodia needs,  they said, is humanitarian aid for its people.    What the Thais have not said are more interesting as in it  are found expressions in the country's overall policy towards  Cambodia. It is all boiled down to one thing -- Thailand has not  yet done enough to dispel suspicious among the Cambodian and  international community over the country's alleged existing  links with the Khmer Rouge.    Therefore, the question of foreign aid in the form of arms  to  Cambodia has been brought into the picture to pressure Thailand  to do more.    France, Australia and the United States, the three major  countries which used to strongly support Thailand's policy  toward Cambodia, have now all turned against Thailand. They are  also fed- up with Thailand's halfhearted attitude towards the  Phnom Penh government, which is the only legitimate group  recognized worldwide.    Worse still, ASEAN is also turning its face away from  Thailand. During the ASEAN senior officials' meeting in  Phatthaya last month, Bangkok failed to garner support from the  regional grouping in issuing a statement on the situation in  Cambodia which stated that the crux of the current problem there  was the infightings between the government and Khmer Rouge  forces. Even Thailand's friends in ASEAN did not buy that kind  of argument.    If the Cambodian controversy drags on into the future,  Thailand's role in the ASEAN Regional Forum will be marred.  Bangkok can never speak for the region's security and emerging  strategic order as it would be considered a pariah if the Khmer  Rouge issue persists.    Cambodia alone cannot change Thai behavior and for that  reason more powerful countries have joined Phnom Penh's efforts.  Clearly, the Western countries want to pressure Thailand to  help with the peace process, Cambodia's rehabilitation and  reconstruction, which have been beset with huge problems  resulting from over two-decades of incessant civil war.    Without Thailand's cooperation, they realize, Cambodia's  future stability will forever be in jeopardy. And the Thais  know it fully well and are aware of their power and potential in  Cambodia. As a bigger and richer country, Thailand has to be  generous towards its neighbor. Bangkok cannot just adopt a  tit-for-tat policy. But all blame must not fall on Thailand.  Cambodia too has to share some of it.    From a historical perspective, Thai-Cambodian quarrels and  conflicts, have more often than not stemmed from leadership  idiosyncrasies among leaders in both countries.    On the Cambodian side, there is the mercurial King Norodom  Sihanouk, who has spent literally all his life wading off  Thailand, to ensure his country's neutrality and independence.  He has outlasted and outmaneuvered many Thai leaders. In fact,  King Sihanouk is the only world leader who knows Thailand  (besides singing Thai songs) so well, including ways to draw  Thai blood. And now, he is passing this art of survival through  his clan, who are running the country.    As far as Thailand is concerned, Thai leaders just hate  Cambodia. Behind the Thai smile lies a long sharp dragger. In  the early Bangkok period, if the same conditions had prevailed  as today, Thai troops would have stormed Cambodia several times  over -- not to mention those lunatic Thai leaders in the 50's  and 60's and what they might have done.    However, the present Thai leaders are not much better than  their predecessors. They have shown ignorance and arrogance,  the deep- rooted trait that does not support Thailand's growing  clout in the regional economic and political arenas. They  continue to view Cambodia through the same old prism, which had  already caused numerous misunderstandings and tensions between  the two countries for the past centuries.    How Thailand is dealing with -- Cambodia today is not  dissimilar with the policy practiced in the 1950's-60's. Phnom  Penh's outrageous reactions were equally predictable.  Obviously, both sides have not learnt from their common history.    Unfortunately, even though there is a Cambodian  ambassador-designate, Roland Eng, in Bangkok, he has yet to  reconfirm and officially take up his job. Relations could  improve if their diplomats on both sides met. Without proper  consultation through diplomatic channels, the two countries  could repeat the bitter past when they suspended bilateral  relations twice under Sihanouk's reign.    Finally, the Khmer Rouge issue happens to be Thailand's  current albatross in the long annals of Thai-Cambodian  relations. The Thai leaders know that even without the Khmer  Rouge problem, other hidden issues will quickly rear their ugly  heads. In the end, there would always be the trouble-ridden  Thai-Cambodian border with poor demarcations to quarrel about.    Absurd as it may sound, some of the Thai leaders still  prefer  to associate with the predictable and disciplined Khmer Rouge  and are willing to sink with them, thinking that sooner or later  they can get away with it as the world will have only Cambodia  to be concerned about.    This is sheer folly that will bode ill for Thai-Cambodia  ties.</p>

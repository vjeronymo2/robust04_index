			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wagon rises to Pounds 9.6m as markets improve Wagon Industrial resumed profits growth, as the effect of internal changes to raise productivity coincided with an improvement in market conditions, especially in the UK. Pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30 at the group, whose interests embrace storage and retail equipment, engineering and automotive products, rose to Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 5.06m). This lifted earnings per share to 12.63p (4.52p) and allowed a 5 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 6.65p (6.325p). Stripping out exceptional costs for restructuring and writing off goodwill associated with disposals, Wagon said that its underlying pre-tax profits rose in the first half by 28 per cent to Pounds 10.4m. It said it was optimistic about its prospects and anticipated 'a continuing improvement in profits for the year as a whole'. Like other engineering companies, Wagon is experiencing continued pressure on its margins. Its profits growth has been underpinned by productivity improvements. 'Underlying profits have moved ahead in the UK, but in Europe, profits were more or less flat,' said Mr John Hudson, the chief executive. The group has made a string of small acquisitions to bolster its varied market positions and this was reflected in its turnover. Acquisitions contributed Pounds 6.49m out of a first half total of Pounds 163.85m, compared with Pounds 132.23m. Operating profits moved ahead to Pounds 11.15m, against Pounds 4.42m when the figure was depressed by restructuring charges at Forkhardt, the German specialist chuck maker. The contributions of both the storage and retail and the automotive products divisions rose, but there remained a loss from engineering, largely because of a downturn in the market for Wefco, which makes storage tanks and pressure vessels, but is now closing two of its four factories. COMMENT Wagon has delivered what it said it would deliver. Its profits are moving firmly upwards: the UK market is under its belt and European recovery is yet to come. Problems at Wefco and at Link Plastics, another trouble spot, will be sorted out in the current half. The group is riding the cycle. Full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 25m, to give earnings per share of 37.4p, would not be fanciful. That presages a 5 per cent increase in the final dividend, given group policy of working towards cover of two times. Such a forecast puts the shares, after yesterday's slip in the market, when they lost 4p to 459p, on a prospective multiple of 12.3, cheap for the sector.</p>

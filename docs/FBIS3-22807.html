			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned on 8 March that the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team for  North Korean nuclear facilities, which began it activities on 3  March, is not proceeding well with inspections.    A high-ranking government official said on 8 March, "North  Korea is objecting to some of the IAEA's inspection activities.  Particularly, it is rejecting the extraction of samples from a  radioactive chemistry laboratory in Yongbyon which is estimated  to be a nuclear reprocessing facility."    The official continued, "North Korea and the IAEA agreed in  Vienna to the extraction of samples from the radioactive  chemistry laboratory although the extraction of samples from the  five-megawatt reactor is not possible because it is not a  replacement of a fuel rod. There can be no concession because  this is the core of the IAEA inspection."    The government authority added, "However, we have to wait  and  see to judge whether the IAEA inspection team's activities are  successfully concluded. That will be around this weekend or  early next week."</p>

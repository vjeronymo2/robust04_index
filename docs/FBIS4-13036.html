			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in  Iraq [SAIRI]--Kurdistan branch--has stated that the Iraqi regime  is getting ready to launch an extensive offensive against the  marshlands east of the Maysan Governorate.    In a statement issued recently, SAIRI said that the regime  has amassed huge numbers of troops equipped with mortars and  small gunboats near the marshlands. The statement affirmed that  the southern revolutionaries had carried out several heroic  operations against the regime's troops and succeeded in  destroying a number of positions on the road between [word  indistinct] and al-Musharrah. The revolutionaries also managed  to destroy the al-Tayyib bridge east of al-'Amarah.

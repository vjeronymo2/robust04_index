			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Rate cut rumour hits DM With the US markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, flows of money were restricted and some currencies were vulnerable to rumour yesterday. The D-Mark was volatile, falling sharply at one stage on misinterpretation of a comment from the Bundesbank, writes Peter John. The German currency had been lifted in late European trading on Wednesday after Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, said increasing caution was needed by the central bank in its interest rate policy to avoid pushing up long-term rates over which it has no direct control. Then, yesterday morning, a news agency reported that Mr Johann-Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank vice-president, had said money market rates could fall to around 4 per cent. The possibility of weaker rates prompted the German currency to slide against the dollar, the pound and the French franc. It was also weaker against the Swiss franc, but more as a result of strength in the Swiss currency than D - Mark weakness. Shortly afterwards, it was stated that the report on money market rates was the result of a translation error. By that time, however, German regional inflation figures from North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria had been announced. The data suggested annualised price rises for November might have fallen to 3.7 per cent from October's 3.9 per cent. They encouraged hopes of a further cut in interest rates that could regenerate the economy and possibly prompt a re-evaluation of the currency. However, some economists said the Bundesbank had been obliged to inject emergency liquidity into the money markets yesterday, suggesting it would be difficult to bring the repo rate down from its current 6.25 per cent. Against sterling, the D-Mark fell a pfennig to DM2.5425, while against the dollar it slipped to DM1.7085 from DM1.7025. It has traded within a narrow range with the dollar for some weeks, holding between DM1.68 and DM1.72, but analysts see it continuing to weaken towards the higher end of the scale, and a shift through DM1.7050 yesterday was significant for chart specialists. The Swiss franc edged back after economic data from Basle suggested a sharp fall in inflation. The currency closed at SFr0.878 to the D - Mark, against SFr0.877 previously. The French franc was helped by an announcement from the Bank of France that it had repaid 80 per cent of the debt it incurred at the end of July through borrowings from the European Monetary Co-operation Fund. The money had been borrowed to fight off heavy selling of the French franc ahead of the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism divergence bands at the beginning of August. Economists said the debt repayment was signalled in details provided by the Bundesbank's weekly balance sheet a few days beforehand, but it was still good for sentiment. The franc improved to FFr3.4650 to the D-Mark from FFr3.4680 previously. Analysts who examine currency movements on the basis of chart trends see the franc attaining FFr3.44 soon. Among Mediterranean currencies, the Spanish peseta lost ground against the D-Mark as one investment house was said to be recommending a switch from Spanish government bonds to Italian paper. There is concern over strikes in Spain at the weekend in reaction to the proposed social pact on wages and jobs. Italy has its own political problems, but economists were saying that they were now discounted following sharp falls in Italian shares, government bonds and the currency on Tuesday. The falls followed extremist victories in local elections which led to fears of general political uncertainty ahead of next year's national elections and an uncertain passage for the 1994 budget. The Italian lira, which hit a record low earlier this week, was little changed at L989.40 to the D - Mark. The peseta dropped to Pta81.90 against the D-Mark at one stage but finished at PTa81.51, compared to Pta81.36 previously. Sterling consolidated gains achieved after the most recent cut in base rates, which had long been discounted by money market rates. Further helped by the worries emanating from Germany, it reached DM2.5430 at one stage, a level which chart specialists see as a significant breakthrough point. The pound rose marginally against the dollar to Dollars 1.4885 and the sterling exchange rate index, which measures the pound against a basket of leading currencies, moved up to 81.7 from 81.6 previously. In the UK money markets, easy conditions ahead of the Budget next week saw overnight lending rates trade down to around 4 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a liquid-ity shortage of Pounds 1.35bn, which was later revised down to Pounds 1bn and dealt with at the earliest opportunity. The central bank bought Pounds 730m of short-dated band one bank bills at the established 5 3/8 per cent rate and Pounds 270m of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on December 13 and 14 at 5 13/32 per cent. The short sterling contract which expires on December 15 was discounting interest rates of 5.4 per cent, little changed since the base rate cut at the beginning of the week. However, some dealers pointed out that the three-month interbank rate of 5 3/8 per cent was, unusually, below short sterling.</p>

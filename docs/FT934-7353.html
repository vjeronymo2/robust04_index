			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (13): Professions give Leeds the edge  -Chris Tighe and Ian Hamilton Fazey analyse market patterns on the east of the Pennines / The North-east and Yorkshire DESPITE A lack of evident excitement, the market in north-east England is going through important underlying and long-term changes, reflecting its move from heavy and traditional industries. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the sites within the remit of the Tyne and Wear and Teesside development corporations, where much of the region's recent property development has been focused. Now midway through their lifespans, both are at the crucial stage of marketing key sites, following sometimes complex land acquisition, and invariably costly reclamation and improvement. Examples include the TWDC's East Quayside and Royal Quays flagship schemes on the Tyne, and the Teesside Development Corporation's Teesdale site. To complement the transformation of this site, a barrage has been erected across the Tees to cover ugly mudflats and enhance leisure amenities. Following a lengthy legal wrangle, eventually resolved in the TWDC's favour, construction has recently begun on the prominent East Quayside site in Newcastle: the first office space has been pre-let to the North of England Protecting and Indemnity Association. That the association is moving from one of the city's central areas, where many much older offices already languish vacant, highlights the disparity between demand for smart new premises, at Pounds 12 plus a sq ft, and the lack of enthusiasm for older buildings lacking car-parking and cachet. Top rents have eased from about Pounds 14 in the last three years. Local agents, although concerned at the dead weight of old, unwanted offices, are adamant more new space is needed to maintain Newcastle's standing as the regional capital, especially at a time when a worrying number of organisations have scaled down their north-east bases in favour of amalgamation with their Yorkshire operations. While the development corporations do not have a monopoly of new development, most new commercial development in the region has benefited from some form of state incentive. For example, Leeds-based Akeler's Doxford Business Park, on the edge of Sunderland, where much of the first phase has recently been let, has Enterprise Zone status. The imminent creation of two more north-east EZs, on Tyneside and in the former coastal mining strip of East Durham, may well make developments outside EZs and development corporation land less likely. The exception to this will be schemes which have some specific attraction or novel feature, such as the proposed Pounds 30m Durham University Science Park, next to the established Mountjoy Research Centre, and the Pounds 100m Project Genesis scheme for the 'green', environmentally friendly regeneration of the Consett steelworks site in County Durham. After its explosion of new shopping space in the past decade, Tyneside's retail sector is generally consolidating rather than expanding. But in Northumberland a new out-of-town shopping development is imminent on land beside the A1 on the edge of Alnwick, where the Duke of Northumberland's estate has won planning consent for retailing. On Teesside, the development corporation is proposing a Pounds 16m second phase at the Teesside Retail Park, the former Stockton racecourse site, to the chagrin of struggling high street traders. Meanwhile, research by Leeds University suggests Newcastle is losing to Leeds in financial and professional services, the main driving force for office rental pressures in the city centre and the benchmark for Yorkshire and Humberside and the north-east. Leeds's clear emergence as the regional financial centre east of the Pennines has come in the past five years. Property demand was already being spurred by the relocation of substantial parts of the departments of health and social security from London. Leeds has achieved critical mass in at least two areas of financial and professional services, and this has helped keep a steady pressure on demand. The city was already particularly strong in large legal practices, half-a-dozen of which are among the biggest in Britain, each employing hundreds of people. But the past three years have brought large numbers of new jobs in telephone-based financial or other services. First Direct, National Breakdown, Barclaycard, Club 24 and - the latest incomer - Direct Line have all established bases. The reason why Leeds is successful in this field is the neutral, non-threatening West Yorkshire accent. First Direct deliberately chose Leeds after researching the acceptability of a wide range accents around the country. Ian Barraclough, managing partner of DTZ Debenham-Thorpe, says: 'We see about 1m sq ft being needed up in 1994. Leeds is looking very strong. Land values and construction costs have remained stuck and there is plenty of land available. Headline rents are around Pounds 18 to Pounds 20 per sq ft, the same as two years ago, but with less than 200,000 sq ft of new space available in 1994, we should see rents rise again.' He thinks this sort of demand, and the consequent guaranteed returns from new building, should help Leeds secure a large share of the Pounds 7.5bn DTZ Debenham-Thorpe estimates as available, mainly from abroad, for UK property investment. Bradford is benefiting from Leeds' strength because, although it is part of the same economic sub-region (the two chambers of commerce merged this year), its office rents are around Pounds 12.50 a sq ft, making it attractive for back-office operations for Leeds' financial and professional services. York, the ancient walled city, remains attractive for much the same reason as Chester, its north-western counterpart; but Sheffield's picture looks less rosy. Sheffield has also suffered from the polarisation of professional services into Leeds, and is short of office space anyway. In contrast, the rundown in defence industries is leaving Harrogate with space to spare. Natwest's Switch card operation recently found 50,000 sq ft there at only Pounds 10 a sq ft. Until economic recovery is more firmly established, however, other market sectors will drag their feet. 'Tenants won't move,' Mr Barraclough says. 'They are worried about creating double overheads. Nervous tenants don't create opportunities for investors.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" program] </F>   [Text] The value of trade between Russia and China reached  $7.7 billion last year, an alltime high. Border trade accounted  for almost half of the total amount. Heilongjiang Province is  Russia's major Chinese trading partner. It is no accident that  Heilongjiang ranks top in Sino-Russian trade because, of all  China's northeast provinces, Heilongjiang shares the longest  common border of over 3,000 km with Russia. Some 20 trading  points along the border serve passenger and commodity transport.  In addition to road and rail transport, there are direct  shipping and air services between Russia and Heilongjiang. One  characteristic marks Heilongjiang's trade with Russia, that is,  Heilongjiang, taking advantage of its geographical position,  serves as a trade intermediary between Russia and more developed  provinces in east and southeast China. Therefore, the structure  and nature of Heilongjiang's external trade reflect an overview  of Russian-Chinese trade. Barter trade remains the main form of  trade between Russia and Heilongjiang. Although both sides  strive to diversify trade operations and to improve account  settlement systems, barter trade still accounts for nearly  two-thirds of the total trade volume. Both the export trade  structure of Russia and China have undergone great changes.  Russia has reduced the amount of raw material sold to China and  increased industrial equipment, automobiles, and aviation  technology exports. At present, machinery equipment exports  account for 80 percent of Russian exports to China. China has  also reduced exports of shoes and garments to Russia, and  increased foodstuff supply. In recent years, border trade has  shown an upward movement in terms of both quantity and quality.  However, this year's prospects do not look good. Border trade  was down by nearly half in the first quarter of this year from  the same period last year. Was it just temporary or will the  trend become a pattern? Heilongjiang's Vice Governor Wang  Zongzhan analyzed the situation when interviewed by station  reporter Mazhinkov.    [Beging Wang Zongzhan recording] We attach great importance  to developing Sino-Russian border trade. Trade relationships  between China and Russia have developed rapidly in recent years.  The trade figures between Heilongjiang and Russia in the last  three years were as follows: The trade amount in 1991 was one  billion Swiss francs; in 1992, two billion Swiss francs; and  1993, nearly 3 billion Swiss francs. Trade volume dropped  sharply in the first quarter. The main reason was Russia's  implementation of a visa system [words indistinct]. Complex  procedures and lots of requirements to get a visa as well as low  efficiency in visa issuance have dampened the enthusiasm of  Chinese businessmen doing business in Russia [words indistinct].  We call on the Russian Government to adopt a policy of  encouragement so as to facilitate [words indistinct] because the  development of [word indistinct] is in accord with the interests  of the two countries, and the two peoples. The development of  Sino-Russian border trade in recent years has greatly  contributed to the harmony, stability, and to the growth of the  two countries' economies. Both sides need to work out  preferential policies to solve such problems as the method of  account settlement, prices, and tariffs. [end recording]</p>

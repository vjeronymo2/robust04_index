			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Boots buys back Pounds 508m of shares: Retailer free to consider acquisitions as unions seek assurance on sale of arm to BASF Boots, the retailer, yesterday spent Pounds 508m on buying back its shares on the stock market. The sum represents 60 per cent of the money it hopes to receive from the sale of its prescription drugs business to German chemical company BASF. The share buy-back leaves Boots' management free to concentrate on acquisitions in over-the-counter (non-prescription) drugs, probably in Germany. 'We are in talks with many companies and merchant banks,' said the company. Once the BASF sale is completed, Boots will have about Pounds 500m in cash, although it refused to say whether this had been earmarked for its acquisition programme. The buy-back came as BASF sought to reassure employees of their future under new ownership. Boots trade unions had feared that BASF, which has a drugs unit of its own, would seek to cut costs by trimming the division's 5,750-strong workforce, of which 1,600 are in the UK. BASF said it wanted to integrate the Boots operations in collaboration with Boots management. 'We are not simply saying 'You must march in our direction',' it said. Mr Ernest Bullimore, a regional organiser for USDAW, which represents about 2,000 Boots employees in Nottingham, the company's home town, said: 'It's inevitable there will be job losses. Manufacturing is the area where we're going to have the losses.' From what the union had gleaned, he added, 'the German company is keen to take on the research and development but whether they'll want to take on all the manufacturing isn't clear'. Yesterday BASF said 'it would not be a surprise for us to have R&amp;D in the UK'. There are 575 Boots R&amp;D staff in the UK and another 295 in other countries. Boots will tell union officials on Friday that 'virtually all' the pharmaceuticals division's employees will be transferred to BASF and that the Germany company will decide on their long-term future. The interests of Boots smaller shareholders had prompted it to buy back shares rather than pay a special dividend. A dividend would 'simply have transferred cash to shareholders, favouring those institutions who are tax exempt. The buy-back favours all shareholders,' said the company. New light was shed yesterday on Boots' thinking behind the decision to sell its prescription drugs business to BASF rather than a management buy-out team. BASF was in a position to move quickly, while there were some doubts at Boots over the financing structure for the City-backed MBO team. Boots is understood to have feared that talks with the MBO consortium would have been 'protracted'. Lex, Page 26</p>

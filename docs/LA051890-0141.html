			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> IMPROVEMENTS BEGIN ON BEACH BOULEVARD  </P> <P> Traffic-choked Beach Boulevard is getting help. Work was launched Thursday on a  yearlong construction project to make Beach into a wider, safer "super street,"  the first such streamlined surface road in Orange County.  </P> <P> Beach Boulevard runs north-south from the Orange County line in La Habra to the  ocean, at Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach. Along the way, it carries  about 80,000 cars a day -- more traffic than any other surface street in Orange  County, according to the county's Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> For four years, county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder has worked to get Beach  Boulevard expanded and streamlined so that traffic would move faster and  easier. At groundbreaking ceremonies on Thursday morning in Huntington Beach,  Wieder proudly heaved the first shovel of dirt.  </P> <P> "They say that good things are worth waiting for, and this is a good thing,"  Wieder said to a group of about 50 people at the intersection of Beach and  Edinger Avenue.  </P> <P> Wieder recalled that the county Transportation Commission began planning for  super streets four years ago, after county voters had rejected Measure A, a  ballot proposal for more taxes to improve highways. "After the defeat of  Measure A, we did go back to the drawing board," she said.  </P> <P> Delays, she said, have been caused by lack of money for the project and by  difficulties in getting the 10 cities along Beach Boulevard to agree to the  plans. No parking will be allowed on Beach after it becomes a super street, and  some cities initially balked at that idea.  </P> <P> Transportation Commission officials said 19 1/2 miles of Beach Boulevard, from  Pacific Coast Highway to Imperial Highway, ultimately will have synchronized  stoplights, additional lanes, better turn areas and other safety improvements.  The initial phase of the project calls for work between Ellis Avenue in  Huntington Beach and Lincoln Avenue in Anaheim. That phase will cost $12.8  million, and work is scheduled to be complete by the summer of 1991. The  redevelopment of the remainder of Beach Boulevard will then proceed.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays spoke at the ceremonies and praised the  project, which he said is vital to "a very important commercial area" of his  city. Part of the super-street work, at the corner of Edinger and Beach, will  improve access to Huntington Center, a mall that is one of the biggest  sales-tax producers for Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Keith McKean, director of the state Department of Transportation, told the  audience that the super-street project is "a beginning of what I see as a  renaissance in commercial development, making access to commercial areas more  feasible during peak hours."  </P> <P> Three more super streets in the county are scheduled after Beach Boulevard is  completed. They are Imperial Boulevard, Katella Avenue and a super street  linking Edinger Avenue, Irvine Center Drive, Moulton Parkway and Street of the  Golden Lantern. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

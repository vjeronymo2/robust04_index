			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "kpk.": "KfW Bank for Reconstruction: </F> Three-Quarters of Our Development Aid Is Successful"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 24 Apr--Development aid does involve  mistakes and failures, but that is only a small part of reality;  the actual success rate is much higher. At least that, once  again, is the conclusion drawn by the Bank for Reconstruction  (KfW) from the cases of development aid that it oversees. A good  two years ago this state-owned bank, based in Frankfurt,  presented its first profit and loss report. Now it has presented  its second, to again verify "with facts" what "has actually been  achieved" with the aid.    According to the report: 76 percent of the KfW projects are  "successful in terms of development policy"; 24 percent are not.  Sixty-seven percent of the financial aid is distributed among  the successful projects, and 33 percent is spent on the  unsuccessful projects. The rate of success is virtually the same  as in the first evaluation report. At that time 74 percent of  the projects examined were classified as successful. Around  four-fifths of distributed funds were used on these projects. In  this respect, the funds were used more effectively at that time.    All cases involve so-called financial development aid: used  to finance projects in the Third World that are contracted by  the Federal Government. For its report the bank evaluated 112  projects. Bank sponsorship of all of these projects was  completed in 1990 and 1991. Around 3 billion German marks [DM]  were spent on these projects. The money came from the budget of  the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ). The  geographic area of emphasis for the projects is Africa, and  functional areas of emphasis include transportation,  communications, electricity and water supply, and health care.  The projects are evaluated both by employees of the KfW and by  the economic evaluation firm, Treuarbeit (under contract by the  ministry).    The bank would like the fact that 27 projects (24 percent)  are unsuccessful to be seen in relative terms: The  classification "unsuccessful" does not mean that the project has  been completely useless for the developing countries involved.  Fifteen projects definitely showed important advantages. These  were not sufficient, however, to classify the project, measured  in terms of the efficient use of funds, as successful. Six  projects were considered "clearly insufficient" in terms of  their developmental policy effectiveness, and only the remaining  five were considered a "complete failure."    As an example of a project that is unsuccessful on the whole  but is not completely useless, the bank mentions the expansion  of a street in Malawi: The street is now passable even during  the rainy season, it improves the sales prospects for  agricultural products raised by small farmers from a rural  district of the capital city, the transportation costs have  dropped, and durable consumer goods from the capital city have  become less expensive for the rural inhabitants of the African  countryside. But the government's inadequate economic policy and  the civil war have destroyed regional development, in contrast  to assumptions made when the project was evaluated, and as a  result the increase in traffic on the street has turned out to  be less dramatic than was necessary for the minimum payment of  interest on the funds employed.    One example of a total failure is the project of a  lead-silver smelting works in Bolivia. It was intended to be  used to smelt the ores, which up to that point had been  exported, domestically, thereby bringing in additional foreign  currency and creating jobs. But the ores were not sufficiently  available and the prices on the world market for lead and silver  dropped, so that the smelting works became uneconomical and it  did not even start up production. Another failure was a planting  of rubber trees in Indonesia. The ministry responsible was not  conscientious enough; the trees were stricken with mycosis, thus  their yield was low; and the small farmers lost interest. The  project was broken off prematurely.    How are successes or failures measured? Evaluation standards  include: Was the goal of the project (Example: drinking water  for 20,000 people) achieved? Does the assisted investment earn  the funds necessary to maintain it (catch phrase: operating  efficiency)? Does it benefit the country's whole economy (Catch  phrase: cost-benefit analysis)? Does the project improve the  living conditions, above all, of the poorer groups of the  population; does it fit in with a traditional life and a  traditional mode of behavior? Could it possibly be harmful to  human health or to the ecosystem (catch phrase: environmental  effects)? Does it display sustained effectiveness; will it  remain durable over the long term?    This evaluation covers only the benefits that the aid  provides in developing countries; it does not account for  benefits the financial aid might have for the German donor  country (example: additional purchases in Germany). The message  the bank is hoping to convey with its report is: Development aid  is far better than its poor public image would suggest.</p>

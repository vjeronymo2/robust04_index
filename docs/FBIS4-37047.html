			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Agonising After the Event"] </F>   [Text] The moaning and groaning over the GATT agreement is  now kept going, not so much by the political parties opposed to  it as by the spokespersons of the Government which is the  signatory of the Final Act. The Commerce Minister, Mr. Pranab  Mukherjee, who had been in the forefront of doughty defenders  and did much to put heart into doubters, is himself raising  questions which ought to have been thought through before the  event, rather than being debated after it. Inaugurating a  workshop in New Delhi on `Impact of GATT Accord on Indian  Economy', Mr. Mukherjee has called for an extensive debate on  several issues going into the very heart of the matter. The  questions he listed were: whether there would be efficient  reallocation of world resources as a result of the pact; whether  a rule-based multilateral trading system like the World Trade  Organisation (WTO) would really provide a level playing field  for all the countries to compete on fair ground: whether the  10-year transitional period should be rolled over or rolled  back; whether the agreement would expose the Indian small-scale  sector to unfair or uneven competition; and whether the new  trade blocs such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) would in any way affect the multilateral trading system.    It would be readily seen that each and every issue that Mr.  Mukherjee has posed has a vital bearing on the entire rationale  and relevance of the Uruguay Round, and indeed on the very  justifiability or otherwise of India's participation in it. As  such, one would have presumed that extensive studies would have  been undertaken by the Government on all the aspects now brought  up by Mr. Mukherjee and the official negotiators would have  fully armed themselves with the necessary conclusions to enable  them to protect India's interests in the course of the Round.  It is really puzzling that Mr. Mukherjee should wring his hands  and pass the buck at this belated stage to the general public to  debate these issues and thus take himself off the hook.  Assuming that (but perish the thought), the debate he seeks  shows the Government's decision to subscribe to the Final Act in  a damaging light, it would only mean that instead of doing its  homework while there was still time, the Government is casting  about for excuses for locking the stables after the horses have  been stolen.    Equally inexplicably, Mr. Mukherjee throws the onus on the  public to debate and advise what legislative changes are needed  for incorporating the GATT requirements and provisions within  the Indian legislative framework. Specifically, he wants to  know whether a law on plant breeders' rights should take the  route of extending the patents or of a sui generis system or of  both. As regards the lines along which India's laws should be  brought in conformity with the Final Act, whether by fresh  enactments or by amendments, one would have thought that the  whole leviathan of a Law Ministry would have put Mr. Mukherjee  wise by this time. And as for plant breeders' rights, Mr.  Mukherjee's poser is yet another sad reminder of the  Government's policy of preferring the bliss of ignorance to the  folly of being wise about what happens right under its nose.    As long ago as March 1990, the Standing Policy Planning  Committee of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research had  gone in great depth into the nature and scope of safeguards for  gene patenting and plant breeders' rights and after a  comparative analysis of laws in other countries, made detailed  recommendations for a sui generis system. In January 1994,  following a wide-ranging, four-day, interdisciplinary dialogue,  the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation at Madras, had  forwarded a comprehensive sui generis draft of a Plant Varieties  Recognition and Protection Act. Mr. Mukherjee's colleague in  the Central Cabinet, Mr. Balram Jakhar, had heartily welcomed  the contribution of the dialogue towards formulating an  effective sui generis system. Thus, Mr. Mykherjee already has  all the answers on this specific question. All he needs is to  ensure that the right hand of the Government knows what the left  hand is doing.    The one major policy issue that is still remaining,  unresolved is the one whereby the US in particular, is insistent  on linking trade with social issues such as labour standards,  environment, human rights and the like. Mr. Mukherjee is right  in warning that this will lead to needless discussion and  confusion, and distract the WTO from substantive trade issues  which should be its prime concern, especially at a stage when  the foundation of a new world trade order is being laid. Ways  of preparing an enduring design and architecture of that  edifice, rather than frills like the colour of the ink making up  the drawings, should consume all its attention.</p>

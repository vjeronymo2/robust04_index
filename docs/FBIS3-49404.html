The statement says that Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported the proposal made by  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman concerning a cease-fire and  the territorial delineation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Muslim  side has not yet signed, and the Muslim side points out that  talks should continue on some details.    The Croatian mission attached to the EU provides detailed  information about the agreements reached at the meeting -- under  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] auspices -- by the military  commanders of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The statement lays special emphasis on the agreement that a  meeting be held on 14 January in Medjugorje at which talks would  be held on the establishment of an EU administration in Mostar.  It also carries the whole proposal of President Tudjman put  forward at the meeting in Bonn.    We recall that President Tudjman made the offer that by 15  January at 0000, all hostilities between the Croatian and the  Muslim peoples must cease. The signatories would then bind  themselves to adhering to humanitarian and international warfare  law. It was envisaged that (?disobedient) formations would be  disbanded and that war criminals would be tried. The agreement  envisages the closure of prison camps and the release of  prisoners by 31 January. Muslim accession to this agreement  would guarantee the free passage of humanitarian convoys and  humanitarian aid. The agreement envisages the regulation of  relations in the Union of Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  accompanied by the mutual respect of the Croat and Muslim  people.    The agreement seeks 17.5 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina for  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and 33.33 percent for the  Bosniak Muslim republic. The town of Mostar would be under EU  administration for up to two years. It would be the capital of  Herceg-Bosna and the return of its citizens would be ensured by  a special agreement.    The agreement -- a statement on which will be issued by the  Muslims by 15 January -- envisages that if the Union of  Bosnia-Herzegovina falls apart there would not be changes in the  borders between the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the  Bosniak-Muslim republic. These two republics would be able to  establish special relations with Croatia.</p>

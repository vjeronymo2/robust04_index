			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by TRUD correspondent Nikolay Dorofeyev: "Deputy </F> Baburin's Car to the Entrance!"]    [Text] While members of the Federation Council took a short  recess from their activities, State Duma deputies continued to  work. There probably would be no reason to delve into the  subject of the Duma today had it not been for one somewhat  alarming aspect of its activities.    Among other documents presented for the consideration of  Duma  members was the Statute on Material Support of the Activities of  the Deputies to the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly. The deputies came up with a lot of comments and  amendments. What is it that the parliament members are not happy  about? The list of amendments indicates that it is mostly the  level of their own material support. It came out, for instance,  that Duma members are not happy with a salary that amounts to 90  percent of a federal minister's salary plus bonuses for the  special nature and intensity of the job, as well as for length  of service. It does not look much compared to commercial  structures, and, judging by all signs, they feel insulted at  being equated to ministers.    There was a multitude of proposals, including this: to set a  Duma member's salary at $3,000 paid in ruble equivalent... In  the end they finally agreed on the following: to set a Duma  member's salary as equal to that of a federal minister plus  bonuses... Somewhere on the plus side of half a million. And 40  days vacation.    A lengthy discussion ensued on the topic of the size of  reimbursement for various expenses such as telephone calls and  other unforeseen deputy expenses. The discussion reached its  peak when the matter of providing Duma members with  transportation came up. Parliament members were not about to  accept a motor pool service on request. Some insisted on having  a phone in the car. The majority, however, were most pleased  with the proposal of S. Baburin, veteran of Russian  parliamentary life, to assign an official car to each deputy.    It is easy to visualize: 450 cars (one for each member of  the  State Duma) idle the entire workday around the parliament's  perimeter waiting for a call like this: "Deputy Baburin's  car--to the entrance!"    It is, of course, both convenient and prestigious. I think,  however, that Deputy N. Travkin was right in trying to explain  to his colleagues what kind of blow to their reputation such  decisions produce. They did not listen to him, however.    In short, the entire course of the discussion on the matter  of deputies' material support graphically demonstrated how  strong among us is the conviction that it is so much better to  champion people's interests on a salary no lower than that of a  minister and to look at the outside world from the window of a  personal chauffeured car...</p>

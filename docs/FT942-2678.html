			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (30): Group F - Morocco This is the third time Morocco have qualified for the finals, each time in the Americas. In 1970, in Mexico, they were the first African side since Egypt in 1934 to take part; 16 years later, again in Mexico, they became the first to reach the second round. In 1994 there is more than the usual dose of national pride at stake. Morocco is still angry about the way its bids to host the World Cup, in 1994 and 1998, were brushed aside in favour of the US and France. King Hassan II has put massive funds at the disposal of the team, and national coach Abdallah Blinda will have some explaining to do if his charges do not reach the second round. He has decided to call mainly on overseas-based players, principally those playing in Europe. The key to the side is undoubtedly Rashid Daoudi (WAC Casablanca), a midfielder known as Magic Daoudi'. He is joined in midfield by rising star Mustafa Hajji (23), who plays for Nancy in the French second division. Experience is represented by Mustafa al-Haddaoui (Angers), the sole survivor of the 1986 World Cup squad. But many of the overseas contingent, having grown up abroad, do not speak Arabic and have no language in common with their home-based colleagues. If things begin to go wrong, the language division could prove crucial. The strategy will be to draw with either Belgium or the Netherlands and notch up a good win over Saudi Arabia. That would see them through to the second round. Success thereafter will be celebrated all the way to the royal palace in Rabat.</p>

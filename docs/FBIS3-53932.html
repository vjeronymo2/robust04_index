They described his excellency as a national leader  of a new type and as the most courageous politician in the world.    In statements to an INA correspondent in Moscow, the Russian  personalities hailed the Iraqi people and their unbending  steadfastness at the historical battle, the Mother of Battles,  and their support for their brave leadership. They said that  the Iraqi leadership stands as a symbol of defiance that will  continue to be recalled by all free people and all of mankind  for many generations to come.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party and member of the Russian Federation's  Parliament, hailed the unique, historic Iraqi leadership. He  described President Saddam Husayn as a national leader of a new  type and as the most courageous politician in the world in  recent times.    He said that President Saddam Husayn represents a dauntless  national leadership that defends the interests of its country  and people. He said that, from this perspective, Saddam Husayn  offers a model for how any national leadership should be in a  world that the United States and hostile Western circles are  trying to control.    He added that a leader who confronted the aggression of 30  states, led by the United States, deserves to be appreciated and  respected. He indicated that the Iraqi leadership's wisdom and  brilliant and successful management of the national economy  despite the criminal blockade is unmistakable evidence that Iraq  is a lofty, lively, and deep-rooted country. He said that had  any other country in the world been subjected to such a  blockade, it would have died a long time ago.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stressed that the Liberal Democratic  Party and the grass-roots Russian masses that supported it in  the recent parliamentary elections constantly call for lifting  the blockade imposed on Iraq. He said: We are continuing our  consultations and efforts in this regard inside and outside the  Parliament. During my recent European tour, I held numerous  meetings with leaders of various parties and political and  social organizations and discussed with them the need to lift  the embargo against Iraq. He stressed the importance of  escalating the international campaign to put an end to the crime  that the United States and the evil powers are committing  against the steadfast Iraqi people.    Gennadiy Zyoganov [name as received], leader of the Russian  Communist Party and member of the Russian Federation's  Parliament, called for the resumption of relations between  Russia and Iraq, proceeding from the deep-rooted relations of  friendship and cooperation that once existed between the two  countries.    In statements to INA correspondent, he said: Time will not  erase from the memory of our people years of extensive relations  of cooperation and mutual benefit. Our people are certain that  the black clouds darkening the skies of our country will  disappear and that relations with Iraq will return to normal.    He added that the Russian Communist Party is looking forward  to the day when difficulties are removed and when relations  between Russia and Iraq are restored to normal for the interest  of the two peoples and their progress and prosperity.

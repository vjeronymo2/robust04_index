			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORKING HOURS OF MEDICAL RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Three cheers for the interns and resident physicians at UCI (Medical Center)  who are finally standing up for themselves.  </P> <P> I've worked with obstetrical residents for over 10 years and have watched their  health and marriages deteriorate during their four years of working over 100  hours per week.  </P> <P> Not only do these physicians in training suffer, but so do the patients under  their care. Residents care for all patients, not just the indigent or  uninsured.  </P> <P> The general public would benefit by knowing how long their doctors have been on  duty. Patients should simply refuse to be cared for by physicians who have been  working for longer than 24 hours. For safety reasons, commercial airline pilots  have a limit on the number of hours they can fly, but there is no limit on the  hours that a resident can work. After already working a day and a half, a  physician can perform open-heart surgery.  </P> <P> Residency is for learning, not a rite of passage into the medical profession.  Let's all wake up.  </P> <P> JENNIFER J. BUSH  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Vitaliy Churkin, the  Russian president's special envoy, said in Belgrade this evening  that he received assurances from representatives of the Srpska  republic in Pale today that they will not take any military  actions against Gorazde, provided that the Muslims do not force  them to do so.    Churkin described the newly created situation around Gorazde  as "slightly better," but, as he said, it is still very  dangerous. "Now is the moment to make decisions on which course  the Bosnian peace process should follow -- toward peace or war,"  he said.    Speaking about his talks in Pale, Churkin said that the  Bosnian Serbs do not pose a threat to the international  community.    The Russian envoy told journalists that he presented to  Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic and then Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic some ideas and initiatives about  the possible continuation of peace talks on Bosnia. Churkin did  not specify which initiatives this referred to, but said that he  would wait in Belgrade for Karadzic's and Milosevic's reply.</p>

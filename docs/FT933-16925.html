			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Police service YESTERDAY'S REPORT from an official committee chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy advocates far-reaching changes to the pay and grading of police officers in England and Wales. On Monday, the government published a white paper setting out equally radical proposals to shake up police organisation and management. The two documents together provide a blueprint for overhauling Britain's police, the last public service to be subjected to the government's reforming zeal. The proposals follow a similar route to that already taken in the health service, local government and education. At its heart is a clear distinction between the purchaser of police services, the police authority, and the provider, the police force. Police authorities will develop local policing plans, set targets, determine budgets and monitor the performance of their forces. The 43 police forces in England and Wales will provide the services, with much greater freedom for their managers, the chief constables, to manage their forces. This approach requires that public services work to clearly-defined objectives. It should provide much greater information about how well different police forces perform in achieving their targets. And it allows comparisons to be made between forces, so that league tables can be used to identify best practice and raise the performance of under-achievers. Inside each police force, responsibility will be delegated to line managers in individual police stations, who will be encouraged to become more responsive to their local communities. Three middle management ranks are to be abolished, and a switch made to fixed-term employment contracts. As in the rest of the public services, performance-related pay will replace the existing pay scales with their myriad allowances and automatic annual increments. In short, what is proposed is a performance culture within which good policing is rewarded and bad police officers are shunted out of the service. All of this is welcome, and long overdue. However, setting performance targets needs finesse if the work of an organisation is not to be distorted. Targets for response times to emergency calls, for example, could be achieved by putting more police officers in cars - leaving fewer of the 'bobbies on the beat' which most people say they want to see. And in one respect, the government has failed to learn an important lesson from its reforms of other public services. Better management and tighter focus on clearly defined targets can do much to improve the efficiency of service providers. But creating effective purchasing bodies which are responsive to local needs is not achieved through unelected quangos. They lack the local representation that is essential for creating a responsive service reflecting local priorities. And absence of local accountability deprives management of warning signals that can indicate serious problems, as happened when the new computer system at the London Ambulance Service collapsed. To his credit, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has stepped back from the proposal of his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, that Whitehall nominees should dominate the reformed police authorities. But elected representatives are likely to control less than half the votes if the chairman is one of the home secretary's appointees. It is already apparent in the health service that absence of local accountability has impaired effective purchasing on behalf of communities. Ministers are heading for the same mistake in the police service.</p>

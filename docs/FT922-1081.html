			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: Mischief-maker? The House of Lords is obviously looking ahead to a livelier time - and a much higher public profile - after the entrance next week of Margaret Thatcher and some of her former cabinet colleagues. It is hardly a coincidence that within minutes of her arrival in the upper house, their lordships will be debating the Maastricht Treaty. The Labour peer Lord Stoddart of Swindon has cannily called for a government statement agreeing to a referendum on political and economic union. How long can Baroness Thatcher resist rising to the bait of such mischief-making?</p>

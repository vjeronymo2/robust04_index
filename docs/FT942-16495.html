			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Inchcape's results at the beginning of the week reflected a strong Japanese yen and were lower than expected. The share price fell back a little and both Charles MacKay, the chief executive, and Sir David Plastow, the chairman, bought stock. Flying Flowers is based in the Channel Islands and deals in fresh blooms. The company was floated in August of last year and the share price has blossomed considerably since then. Most of the board held stock when the company came to market but the purchase by D. Payne of 50,000 shares represents his entire holding. Calderburn, which makes office furniture, warned about profits in December following the impact of deferred orders. At the same time, it announced it had acquired SBFI, which makes specialist desks. This has proved a successful deal and the company started the year strongly. We note that the sale of stock by Fredrich-Wilhelm Dauphin was made on behalf of his wife; he retains almost 3.5m shares. Devro International makes sausage skins and came to the market in July 1993. At that point, the directors undertook not to sell any stock until after the results were announced last month. When these were announced, three board members then sold shares. All retain considerable stakes in the company, though.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           No of Company                 Sector      Shares    Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abtrust Pref Inc         InvT       30,000      43          1 British Vita             Chem       23,250      64          5 Broadcastle              OthF       75,000      20          1 Calderburn               OS&amp;B    1,200,000    2496          1 Devro International      FdMa    1,250,000    3050          3 Eurocamp                 L&amp;Hl       10,000      25          1 Holders Technology       Dist       25,800      47          1 Lex Service              Dist       52,869     267          1* Lloyd Thompson           Insu      250,000     700          1 MacFarlane               PP&amp;P       10,400      24          1 More O'Ferrall           Mdia       50,000     203          1 Morrison (Wm)            RetF       20,380      23          1 Page (Michael)           SSer       36,000      27          1 PizzaExpress             L&amp;Hl       19,100      22          1 RTZ                      ExIn        3,235      28          1 Serif                    PP&amp;P       85,000      23          1 T&amp;N                      EngV      100,000     231          1* UDO Holdings             OS&amp;B       13,506      31          1 Whatman                   Eng        3,800      20          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birkby                   Prop       10,000      28          1 Computer People          SSer       27,500      50          1 Flying Flowers           RetG       50,000      49          1 Inchcape                 Dist       46,000     233          2 Kleen-e-ze               RetG       50,000     109          1 Lex Service              Dist        5,000      25          1 Powergen                 Elec        5,000      27          1 Shanks &amp; McEwan          OS&amp;B      200,000     164          1 Smith &amp; Nephew           Hlth       20,000      28          1 UK Land                  Prop      146,000      44          2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

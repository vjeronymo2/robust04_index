			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Metsec Metsec continued the progress made over the past 18 months, reporting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 754,000 on turnover of Pounds 29.1m for the six months to end-June. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 505,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.9m in the previous first half. After an increased tax charge of Pounds 377,000 (Pounds 122,000) earnings per share came out at 2.44p (2.48p). The interim dividend is being restored with a 1p pay-out. The USM-quoted company, which has interests in building products electronics and engineering, said that the higher tax charge arose because losses from its US operations were not allowable against other group profits.</p>

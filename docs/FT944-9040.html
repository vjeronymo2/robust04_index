			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Jobless measure faces rough ride The government's legislation to introduce a six-month Jobseeker's Allowance as a replacement for unemployment benefit and income support in April 1996 can expect strong opposition from the unemployment lobby. Mr Paul Convery, head of the independent Unemployment Unit, said yesterday that his organisation would be pressing a range of reasoned amendments to the bill when It reached the committee stage. The measure is expected in the Commons before the Christmas recess. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday that the Jobseeker's Allowance would 'not help a single person back into work'.</p>

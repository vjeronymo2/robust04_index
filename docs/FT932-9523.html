			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Oriel shows downturn to Pounds 74,000 loss ORIEL GROUP, the USM-quoted insurance broker, announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 74,000 for the year to end-December compared with profits of Pounds 2.44m in the previous 12 months. The group also announced the acquisition of a used car breakdown warranty company for an initial Pounds 8.71m, funded by a Pounds 3.5m placing with partial clawback. Oriel is paying Pounds 4.77m for Warranty Holdings' total share capital. It will pay one of the remaining shareholder-directors Pounds 200,000 in advance of a deferred payment scheme. It will also advance Warranty a total of Pounds 3.74m to settle debt. Exiting shareholders will receive Pounds 3m, mostly in cash, while remaining shareholders will be paid Pounds 650,000 in ordinary shares and Pounds 1.12m in unlisted convertible redeemable shares of 10p each. Mr Peter Head and Mr David Latimer, the principal vendors, will continue as managing and sales directors respectively. They stand to gain a further Pounds 5.92m in deferred consideration, payable in 1996, depending on profits. Warranty made pre-tax profits of Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 725,000) in 1992. At the year-end, it showed a net deficiency of assets of Pounds 4.46m, of which Pounds 4.47m related to goodwill written off following a management buy-out. Oriel said the acquisition would consolidate its strategy of developing businesses which control their own distribution networks focused on a high volume of low value transactions. The acquisition will be funded by a bank loan and a Pounds 3.5m placing with the Oman National Insurance Company at a premium price of 100p per share. Shares in Oriel climbed 6p to close at 84p. Qualifying Oriel shareholders will be able to subscribe for about half the new issue on an 8-for-1 basis at the same price. Oriel's turnover dipped to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 12m). The board proposed a final dividend of 3p (3.2p), giving an unchanged total for the year of 5p. Losses per share were 5.8p (earnings 11p).</p>

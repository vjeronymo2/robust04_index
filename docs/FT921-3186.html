			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Japanese bankers keen to develop domestic sector THE international bond market looks set to face a potent new competitor over the next few years as Japanese bankers look to develop their domestic bond market. Earlier this month Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the largest Japanese electricity utility, launched a Y100bn three-year bond issue in Japan. The deal, lead-managed by Nomura Securities, was one which many syndicate managers expected to see launched in the international market. In the past, large Japanese utilities have funded themselves much more cheaply by launching international bonds, mainly because fees charged by underwriting firms in the Eurobond market were smaller. But the Tepco issue shows Japanese underwriting fees are falling. The deal carried full fees of 0.45 per cent (45 basis points). Under the old system of semi-fixed commissions, borrowers had to pay at least 1 per cent of the total amount raised. Direct comparison with the old system is difficult, because the Tepco deal was the first domestic corporate bond issue with a three-year maturity. Until last year, the Bank of Japan prohibited companies from issuing bonds of less than five years' maturity. This was seen as a way of keeping markets for shorter-dated securities clear to meet banks' wholesale funding needs. However, in January last year Chugoku Electric Power received permission to launch a four-year deal. Bankers said the Tepco deal demonstrated that the authorities were prepared to erode further the banks' monopoly on shorter-maturity bond issues. Japanese securities firms have also been importing new issue underwriting and syndication techniques from the international bond market. Last autumn, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone launched the first domestic yen bond issue to be re-offered to investors at a fixed price. The issue was lead-managed by Nomura and Morgan Stanley, the US firm which pioneered the technique in the international bond market in 1989. The idea of the fixed-price reoffer is to prevent junior members of the underwriting group from flooding the market with discounted bonds if a deal appears to be proceeding badly. The lead bank can hold the bonds at a fixed price until it is satisfied the bulk of the deal has been placed with end investors. Only then is the issue allowed to float and find a true market price. The technique is now favoured in most sectors of the international bond market. It is widely credited with helping to restore the profitability of underwriting firms and the faith of institutional investors in the primary market - since prices are less likely to fall straight after launch. The Tepco bond issue was also sold in this way. Japanese bankers' desire to develop their domestic bond market stems from a recognition that the supply of equity finance which fuelled the Japanese economy in the 1980s has dried up. Companies are now much more reliant on debt to fund investment. In the late 1980s Japanese companies had access to almost unlimited amounts of equity finance as the stock market boomed. In the last quarter of 1989, just before the equity market collapsed, Japanese companies raised a staggering Y9,000bn of equity or equity-linked finance. In the fourth quarter of last year, by comparison, the amount raised was only Y1,000bn. In addition, many of the equity-linked bond issues launched in the international bond market in the late 1980s are now due for redemption. Around Dollars 78bn equivalent of warrant bonds need to be repaid next year, for example. Since the appetite of international investors for equity-linked finance is now much less, Japanese companies will have to rely on their domestic investors for a significant portion of this refunding. However, there are obstacles to the rapid development of a mature domestic bond market in Japan. Clearing and settlement remains cumbersome. Physical exchange of bond certificates is still the norm and the system is dominated by the Industrial Bank of Japan. Partly as a result, secondary market trading of corporate bonds is limited. Bankers are keen to streamline the system and invest in new technology, but agreement on the structure and funding of such a system has yet to be reached. In addition, access to the bond market is still limited to only a few big borrowers because Japanese investors want collateral to back any form of debt finance. Desire for collateral and security is not unique to Japan. But the concept is strong enough to have effectively blocked most sectors of industry from issuing domestic bonds.</p>

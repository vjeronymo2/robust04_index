			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLISH LEADER DEMANDS ROLE IN REUNIFICATION TALKS  </P> <P> Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, voicing Warsaw's disquiet at the  prospect of a united Germany, demanded a role for Warsaw in talks leading to  unification but ran into opposition from Bonn on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki said Poland, whose postwar borders include huge tracts of former  German territory, must be involved in negotiations between East and West  Germany and the principal victorious wartime Allies in order to guarantee its  security.  </P> <P> "We want to be present wherever the question of security of Germany's neighbors  would be discussed. Our security matters cannot be settled by proxy for us," he  told a news conference in London.  </P> <P> But West German government officials in Bonn virtually rejected the demand,  saying that West and East Germany would make no claims on Polish territory.  </P> <P> "It would not be meaningful to include Poland in the six-nation talks," one  source said.  </P> <P> In Ottawa, where the unification plan was drawn up, the Soviet Union changed  the draft by adding the phrase, "including the issue of security of the  neighboring states," at the behest of Poland, it was understood.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki refused to be drawn out on whether Poland wants full membership in  the six-power group overseeing German unification -- the United States, Soviet  Union, Britain, France and the two Germanys.  </P></p>

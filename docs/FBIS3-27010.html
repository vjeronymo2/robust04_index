"Was this meant to be a festive gift for us?" he asked.    He was referring to the reshuffle at the Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences (Cass), announced on the eve of the lunar new  year.    Wang Renzhi, the hardliner who formerly headed the Communist  Party's Central Propaganda Department and carried out the purge  of government critics in 1989, was made senior vice-chairman of  the once prestigious think tank.    Wang joined Cass in 1992 as the party boss, but did not have  any defined position in the administration.    The official announcement directed at overseas audiences  said  that new heads had been named at 43 of the 150 institutes under  Cass and that liberal academics involved in the 1989 protests or  close to the former party chief, Zhao Ziyang, had been removed.    Loyalty to socialism and "revolutionary spirit" were  considered in addition to professional qualifications in making  the appointments.    But the official report did not mention Wang's appointment,  perhaps because even his comrades knew this might have spoiled a  public relations exercise boasting a younger, more capable Cass  leadership "emancipated in thought and perspective".    "What a joke," sneered an older intellectual who translates  social science books.    "I'm surprised there is still something that can make them  feel embarrassed, now that they have turned our profession into  the most politically repressed and economically pointless way to  make a living in the entire country."    Staff were not consulted about Wang's nomination. Some had  signed a protest letter to the top leadership when he was  transferred to Cass.    Despite the economic reform of the past couple of years,  social science research in China has remained under tight  control by a small group of ideologically conservative officials  who rose to power with the crackdown on the 1989 mass protests.    Freedom in academic pursuits and expression are still  regarded as dangerous by the regime.    News of Wang's appointment came shortly after a national  conference on propaganda. The only message of the conference  was that the party wanted to reassert "leadership on public  opinion".    One new twist, however, was a warning to the press not to  indulge in publicising "certain issues" to such a degree that  they have "excessive social impact".    The "certain issues" concerned, according to Beijing  journalists, include last year's high rate of inflation -- the  third-highest record during the reform era -- and rampant  corruption.    Inflation and corruption were the two most important factors  which drove millions of citizens to join in open protests in  many Chinese cities in 1989, which the regime was able to  disperse only by using armed force.    The situation in the Year of the Dog is in many ways as  serious as at the beginning of 1989, according to some social  scientists.    The leadership has an abiding fear of serious social  research, noted one Beijing university teacher, who said it was  a "lesson learned four years ago", when many Cass researchers  were participants and even leaders in the mass protests.    To control social science, the regime not only uses fusty  bureaucrats such as Wang Renzhi -- who himself has accepted  bribes, according to former subordinates at the Party Propaganda  Department -- but it has also financially crippled research in  many Cass institutes.    Since the 1989 crackdown, the Institute of Political Science  and the Institute of Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought --  two departments which produced some of the regime's most  articulate critics -- have not embarked on a single important  project.    Administrative control of these two institutes has been  merged with the Institute of Law Studies, Cass sources said.    "It is a tradition in Soviet style systems that political  science can never be treated as a separate discipline, but  rather must be subordinated to Stalin's theory on the state and  law," the source said.    The library at Cass can only afford to renew subscriptions  to  a quarter of the foreign social science periodicals it used to  import during the 1980s -- dropping from nearly 4,000 titles to  only 800 -- due to the devaluation of renminbi and lack of any  corresponding increase in funding.    Since mid-1993, some Cass institutes have leased their  office  rooms to businesses or converted them into cheap hotels.    In the worst cases, money earmarked for research was  distributed as year-end bonuses among staff who would otherwise  have to cancel their holiday shopping.    Ironically, nearly every institute has set up a "leading  group on money-making activities" (chuangshou lingdao xiaozu),  often headed by the institute director.    The money-making group is expected to eke out the  institute's  lean research budget and supplement the staff's meagre welfare  funds.    But the Institute of Political Science has not even been  able  to get its money-making venture off the ground.    The main reason, according to one source at Cass, is that  its  field of learning has no commercial value.    Moreover, the institute director, Wu Daying, who was also  installed after the 1989 crackdown, is said to be extremely  selfish as well as incompetent. He does not want to share any  of his own money-making opportunities with colleagues with  differing political views.    A typical middle-aged researcher at Cass earns just less  than  300 renminbi (HK$265 [Hong Kong dollars]) a month. To buy a  decent suit in Beijing costs more than 1,000 renminbi.    Finding a publisher for one's scholarly work in the market  place can be an uphill battle, even if the book is not  politically sensitive.    A manuscript will not usually be accepted by mainland  publishers unless the author promises to sell -- or buy -- most,  if not all, of the books.    "The whole process takes two years to complete," said a Cass  literary critic, "and you get nothing out of it at the end  except being worn to a frazzle."    A "sense of loss" has also invaded the six Cass institutes  of  economic research. Some receive research contracts, thereby  offsetting funding problems, but still face a brain drain crisis  because economists are being offered lucrative corporate  positions in the external job market.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Political Notebook: The view from the trenches IT IS back to the trenches. MPs returning to Westminster today after the Easter break will find the contours of the battlefield have scarcely changed. The Commons battle over the Maastricht treaty and the economy's slow emergence from recession will continue to shape the political landscape. The next three months, parliament's summer term, will be no less critical for that. They should show whether retreat has become a way of life for Mr John Major's government. They should reveal whether Mr John Smith's Labour party can find ammunition more lethal than the worthy respectability of its leader. Between now and July the prime minister must make up his mind whether to give a fresh face to a weary-looking government with an extensive cabinet reshuffle. Mr Smith must decide whether a solid public image and a sharp Commons debating style provide sufficient substitute for the radicalism demanded by some of his colleagues. There will be a chance for the electorate to give their interim judgment. Some 25m adults are eligible to vote in next month's county council elections. In Newbury Mr Major will face the first by-election of the parliament. The local and by-election results will be brushed aside by the losers as inconsequential to the long-term political fortunes of the participants. But the results will have an important impact on the psychology of the politicians. A government as battered as the present one cannot lose in its electoral heartland and expect its already ragged backbenchers to keep their nerve. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have drifted on the sidelines since last April. A strong showing in the local polls and victory in Newbury would put them back in the political fight. Everything hinges on Maastricht, of course. The return of the Maastricht legislation to the Commons tomorrow will mark the opening of the final chapter in this particular saga. No-one can predict with certainty the denouement. Ministers are upbeat. About 90 per cent of the hundreds of proposed amendments have now been debated. Most of the government's other legislation, including hefty bills on education, employment and leasehold reform have been dealt with. Assuming that the Danes vote 'Yes' in their second referendum next month, the odds are that the treaty will be ratified by the end of July. Mr Major cannot rest easy. His party's fifth columnists have become totally detached from his leadership in their opposition to the treaty. There remains a small but real chance that the arcane procedures of the Commons may facilitate an amendment to incorporate the social chapter. If that happened for the prime minister all would be lost. The mood over Europe - and most else - will in turn be conditioned by the economy. The Treasury is convinced that recovery is under way. Disgruntled Conservative MPs want to see the green shoots flower before deciding that the government has restored a grip on economic management. As with Maastricht, Mr Major cannot afford to be wrong this time. No-one expects recession to be followed by boom. But without strong and steady confirmation of recovery he cannot begin to restore his authority. The economy colours everything. With recovery underway the latest dispute over testing in schools is likely to prove awkward but manageable. If the economic indicators turn down again, the row could spark yet another backbench rebellion. There are other potential minefields. Unemployment is still rising. This summer's public-spending round will be bloodier than most realise. The fundamental review of Whitehall budgets being undertaken by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, will remind Tory MPs how much easier it is to talk about saving public money than it is to do it. So there will be no shortage of targets for the opposition parties. And yet Labour MPs are far from reassured. Mr Smith has a notional opinion poll lead of 15 points but this appears to owe much more to the government's unpopularity than to positive enthusiasm for a Labour alternative. Mr Smith, a cautious, patient man cannot wait indefinitely before defining that alternative. He must make up his mind about electoral reform, about his party's links with the trades unions, and about the balance in its policies between egalitarianism and individual opportunity. Until then Labour, like the Tories, cannot expect to break out from its trenches.</p>

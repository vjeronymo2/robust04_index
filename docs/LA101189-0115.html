			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CITY SAYS PERMIT NOT NEEDED FOR GAY DAY  </P> <P> A month after a controversial Gay Pride Festival, city officials have decided a  permit is not needed for a gay organization to hold its second annual National  Coming Out Day today at the Plaza of the Flags in the Civic Center.  </P> <P> Although a permit was issued for last year's event, sponsored by the Gay and  Lesbian Community Center of Orange County, city officials now say permits are  not needed by any group that wants to use the plaza.  </P> <P> Gay activists say the city's decision is an effort to sidestep the sort of  controversy that erupted over last month's Gay Pride Festival, where a wild  fistfight broke out between radical gay activists and fundamentalist Christians  after a peaceful gay parade around Centennial Regional Park.  </P> <P> But Assistant City Atty. Richard E. Lay said Santa Ana never had the authority  to issue permits for the use of the plaza. The city only has a joint operating  agreement with the county to maintain the plaza, he added.  </P> <P> "What had happened at the festival certainly raised a question about this  permit. But it turns out that we never had the authority to issue a permit in  the first place," Lay said Tuesday.  </P> <P> As a result, the city is revamping all of its permit procedures, said Allen  Doby, director of the city's Department of Recreation and Community Services.  </P> <P> "We can't grant permits or deny them," said Doby, while denying that the city  is trying to avoid controversy.  </P> <P> Civil rights attorney John J. Duran said the gay community center based in  Garden Grove applied for a permit on Sept. 20.  </P> <P> The city's decision not to issue one indicates that officials are "paranoid,"  said Jeff LeTourneau of the Orange County Visibility League, a gay activist  group. "This is a repercussion of the festival and it's plain discrimination.  The city's sole concern is avoiding political controversy," he said.  </P> <P> Werner Kuhn, executive director for the gay center, said the city is "skittish"  about any event that smacks of controversy even though last year's Coming Out  Day was peaceful.  </P> <P> Today's event is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. and will include speeches and a  candlelight ceremony, Kuhn said.

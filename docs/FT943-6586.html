			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / US and Cuba seek better relations The US and Cuba yesterday sought to improve their stormy relations, with President Fidel Castro ordering a curb on the exodus of some refugees and the US agreeing to respond positively to any significant democratic reforms by Cuba. US secretary of state Warren Christopher said the administration was not seeking President Castro's removal, even though it blamed him for the flood of refugees leaving Cuba this month. 'If he moves toward democracy in a tangible, significant way, we'll respond in a carefully calibrated way,' he told the CBS television programme, Face the Nation. He said the US sought peaceful, democratic change in Cuba. Meanwhile, President Castro made a concession to the US over the refugees by ordering police and coastguards to stop unsafe boats and rafts carrying children from leaving the country, according to a Cuban Sunday newspaper. A meeting between the US and Cuba to discuss the refugee problem is scheduled to take place in New York on Wednesday or Thursday. The number of refugees has fallen recently because stormy weather has deterred many from attempting the crossing. US officials said Cubans also now understood that they would not get into the country if they fled by boat. Report, Page 3</p>

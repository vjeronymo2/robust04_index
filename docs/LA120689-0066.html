			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED SLAYER OF ACTRESS IS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL  </P> <P> Robert John Bardo, accused killer of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, was ordered  Tuesday to stand trial for her slaying after several witnesses testified at a  preliminary hearing that they saw him flee her Fairfax District apartment after  the shooting.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge David M. Horwitz set arraignment for Bardo, 19, for Dec.  11. The judge also upheld a special-circumstances charge -- lying in wait --  that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty if Bardo is found guilty  on the first-degree murder charge.  </P> <P> Schaeffer, best known as the co-star of the television series "My Sister Sam,"  was shot once in the chest July 18 as she stood in the doorway of her  residence. She died at the scene.  </P> <P> Bardo was arrested in Tucson a day later. He was taken into custody after  police found him darting in and out of traffic, apparently in a suicide  attempt. Police said he later led them to a bloody shirt and copy of J. D.  Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye."  </P> <P> In a hotly contested move, two Los Angeles police officers brought Bardo from  Arizona to Los Angeles in mid-August. Although the defense called the  extradition illegal, an appeals court judge upheld the action.  </P> <P> The judge's order Tuesday followed nearly 5 1/2 hours of testimony by 10  prosecution witnesses, most of whom said they either heard the fatal gunshot or  saw Bardo near Schaeffer's apartment before or immediately after the shooting.  </P> <P> "I was on the phone near the window when I heard a scream," said Francois  Lesourd, a witness who lived across the street. "I walked to the kitchen window  and to the living room window, and I saw (Bardo) running out from the door  across the street."  </P> <P> Lesourd said Bardo, whom witnesses described as wearing flip-flop shoes, was  running "funny" in an effort to keep his shoes on his feet. At least six other  witnesses testified that they saw Bardo leave the scene.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark also called as a witness the  manager of a detective agency that Bardo allegedly hired to find Schaeffer's  address.  </P> <P> "He said he wanted to send her a gift," said Anthony Zinkus, the manager. "He  said (Schaeffer) might be somewhere in the L.A. area and that she had  connections with the television business. He showed me a black-and-white,  8-by-10 photo."  </P> <P> Zinkus' agency later obtained the address from the Department of Motor  Vehicles, a move that recently prompted legislators to tighten regulations  regarding the release of DMV information to the public.  </P> <P> Another witness, Lynne Marta, said she heard the shooting as she stood in an  apartment down the hall from Schaeffer's.  </P> <P> "The door shook, the wall shook," said Marta, whose apartment was only a few  feet away from where Schaeffer was slain. "The cat went up into the air. I fell  to my knees and crawled into the bedroom. Then, I heard Rebecca's first  scream."  </P> <P> Marta said she called 911 after she heard the gunshot.  </P> <P> "She was still screaming while I was talking to 911," said Marta. "By the time  I got to the door, she was wailing. I opened the small hatch in my door. There  was a smell I'll never forget: the smell of gunfire. It was quiet except for  light moaning."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEY PIECE OF DOOMED DC-10 FOUND IN FIELD  </P> <P> The discovery of a key engine part from a jumbo jet that crashed in July has  intensified the search of Iowa cornfields for other pieces to the puzzle of  what caused the DC-10's rear engine to fly apart, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We don't know yet whether this is the golden nugget we're looking for," said  Jim Burnett, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, of the  discovery of the engine's fan disk. "But we're glad we found it."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for General Electric Co., which made the engine, said that the fan  disk of the crippled DC-10 that crashed on July 19 when trying to land at the  Sioux City airport is vital to the investigation into what happened to United  Flight 232.  </P> <P> "This is the key to the whole search," said Jerry Clark, a flight safety  investigator for GE.  </P> <P> Clark spoke at the Storm Lake airport before the fan disk was flown to GE's  Evandale jet engine plant in suburban Cincinnati, where it arrived later in the  day. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said that federal inspectors would oversee  analysis of the part.  </P> <P> One hundred searchers hired by GE will walk newly harvested fields in northwest  Iowa this weekend looking for additional parts.  </P> <P> Flight 232 crashed at the Sioux Gateway Airport after its aft engine  disintegrated in flight, throwing off parts that severed the plane's hydraulic  lines. The jet cartwheeled across the runway in a fiery crash that killed 112  people; 184 survived.  </P> <P> Farmers have been recovering small pieces of the No. 2 engine for several  weeks, but investigators said that the key to what happened is apparently the  290-pound titanium disk that holds fan blades.  </P> <P> Tuesday, about two-thirds of the disc assembly was found by Janice Sorenson,  who was running a combine through corn a half mile from her house on her farm  about 10 miles north of Alta. Alta is about 80 miles northwest of Des Moines.  </P> <P> "I felt a resistance against the combine, so I backed up, and I looked and I  could see the fan blades protruding from the ground," Sorenson said.  </P> <P> She said the disk "was buried between 6 and 8 inches. It was all in one piece  but there were pieces of fan blades that had been broken off."  </P> <P> Burnett said it is too early to assume that a flaw in the disk caused the  crash. "The metallurgical examination of the disk itself, if in fact the  problem originated there, should . . . reveal the cause," he said.  </P> <P> It is unlikely, he said, that the NTSB will disclose results of tests before a  hearing that begins Oct. 30 in Sioux City.  </P> <P> In Evandale, GE plant spokesman David Lane would not theorize about what might  have gone wrong with the disk, which probably was made in the early 1970s, but  he said that GE was eager to see the part.  </P> <P> "This is a very significant find, in our eyes," he said.  </P> <P> GE lawyer Stephen Gadd said Sorenson will receive a part of the $50,000 reward  it offered for the disk equal to the percentage of the disk she recovered, plus  separate rewards for each fan blade. The company is paying up to $1,000 each  for recovered blades.  </P></p>

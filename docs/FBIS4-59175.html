Sa'id Salman al-Fadili, director of Babil Agriculture  Department, said some 14 committee have been formed to supervise  harvest operations and to provide the necessary means of  transport to ensure the success of the campaign, which covers  293,000 donums and in which 105 harvesters will be used. Fuel  and spare parts have also been ensured for the harvesters. He  added that trucks have been provided to transport grains  directly to silos and government receiving centers, and the  Agriculture Department's teams have been instructed to join the  campaign to follow its progress.    Al-Fadili said a mobile repair workshop with mechanics will  accompany the harvesters, which can be transferred from one  administrative unit to another if necessary to achieve a balance  and to complete the harvest in all areas at once.</p>

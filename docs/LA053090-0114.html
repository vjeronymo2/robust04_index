			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> GRAFFITI COVERED UP BY 275 VOLUNTEERS  </P> <P> During three Saturdays in May, hundreds of gallons of paint were sloshed on  graffiti-marred buildings, walls and houses in Anaheim as part of Paint and  Plant Month, a new city effort to involve residents in graffiti removal and  prevention.  </P> <P> About 275 volunteers took part in the program, which city officials hope will  encourage residents to play a bigger role in maintaining their neighborhoods  and put pressure on those who deface property with graffiti.  </P> <P> In addition, the volunteers planted about two dozen shrubs in front of walls  likely to tempt vandals.  </P> <P> The Saturday volunteer program saved the city about $29,000 which would have  been spent on staff time and materials to clean up the graffiti-tainted  surfaces, said Bret Colson, a spokesman for the city.  </P> <P> Last year, the city allocated about $250,000 to fight graffiti, money that was  spent before the year was over.  </P></p>

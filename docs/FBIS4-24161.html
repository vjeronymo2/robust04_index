			<p>BFN     [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the  UN secretary general in Angola, met with South African President  Nelson Mandela in Cape Town today. Present at the meeting were  six observers in the Angolan peace process, including the U.S.  ambassador in South Africa. Alioune Blondin Beye briefed Nelson  Mandela on the development of the peace talks in Lusaka. Manuel  Augusto, Angolan charge d'affaires in South Africa, told Luanda  Radio Nacional today that the meeting was positive.    [Begin recording] [Augusto] As far as we know, President  Mandela expressed gratitude for the briefing. He also expressed  his readiness, at the request of the relevant parties, to render  his contribution within the framework of the Lusaka talks. In  other words, President Mandela made it clear that he will not  take initiatives which are outside the Lusaka spirit or which  could collide with the Lusaka spirit.    [Unidentified correspondent] We have learned here in Luanda  that President Nelson Mandela has agreed to join the group of  mediators in the Angolan conflict, that he even expressed a  readiness to meet very soon with President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. When do you think these  meetings will take place, particularly with the president of the  Republic?    [Augusto] In my understanding, I think it is not very  correct  to say that he agreed to join the group of mediators. In his  capacity as the head of state at the present, President Mandela  would not join anyone, because we have no mediators at the level  of heads of state. It is correct to say, however, that  President Mandela expressed a readiness to join efforts aimed at  bringing peace to Angola.    President Mandela also said at the end of the meeting this  afternoon that, at the request of the UN mediators, he is ready  to meet with all the parties involved in the process. It is  important to clarify, however, that at no time was it said that  there would be a summit meeting. As long as he is requested,  President Mandela is ready to take part in or promote meetings  with the Angolan Government and UNITA.    Regarding the meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos,  President Mandela has just expressed his readiness to meet him.  So, some contacts will be made through the appropriate levels  and channels between the South African Government and the  Angolan Government so that the Angolan Government can tell the  South African Government in which areas it expects it to render  its contribution.

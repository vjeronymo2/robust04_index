			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We begin with a meeting of the Council of  Ministers at the presidential offices today. Mr. Liamine  Zeroual, the head of state, chaired the meeting. In accordance  with the agenda, at the beginning of its proceedings the council  listened to a report by Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi on all the  activities of his government since it was appointed.    In light of the report presented by the minister delegate  for  the budget, the Council of Ministers then studied and approved  the Supplementary Budget Act 1994. The Supplementary Budget Act  aims to implement austerity measures in public expenditure in  order to reduce the total deficit in the state's finances; to  provide additional financial resources to restructure and clean  up public enterprises; to restructure banks; to limit the  effects of the structural reform program on deprived social  groups; to establish new tax measures aimed at promoting  investment in conformity with and in transition to a market  economy, on one hand, and at achieving economic revival so that  national development can take off again, on the other. [passage  omitted]    In his contribution to the Council of Ministers' discussion,  the head of state insisted on the need to formulate a program  for social protection, as well as undertaking work aimed at  achieving economic effectiveness, because, as he explained, we  must succeed not only on the economic level but also on the  social level. [passage omitted]    In reviewing Algeria's foreign activities in the economic  field, the head of state gave directives on the setting up of a  joint ministerial committee to be headed by the prime minister.  This committee will follow up the implementation of the  agreement signed with the IMF. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 22 SAPA -- The poor and defenceless  individual taxpayer, who already carried most of the tax burden,  would have to cough up yet again, the Freedom Front [FF] said on  Wednesday in its reaction to the budget. FF financial spokesman  Dr Willie Botha said most of the transition expenditures which  the taxpayer had to foot had been been unnecessary.    The failed National Peacekeeping Force had cost the taxpayer  R395 million [rand] and the Independent Electoral Commission had  overshot its budget by R700 million.    Dr Botha added that the measures envisaged to stimulate  growth would have a negligible impact on job creation. The  danger existed that those who qualified for these benefits would  benefit themselves, rather than create jobs.    He said it was difficult to imagine how economic growth  alone  would meet the increasing demands of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme.    According to Dr Botha foreign investment would probably only  be realised after the first real african national congress  budget in 1995, provided the ANC indicated its support for a  free market economy.</p>

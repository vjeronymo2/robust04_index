The first-place winner will receive $500 and be designated the  "Official Bicentennial Artist of Westminster." That artist will paint the  largest of three murals.  </P> <P> The second-place winner will receive $200 and the third-place winner $150. They  will each paint smaller murals.  </P> <P> "We decided to do something for the community that would have a lasting  effect," said Trudy Gibbons, a Bicentennial Foundation board member. "These  murals will remain indefinitely and will be a source of pride and prestige for  the artists selected."  </P> <P> All entries must be labeled with the artist's name, address and phone number.  They must be turned in to the Westminster Community Services and Recreation  Department at 8200 Westminster Blvd. by May 15.  </P> <P> Winners will be chosen by the Bicentennial Foundation and announced on June 14.

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / British Coal loss hides sharp rise in productivity British Coal yesterday reported a Pounds 238m loss for 1993-4, but showed sharp improvements in productivity and operating costs in the run-up to privatisation later this year. Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman, said the corporation had achieved in one year what might reasonably have been expected to take three years to accomplish. The Selby mines complex in Yorkshire was producing coal at costs which would enable it to be delivered to Aire Valley power stations at world competitive prices. Overall colliery productivity had increased by 38 per cent to an average of 8.76 tonnes a manshift (excluding shifts worked by contractors' employees) during the year and operating costs had been reduced by 14 per cent in real terms. This had helped British Coal generate an operating profit of Pounds 186m in the year to March 26. Although this was sharply down on the Pounds 588m of 1992-93, it was achieved on sharply lower volumes and a 20 per cent reduction in contract prices paid by generators in England and Wales. Turnover was down from Pounds 3.88bn to Pounds 2.66bn. Opencast mines were the corporation's most profitable arm, contributing Pounds 80m towards total operating profits. Deep mines made Pounds 66m and subsidiary companies, including Coal Products, produced Pounds 39m, more than doubling last year's Pounds 16m total. However, exceptional items, including the costs of closures and restructuring for privatisation totalled Pounds 305m (Pounds 996m last year) while net interest charges amounted to Pounds 119m. Keeping collieries open on a care and maintenance basis while negotiations with private companies continued has cost more than Pounds 70m. British Coal spent Pounds 10m last year preparing the industry for privatisation. The corporation also wrote off Pounds 65m in materials at closed collieries. Mr Clarke said availability of government subsidy had not resulted in significant additional sales. British Coal would not reveal the amount of subsidy it had received but the total is thought to be below Pounds 500,000. Mr Clarke said British Coal had won what it believed was all but a small percentage of the available sales to the UK's three largest generators. Mr Clarke said the most painful task of the year had been closing collieries to bring supply and demand into a more sustainable balance after the drop in generator contracts from 65m tonnes in 1992-3 to 40m last year and a further fall to 30m this year. 'The price has been high . . . but for our continuing collieries to have the chance of a sustainable future, it was a price which had to be paid.'</p>

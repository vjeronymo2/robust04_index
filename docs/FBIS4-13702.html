			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by 'Ali Feyzi: "A Political Taboo"] </F>   [Text] One of the most revolutionary actions after the  victory of the Islamic revolution was the severance of relations  with the United States. However, the fact is that we have not  yet fully realized the importance of this action. What were the  intended objectives, implications, dimensions, and extent of  this action? Does the mere severance of diplomatic relations  survive in isolation, without its perspective within the overall  concept of domination? Can this conform to the original  objectives? The breaking of relations should be viewed in all  its aspects; diplomatic relations cannot be segregated from  economic and trade relations. Those who blindly insist on the  continued severance of diplomatic relations are as ignorant as  those who are covertly striving to patch them up. They do not  realize the true significance of severing these relations nor  that the issue cannot be confined to the political arena, for  that would be a blatant contradiction of its purpose. Now that  there are no relations between Iran and the United States there  are irrefutable signs of increased economic relations. Even  though in most cases direct economic ties have been obstructed,  the transactions take place through middlemen. Hence, one must  view the profits and losses of these indirect deals.    If we are realistic, we will clearly see that the goods that  reach us in these deals already cost 10 to 20 percent more and  the countries that act as intermediaries also take a cut at our  expense. The American companies do not seem dissatisfied with  this state of affairs because their third country partners take  their share from Iran. In the case of countries such as Turkey,  which is facing major financial difficulties, these indirect  U.S.-Iran transactions are extremely favorable.    Therefore, contrary to Ayatollah Azeri-Qomi's remarks that  the murmurings of relations with the United States stem from a  lack of taste on the part of some officials, these murmurings  are in fact realities resulting from the absence of a specific  economic policy.    In the current circumstances, no one desires diplomatic  relations with the United States, which maintains policies  hostile to the Islamic Revolution. However, those who issue  licenses to facilitate the entry of American products into the  country will sooner or later find themselves forced to defend  the forging of diplomatic relations. We must tell these  gentlemen clearly: It is not possible to continue advertising  for Coca Cola and General Electric in the most revolutionary  newspapers while simultaneously defending the severance of  diplomatic relations.    Such a blatant contradiction is detrimental to our national  interests. The United States does not dominate solely through  its embassies all over the world. Coca Cola and General  Electric are their vanguards, and economic and trade domination  precedes political domination. Those who have turned a blind  eye to the uncontrolled entry of American commodities into our  country will sooner or later have to face the reality that  political relations will consequently become necessary. Has  adequate attention been paid to this issue?    How will it be possible to profess that we do not want  relations with the United States when a large part of the  consumer market is controlled by American companies? A dual  approach to a phenomenon that is intrinsically unitary will not  resolve the problem. The Islamic Revolution should adhere to  the concept of not having relations with the United States, but  in our opinion, the Iranian consumer market, to which the United  States fervently wants to return, is more important.    A glance at the shelves of the markets that have mushroomed  since the revolution and have sprung up even in the smallest  cities will show that the most substandard products from various  parts of the world can be found in these boutiques [preceding  word in English]. American goods may not be the most prevalent  in these shopping centers, but they are certainly no fewer than  those from other countries. A cultural movement can only reach  fruition when it does not lose sight of its objectives or  degenerate into a mere cultural quirk. Have our officials and  our nation embraced the belief that they should not use American  goods?! Such claims do not appear logical and the converse is  clearly evident in our society.    The dissemination of information in our society is quite  rudimentary, but even so, it is quite eloquent even at this  level. If one were to intensively examine the Iranian-German  talks on the reimbursement of outstanding sums, one would recall  how vehemently the United States protested to Germany for not  coordinating with it on exerting pressure on Iran. The United  States was unable to answer one German official's justification  of his government's policy. He attributed the situation to the  pillaging of Iranian foreign exchange by American companies, and  we maintained our poised silence in this altercation.    At the same time, there were rumors all over the world that  the United States wanted to increase pressure on Iran and urged  its allies not to conclude agreements with Iran. Current  developments -- which our Central Bank is proclaiming with much  fanfare as a major victory for public consumption -- are in fact  another trap to make us become so indebted that we will have no  room left to maneuver. The transformation of short-term loans  to long-term loans is not an art discovered for the first time  by the authors of our economic adjustments.    In any case, it will not make much difference whether a  debtor country has relations with the United States or not, or  continues to remain estranged. For as long as we do not  approach these issues in an honest and realistic manner,  vacillations in our foreign policies are inevitable, regardless  of whether anyone is ready to accept them or not.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Sheriff's report:  </P> <P> "Deputy Allen Sarpy and Richard Clovis were out on patrol when they were told  by a citizen that an alligator was walking northbound on Clovis Avenue  approaching the intersection of 130th Street in an unincorporated area of  Carson. The deputies found the 3 1/2-foot alligator, lassoed him and removed  him from local surface streets."  </P> <P> The deputies then called Los Angeles County animal control officers, who took  the reptile into custody. But they discovered that the "alligator" was not an  alligator at all, but a caiman -- a variety of crocodile, according to Lt.  George Warfield, of the animal control office.  </P> <P> "And he's only about 2 feet long," Warfield said.  </P> <P> Warfield noted that it is illegal to have caimans as pets in California, so  animal control officers will turn it over to the state Fish and Game  Department, which will "try to find a happy home in a zoo for the caiman."  </P> <P> If that doesn't work, he said, it will be shipped to Arkansas, where  authorities will let it loose in the swamps. So far, officials haven't any idea  how the caiman happened to be out for a morning stroll.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills' new Carnegie Deli is starting a "Pickle of the Month Award." The  cucumbers and dills won't be the honorees, but rather people who get themselves  embroiled in same, as in "What a Pickle I'm in." In other words, if you're in a  serious jam, you might relish sharing it with everyone. The deli intends to  immortalize monthly winners with a window display.  </P> <P> Maybe Carnegie's first nominee could be Zsa Zsa Gabor.  </P> <P> If you remember, Zsa Zsa is in a pickle because she allegedly slapped and  cussed at a Beverly Hills police officer, who pulled her over for having  expired tags.  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa's recent run-in with Beverly Hills police has spawned a whole new fan  following for the Hungarian-born actress.  </P> <P> A group called The Society for Prevention of Anything Against Zsa Zsa (SPAAZZ)  is planning a "moment of silence" for their heroine on her trial date Sept. 11.  </P> <P> Founder Paul Spreadbury of Orlando, Fla., said he wants everybody in Beverly  Hills to wear "Free Zsa Zsa" T-shirts (which he sells, of course) that day and  observe a minute of silence for Zsa Zsa at noon that day.  </P> <P> Spreadbury, who says he was never a big fan of Zsa Zsa's before the court  action, explained: "We've got people who murder and rape and walk away from the  courtroom and here we are making a case against Zsa Zsa. Something's not quite  right."  </P></p>

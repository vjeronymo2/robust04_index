Each question, either to close a meeting or to withhold information, must be voted on separately, unless a series of meetings is involved, in which case the Panel may vote to keep the discussions closed for 30 days, starting from the first meetings. If the panel feels that information about a closed meeting must be withheld, the decision to do so must also be the subject of a recorded vote. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Before a discussion to close a meeting or withhold information, the chairperson of a CARP must certify that such an action is permissible, and the chairperson shall cite the appropriate exemption under &sect;251.13. This certification shall be included in the announcement of the meeting and be maintained as part of the record of proceedings of the Panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Following such a vote, the following information shall be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as soon as possible: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The vote of each arbitrator; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The appropriate exemption under &sect;251.13; and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Traditional roast yields to stir-fry - Ten years of Oxo ads have reflected the social changes affecting British family life When Katie, the gravy supermum, hung up her apron for the last time and was replaced by the Oxo family on British television, there were letters of complaint from viewers. The family featured in the new set of advertisements was too realistic for some to stomach. Children arguing at the Sunday lunch table prompted Disgusted of Walton-on-Thames to write: 'Such a din, the children didn't deserve the lunch presented to them.' A Bristol viewer complained: 'It's bad enough on the few occasions my children squabble but to have it on an advert . . .' This week, and 36 commercials later, the family is 10 years old and still striving to maintain a contemporary flavour. Indeed, the development of J Walter Thompson's campaign for Oxo's manufacturer, Unilever subsidiary Brooke Bond Foods, tracks many of the social changes affecting families in general over the past decade. In 1984, a year into the Oxo family soap opera, Mum began her bid for freedom by leaving Dad to cook a weekend lunch while she goes off on a shopping jaunt. 'Saturday off from now on,' she declares on her return, as he appears not to have made a dog's dinner of it. Three years later, Mum, like most women, has a job; like most mums, the job she has is part-time and she still carries the main domestic responsibilities. Even though she is working late, her family will not be deprived of nourishing food - an Oxo-enriched casserole is left bubbling in the oven. By 1990 Mum is venturing even further afield to a Friday night keep-fit class. Health consciousness is also creeping in among the now-adolescent children: in an attempt to shake off the total identification with red meat, vegetable Oxo was launched in 1989. The TV soap has a vegetarian friend of son Nick coming over for lunch and daughter Alison finding his veggie pal madly attractive. Which brings the campaign to Oxo and sex. In 1990 Nick invites his girlfriend back for a meal while Mum and Dad are out. Their eyes meet seductively over the gravy boat but viewers are spared further developments as the parents return. Two years later Nick has stayed the night at his girlfriend's flat - they appear to spend their time preparing a risotto together. Later the same year he is cohabiting with her. The most recent development in this everyday story of contemporary family life is the appearance of a wok. How many viewers would even have known what one was 10 years ago? The increase in foreign travel and the developing British palate have led Oxo to its latest brainwave - the International Cube. Nick and girlfriend, their unwedded domestic routine now firmly established, invite his parents over for a meal and treat them to an Oxo-seasoned Chinese meal. The British public seems to have taken all this in its stride. The next obvious development - babies out of wedlock - might be too much to swallow. Will public opinion force the couple to wed? Or, in the immortal words of the late Robert Maxwell, the time may come for the gravy train to hit the buffers.</p>

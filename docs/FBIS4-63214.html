			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- An agreement on partnership and  cooperation between Russia and the European Community [EC] will  be ready for initialling in June this year. This was stated  today by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin upon completion of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's  talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.    Vitaliy Churkin said Alain Juppe assured Viktor Chernomyrdin  of France's readiness in the near future to join Russia in  resolving the question of the trade in products of the nuclear  cycle. The special position adopted by France in this area has  so far held back the talks on concluding a cooperation agreement  between Russia and the EC. Russia and France are, of course,  major producers of fuel for nuclear power stations and compete  in European markets.    A number of questions relating to bilateral trade-economic  cooperation were also discussed at the talks. Alain Juppe  handed Viktor Chernomyrdin an invitation from French Prime  Minister Eduard Balladur to visit France in the second half of  this year. The invitation was accepted.</p>

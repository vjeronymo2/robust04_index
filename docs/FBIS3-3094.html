			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Shude (3769 2885 1795), Central People's </F> Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang  (0719 1807 2455)]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- An all-Army work  conference on the legal system concluded in Beijing today. Liu  Huaqing, Standing Committee member [of the Political Bureau] of  the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the Central  Military Commission [CMC], as well as CMC Vice Chairman Zhang  Zhen and CMC members Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyu met  with the delegates during the meeting. Liu Huaqing said:  Considerable results have been achieved in work related to  military laws, but arduous tasks still lie ahead. I hope that  all of you will continue to work hard. He stressed the work to  strengthen the enactment and enforcement of military laws to  bring about the administration of the military by the law.    State Councillor Chi Haotian, national defense minister and  CMC member, attended and addressed the meeting today. He said:  Administering the military by the law is an important component  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building during the  new period. We should give the in-depth study and  implementation of this thought the most prominent place in legal  construction throughout the military and integrate them with the  study and implementation of the gists of CMC Chairman Jiang  Zemin's relevant instructions. The in-depth implementation of  the CMC policy of administering the military by the law is a  reliable guarantee for upholding the party's absolute leadership  over the military under the new circumstances, an objective  demand of adapting to the establishment of a socialist market  economic system, a pressing need of strengthening national  defense and military modernizations during the new period, as  well as a fundamental measure for safeguarding state interests  and service members' legitimate rights. Military legal  construction for the period ahead consists mainly of tasks in  six areas: We must conscientiously give military legal  construction a prominent place in the overall perspective of  national defense and military construction and bring about the  synchronized development of such construction and the legal  system by paying simultaneous attention to these two areas; we  must draw up a complete set of military laws to cover every  sector, aspect, and link in national defense and Army building;  we must establish an operating mechanism which can guarantee the  smooth implementation of military laws to give full play to the  role of military laws as a guide, driving force, and safeguard  for national defense and Army building; we must vigorously  strengthen the supervision and inspection of justice, law  enforcement, and laws to truly bring about a situation in which  justice is administered in accordance with the law, all laws are  enforced stringently, and every violation of the law is  accounted for; we must carry out throughout the military  extensive and deep-going propaganda and education on the legal  system to lift the self-consciousness of the vast contingent of  officers and men in observing and enforcing the law; and we must  strengthen the building of legal organs and a contingent of  cadres to prepare them for the tasks that their shoulders bear.  Chi Haotian called for the conscientious strengthening of  leadership to really satisfy the CMC requirements on military  legal construction, including military legislation in the agenda  of party committees, and to unite and organize forces, to make  sure we achieve positive results; and he called for adherence to  the proper principles of legislation to ensure the quality of  work in drafting various military laws and regulations, and for  the strengthening of the supervision and inspection of law  enforcement to promote the implementation of various military  laws and regulations.    The all-Army work conference on the legal system which  opened  in Beijing on 3 March with the CMC's approval is the first-ever  meeting of its kind. The meeting earnestly implemented the  demands of the party Central Committee and the National People's  Congress [NPC] on strengthening legislative work, as well as the  CMC policy of administering the military by the law; and  emphatically studied such issues as quickening the pace of  military legislation and opening up new prospects for military  legal construction under the circumstances of adapting to the  establishment of a socialist market economic system and of Army  building during the new period. Attending the meeting were  responsible persons from the three general departments and other  major Beijing-based units of the People's Liberation Army, as  well as relevant departments under the headquarters of the  Chinese People's Armed Police Force. Responsible comrades from  legislative work departments under the CPC Central Committee,  the NPC, and the State Council also attended the meeting.</p>

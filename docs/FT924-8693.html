			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: City solicitors ride the recession - British charges have not been cut and they compare unfavourably with big US firms Are British companies paying too much for legal services? Are the UK's top commercial law firms really the most expensive in the world, charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their US counterparts? Recent evidence suggests the answer to both questions is yes. First, the International Financial Law Review produced figures which showed the average hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a top City of London law firm has risen by 20 per cent over the last 12 months to Dollars 585 per hour. The top rate for a partner in the most expensive Wall Street firms was Dollars 350 per hour and the average hourly rate for partners in US law firms was Dollars 230 (see table). Then, Mrs Yve Newbold, Hanson company secretary, speaking at the English solicitors' annual conference in Birmingham last month, attacked 'unrealistic' commercial law firms for their failure to reduce their charging rates during the recession. Finally, a Gallup survey of 200 large and medium-sized UK companies published yesterday revealed that 57 per cent of companies using London law firms and 48 per cent of all the companies surveyed felt they were paying too much for legal advice. Thirty-four per cent said they had been overcharged by lawyers in the past two years. The case for the prosecution looks strong but does it stand up to cross-examination? Mrs Newbold stands by her criticism but is quick to point out that Hanson has no problems with the law firms it uses. The company is large and sophisticated enough and has sufficiently experienced in-house lawyers to drive a hard bargain on rates. Her comments, she said, were directed at companies which did not have this experience or negotiating strength. She knows of 'a number of City law firms' which 'it would not be fair to name' charging Pounds 450 per hour for advice. 'That is totally unrealistic. Industry is having to be realistic. Top management have had to take pay cuts. How many senior law firm partners have taken a drop in their real income in recent years?' Mr Barry O'Meara, ICI's deputy group solicitor, believes that if companies are being taken for a ride on costs, it is their own fault. 'They must learn to treat legal services like any other raw material. They would drive a hard bargain when buying widgets; why not when buying legal advice?' he asks. The solution is to keep a tight rein on how the law firm does the work. 'Any businessman who gives a lawyer a free hand is a fool,' he adds. The role of the internal lawyer is key to ensuring that law firms staff the job correctly, do not follow irrelevant lines of inquiry and that the correct level of lawyer is assigned to it. Mr Peter Hall, general counsel for More O'Ferrall Adshel and chairman of the Law Society's commerce and industry group, says that, although there is now a much greater awareness among commercial law firms of the need to be flexible in their approach to charging, there is still widespread concern among his members about the level of costs in the middle of a recession. He says one consequence of perceived overcharging by City law firms has been a shift of routine work out of London to the large provincial law firms, where it can often be done to the same standard at half or one-third of the cost. This is borne out by the Gallup survey. What about the case for the defence? City law firms are still remarkably touchy on the subject of fees. Linklaters &amp; Paines, the UK's second biggest law firm, is adamant that the days of law firms imposing fee structures and hourly rates on their corporate clients are long gone. Everything is negotiable, including fixed fees, success fees, premium rates for technically demanding jobs, low rates for routine work, and discounts where deals fall apart. What about the accusation that UK lawyers are the most expensive in the world? Mr Ken Walder, British Petroleum group general counsel, says the apparent difference between the hourly rates of UK and US firms is largely a product of the dollar exchange rate. The difference between the two has narrowed considerably with the pound at Dollars 1.53. He adds that methods of billing are very different, but that he would be 'astonished' if he got a bill from a UK firm for almost twice the amount charged for similar work by a US firm. Linklaters would not dispute that. But it adds that UK lawyers only charge 'a fraction' of the hours billed to clients by US lawyers each year, so a comparison of hourly rates is meaningless. The International Financial Law Review figures are simply not comparing like with like. This is not an argument which cuts much ice with Mr Bruce Buck, the senior London partner of New York law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom. 'If they are billing less hours and at the end of the day the client is not paying any less, then they are simply billing less hours at a much higher rate.' Wherever the truth lies in this debate, commercial lawyers still need to beware. The Gallup survey revealed that 47 per cent of the companies questioned felt their accountants had provided the best service over the past 12 month, compared with only 36 per cent who rated their solicitors as the best. With multi-disciplinary professional partnerships just around the corner, perhaps the writing is on the wall.</p>

In a predeparture  statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Kostepen said his visit  to Kazakhstan will be extremely useful in raising the level of  bilateral relations.    The two countries will exchange permits governing passenger  and cargo transportation between Turkey and Kazakhstan, Kostepen  explained. He expressed the belief that during his visit,  concrete moves will be undertaken toward the establishment of a  joint railroad car factory in Kazakhstan, in line with a  previous agreement. Kostepen noted that Kazakhstan's request to  purchase railroad cars, as well as ships for internal sea and  river transportation, from Turkey will also be discussed during  his visit. He added that the question of nonstop television  broadcasts will also be raised. The transportation minister's  visit to Kazakhstan will last three days.</p>

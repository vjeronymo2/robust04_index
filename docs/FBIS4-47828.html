			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 3 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] was revamping its counting procedures overnight  with election results expected to flow again on Wednesday [4  May] morning, the IEC said Tuesday night.    The vote counting was to be accelerated by entering the  total  number of votes recorded at counting stations as the basis for  accumulating national and provincial tallies. This would  replace the old system, which involved the entry into the count  of batches of 2-3000 votes from the counting stations as the  figures came in.    "This changeover will take place during the course of the  night and results will continue to flow during the course of the  morning," the IEC statement said. The commission stressed it  had not stopped counting votes.</p>

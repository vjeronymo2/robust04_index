			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program described by this interim rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.850_Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A Notice of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from coverage under this Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule: (1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceeding before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to facilitate the effective and economical operation of a business enterprise, adequate and reliable financial records must be maintained. Accounting records must provide a clear and accurate picture of current economic conditions from which management can make informed decisions in charting the company's future. The rate regulated environment in which an electric utility operates causes an even greater need for financial information that is accurate, complete, and comparable with that of other electric utilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA, as a federal lender and mortgagee, and in furthering the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act (RE Act)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7 U.S.C. 901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) has a legitimate programmatic interest and a substantial financial interest in requiring adequate records to be maintained. In order to provide REA with financial information that can be analyzed and compared with the operations of other borrowers in the REA program, all REA borrowers must maintain financial records that utilize uniform accounts and uniform accounting policies and procedures. The standard REA security instrument, therefore, requires borrowers to maintain their books, records, and accounts in accordance with methods and principles of accounting prescribed by REA in the USoA for its electric borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that borrowers consistently account for and apply the provisions of recent pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the USoA must be revised and updated as changes in generally accepted accounting principles occur. REA is, therefore, proposing to add two new accounting interpretations to Section 1767.41, Accounting Methods and Procedures Required of All REA Borrowers, that address the accounting requirements recently set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement No. 112), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (Statement No. 115). Statement No. 112 establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement while Statement No. 115 establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities and for investments in equity securities that readily have determinable fair values. Copies of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards may be obtained from the Order Department of the Financial Accounting Standards Board,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116, Norwalk, Connecticut 06856&hyph;5116.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA is also proposing to amend accounting Interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 626, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, to establish the accounting policies and procedures for the Rural Economic Development Grant program recently established by REA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interpretation No. 604, Deferred Compensation, sets forth the specific accounting entries and the balance sheet reporting requirements for participation in the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association's Deferred Compensation Program. Under the terms of this program, a portion of an employee's current salary may be deferred until such time as the employee retires or terminates employment. The employer makes a contribution into the deferred compensation fund in an amount equal to the salary deferred. As such, the borrower records both an asset and a liability_an asset in the amount of the contributions to the fund and a liability to that employee for future payment of the deferred compensation. Current REA procedures require the asset and liability to be offset for financial reporting purposes. Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts, states that the offsetting of assets and liabilities in the balance is improper except where a right of offset exists and a right of offset exists only when each of two parties owes the other determinable amounts. Contributions to the deferred compensation fund are payable to the borrower and, as such, the right of offset does not exist. REA is, therefore, proposing to amend Interpretation No. 604 to comply with generally accepted accounting principles by requiring the asset and liability to be reported separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106). Statement No. 106 requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years in which the employee provides service to the reporting entity. Prior to the issuance of Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the reporting entity in exchange for the benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

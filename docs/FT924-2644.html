			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: Hot seat Spare a thought for poor old Andrew Buxton, the embattled chief executive of Barclays Bank who's supposed to step into the chairman's seat at the end of the month. Not only are the institutions gunning for him, but now one of his former minions, Martin Vander Weyer, is attacking him in the Spectator for inheriting the top job because of his family connections. Buxton is a descendant of a union between Sir Thomas Foxwell Bt and a Miss Gurney of Norwich, and according to the article was passed over for the chairmanship last time round because of his youth. However, it was common gossip in the bank that Sir John Quinton was only supposed to be keeping 'the seat warm for Andrew'. The peculiar hold of members of the bank's founding families on the the top jobs at Barclays has often been commented on. But Vander Weyer is better briefed than most. Until recently he worked at Barclays and his late father, Deryk, was deputy chairman when Sir Timothy Bevan was running the show. It is often said that Sir Deryk, who revolutionised Barclays' marketing, would have made a better chairman than Sir Timothy Bevan, but never had a chance because he wasn't family. No doubt this might have coloured young Vander Weyer's thinking. Even so, if the institutions really are intent on shaking up the Barclays' boardroom they might question whether Sir Timothy really is earning his keep after 26 years on the board.</p>

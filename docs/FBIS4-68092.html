			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 13 May (NA) -- A tear gas grenade  exploded this morning in the Rio de La Plata Building, where the  Japanese Embassy has its offices, in repudiation of the Japanese  refusal to grant a visa to soccer star Diego Maradona. Three  people were injured.    The explosion occurred just after 0830 [1130 GMT] when  embassy employees opened the door to the offices on the 9th  floor.    According to Alberto Crescenti, director general of the SAME  [expansion unknown], the explosion at Paseo Colon 279 caused eye  problems and suffocation to the following: Roberto Blanco;  Carlos Catalano, 23; and Andrea Vousou, 22.    The three were quickly taken by ambulance to the Algerich  Hospital in La Boca District where it was determined that their  injuries were not serious.    Pamphlets with the slogan "Down with Japan, lay off  Maradona," of the Revolutionary Organization (ORP) were found in  the building. This shows that the attack was in reprisal to the  Japanese Government decision to not grant Maradona a visa.  [passage omitted]    One employee told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS: "It is all very  strange because the building has a contracted security  organization in addition to the embassy security guard. Thus it  is very difficult to understand how the grenade could have been  planted in the building." [passage omitted]</p>

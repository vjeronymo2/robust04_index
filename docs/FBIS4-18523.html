			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Center Party secretary Ake </F> Pettersson by Elisabeth Crona; place and date not given]    [Text] "There is every indication that the Center Party  will say yes to the EU [European Union]. And this will be of  great importance for the result of the referendum."    So said Center Party secretary Ake Pettersson on the eve of  the party's extraordinary conference at which he intends to draw  attention to the results of the negotiations in order to achieve  his goal.    He also says yes to a common Nordic referendum day but no to  government collaboration with the Social Democrats after the  election. They are continuing to apply their rigid philosophy.    And the Social Democratic idea of letting the farmers pay  the  EU membership fee is tantamount to shooting themselves in the  foot -- and gives an indication of a Social Democratic  government's plans for new taxes on farmers and small business  owners, Ake Pettersson said in this interview with SVENSKA  DAGBLADET.    He came straight from a meeting of the Center Party's  Farmers  Committee that scrutinized the results from the negotiations in  Brussels. The farmers appear content, and Ake Pettersson spoke  of a very long-term and conscious Europe strategy on the part of  the party leadership.    "From the time of the fall of the Berlin wall, we have taken  a positive view of submitting a membership application and have  created a democratic base for this at our party conferences. We  set out demands to be made in the negotiations in December 1992,  before all the other parties. We chose the ministries --  Environment, Agriculture, Regional Policy -- we now head with an  eye to the EU negotiations. And in the negotiations we have won  an acceptance of the vast majority of our demands. It is  logical that we should follow this up with a yes.    ``We are now entering the most difficult phase. It is of  vital importance that we deal with this question in such a way  that we are still good friends after the decision reached by the  party conference. Note well that the question will be settled  in a referendum. We can have different ideas about whether EU  membership is the right way to achieve the Center Party's goals,  but we do not have differing views on the objectives of Center  Party policy.    ``I am very well aware that there are risks for the Center  Party -- in the form of a split, downright enmity, or the  possibility that people will have no desire to involve  themselves in politics for the sake of the party.''    Ake Pettersson is upset by the media criticism of the Center  Party's approach to the EU:    "We ought instead to enjoy respect for our lengthy  democratic  process," he said, making a comparison with the Social  Democrats' way of dealing with the issue:    "They do not as yet even have a single party conference  decision to seek membership. They are adjourned. And once the  negotiations are completed they will tackle everything at once."    [Crona] Mona Sahlin's remark -- which has been backed by  Goran Persson -- to the effect that the farmers should be  responsible for the EU membership fee runs the risk of pushing  farmers and small businessmen away from voting yes in the  referendum. Surely this cannot have been the Social Democrats'  intention?    "The reality is also that we are discussing Swedish  membership in the context of making our contribution to peace  and achieving more rapid economic development. A 1-percent  increase in GNP will add a further 14 billion per year to the  economy. If half this sum is in the private sector, we will  almost have found the finance for the 9 billion we expect to be  the net cost of membership."    Ake Pettersson rejects following the successful no road of  the Norwegian Center Party as a shortsighted tactic on so  important a future issue. But he takes the view that conditions  in Sweden are different from those in Norway and Finland.    "Norway has a strong factor in its economy -- its oil and  gas  resources. The rest of its industry and commerce is not so  dependent on Europe as Sweden's is, with our emphasis on  engineering and forestry products. And in our working life we  live much closer to companies in other countries because of  Sweden's incredibly comprehensive foreign trade.    ``In Finland's case there is also the dissolution of the  traditional relations between Finland and Russia. It is natural  for many Finns to want to confirm this dissolution with  membership in the EU.''    It was not the Norwegian Storting but the Swedish Center  Party that first proposed a common Nordic referendum day.    "Over the past year this has not been a realistic idea, but  it has become so again. A shared voting day would be a positive  signal of the Nordic identity."    This is necessary, said Ake Pettersson, who listened to the  Nordic Council's recent EU debate with some disappointment. It  is not certain that Nordic cooperation will grow within the EU  -- and it certainly will not do so automatically.    "There is a risk that the positions of the Nordic countries  will diverge, in part because they are in tough competition in  certain areas, as Sweden and Finland are in the field of  forestry products, and Sweden and Denmark in the field of  agricultural produce."    The SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Institute for Market Research poll  into  the Center Party's potential voters is in line with those the  Center Party itself carries out.    "They are about one-third of the electorate, and many of  them  are on the left.    ``This shows that the Center Party plays an important role  for where government power lies in Sweden. Another conclusion  is that the Center Party's current and potential voters feel  strongly in favor of a fair policy on the distribution of  income.''    Ake Pettersson says he understands why the Social Democrats  keep repeating that they want to form a government with one of  the parties of the Center:    "They promise a lot -- tearing things up and tearing things  down. They would like the support of one or more nonsocialist  parties in order to be able -- if they get into government -- to  justify why they are forced to abandon their election promises.  Today they are pursuing an irresponsible economic policy -- one  with very serious consequences for Sweden's future development  -- that they probably do not even believe in themselves.    ``But they hope that it will be viable in the election  campaign. That is why they would like a partner in government on  which they can later blame the difficult economic decisions.''    [Crona] But you do not want this?    "No, we are extremely critical of the Social Democrats  because the party still lives in the midst of the centralist  thinking that is at odds with the whole pattern of developments  today. Reading Anders Sundstrom's remarks (in DAGENS INDUSTRI  recently) was like hearing a speech by Krister Wickman at the  1968 party conference.    ``At present there are so many things in developments that  agree with the Center Party's values. Technological  developments favor small-scaleness, quality, economy with  resources. Sophisticated industrial activities in small  business form can be engaged in far from their markets. This  means that we are getting a new pattern of localization. Take  NK [Nordiska Kompaniet -- major Stockholm department store]!  You see the same building on the outside, but inside you meet  120 small businesses that are very successful. You notice when  you travel by the Silja Line that all services comes from Kalix.  Order a taxi in Stockholm and the reply comes from women on  Ingmarso in the archipelago. SJ [Sweden's state railroad  company] has its service center in Sveg.    ``There are factors other than closeness to the market that  have begun to play a decisive role: access to good training,  good communications, a clean environment, freedom from violence  and crime. This is something we can read from the statistics  today -- in Sweden, Europe, the United States, Japan.    ``In Sweden this means that the rural population is  increasing. It has not done so for 100 years. That is why it  is important that the country has a political leadership that  does not steer Sweden in the opposite direction, that does not  try to rule Sweden with a rigid philosophy and centralism, with  Oresund bridges and Dennis packages.    ``Anders Sundstrom, who is being portrayed as the next  (Social Democratic) industry minister, talks about creating a  centrally controlled committee for industrial development in  Sweden and about developing plans for each branch of industry to  organize industry from above -- a traditionalist and rigid  philosophy.''    According to Ake Pettersson, technological developments also  make it easier for the Center Party to advocate EU membership  today:    "The fears that existed and that were justified in the late  sixties and early seventies are being eliminated largely as a  result of the high-speed, economical, and small-scale technology  that is being developed. Today I am much less worried that  European cooperation will lead to things being concentrated in  certain locations.    ``Closeness to the market is no longer so important. That is  why we have the same -- or better -- potential to engage in  industrial activities in Sweden as people in the environmentally  damaged regions on the European continent.''</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI SOLDIER DIES IN ATTACK BY GAZA CROWD  </P> <P> Palestinian refugees in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip stoned an Israeli  soldier unconscious and set his car on fire, burning him to death, the army  said today.  </P> <P> The soldier had injured two Arab youths in a collision inside the camp  Thursday, sparking a riot.  </P> <P> Israeli authorities immediately declared the Gaza Strip a closed military zone  for two days. The army clamped a curfew on the camp and sent troops in to carry  out house-to-house searches for suspects.  </P> <P> Soldiers ordered all camp residents onto the streets for identity checks.  </P> <P> The reservist, who was not immediately identified, was killed about noon  Thursday as Israel celebrated the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, one of  Judaism's holiest days.  </P> <P> Previous killings of Israelis have ignited fierce anti-Arab riots in Israeli  areas.  </P> <P> The army said the reservist drove a civilian car with Israeli license plates  into Bureij refugee camp by mistake. As he tried to leave the camp, he collided  with a cart driven by two Arab youths, injuring them, the army said.  </P> <P> Hundreds of camp residents gathered around the car and pelted the soldier with  stones, knocking him unconscious. Masked Palestinians set the car on fire and  burned the man to death, witnesses in the camp said.  </P> <P> Army radio said the soldier was armed with an M-16 rifle but apparently did not  use it. Troops who discovered the gutted car found large stones inside.  </P></p>

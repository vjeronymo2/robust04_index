			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profits taken ahead of economic figures Wall Street A three-session rally by US stocks stalled yesterday ahead of a barrage of crucial economic data due out today and tomorrow, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.68 off at 3,875.15 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.32 to 465.47. Declines outscored advances by a slim margin after volume of 270.3m shares. Other indices were slightly ahead, with the Nasdaq composite up 1.43 at 767.00 and the American SE composite adding a scant 0.74 at 458.50. In the absence of fresh economic news and a light flow of corporate results, stocks opened weaker. Profit-takers were taking advantage of share prices inflated by a 101-point advance by the Dow since last Thursday's close. The slight downturn also reflected a modest setback in the bond market. Investors in both markets were keen to see today's data in September producer prices and tomorrow's news on consumer price inflation, retail sales and industrial production. Caution prevailed, though the outlook was generally favourable. None of the data was expected to be particularly troublesome and there was a growing consensus that the Federal Reserve would hold off on any further moves to lift interest rates until next month. Amid such underlying optimism, stocks retraced their steps as the morning progressed and nudged briefly into positive territory late in the afternoon. General Electric, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 1/8 , and United Technologies, Dollars 1 1/4 ahead at Dollars 64, aided the cause. But there was little conviction behind the move upwards, and the index had receded by the close. While there were fewer companies announcing their results, several were giving Wall Street good indication about what was to come. Goodyear Tire, riding high on the strong demand for US cars, said it expected to report improved quarterly earnings. But its estimate failed to impress investors. The stock edged up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 . Farah, an apparel maker, was hammered after forecasting earnings of 15 to 25 cents a share in the three months to November 4, against 42 cents a year earlier. The stock plunged Dollars 2, or 19 per cent, to Dollars 8 5/8 . Among companies actually reporting, Weyerhauser became the second paper and pulp supplier after International Paper to post disappointing results. The stock fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 . CBS shares lost about 2.7 per cent of their value after the media group revealed a decline in net income and revenue. The issue shed Dollars 9 to Dollars 330. In the technology group, International Business Machines stood out after a quiet outing in the previous session, when many of its competitors had appreciated in value. Big Blue rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 73 on favourable comments by Mr Louis Gerstner, its chairman. Advanced Micro Devices was marked down Dollars 1 3/8 to 23 3/8 after a federal court ruled against the company in a lawsuit relating to microchip coding. On the Nasdaq, Intel, which filed the suit, dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 . Elsewhere, computer-related issues were mixed. But Apple, frequently mentioned as a possible strategic partner with IBM, gained Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 42 1/8.</p>

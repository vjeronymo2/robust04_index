			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Stronger US ties spark 73% profits gain at KLM KLM Royal Dutch Airlines saw net profit soar by 73.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1994-95 under the combined influence of cost-cutting and economic recovery in important markets. The quarterly net profit of Fl 354m (Dollars 208m), which compares with Fl 204m a year earlier, led to a near doubling of first-half net profit to Fl 476m from Fl 244m. Profit per share in the first half rose by a more modest 15 per cent to Fl 5.22, because of the 60 per cent expansion of KLM's ordinary share capital in early 1994. KLM also attributed its strong performance to the further deepening of its partnership ties with Northwest Airlines of the US, though Northwest's figures are no longer included in the Dutch carrier's profit and loss account. Turnover rose by 6.2 per cent to Fl 2.55bn, outstripping a 2.8 per cent increase in operating costs to Fl 2.17bn. KLM's shares rose from Fl 47.30 to Fl 48 yesterday in response to the results. KLM has introduced a wage freeze for the calendar year 1994, and the airline is also benefiting significantly from a pension premium 'holiday' agreed with the company's three pension funds in 1993. The productivity gains and strict cost controls enabled it to cut unit costs by 5 per cent. Overall traffic, including passengers, cargo and post, rose by 9 per cent in the quarter, which covers the busy summer holiday months from July to September. Capacity rose by 6 per cent, enabling KLM to lift its load factor by 1.7 percentage points to 77.1 per cent. In passenger traffic, yields remained stable, in contrast to previous quarters when yields were under pressure. But cargo yields fell by 5 per cent. KLM said the upward trend was expected to continue in the second half, provided the general economic climate continues to improve. However, the pace of the improvement will be slower than in the second half of last year, when losses narrowed sharply to Fl 141m from Fl 770m a year earlier. KLM's financial year ends on March 31.</p>

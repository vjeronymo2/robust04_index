			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Criminals Involved in Xiji's Armed Gang Fights </F> Punished"]    [Text] A case of armed gang fights in the Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Region's Xiji County was examined in open trial by  the Guyuan Prefecture Intermediate People's Court, and court  judgments were made in accordance with the law on 3 and 6  February. During the legal time limit, the defendants did not  appeal to the higher court, and the procuratorial organs did not  disagree with the court's judgments. Accordingly, the verdicts  became effective on 19 February.    Criminal Ma Liesun was the vice chairman of the Ningxia  Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and a member of the Standing  Committee of the CPPCC National Committee before he was  arrested. Criminal Ma Fuli was an associate professor at the  Ningxia Education College and criminal Ma Jie was a lecturer at  the Northwest No 2 Nationalities Institute before their arrests.  Criminal Ma Rucheng was a peasant in Xiazhai Township of Xiji  County before he was arrested. Since May 1992, Ma Liesun, Ma  Rucheng, Ma Fuli, Ma Jie, joined others in repeatedly organizing  gang fights and revenge attacks in Xiji County of Ningxia  despite repeated warnings from the party and government. They  trampled upon state laws and ignored the safety of the people.  As a result, 49 people died, two disappeared, and 30 were  wounded. To prepare for the gang fights, they unlawfully  manufactured and bought guns and ammunition. After the fights,  a total of 5,442 guns (of which 2 were for military use), 7,362  bullets of various kinds (of which 310 were for military use),  21 privately made cannons, and 118 privately made shells and  bombs were confiscated from the two sides involved in the  dispute.    The evidence mentioned above was sufficient and proven, and  the defendants pleaded guilty.    The acts of these criminals seriously violated Articles 137,  132, and 112 of the "Criminal Law of the People's Republic of  China," and constituted the crimes of murder with intent and the  illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition. To  safeguard the authority of the law and to protect the safety of  the people's lives and property, Ma Liesun was punished  according to the law for murder with intent and the illegal  manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting  armed gang fights, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, and  was deprived of his political rights for four years. Ma Fuli  was punished for murder with intent and the illegal manufacture  and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing, and  commanding armed gang fights, was sentenced to life  imprisonment, and was deprived of his political rights for life.  Ma Jie was punished for murder with intent and the illegal  manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition in plotting,  organizing, and commanding armed gang fights, was sentenced to  20 years' imprisonment, and was deprived of his political rights  for five years. Ma Rucheng was punished for murder with intent  and the illegal manufacture and purchase of guns and ammunition  in plotting, organizing, and commanding armed gang fights, was  sentenced to life imprisonment, and was deprived of his  political rights for life. Of the 19 other criminals involved  in the case, 18 were sentenced to three to 14 years behind bars,  and one was not given criminal punishment.</p>

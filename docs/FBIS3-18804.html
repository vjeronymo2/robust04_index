			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic  Party) has said that the figures published by the Federal  Statistical Office have confirmed the government's economic  expectations. It is now "more than mere hope" that housing  construction and exports will contribute to a recovery of the  economy. A decline of the inflation rate below 3 percent in the  course of the year is also "within reach." Rexrodt demanded  that the "path of moderate wage settlements and of the  consolidation of the budget should be continued." This would  make possible further interest rate reductions.</p>

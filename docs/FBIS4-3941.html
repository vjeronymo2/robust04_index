			<p>BFN     [Text] On 5 April, the provincial party committee convened  a rural work meeting in Guiyang, at which Chen Shineng,  provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial  governor, relayed the spirit of a central rural work meeting  held in late March of this year, and Provincial Party Committee  Secretary Liu Fangren delivered an important speech entitled  "Strengthen Leadership, Firmly Grasp Implementation, Make Every  Possible Endeavor To Reap a Good Agricultural Harvest in 1994."    Secretary Liu Fangren's speech was divided into three parts:    1. To profoundly understand the great importance of this  year's agricultural and rural work;    2. To successfully accomplish this year's basic agricultural  and rural work tasks;    3. To further strengthen party leadership over agricultural  and rural work.    Secretary Liu Fangren said in his speech: Ever since the  last rural work meeting held by the provincial party committee  in late February of this year, all areas across the province  have accomplished a great deal and have scored gratifying  results in respect of implementing the spirit of the last  central rural work meeting and the spirit of the last provincial  party committee rural work meeting. In general, the province's  rural situation has remained excellent. Nonetheless, we have  not yet fulfilled all agricultural and rural tasks, satisfied  all agricultural and rural demands, or implemented to the letter  all agricultural and rural policies.    We are still confronted with a difficult situation in this  regard and with such thorny problems as increasingly high prices  for agricultural production means, slow growth of summer crops,  lack of agricultural funds and loans, slow increase of peasant  income, and so on. Should these thorny problems fail to be  resolved, the province's overall agricultural and rural  situation would be adversely affected. In view of this  situation, party committees and governments at all levels in the  province should bravely stand up to difficulties, strengthen  confidence, proceed from the overall interests of party work,  conscientiously implement to the letter all basic central  principles concerning this year's agricultural and rural work,  profoundly understand the great importance of successful  agricultural and rural work in 1994, and properly handle the  strategic relations between reform, development, and stability.    They must expand contacts with the outside world and with  the  provinces and regions to the east, ensure a sufficient food  supply, emancipate the mind in a down-to-earth manner, implement  to the letter each and every central and provincial agricultural  and rural policy, stabilize the grain growing area, and raise  the per unit area yield of grain and total grain output. They  should step up wheat field management in the latter half of this  year's wheat growing season, successfully nurse rice seedlings  in hothouses, under plastic films, and in two stages, develop  and transplant more maize strains with more nutrition, take  steps to protect more than one million mu of high-yield rice and  maize fields from excessive rainfall in spring and summer, turn  more dry land into irrigated farmland as soon as possible, and  make every possible effort to increase income on the part of the  peasants by boosting diversified economic growth.    Secretary Liu Fangren noted: This year, we should strive to  raise the peasants per capita net income by 60 yuan over last  year on average throughout the province, by more than 80 yuan in  better- off areas where conditions permit, and by more than 50  yuan in poverty-stricken areas. Approximately 10 million people  currently lack food and clothing across the province. In view  of this situation, we should provide more assistance to and help  poverty- stricken areas successfully shake off poverty, work out  a new plan aimed at assisting poverty-stricken areas, carry out  scientific farming, vigorously build a batch of pillar  industries, energetically build infrastructure facilities, push  ahead with education development in poverty-stricken areas, and  enable poverty- stricken areas shake off poverty as soon as  possible.    Secretary Liu Fangren asserted: We should closely combine  four types of work, specifically, family planning, economic  exploitation of poverty-stricken areas, assistance to  poverty-stricken areas, and spring plowing production. We  should unswervingly carry out these four types of work in a  down-to-earth manner and make unreserved efforts to keep the  province's natural population growth rate at and below 14 per  thousand this year. We should successfully build grassroots  organizations in rural areas and ensure rural economic  development with political and organizational guarantees.    Secretary Liu Fangren urged all areas across the province to  strengthen party leadership over agricultural and rural work.  To this end, he stressed, prefectural, autonomous prefectural,  and county party committees should put more energy toward  agricultural work, earnestly improve work style, provide  agricultural production with better services, and institute a  responsibility system under which party and government leaders  at all levels are held fully responsible for agricultural and  rural work and are assessed in light of local agricultural and  rural work achievements. The party committees at all levels  across the province should also organize broad masses of cadres  and people to set off a spring plowing upsurge at once and  concentrate efforts, time, and human resources on spring plowing  production over the next two months with a view to successfully  winding up spring plowing production before the summer solstice.    A number of provincial party and government leaders,  including Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Li Wanlu, Xia Guohua, Huang  Yao, Hu Tiansheng, Wang Anze, Gong Xianyong, Mo Shiren, and Zhu  Yaoguo, attended the rural work meeting, at which the province's  prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party and  government leaders summed up and exchanged experiences of  implementing the spirit of the last provincial party committee  rural work meeting.</p>

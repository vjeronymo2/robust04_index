			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Kunick tries to stop shares slide Kunick, the amusement machine and nursing home group, yesterday tried to stop the slide in its share price by announcing there has been no change of circumstances since the company released its most recent profits warning two weeks ago. The shares, which have been under pressure since last October, fell from 8p to 6.25p earlier this week. Yesterday they closed unchanged at 6.5p. The company appears to be suffering from a general loss of institutional support following its warning that interim profits to end-March will be 'substantially below' the Pounds 7.3m last time.</p>

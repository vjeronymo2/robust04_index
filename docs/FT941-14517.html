			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Retail activity was subdued over Christmas A disappointing rise in Christmas retail sales, revealed in official figures yesterday, indicated that consumer activity was more subdued than anecdotal evidence from stores and shops suggests. Last month the volume of sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent compared with November, although it was 4 per cent higher than in December 1992. The year-on-year rate disappointed expectations for a 5.2 per cent increase, particularly since sales in the previous Christmas period were poor. Nonetheless, this was the biggest rise since July last year. The news from the Central Statistical Office of the monthly fall in sales came as a surprise following a report earlier this week from the Confederation of British Industry, which painted a more upbeat picture of the Christmas trading period. Statisticians pointed out, however, that the CBI gave only the year-on-year increase in sales, and that its figures were similar to the official series on a month-on-month basis. Anecdotal evidence of booming Christmas sales has further muddied the picture, but this has come from the large chain stores which account for two-thirds of retail sales. They are more easily able to hold down prices and are therefore faring much better than smaller shops. The most up-to-date figures confirm that on a year-on-year basis big retailers are significantly outperforming small ones. The volume of sales by small businesses in November fell 0.2 per cent compared with a year ago while large retailers increased their sales by 5.8 per cent in the same period. The latest dip in retail sales may prompt unease in the government that consumer spending will weaken significantly when Budget tax increases come into effect in the spring. Viewed over three months, however, there is a clear upward trend in volume of sales growth. In the three months to December sales volume was 0.7 per cent higher then in the previous three months, and 3.7 per cent up on the same period a year earlier. Based on non-seasonally adjusted data, the average weekly value of retail sales last month was Pounds 3.7bn, 5.9 per cent higher than in December 1992. The strongest growth in the latest three months has been in sales by mixed businesses, a category that includes department stores. Sales volume was up 1.6 per cent in the three months to December compared with the previous three months. For food retailers and specialist non-food retailers the rises were 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Figures released by CSO also show that sales volume was 3.6 per cent higher last year than in 1992. This was the biggest increase since 1988 when the increase, compared with 1987 was 6.2 per cent. Consumers bought Pounds 5.4bn worth of goods and services using credit and debit cards in December, according to the Credit Card Research Group, funded by the credit card industry, Alison Smith writes. Debit card spending was much higher at food and drinks retailers than credit card spending, while the positions were reversed at gift stores.</p>

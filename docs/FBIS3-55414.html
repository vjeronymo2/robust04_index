The U.S. President Has Quite  a Lot of Things To Do in Europe -- Beginning With Deciding  Whether To Open the Doors to NATO Membership for All Who Want To  Enter and Ending With an Impromptu Meeting With the Ukrainian  President"]    [Text] Moscow -- The special booklet carefully produced in  Washington for those members of the U.S. press bound for the  summit meeting in Moscow points out that Russia is a cold  country where survival in winter is hard and where furthermore  crime is to be feared and rides in "private taxis" are to be  avoided. Among the plus points it lists "the likelihood of  moderate prices for souvenirs if you pay in dollars." I would  dispute that point: Prices in Moscow today, both in general and  in particular, have outstripped those in America, despite the  fact that the country is falling apart before our very eyes.    The present meeting between the two leaders is a jubilee  one,  the 25th since Khrushchev's time. But in terms of meetings  between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, it is the second and is  surely once more akin to a "leap into the unknown." In  Vancouver their discussion took place on the eve of the April  referendum after a week of feverish thought in Washington about  whether there was any point in meeting "on the eve of  uncertainty." The situation is also quite tricky after the  December elections in Russia. I am bound to agree with Brent  Scowcroft, Bush's former national security adviser, who remarked  that if this visit had not been planned long ago Clinton would  surely not now have wanted to make the trip but would have  waited for the dust to settle and for relations between Yeltsin  and Zhirinovskiy to become clear. As for Vladimir Volfovich,  the U.S. President has already decided not to meet with him for  the moment, although during the visit he may demonstrate his  sympathies for reformers not only of the pro-Yeltsin type.    Meanwhile during the visit the U.S. President will clearly  have to try to convince his own fellow countrymen that, even if  America does not have a clear concept of its relations with  Russia today, it is at least working on one. That criticism has  been expressed increasingly loudly lately, along with barbs  aimed at the secretary of state, who is increasingly loudly  being called "sluggish" and "irresolute" in the United States.  Meanwhile the accusations that the U.S. Administration's course  is unclear are being countered by the thesis that it is not only  America but also international financial institutions which  should respond more clearly and promptly to the social reforms  in Russia -- in the sense of providing Western aid. On the  subject of Western aid, Russia has so far not received even the  amount that it was promised. For example, the $5.5 billion  which the IMF proposed giving us is still in doubt. Since 1992  Russia has received $2.5 billion. The rest will be paid only if  the IMF considers that we will fulfill the agreed conditions.    Clinton's team believes that this is right, while at the IMF  the rate of inflation and the imbalance in the money system are  giving rise to definite doubts. In this connection two IMF  missions will come to Russia to work in January. If they  believe that the government does have concrete and durable  remedies for stabilizing the economy they will "release" a  further $1.5 billion to us and will make recommendations on  social aid to citizens who have suffered during the economic  reforms.    According to information in BUSINESS WEEK, the U.S.  President is considering offering his Russian counterpart a  further $1 billion for items of expenditure in the new budget in  1994. He will also focus attention on the theme of creating a  social safety net in Russia -- I do not rule out the possibility  of technical assistance in elaborating it -- relating to a  system of unemployment benefits, food subsidies, and so forth.    During the visit there will probably be an announcement of a  joint Russian-U.S. project aimed at prospecting and opening up  oil fields in West Siberia and on Sakhalin. U.S. oil and gas  companies are planning to set aside $3.4 billion for this  purpose -- meanwhile U.S. investments in Russia stand at $400  million today.    I would recall here that the two presidents will also give  their formal blessing to a whole series of agreements concluded  in Moscow during U.S. Vice President Gore's visit -- agreements  on space, on ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors, and on new  norms for foreign investments.    The U.S. President will spend four hours in Minsk -- as a  mark of gratitude for Belarus' constructive stance on the  question of scrapping nuclear missiles. As for a meeting with  the Ukrainian leader, after rumors that Clinton had invited him  to Moscow earlier than Yeltsin a statement was made on an  agreement to hold a meeting of the three presidents in Moscow.  On 12 December the U.S. visitor will probably stop off at  [Kiev's] "Borispol" airport.    The U.S. first lady and her daughter will join the President  on Friday after spending a few days in Europe.    Here is one more fact: Several days ago, before New Year,  the U.S. President visited his native state of Arkansas and with  a laugh showed the whole country the "family" shorts given to  him for his morning jog by the people of his state. Last  Thursday Bill Clinton had to return to his home state,  unfortunately for a very solemn occasion -- in connection with  the death of his mother. But one of the drawbacks to the  President's work is that even personal tragedies do not cause  state visits to be canceled.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALSH;  </P> <P> 49ER COACH IS A WALL OF KNOWLEDGE; FEW SEE HIS OTHER SIDE  </P> <P> Bill Walsh, you've just won your third Super Bowl in the 1980s, sealing your  fate as destiny's child and one of the greatest coaches ever.  </P> <P> You've won 102 games in 10 years with the San Francisco 49ers, all the while  speaking eloquently about fine wines and wide receivers.  </P> <P> You dress smartly, have a mean topspin forehand and can recite the Dred Scott  decision in three languages.  </P> <P> Bill Walsh, you've done it all, and so much better than the rest. So what are  you going to do now?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Honestly, I'll probably take all this frustration out on the media.  </P> <P> Those who have watched and writhed with Walsh over the years can see it coming  -- an opportunity fatter than a roundhouse punch -- should his 49ers slip past  the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII Sunday.  </P> <P> One more victory may trigger a final sunset ride out of town for Walsh on his  high horse, since good will have triumphed over evil in the harsh football  world Walsh has lived and/or imagined.  </P> <P> Walsh, they say, is as gracious a loser as you'll ever know. And an equally  horrible winner, like the field general once described by Winston Churchill as  being "in defeat unbeatable, in victory unbearable."  </P> <P> Never has that been more the case than in the 1988 season, in which Walsh has  used personal setbacks and team controversies to rekindle a Super Bowl fire,  with Walsh perhaps serving as team arsonist.  </P> <P> Leading the charge, Walsh has jumped his team over a season's barriers, whether  real and imagined. It began with his demotion as club president in March and  continued through a quarterback controversy that he insists was invented by  reporters.  </P> <P> It provided enough fuel to get his team over the rough spots, none knottier  than a Nov. 13 loss to the Raiders that dropped the 49ers to 6-5 for the  season.  </P> <P> "He probably had never sunk so low as after the loss to the Raiders," said Mike  White, a former coach at California and Illinois who is probably Walsh's  closest friend.  </P> <P> Since hitting the comeback trail, though, Walsh has been relentless, lashing  out after every obstacle is cleared on the way to Super Bowl XXIII. His recent  news conferences have become personal and well-crafted attacks against local  reporters, blaming them for turning the Steve Young-Joe Montana controversy  into the straw that nearly broke a team's comeback. You wonder how a team ever  made it this far.  </P> <P> Walsh had clearly defined the opponents.  </P> <P> "You might get that kind of feeling, that it's always Bill against the world,"  said Jim Finks, general manager of the New Orleans Saints. "He does have that  image."  </P> <P> Yet, it was a quarterback controversy, local reporters insist, that was created  and fanned by Walsh himself, in a calculated effort to push an aging Montana to  new heights.  </P> <P> When it backfired, and Montana was finally reinstated as the starter after  reluctantly sitting out 2 games, Walsh needed an alibi. So he wrapped Montana  neatly in a cloak of illness and injury, insisting that he had been benched for  health reasons. Montana denies to this day that he was ever injured or  fatigued.  </P> <P> Walsh, though, has stayed with that story. Before a season-ending game with the  Rams, after the 49er recovery was complete, Walsh lamented about the travails  of Montana and how injury had been misconstrued as controversy.  </P> <P> "To be honest with you, a lot of people doing the criticism knew full well what  the problems were," Walsh said. "They knew Joe had had major back surgery (in  1986), that he'd lost 10 pounds and was weakened. Even in his appearance, it  was very obvious.  </P> <P> "Still, certain people in our press made a big issue of the fact that Joe  wasn't playing and did everything to convince people that I was confused as to  what I was doing as a coach.  </P> <P> "The quarterback controversy, I feel, was ill-conceived and unfair to a lot of  people, but we've gotten through it and we're on our way."  </P> <P> And so they were, though sometimes it seemed like Walsh against the world. In  his news conference before the NFC title game against the Bears, Walsh  valiantly defended his record, as if anyone had questioned it.  </P> <P> "We're not going to be easy," said Walsh, who then listed his impressive  accomplishments. "There's a lot positives about this football team. I'm not  sure you want to hear it . . . 2 Super Bowls, 6 divisions . . . not bad."  </P> <P> So the question is: Just who is Bill Walsh and what does he want? At 57, he  seems ready to tie a ribbon on a brilliant coaching career. Most think he'll  call it quits if his team wins Sunday.  </P> <P> But for a man who has so precious little to prove, Walsh seems bent on proving  it over and over, to whomever will listen. He has long been a mysterious nut to  crack, followers say, mainly because he won't let you get close enough with a  cracker. He has a few close friends but generally stays a healthy distance from  players and coaches.  </P> <P> Earlier this season, when Montana was struggling and mystified over his  demotion, a reporter suggested that the quarterback meet with Walsh to clear  the air. Montana said it wouldn't make any difference, not even after a 10-year  player-coach relationship.  </P> <P> White said it's not uncommon for Walsh to go months at a time without speaking  to one of his coaches. It happened to White 10 years ago, as a 49er assistant  coach.  </P> <P> "For some reason, Bill has developed that style," White said. "And it's a  natural barrier. You know, great leaders are respected but not always invited  to dinner."  </P> <P> Keeping your distance also makes it easier to administer, especially for one so  hands-on as Walsh, who has full command of football operation.  </P> <P> As a player, backup quarterback Steve Young has grown to admire Walsh's  football genius, while walking gingerly in his coach's footsteps.  </P> <P> "He doesn't talk a lot to quarterbacks," Young said. "I think he expects  perfection, and you know that, and he drives you to play well enough just to  get a nod. It's like, you think you're playing pretty well, and it's like, ah,  I think he nodded at me. I think I almost saw some reaction. I take that as  positive."  </P> <P> But if it takes fear to be motivated, Young says he doesn't mind.  </P> <P> "He somehow gets you on edge," he said. "You feel you're always on edge. I get  the feeling he's staring at me every play, you know, and I'm saying, 'OK, I'll  do better. I promise.' I think he's driven me by whatever he's done. Or maybe  I've just imagined it, but I keep working hard. Trying to impress him, I think,  is the ultimate goal."  </P> <P> So Walsh isn't a player's coach so much as a coach who makes great players.  </P> <P> Yet for all his successes, some insist that Walsh will ultimately leave the  game unfulfilled, unhappy and under-appreciated.  </P> <P> Some contend that Walsh can hold a grudge with the best of them and may be  doing so now. Does he still resent not landing an NFL head-coaching job until  he was 47? He seems a paradox, a man who wraps himself in his scholarly image  -- the connoisseur of fine wine and history -- yet is much more a football  workaholic than he lets on.  </P> <P> Walsh wrote his master's thesis on defensive football.  </P> <P> "He's a lot more like Mike Ditka than Arthur Schlesinger," said Ira Miller, a  Bay Area sportswriter who has covered Walsh for nearly 10 years.  </P> <P> So what does Bill Walsh want? More respect than he has? More titles? Why the  100-pound chip on the shoulder?  </P> <P> During an interview session last week in Santa Clara, Calif., Walsh was asked  if he had fulfilled every goal in his coaching career.  </P> <P> "Oh sure," Walsh said. "Of course, some of you (reporters) haven't agreed every  week. But my offense is updated. I know it's been outdated, as you've indicated  every other week. . . . I'm kidding. It's been very good, I'm pleased,  gratified."  </P> <P> Are you sure?  </P> <P> It doesn't take a read-between-the-lines reader to detect something missing on  Walsh's gratitude meter.  </P> <P> "He's a sensitive guy," White said. "And I know there hasn't been the  appreciation for what he's done. I've never heard him verbalize it, that it's  the press' fault. But he's never felt the Bay Area press or the people have  been as supportive. He's never said it to me, but he's said it in other ways."  </P> <P> During his visit to Chicago for the NFC title game, Walsh remarked to friends  how much excitement there seemed to be about the Bears in Chicago, as if that  feeling were somehow foreign to San Franciscans.  </P> <P> Also, Walsh reportedly was hurt that more attention wasn't given his 100th pro  victory (including playoffs), recorded 3 weeks ago in the first-round playoff  win over Minnesota.  </P> <P> Walsh seems to absorb the hurt before channeling it into high football energy.  Always another hurdle to climb.  </P> <P> Nothing wounded Walsh more than his demotion last off-season as club president.  The edict was handed down by owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. -- who assumed the  duties of president -- after the 49ers, who had won Super Bowl XIX in 1984,  were bounced out in the first round for the third consecutive season. DeBartolo  and Walsh didn't speak for 6 weeks after the 49ers' 36-24 playoff loss to the  Vikings.  </P> <P> The demotion stripped Walsh of his title, yes, but not his actual powers. The  stripping of Walsh's dignity was another matter.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us realize how that Minnesota game affected him and the  organization," White said. "We know how it affected Eddie. I don't know if it  was the taking away of the president title that has made (Walsh) even more  motivated than ever to prove once and for all how solid that organization was.  When it was sliding, when he was really down, that's when he really took  charge."  </P> <P> Walsh was stung again on March 22, 1988, when a local gossip columnist hinted  at an alleged affair between Walsh and a local model.  </P> <P> "What genius coach is being put on waivers by his wife for his long-running  relationship with a TV sports reporter who's a former Playboy centerfold?" the  item teased.  </P> <P> Walsh had been separated from his wife, Geri.  </P> <P> Though the story was never explored further or substantiated, some believe that  Walsh has been taking it out on reporters ever since.  </P> <P> "It hurt him a lot," White said of the report.  </P> <P> Walsh believes he deserves better, considering the riches he has brought to the  Bay Area since his arrival in 1979. There have been no mysteries about Walsh on  the field; no questions or quandaries. Walsh took over a team that won 2 games  in 1978 and had only 2 losing seasons -- 2-14 and 6-10 -- before bringing a  Super Bowl championship to San Francisco after the 1981 season.  </P> <P> His team is the winningest in the 1980s, with only 2 losing seasons in the  decade -- 6-10 in 1980 and 3-6 in 1982.  </P> <P> More remarkable to observers has been the high level of consistency, even  through the non-Super Bowl years. Walsh enters Sunday's game with only five  players who participated in his first Super Bowl win. Thirty players on this  year's team weren't around in the 1984 season, when the 49ers defeated Miami in  Super Bowl XIX.  </P> <P> Yet, since the last Super Bowl trip, Walsh's teams have posted records of 10-6,  10-5-1, and 13-2.  </P> <P> "That's very hard to do," said Finks, who has built strong franchises in  Minnesota, Chicago and now New Orleans. "It's the way the (draft) system is.  You're penalized by success. He's done an excellent job at refueling the club.  He's done as good a job as anyone's ever done in the business."  </P> <P> And the 49ers are all Bill Walsh. He orchestrates his team's yearly player  drafts, makes all personnel decisions and coaches a little on the side.  </P> <P> In 1985, Walsh traded draft choices to New England for the right to move up and  take wide receiver Jerry Rice. Not a bad pick.  </P> <P> In 1986, Walsh took defensive end Larry Roberts in the second round, fullback  Tom Rathman and cornerback Tim McKyer in the third, linebacker Charles Haley,  offensive linemen Steve Wallace and Kevin Fagan in the fourth and corner Don  Griffin in the sixth round.  </P> <P> You'll hear more from those players Sunday. In 1987, he drafted starting tackle  Harris Barton. This year, second-round defensive picks, ends Pierce Holt and  Danny Stubbs, have been big contributors, as has a third-round linebacker, Bill  Romanowski.  </P> <P> Walsh has succeeded, he says, because his owner has kept his nose out of  Walsh's business -- with the exception of one aforementioned,  nameplate-removing outburst.  </P> <P> "The bottom line of it all is that Ed DeBartolo has given me the responsibility  of doing it," Walsh said. "A lot of organizations will stop and start pointing  fingers at each other. They blame each other, and before long, no one will make  a decision. No one will step forward."  </P> <P> Bill Walsh has stepped forward. Now he wants to be counted, though he is widely  recognized as a coach with few peers.  </P> <P> "I sharpened my skills being around him, almost just by accident," White said.  </P> <P> Walsh's expertise is in quickly dissecting an opponent and constructing a  visionary game plan to exploit weaknesses. You have no doubt heard that the  first 25 plays of a Walsh game plan are scripted in advance.  </P> <P> There are complicated explanations of Walsh's gift, and one other offered by  quarterback Young.  </P> <P> "No one's going to pull anything over on Bill Walsh," he said. "There's no  way."  </P> <P> Walsh studied in some fine finishing schools, but no time was more important  than 8 years spent under Paul Brown with the Cincinnati Bengals.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone is more creative," White said of Walsh. "As far as  executing a game plan on game day, there's no one I respect more. . . . I think  he's very intelligent. I don't know what his IQ is, but all you can do is learn  by being around him, almost by osmosis. I marvel how he uses Rice and (Roger)  Craig, the way he utilizes what he's got."  </P> <P> White says Bill Walsh is really quite a guy, if you'd only take the time to get  to know him. Of course, some might add, who has that much time?  </P></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Clinton pledges trade initiatives: Approval of Nafta hailed as boost for Gatt talks A JUBILANT US president Bill Clinton arrived in Seattle for his Asian summit yesterday on the wings of a famous victory in Congress, and promising new initiatives to liberalise world trade. His mission, he said, was to drive down world trade barriers as a spur to US economic revival. Earlier, Mr Clinton declared from the White House lawn that the House of Representatives' approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement was 'a long step in the right direction' of more open markets and more vigorous international competition. The Nafta vote gave the US 'the economic, political and moral standing' to make its case, he said, not only with the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group but also in the push for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Mr Clinton's optimism was echoed by trade officials in Europe who said the Nafta vote had improved the chances of an agreement on trade liberalisation measures under the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the December 15 deadline. Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, said: 'There is no negotiator in Geneva today who isn't breathing a sigh of relief as a result of the vote.' The Nafta debate had cast a shadow over Gatt talks for several weeks, tying US negotiators' hands even though time was perilously short. It is now hoped that talks next week in Washington between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner, will give long-awaited impetus to the negotiations. The US Senate is expected to approve Nafta next week, as is its Mexican counterpart. Mr Clinton said President Salinas had invited US vice-president Al Gore for the Mexican side of the ratification process. The new trading bloc, which includes Canada, is to take effect on January 1. The House victory, on a vote of 234-200, was far more comfortable than had appeared likely even as the House debated the agreement. The majority was composed of 132 of the 175 Republicans and 102 of the 258 Democrats, with the sole independent voting against. Yesterday, Mr Clinton thanked all who had voted in favour of Nafta and hoped that the bipartisan spirit that had carried the day could be applied to other great issues facing the US, such as healthcare reform. The president also went to great lengths to compliment the opposition and to heal the open wounds in his especially with organised labour. Trade union leaders remained unmollified. The full hierarchy of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation, held a press conference to express regret at Nafta's passage. Mr Bill Bywater, head of the electricians, warned those Democrats who voted in favour: 'We're going to make sure we get even at the polls.' Mr Owen Bieber, of the car workers, said Senate votes next week would be duly noticed, too. Mr Ross Perot, a loser in the Nafta debate, also threatened retaliation by his independent movement. US stocks fell after investors took the Nafta vote as a signal to take profits. The Dow closed off 19.01 points at 3,685.34. In Geneva, Mr Sutherland, at a briefing to underline trade liberalising moves that have already been provisionally agreed, warned of difficulties ahead. He said: 'The overall picture is heartening, but there are still significant difficulties in bringing the round to a conclusion.' In Brussels, Sir Leon said the vote would remove a big distraction for the US and allow a final drive for a Gatt agreement.

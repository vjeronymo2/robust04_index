			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 11 May (MENA)--Major General Nasr Yusuf,  director general of the Palestinian National Security Forces,  has announced that the first group of these forces entered the  Gaza Strip yesterday via the Egyptian border crossing point at  Rafah. He added that 7,000 Palestinian policemen will enter  Gaza over the next three weeks, including the 'Ayn Jalut Forces  from Egypt, the forces now in Yemen who will travel via Saudi  Arabia, and later the forces currently stationed in Libya and  Sudan.    He explained that at the same time the Badr Forces,  currently  in Jordan, and al-Aqsa Forces, currently in Iraq, will enter the  West Bank via the Allenby Bridge, where they will join 2,000  policemen already residing in Gaza and Jericho.    The director general of the Palestinian National Security  Forces affirmed that there is a sufficient number of policemen  involved to deploy them in the autonomy area and maintain  security there. He noted, however, that the Palestinian police  apparatus needs international assistance to cover the cost of  equipment.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that the role of these policemen is to  maintain peace and order, guarantee democratic freedoms, and  protect people of all political affiliations, taking into  account the need to use methods of persuasion, discussion,  dialogue, and democracy.    Marwan Kanafani, official spokesman for Palestinian  President  Yasir 'Arafat, announced that several Palestinian, Israeli,  Egyptian, and Jordanian joint committees are discussing the  return of the Palestinians who left their homes after the 1967  war, as outlined in the Oslo Agreement.    Kanafani urged that all Palestinian detainees, regardless of  their political affiliations or whether they support or oppose  the autonomy agreement, be released. He called for the  repatriation of all Palestinian deportees.    He pointed out that a Palestinian passport will be issued to  every citizen to be used when entering of leaving the country.    Kanafani explained that the delay in the entry of some  Palestinian police forces was caused by the Yemeni civil war,  the air blockade of Libya, and several procedural problems  connected with the size of the forces, their equipment and  weapons, and the need to sort out all political, military,  financial, and administrative arrangements pertaining to the  deployment of these forces. He said many of these problems had  been solved with the help of the Egyptian brothers. He urged  all Arab countries to facilitate transportation for these forces.    He added that the families of the Palestinian policemen will  enter the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho in several stages  after this issue is discussed with the Israeli authorities and  after amenities such as housing and schools are provided for  them.</p>

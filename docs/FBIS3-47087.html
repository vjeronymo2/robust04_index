			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry will  test launch two prototypes of next generation ultra-high-speed  freighters as soon as construction is completed, ministry  sources said Saturday [8 January].    The freighters, dubbed as Techno Super Liner (TSL), which  can  sail at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour with a cruising range  of some 1,000 kilometers, will be completed in June and March  respectively, the sources said.    The two types of TSL -- a hovercraft freighter and a  hydrofoil freighter -- will be capable of delivering 1,000-ton  cargoes from Tokyo to the major islands of Hokkaido and Kyushu  in half a day, they added.    The 1,590-ton prototype of the hovercraft freighter measures  70 meters by 18 meters. This is half the size of the projected  freighter to be commissioned in the mid or late 1990s, they said.    The 30-ton prototype of the hydrofoil freighter measures 17  meters by 6 meters. This is one-sixth of the size of the  projected freighter, to be commissioned around the same time.    The sources characterize the TSL as a cargo shinkansen  bullet  line that runs through the sea.    More than 10 prefectures, including Hokkaido, Aomori and  Kagoshima, have already asked the ministry to designate them as  major ports of call for the TSL.    The hovercraft freighter will be tested in Tokyo Bay  immediately after its completion in late June.    It is now being manufactured as a joint project between the  ministry, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the sources said.    The hydrofoil freighter, manufactured by another  ministry-commissioned group of five major shipbuilders, led by  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., will be tested in Osaka Bay  after its completion in late March, they said.    If the project is commercialized and there is sufficient  demand for the service it would give a boost to the shipping  industry, as the freighters could deliver a greater volume of  cargo than trucks or planes. Both freighters cost more than 15  billion yen.    It is expected among industry circles that the completion of  the two types of freighters might make it possible to deliver  cargo from Tokyo to Asia's newly industrializing countries in a  day or two, at one-tenth the cost charged by conventional  container vessels.</p>

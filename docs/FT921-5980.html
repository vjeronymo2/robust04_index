			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Serious signs of the times - Radio MICHAEL BUERK, lately the BBC's Southern Africa correspondent, has begun a new Sunday series on Radio 4, Africa, Deadline for the Dark Continent. He begins at Africa's, perhaps the world's, most disturbed place, Somalia. His account of life in Mogadishu - little food, little medicine, and the relief convoys robbed by the so-called police - was appalling. Each local warlord is at war with others; there are freelance killers, with seemingly endless weapons. You must have arms, or looters may come to your house and fire a rocket-launcher through the door. Help is provided by Belgians, Irish, Italians and others, but they have no stores. Buerk hopes for Western intervention, but Somali 'leaders' not. 'This is only a conflict of tribes,' we are told. A wiser man reckoned, 'The colonialists left too soon; we were not ready to understand what a nation is.' By chance, in the last of his stimulating Radio 3 series, Bryan Magee, considering Nationalism and the Melting Pot Myth, came to a like conclusion; he quoted Dag Hammerskold in the Congo operations, 'They are not ready for it.' Radio 3 began its 'Chekhov and After' season on Sunday with a repeat of John Tydeman's fine 1965 Three Sisters, with Jill Bennett, Lynn Redgrave and Rosalie Crutchley as the sisters and Paul Scofield as Major Vershinin. On Tuesday they gave Mrs Vershinin, a fascinating piece in which Helen Cooper looks at the major's domestic life. Yeliena Vershinina is roundly described by Toozenbach in Act 1 of the Chekhov, and we know that on the night of the fire she abandoned her children in their nightclothes and took refuge at the Prozorovs. Cooper traces her back to her childhood, her courtship, then to her married quarters. Her old father and mother also live there, but the major is too often at the Prozorovs. 'It's the dark one,' they say. When the battery is ordered to Poland, Yeliena won't have it. She and her daughters are going to Moscow, walking if necessary. Infection, evidently. Julie LeGrand gave a sensitive portrayal of her unhappy decline. No other characters from Chekhov are used. Ned Chaillet produced. Radio 4's Monday play was Mary Morgan, a novelettish piece by Greg Cullen about a serving-girl hanged for killing the baby she had from the heir to a prosperous family. At her trial (early 19th century), the young man was foreman of the jury. By then he was about to make an advantageous marriage. A guilty verdict was socially and dramatically essential. Mad King George III appeared as an extra. The tale is said to be true, but it sounded pretty fictional in Jane Dauncey's competently novelettish production. The motion before the third of the Radio 4 debates on Sunday was that 'The time has come to disestablish the Church of England,' and the lively discussion must have held the 9 per cent of the British people that still go to church. Tony Benn (proposing) brought up such matters as equality of faiths, appointment of bishops, blasphemy, and could not help saying that Conservatives controlled our faith through the BBC. The Bishop of Peterborough (opposing) wisely drew attention to the 'bread-and-butter' services - baptisms, weddings, funerals - that so many non-churchgoers still find necessary. The motion was lost by 73 to 77. These debates are better than Any Questions or phone-ins; the quality of participants is higher. I interviewed Cliff Richard in about 1960. He seemed to me a serious sign of the times. Modest and likeable, with hair on his chest, he had little to tell me; Elvis Presley was his hero, Christianity came later. Now Wired for Sound, a six-part series on Radio 2 (Sundays), will tell more, for instance, that he thinks Madonna too sexy - though Jack Good of television's Oh Boy] thought Cliff 'the sexiest animal on television'. The first programme was only biography, however. Radio 1 will deal with Elvis next week - Elvis Costello, I mean.</p>

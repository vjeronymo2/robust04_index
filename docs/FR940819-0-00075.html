			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four comments noted that many hazardous chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cargoes can pose serious risks to the marine environment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health, and argued that vessels carrying these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cargoes should also be escorted. One comment stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional regulations are needed to cover the transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous substances not covered by the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The Coast Guard has determined that including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous material cargoes is outside the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority of OPA 90. However, the Coast Guard will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking further comment on this issue as part of the ``other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters'' escort vessel rulemaking and may propose regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include certain hazardous material and or NLS cargoes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under authority of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (33 U.S.C. 1221  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 7. Applicable waters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty comments addressed what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. waters should be included under the escort regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Prince William Sound, 12 comments stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escorts should be continuously required all the way from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Port Valdez to Hinchinbrook Entrance (including the mid-Sound region). Four comments stated that escorts should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only be required at Port Valdez and Hinchinbrook Entrance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not in mid-Sound because there is enough sea room in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mid-Sound for a tanker to safely drift while waiting for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrival of assist tugs dispatched from Port Valdez. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast Guard agrees that escorts are appropriate for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regions of Prince William Sound, and the rule so provides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Puget Sound escort zone, the NPRM proposed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> western boundary of longitude 123 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;24.5 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; West, but excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers transiting to and from the Ediz Hook anchorage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Port Angeles (which would require them to skirt just inside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that boundary). Three comments suggested moving the western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary of the escort zone to the entrance to the Straits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Juan de Fuca (Cape Flattery), while 2 comments suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moving the western boundary eastwards to coincide with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing escort zone established by Washington state. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment suggested the applicable area be extended to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ediz Hook anchorage adjacent to the Port Angeles Harbor. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of comments, this rule revises the western boundary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by shifting it approximately 11 nautical miles eastwards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the U.S. waters east of the line connecting New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dungeness Light (Washington) with Discovery Island Light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Canada). This new boundary location therefore coincides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the existing Federal boundary line governing maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker size in Puget Sound waters (33 CFR 161.143), as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the boundary line for escorting as required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing Washington state regulations. This change still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excludes the Ediz Hook anchorage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining comments nominated additional waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> besides Prince William Sound and Puget Sound, such as Cook  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inlet, Alaska, and the Olympic coast, Washington. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments will be considered in the separate ``other waters''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking project (CGD 91&hyph;202a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 8. Number of escort vessels.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Coast Guard define the required capabilities of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort vessel rather than only specifying any particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of escort vessels. Another comment supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for two escorts in Prince William Sound. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments suggested that smaller tankers be allowed to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only one escort vessel. Two comments disagreed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring the usage of two escort vessels and suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one would be adequate in most cases. OPA 90 requires a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum of two escort vessels for the Prince William Sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Puget Sound waters stipulated in the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, regulations for those waters which cite OPA 90  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority must incorporate this statutory minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 9. Relative positioning of escort vessels.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other provisions, the NPRM proposed that the escort vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be ``available in close proximity to the tanker at all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times.'' Twelve comments addressed the issue of where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort vessels should be positioned (relative to the tanker)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the escort transit. In lieu of a close proximity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, some comments suggested a specified maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance from the tanker, such as one-half mile. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other comments argued that a specified distance was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily restrictive. The latter comments pointed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the closer any vessel is to a tanker, the greater the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of a collision. These comments argued that, in open  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters, the escort vessel should have the flexibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position itself at any safe distance as judged by its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> master, so long as it could still respond in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashion. The Coast Guard agrees with the ``timely response''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach, and has revised this rule accordingly. This will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively require the tanker and escort vessel masters to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuously evaluate the situation and reposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves, as appropriate, at different points along the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit route. This does not preclude the escort vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from remaining in the shelter of the tanker's lee if weather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions and prudent seamanship warrant; the tanker should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then adjust its speed to compensate for any delays before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the escort vessels could move into position to render  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance in an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 10. Performance requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the escort vessels be ``capable of providing sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maneuvering forces to substantially influence the speed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direction of travel of the tanker.'' Twelve comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed the issue of performance capabilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort vessels. One comment recommended that a tug escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the capability to push or tow a disabled ship away from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the danger of grounding or collision. One comment suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that tug escorts should have the ability to stop a disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel within 10 vessel lengths from the declaration of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency (this comment qualified its suggestion by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizing that such a standard would be very dependent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the harbor conditions). Another comment suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tug escorts be capable of meeting the demands of assisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the escorted tanker. Another comment contended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance and design criteria for tug escorts will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dictated by an effective escort program, and suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local geography, local man-made hazards, and regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel speeds be considered when developing tug escort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities criteria. Four comments addressed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance standards as outlined in the NPRM. One comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that performance standards should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographically-specific. Two comments recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance based criteria be coupled with the tanker's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tonnage, weather, or sea conditions. Additionally, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment was specifically concerned with weather conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and suggested that oil tankers only be allowed to operate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prince William Sound when weather conditions would permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe operation of the tug escorts. This comment further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the realistic adverse weather limits for safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escorting operations is approximately 40-knot wind speed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10-foot seas. Another comment generally supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance-based criteria as proposed in the NPRM, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that operating parameters also be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard agrees that performance requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be more detailed. Accordingly, &sect;168.50 of this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been revised to include towing, stopping, holding, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turning requirements for controlling a tanker within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified parameters under various failure and weather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios, and to require that the tanker not be operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond a speed at which the escort vessels can reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to bring it safely under control within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> navigational limits of the waterway. The requirements were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed after reviewing several tanker/tug maneuvering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies that were submitted to the docket, and considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the largest tankers in Prince William Sound are about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 265,000 DWT (deadweight tons) and the largest in the Puget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sound waters are 125,000 DWT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

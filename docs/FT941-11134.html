			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: . . . and picking the best provider Equitable Life's position as a major pension provider is undisputed, both in the individual and company markets, writes Debbie Harrison. It has a reputation for high-quality, high-performance products geared towards the more affluent investor who can afford above average premiums. It was founded in 1762 and is the oldest mutual life office in the world. Yet there is something unusual about the office - a certain aloofness that has characterised its standing in the pension market for more than 230 years. The attitude of rival life offices and independent advisers towards Equitable is similar to that of the rest of Europe to Switzerland: a mixture of sour grapes and admiration. Take its sales strategy. Equitable's aim is to deal personally with the pensions needs of managers, the self-employed, executives and directors. It may sound elitist but it is a formula that has worked for more than two centuries. Other life offices have sold through direct sales, independent advisers, tied agents or a combination of all three, depending on the prevailing fashion. Equitable does not pay sales commissions to third parties and sells most of its products through its relatively small (375) salaried sales force. Seven per cent of its business is derived from other professional advisers but they do not receive any payment from the society. Roy Ranson, chief executive, says: 'The board first rejected a request to pay commission in 1765 and has never found its payment necessary in order to attract new business. By refusing to pay commission, we maintain strict control over our business and the quality of service.' The flagship of Equitable's personal pension range is its with-profits plan which has produced consistently good returns over the past 20 years. This is a mixed, actively-managed fund which, at the end of 1992, comprised fixed interest securities (27 per cent), UK equities (41 per cent), overseas equities (11 per cent), property (9 per cent), and 12 per cent in other investments such as cash and index-linked gilts. The strength of the with-profits product is that a proportion of the annual investment return is paid in the form of guaranteed bonuses which, once added, cannot be taken away. Each year, Equitable announces a 'yield' on the fund, part of which is guaranteed, while the remainder is non-guaranteed and confirmed only if the policyholder wishes to terminate the plan or retires. Ranson says recent criticisms of the performance of with-profits policies, compared with unit-linked funds, are 'nonsense.' 'With-profits funds should be looked at over a rolling three to five-year period and not judged on an annually,' he says. 'Although the aim of the fund is to smooth investment returns to investors, there are bound to be peaks and troughs in the short term. It is always easy with hindsight to spot a specialised unit-linked fund that has done better.' Moreover, Ranson reaffirms the long-term view of pension planning. 'It's no good switching all your assets every year to a new provider, not if you want to sleep at night.' Under the unit-linked personal pension, in which contributions are invested in units that reflect directly the value of the underlying fund, the society offers 16 funds, ranging from low-risk gilt and fixed interest to the higher-risk Far Eastern fund. Long-term performance varies. The top scores are from the high income, international, Far Eastern, fixed interest and money funds. However, the managed fund - the most common choice for unit-linked clients - got off to a good start in 1988 but slowly declined over the following four years, until its recent improvement in 1993 when it bounced back into the top quartile. Elsewhere in the pensions market, Equitable is a leading provider of in-house additional voluntary contribution (AVC) schemes and is very competitive on annuity rates. The society also offers clients a range of annuity products which have particular appeal to the active investor. One of the problems of personal pensions and similar products is that, on retirement, the individual has to use the accumulated fund immediately to buy an annuity which, normally, provides a fixed income for life since it is invested in fixed-interest gilts. The annuity, once purchased, cannot be changed. To combat this problem, Equitable sells both unit-linked and with-profits annuities which allow clients to continue to hold their pension fund investments in real assets. As a further development, the society launched its managed annuity in October 1993 - the first of its kind - which allows investors a greater degree of control over their annuity fund than is possible under conventional contracts. The continued active investment, particularly in equities, aims to provide a better income in the long term. However, these products are complex and require both expert advice at the outset and careful management over the long-term. The charging structure on Equitable's pension policies, devised in 1956 with the launch of its first individual pension product, is central to the society's 'flexibility without penalty' philosophy and provides a blueprint for modern plans. Each contribution is treated as a single premium and, therefore, future contributions can be reduced, stopped and restarted without any penalty. The modest charging structure puts Equitable among the top 10 leaders in the industry in terms of value for money, according to statistics published in the Financial Times Personal Pensions 1994 handbook. Over the next decade, Equitable will face greater competition as professional advisers negotiate non- commission terms with more of the mainstream providers. Nevertheless, in 1992 the society had the lowest expense ratio (management expenses divided by total premium income) of all life offices, at 6.6 per cent and less than half of the industry average (last calculated in 1991) at 19.3 per cent. The expense ratio is expected to fall to 5.8 per cent for 1993. So far, Equitable has avoided any taint from the personal pension transfer scandal in which individuals were advised wrongly to transfer benefits out of company schemes. The company has sold 37,000 transfer plans, a significant proportion of which was not to employees in company schemes but to individuals dissatisfied with the performance or contract terms of another provider's plan. Finally, Equitable looks good in terms of financial strength, receiving a Standard &amp; Poor's AA rating. S &amp; P says: 'Insurers rated AA offer excellent financial security. Capacity to meet policy holder obligations is strong under a variety of economic and underwriting conditions.'</p>

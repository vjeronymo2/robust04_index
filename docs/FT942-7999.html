			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): George Trumbull touches down in Australia The US executive invasion of corporate Australia continues with the appointment of George Trumbull as the next chief executive of Australia's largest investment group, the AMP Society, writes Bruce Jacques. Trumbull, scheduled to take over in September when Ian Salmon retires, has been recruited from the CIGNA insurance group in the US. A former American football player, 49-year-old Trumbull has a reputation for toughness and change. He'll need to score some early touchdowns when he arrives at the Sydney headquarters next month. Trumbull's appointment departs from more than a century of promotion from within AMP. Perhaps his most challenging task will be to modify the creaky internal structures of one of Australia's oldest corporate cultures. But he is not alone. A number of his compatriots, including Robert Joss at Westpac, and Frank Blount at Telecom, face similar tasks. Early items on Trumbull's agenda are likely to include whether the Society should demutualise in favour of an equity-based structure and whether it should again look to banking after recent disastrous flirtations. Trumbull has already spent nearly a quarter of a century overhauling large parts of the CIGNA group. An economist with a degree from Dartmouth in 1966, he also obtained a Masters degree in Business Management in 1968 from the Dartmouth School of Business.</p>

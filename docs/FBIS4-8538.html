			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and </F> minister of foreign affairs, by unidentified announcer; from the  "Slikom na sliku" program -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] Mr. Granic good evening.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Announcer] You have returned from Greece where you had  talks  with Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias.  According to news agency reports, you obtained support for the  peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas. A visit by  European Union [EU] ministers to Knin has been announced. What  does this mean in concrete terms?    [Granic] Greece supports the territorial integrity and  sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia and the resumption of  talks with the local Serbs. In this it sees a chance for the  final normalization of Croatian-Serb and Zagreb-Belgrade  relations. I put forward a proposal that a European troika  should visit Knin, and as Greece currently holds the EU  presidency, Mr. Papoulias accepted this, and he will join peace  efforts to continue the peace process. Greece has a great  interest in the normalization of Croatian-Serb relations and in  this respect it will do everything it can.    [Announcer] Today you also discussed Croatia's admission to  Partnership for Peace, aid for reconstruction, and its  membership of international political and financial  institutions. What would you single out as particularly  important from these talks?    [Granic] A very interesting thing is that totally identical  support was given both by Greece and Turkey as regards the  demands of the Republic of Croatia toward the European Union,  both in connection with an agreement on cooperation with the  European Union, aid for the reconstruction of the Republic of  Croatia, and its admission to certain concrete projects, such as  the PHARE [Poland-Hungary -- Actions for Economic Reconversion]  project. We also discussed Partnership for Peace and Croatia's  admission to it. Both countries lent their strong support for  this.    [Announcer] You returned from an official visit to Greece  and  Turkey, two countries having strong links with events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia. How much were the talks  determined by this current Turkish support for the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Greek closeness to Belgrade?    [Granic] It is indisputable that Turkey has a significant  influence over the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a very  positive one. Throughout the entire war it has been a positive  influence. We have always had very good and excellent contacts  with Turkey, in the course of the entire past period, and  naturally, especially now.    On the other hand, Greece has good relations with Belgrade,  Greece wants a final normalization of Croatian-Serb relations.  We do not see any obstacles to the positive development of  relations both with Turkey and Greece.    [Announcer] Greece was one of the rare countries that  condemned the latest NATO air strikes around Gorazde. There is  a demand for a cease-fire and the resumption of negotiations  between the Croatian- Bosniak federation and the Serbs. How did  they assess the latest developments, particularly NATO air  strikes on Gorazde?    [Granic] Well, we discussed that, of course. Greece believes  that nothing that would prevent the process of negotiations  should be carried out. I pointed to the fact that this was,  nevertheless, an aggression on Gorazde launched by the Bosnian  Serbs, and that NATO had reacted in a legal and legitimate way.  However, we agreed that it was of primary importance to halt  all conflicts, achieve a cease-fire, and organize negotiations  between the Bosnian Serbs and the [Croat-Muslim] federation.    [Announcer] How do you view the latest developments? I know  you have just returned from Greece, but as you are here I am  availing myself of the opportunity to ask you, the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is again being complicated. News has come  about a fresh violation of the cease-fire in Sarajevo. It seems  that shooting has again started there, that the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is restarting.    [Granic] The Bosnian Serbs' reactions have been edgy. But,  still, the Serbs were surprised by the NATO action. They had  not believed it would take place. There are considerable  differences among the Serbs themselves in their approaches.  This was discussed today in talks with Minister Papoulias.  Greece is ready to do everything to achieve a cease-fire and  for negotiations to start.    I would like to point to one more thing: Croatia's  reputation in both Greece and Turkey, and particularly President  Tudjman's reputation. It is interesting that both countries  emphasized this, both ministers, especially President Demirel  who said that Turkey has always maintained good relations with  Croatia, particularly after the Washington agreement was signed.    [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for finding time  to be a guest in our Slikom na sliku program.    [Granic] Thank you.</p>

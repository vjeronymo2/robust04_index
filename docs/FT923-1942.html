			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (12): Falling prey to la morosite - It is time to take stock of the socialist government's record / France THROUGHOUT the summer one word has dominated the political and economic agenda in France - Maastricht. The referendum yesterday, at which the French were asked to vote on whether or not to ratify the Maastricht treaty for European union, was of such overwhelming significance, both to France itself and elsewhere in Europe, that it dwarfed every other topic of debate. Now that the referendum is over, the French public can concentrate on assessing the socialist government's economic record ahead of the forthcoming elections. If you listened to the conversation at a Parisian dinner party or a Lyonnaise bistro, you could be forgiven for thinking that the government's record was very bad indeed. Moaning and groaning about la morosite, or the sluggish state of the French economy, has been a dominant topic in France over the past year or so. To the British, the Americans, or any other nation whose economy has really suffered, the complaints of the French scarcely seem justified. France has, after all, benefited from a much more robust economic performance than almost all its trading partners in the early 1990s, as screeds of analyses attest. The reason why the French have fallen prey to la morosite over the past year or so is that, although France has avoided the recession that has beset so many of its international competitors, its economic performance has been, at best, pedestrian. France mustered growth of just 1.25 per cent last year, much lower than in previous years. It is on course for slightly higher growth of at least 2 per cent this year, according to Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, together with an annual inflation rate of around 2.8 per cent and a trading account that has moved from the red in 1991, into the black in 1992. The problem for the French government is that most of this growth has been export-led, as French companies have taken advantage of France's consistently low rate of inflation to become more cost-competitive in their international markets. By contrast, the domestic market has stayed stubbornly sluggish because the high cost of borrowing - with bank base rates of 9.85 per cent - has depressed consumer confidence and curbed industrial investment. This means that French consumers feel as though they are under financial pressure as do companies, which have continued to shed labour thereby creating a vicious circle in which the rising rate of joblessness - which has hovered between 8 per cent and 10 per cent for the past eight years but passed the 10 per cent barrier earlier this year - makes consumers even more nervous. Unfortunately for the French government the obvious remedy of reducing interest rates is complicated by Germany's dominant role in the EC economic system. So far France has failed to convince international investors that the inflation rate has been so low for so long that the franc and French bonds, are a suitable substitute for the benchmark investment vehicles of the D-Mark and German bunds. As a result, French interest rates are still dictated by those of Germany as Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who preceded Mr Sapin as finance minister before becoming prime minister this spring, discovered last autumn when he tried to hold French rates below those of the Germans only to have to raise them again little more than two weeks later to protect the franc. This scenario seems set to continue with the uncertainty over Germany's economic outlook making it even more difficult to predict when the Germans, and then the French, will be able to reduce interest rates again. In the meantime, both Mr Beregovoy and Mr Sapin have made it quite clear that they will stick to their franc fort policy of supporting the French currency. Even with interest rates at their present level, the French economy is on course to meet Mr Sapin's growth target of 2 per cent for 1992, according to the latest forecast from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which also predicts a modest improvement to 2.5 per cent growth next year. In the short term this growth will continue to come from exports. It is only in the longer term, according to the OECD, as the benefits of greater international competitiveness filter through and lower interest rates alleviate the pressure on the domestic market, that demand within France itself will recover, the increase in unemployment will be halted and the French economy will be ready to return to faster growth. The international outlook is still clouded. There has been some progress but the instability of Japan and the effect of the dollar's decline on the US, both important markets for French luxury goods and drinks companies, could pose problems, as could the continuing uncertainty over the prospects for Germany and Italy, two important European export markets. This may make it more difficult for France to continue its buoyant export performance, and to counter the effect of the depressed domestic market, over the coming year. The OECD warned that the fragility of the international economy could be the main impediment to France's recovery. As a result, although France still seems on course for continued growth, the French public are likely to be moaning and groaning about la morosite into the forthcoming elections. The scenario could, of course, be very, very different if Mr Spain and Mr Beregovoy showed the slightest sign of relaxing their tight control over the economy. But the socialist government seems set on being as rigid as ever in its approach to the economy. The OECD has applauded its rigour, maintaining that it would have nothing to gain and everything to lose, in terms of tattered credibility, if it was to change course. As the elections approach, the one certainty on the febrile French political scene is that, whichever party wins, left or right, it will not make the slightest difference to the economic management of France.</p>

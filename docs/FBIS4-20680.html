The following satisfactory  results were obtained: BOD and SS concentration in the system  effluent was under 50 mg/l and 90 mg/l respectively. More than  99 percent of organic matter was removed. About 40,000 kcal of  methane gas energy was recovered in an operation of 12-22  kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day, and the average methane gasification rate  and sludge yield rate were 0.33  Nm[.sup]3[/]-CH[.sub]4[/]/kg-COD removed, and 0.12  kg-VSS/kg-COD removed respectively.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Many industries, such as the food industry require an energy  efficient system to treat the waste water, which may contain  high strength dissolved and suspended organic matter. Anaerobic  waste water treatment systems had advantages over aerobic ones  in not only energy efficiency but less sludge yield and  production of gas useful for fuel, but, on the other hand, had  some drawbacks, such as unstability in treatment and high  effluent concentration.    The process of anaerobic degradation roughly consists of  acidogenesis, where organic matter degrades into organic acid,  and methanogenesis, where organic acid degrades into methane and  carbon dioxide. However, these two processes have to be  separated in order to offer desirable circumstances that allow  each bacteria to work in each process.[.sup]1,2[/] This has  proven to be very difficult in actual operation.    A membrane combined two phase methane fermentation system  has  been developed to overcome such difficulties of anaerobic  treatment. In this system, a membrane is placed between the  acidogenic and methanogenic phase. Therefore, undegraded organic  matter, SS and acidogenic bacteria remain in the acidogenic  reactor (AR), and the methanogenic reactor (MR) is fed with  membrane filtrate, mainly containing organic acid which can be  utilized by methanogenic bacteria. One difficulty with this  system is that SS is retained in the AR. This system was tested  with wheat starch waste water containing high strength SS, and  degradation of organic matter and organic loading was studied.  <H5>  Pilot Plant </H5>   Flow of Pilot Plant    Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the pilot plant, which  consisted of fixed bed AR, UASB[.sup]3[/] MR and membrane  module. The feed water was the waste water from a wheat starch  and gluten producing plant, owned by Nagata Industry Co., Ltd.  The pH of waste water was adjusted in the feed tank and pumped  to the heat exchanger, which recovers heat from the effluent  from the MR. The preheated waste water was heated again to  37C by steam injection before being fed to the AR. The  effluent from the AR was fed to the membrane module, and the  filtrate was fed to the MR and the concentrate was recycled to  the AR. The effluent from the MR was finally discharged out of  the system through the heat exchanger. The gas produced in both  reactors was desulfurized in the desulfurization towers,  reserved in the gas holder and then discharged out of the  system. Table 1 shows the specification of the pilot plant.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-44A>      Figure 1.

The  loading rate is per total capacity of the AR and the MR. As  shown in Figure 2, the removal rate decreases a little as the  loading rate increases. With 20 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD  loading rate, however, 99 percent of TOC removal rate was kept  and more than 99.8 percent of BOD removal rate was recorded. As  a result, it is clear that the system can treat wheat starch  waste water containing high strength SS with more than 20  kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD loading.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-45A>      Figure 2. Relation Between TOC Removal Rate and COD </FIG>     Analysis of Waste Water    Table 3 shows the results of the analysis of the effluent in  each process. The concentration of the AR effluent is higher  than that of the feed water because undegraded matter and  bacteria were concentrated by the membrane. The BOD of MR  effluent mostly levels off at 50 mg/l and the SS concentration  at about 100 mg/l. As the membrane filtrate, which is fed to the  MR, contains no SS, all SS in the MR effluent is considered as  biomass. The results prove the system could efficiently and  stably treat waste water to a level of purity high enough to  allow discharge into a river.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

The gasification ratio was defined as  the amount of carbon in produced gas to influent TOC. Figure 3  shows the liquefaction ability and gasification ratio. Each  ratio, of which the average was 86.5 percent and 23.6 percent  respectively, decreased a little as COD loading increased. The  excess sludge was extracted with a fixed ratio to feed amount  from the reactor. Therefore, the increase of COD loading  resulted in a concentration of membrane concentrate, which led  to an increase in the amount of carbon in the sludge extraction.  The 63 percent, carbon ratio of liquefaction minus that of gas  shown in Figure 3, is carbon ratio fed to MR via membrane.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-46A>      Figure 3. Liquefaction and Gasification Ratio vs. COD </FIG>     On the other hand, volatile fatty acid production is the  most  important degradation reaction in the AR. Figure 4 shows main  volatile fatty acids content change with time in membrane  filtrate. In Figure 4, propionate and n-butyrate content  increased gradually over time, and COD loading increased too. it  is likely that the acetogenesis reaction reaches its limit by  the increase of COD loading. However, acetic acid content  changed with time, and decreased greatly from 130 to 200 days.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-46B>      Figure 4. Main Volatile Fatty Acids Content vs. Elapsed </FIG>     Figure 5 shows the change in the rate gas production over  time in the AR. Because the gas production rate in this period  increased, it is likely that methanogenic bacteria transformed  acetic acid into gas. In order to operate the AR normally, it  was necessary to suppress gas production to prevent severe  foaming in the reactor. A decrease in the amount of methanogenic  bacteria was attempted by drawing the excess sludge from the AR.  As a result of the suppression of gas production in the reactor,  the acetic acid content of filtrate increased and normal  operation was maintained.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-47A>      Figure 5. Gas Production Ratio vs. Elapsed Time </FIG>     Degradation in MR    The efficiency of degradation of the MR can be evaluated  with  the index of the TOC removal rate. Figure 6 contrasts the TOC  removal rate with the COD loading in the reactor. While the rate  decreased a little with the increase of COD loading, it was  always over 98 percent even with 30 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD  loading. This was because the influent to the reactor, which  mostly consisted of organic acid and did not contain SS, was  good for the USAB to operate most efficiently. Of the TOC  removed in the reactor, approximately 96 percent was gasified  and 2.5 percent transferred to bacteria, which indicates that  the organic matter fed to the reactor had almost completely  degraded.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-47B>      Figure 6. TOC Removal Rate vs. COD Loading Rate </FIG>     Gas Production    The gas produced from the both reactors consisted of 62  percent methane and 38 percent carbon dioxide, and amounted to  7.6 Nm[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]3[/]-feed waste water (2.0 in AR,  5.6 in MR). Taking the energy level into account, when 1  m[.sup]3[/] of waste water was treated, 40,000 kcal of energy  with gas of about 5,400 kcal/m[.sup]3[/] was produced.    Figure 7 contrasts methane yield rate with the COD loading  in  the AR, the MR and the system. The methane yield rate in the  system has little influence over the increase in COD loading.  However, it decreases a little in the AR and increases in the  MR. This is because organic acid content of AR effluent increase  with the rise of COD loading, and as a result high strength  organic acid was fed to the MR. Methane produced in the AR  amounted to only one-fifth of that in the system, which meant  that the acidogenesis reaction occurred mainly in it. The  average gas yield rate of the system recorded high 0.336  m[.sup]3[/]-CH[.sub]4[/]/kg-COD removed.[.sup]5[/]      Biomass Yield    Figure 8 contrasts the biomass yield rate per removed  organic  matter with COD loading. The biomass yield rate in the each  reactor increases with the rise of the rate of COD loading. In  this system, all SS separated is retained by the membrane in the  AR. In spite of the many degradation reactions going on in the  reactor, the organic matter removed is a little amount of gas  and biomass. Almost organic matter flows out in the form of  volatile fatty acid from the AR. Therefore average SS yield rate  for removed organic matter was 0.248 kg-SS/kg-COD removed in the  AR, a value which was comparatively high.[.sup]6[/] However,  this is only 0.106 kg-SS/kg-COD removed for the whole system. On  the other hand, the biomass yield rate of the MR was few 0.020  kg-SS/removed COD,[.sup]7[/] because it was membrane filtrate  containing more than 92 percent of organic acid that was fed to  the reactor. That of the whole system was rather high 0.126  kg-SS/removed COD, which is a good result considering that the  waste water contained high strength SS and the system operated  with high loading rate.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-48A>      Figure 8. Biomass Yield Rate vs. COD Loading Rate </FIG>     Membrane Module    The membrane unit operated with constant amount of filtrate,  and the linear velocity on the membrane surface was kept of 0.9  m/sec for energy saving in this test. As a result, the flux per  operating pressure was highly affected by SS concentration on  the membrane surface. The membrane was regularly washed with  reverse flow of membrane filtrate but not washed by any other  method. The membrane could maintain the flux for SS  concentration of 30,000 mg/l by washing with the filtrate, which  proved the membrane was usable for treating high SS  concentration solution.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   The pilot test fully proved the efficiency of the system. It  surpasses other state-of-the-art reactors in treatment  efficiency, high removal rate of organic matter and gasification  rate as well as compactness of size. From these results, the  anaerobic treatment was considered to be useful for low strength  waste water as well as high strength waste water.  <H5>  Acknowledgments </H5>   This study was a commission to develop ``The high efficiency  membrane complex methane production unit'' from NEDO, which was  proceeded in cooperation with Mitsubishi Rayon Engineering Co.  and Mitsubishi Electric Co.

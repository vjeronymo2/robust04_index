			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea sought  Thailand's cooperation Wednesday in strengthening ties with  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in its bid to get  actively engaged with the region.    Visiting South Korean foreign minister, here on the second  stop of his Southeast Asian tour, met with Thai Prime Minister  Chuan Leekpai for talks on regional issues covering ASEAN, its  relations with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the  regional security dialogue that opened for the first time this  year, Han's aides said.    Han expressed hopes of giving a boost to Seoul-Bangkok  relations when Chuan visits South Korea next month, the aides  said. He explained the latest developments on North Korea's  nuclear problem with emphasis that the situation is not just a  regional concern but an international one that threatens world  stabiliity.    The foreign minister sought Thai's active role in mediating  South Korea's involvement with ASEAN as Bangkok plays  chairnation to this year's ASEAN post-ministerial conference  July 26-28, the aides said.    Chuan explained Thailand's "constructive engagement policy"  aimed at improving relations with the three Indochinese country  -- Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia -- and its efforts to establish  the "baht economy" that would also incorporate Myanmar [Burma].    South Korean officials said they wish to connect to these  countries as well economically through Thailand.    The two leaders touched on Seoul-Bangkok economic relations  with Chuan noting the trade imbalance in South Korea's favor.    Bilateral trade tallied at 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last  year  with South Korea pocketing 1.2 billion dollar surplus.    Chuan urged South Korean businesses to more actively enter  Thai market and to make more investments as part of efforts to  balance these trade figures, the aides said.</p>

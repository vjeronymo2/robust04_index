			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOWNEY SAVINGS TAKES PROFITS A QUARTER AT A TIME;  </P> <P> THRIFT: NEWPORT BEACH S&amp;L NETS $13.2 MILLION TO START YEAR, NEARLY EQUALING  1989 TOTAL. NEW CEO SAYS OFFICERS ARE 'PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS' AND ANALYSTS  EXPECT CONTINUED STRONG GAINS.  </P> <P> Downey Savings &amp; Loan, stashing away capital for a possible future  conversion to a bank, posted net income of $13.2 million for the first quarter,  nearly reaching its earnings for all of last year.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach-based thrift's earnings were lower than the $21 million  recorded in the corresponding period last year, but half of that quarter's  amount came from accounting changes.  </P> <P> The first-quarter profit marks a turnaround from losses in the second half of  1989, including a $9.4-million fourth-quarter loss, that dropped Downey's  annual earnings to $13.6 million.  </P> <P> "We're pleased with the results," said David L. Boyles, Downey's recently named  chief operating officer. "The first quarter came out very much how we thought  it would."  </P> <P> Industry analysts are predicting that the sale of Downey's valuable real estate  holdings this year should push 1990 earnings to as much as $100 million. The  thrift has nearly $95 million in tax credits it must use this year or lose.  More than $12 million of the thrift's first-quarter earnings came from gains on  its sale of properties.  </P> <P> What is driving Downey, though, isn't its real estate sales, but its basic  savings and loan operations, said James F. Wilson, an industry analyst with  Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Operating earnings -- excluding real estate sales and other nonrecurring gains  or losses -- increased roughly 40% to about $10.5 million for the first  quarter, Wilson estimated.  </P> <P> "They're simply doing well in the S&amp;L business," he said. Downey's profit  margin on its loans has nearly doubled from the end of June, 1989, he said.  </P> <P> Downey has earned a solid reputation for building neighborhood shopping centers  throughout California and in Arizona. Only a few years ago, it owned more than  90 centers and 55 other real estate projects. But a new federal law requires  all thrifts to sell their real estate holdings by the end of 1994.  </P> <P> During the first quarter, which ended March 31, Downey sold or put into escrow  11 projects worth $149.9 million. And more properties are being added regularly  to that category, said A.J. Morsillo, the S&amp;L's controller.  </P> <P> Campbell Chaney, an analyst for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, had expected  Downey to post higher earnings. But Chaney said the timing of the real estate  sales may simply be lagging. He said he expects Downey's profits to rise in the  next three quarters.  </P> <P> Downey's real estate and securities portfolios took a major hit in the last  quarter of 1989 when changes in federal law forced the thrift to write down the  value of those assets.  </P> <P> Some of those problems continued through the first quarter as Downey socked  away $5 million in reserves for writedowns on its mortgage-backed securities,  which are bonds whose value fell during a rising interest rate market.  </P> <P> Downey's deposits and assets fell during the quarter, mainly due to the results  of a former subsidiary, Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana.  Butterfield was seized by regulators in August, 1985, and Downey purchased it  from regulators in September, 1988, acquiring $240 million in tax credits in  the deal.  </P> <P> Downey then started dropping Butterfield's interest rates on deposits, which  led many Butterfield customers to take their money elsewhere. About $126  million in original Butterfield deposits were pulled out of Downey during the  first quarter, giving the S&amp;L a net decline in deposits of $72.7 million to  $3.4 billion.  </P> <P> Mainly as a result of the continuing drain in Butterfield deposits over the  last year, Downey's assets fell to $4 billion at the end of March from $4.2  billion a year earlier.  </P> <P> Downey already exceeds the capital requirements imposed by the new federal law  and is trying to build its capital even higher in a bid to convert into a bank,  though most industry analysts say little would be accomplished by that move  because banks and S&amp;Ls are nearly identical now.  </P> <P> Boyles, a former Bank of America executive, was hired recently to increase  Downey's commercial banking activities and run the savings and loan operations  while other executives concentrate on selling the thrift's real estate.  </P> <P> DOWNEY SAVINGS AND LOAN'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Here are revenue and net income and loss figures of Downey Savings and Loan  during the past nine quarters.  </P> <P> Revenues (in millions of dollars): $101.4. Net Income and Loss (in millions of  dollars): $13.2.  </P></p>

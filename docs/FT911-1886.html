			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Battle line challenge for Tory strategists - The state of the parties as they face the local election contests THE ONE safe bet for today's local elections throughout England and Wales is that all three major parties will seek to glean some comfort from the results and will probably succeed in doing so. The outcome is unlikely to be clear-cut. However, it should give Conservative party strategists all the information they need to decide whether to recommend going to the country in June. With no contests in Scotland, Northern Ireland and greater London, the results will cover 475 of the UK's 650 parliamentary constituencies, including those in the most keenly fought areas with many marginal seats, so the elections represent the last big test of public opinion available to ministers. There are full council elections in 185 English shire districts, and a third of the council is being contested in the remaining 111 and in the 36 metropolitan authorities. In Wales, there are full elections for 33 district councils, with a third of the seats being contested in the other four. The Tories are defending around 5,200 seats and Labour 3,075. The Liberals took 1,276 seats in 1987 and the now-defunct SDP 468. Independents won 2,094 seats and Plaid Cymru 89. Two battles are being fought in the 12,000 council seats at stake, one for seats and council control and the other for share of the vote - the issue that will decide whether there is to be an early general election. Last time, Labour won 31 per cent of the vote, the Tories 40 per cent and the SDP-Liberal Alliance 27 per cent. On the face of it, it is the Conservatives who are under pressure. Their 1983 and 1987 results saw net gains of 113 and 78 seats respectively, and were good enough to trigger a successful June election. But circumstances have changed considerably since 1987, partly because of the mess the government has made of the poll tax and partly because of the likely fall in the Liberal Democratic vote. A crucial element of tonight's results will be how much of the former Alliance vote remains with the Liberal Democrats and the distribution of the remainder. The Conservatives' relatively good performance last time makes net gains unlikely even if the announcement of plans for a property based council tax has succeeded in neutralising the adverse effect of the poll tax. The Tories could afford to lose 200 to 250 seats and a handful of councils and still justifiably regard the outcome as a success, if the distribution of votes is favourable. The loss of 500 seats or more would be bad news both for Mr John Major's standing as party leader and for the party's general election prospects. Labour seems certain to make net gains because of its poor performance on the last occasion. But it needs to gain well over 300 seats to justify its present standing in the opinion polls and to maintain the prospect of a general election victory. All the major parties will be studying especially carefully results from three areas - the north-west and the west and east Midlands, where there are clusters of Tory-held marginals. In north-west England, the Tories hope the proposal to introduce the council tax will help in previously low-rated areas such as Pendle and West Lancashire, where there has been fierce opposition to the high levels of poll tax. The Midlands will see a key contest in Nottingham, which the Tories took in 1987 but where a minority Labour administration now relies on a former Communist turned Green for control. Labour could take Derby from the Tories on a good swing and gain control of hung Peterborough. Elsewhere, Labour will want to take control of Exeter, currently hung, and keep control of Milton Keynes where an additional Parliamentary seat is being carved out. More councils look likely to change to no overall control rather than switch between parties if the Tories do badly, particularly where only a third of seats are at stake. The Liberal Democrats, who usually poll much better in local elections than their standing in opinion polls would indicate, hope to demonstrate local strength in several places of parliamentary interest. They could gain Eastbourne, scene of their spectacular by-election victory last year, and Cheltenham, and fend off Tory counter-attacks in hung councils such as Bath, Chelmsford and Hastings.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The Councils to Watch  --------------------------------------------------------------------- LABOUR hopes to take:    TORIES want to hold: LIBERAL                                               DEMOCRATS Darlington               Trafford             hope to keep: Nottingham               Solihull             Adur Newark                                        Hereford NW Leics                 TORIES seek to gain  Berwick Kingswood (Bristol)      from Lib Democrats:  Chelmsford Langbaurgh (Cleveland)   Bath                 S Somerset Gravesham (Kent)         Chelmsford                          Hastings             LIBERAL                                               DEMOCRATS LABOUR may threaten                           want control of: (given a big swing):                          Eastbourne Derby                                         Cheltenham Plymouth                                      N Wiltshire Peterborough Luton Cardiff  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

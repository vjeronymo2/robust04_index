			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- What do you think of the  services of China's Airlines? That is what passengers of the  airlines under the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)  will have the chance to answer on newly-launched "appraisal  cards."    Jiang Zhuping, vice-director of CAAC, headed a group of CAAC  staff this morning to issue the "appraisal cards" to hundreds of  Chinese and foreign passengers at Beijing capital airport.    A spokesman for CAAC, Bao Peide, said that this was part of  the efforts CAAC will carry out this year to improve passenger  service quality.    He said that, starting from today, a total of 100,000 cards  will be issued this year, and at the end of the year CAAC will  list the 17 domestic airlines and major airports according to  the passengers' appraisals. Those which have won high marks  will get awards, while those with low marks will face sanctions.    The card asks for travellers' comments on 22 aspects of  aviation services, including the service attitude of staff,  flight punctuality and in-flight service.    Bao said that this year CAAC's major attention will be paid  to the improvement of staff's service attitude and the services  when flights are delayed.</p>

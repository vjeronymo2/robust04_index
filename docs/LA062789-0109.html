			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEFNER WEDDING: STRICTLY TOP HAT, TAILS  </P> <P> When perennial bachelor Hugh Hefner meets his bride-to-be Kimberley Conrad at  the altar on Saturday, he won't be wearing pajamas, she won't be in a skimpy  negligee and there won't be a hidden bunny logo anywhere.  </P> <P> The two will be married in an elaborate but traditional ceremony at the Playboy  Mansion in Holmby Hills, witnessed by 400 guests who will then party the night  away under a tent of 15,000 yards of white satin twill, inhaling the wafting  scent of 10,000 white roses, eating imported cheese and smoked fish flown in  from Europe and dancing to a 25-piece band.  </P> <P> It's all under the control of 27-year-old Colin Cowie, a dapper, tanned former  model who was brought in (via a Playboy exec who knew his work) a scant five  weeks ago to organize and cater the affair.  </P> <P> "Originally they were going to do the wedding in-house," he explains in a  clipped British accent while sitting in his small but tasteful office across  from the Beverly Center. "There was no real focus as to someone taking control,  making decisions, getting the ball rolling. I had one interview with Hefner and  Kimberley, and she said, 'You must go and do what you have to do.' From then it  was like 24-hour days, preparing the budget, concept and plan, running around  with swatches of fabric.  </P> <P> "One thing I must say," he adds, "is it's not at all Hollywood. It's not glitz.  It's like taking a little piece of Europe and putting it in Beverly Hills for  eight or nine hours. My background is totally European in terms of  entertaining, and I think we've come up with a very tasteful and elegant  ambiance the way the whole thing runs."  </P> <P> Cowie declined to discuss the cost of the wedding, or reveal the guest list  with the exception of one name on it, Bill Cosby.  </P> <P> According to Cowie, guests will enter the mansion from the Mapleton Drive  entrance (garlanded) after being carefully screened by security. Following  light drinks and serenading by a string trio in the pool pavilion, they'll be  escorted to the front lawn and the wishing well, where Hef proposed to Conrad  last year.  </P> <P> They'll be led to their seats by ushers dressed in uniforms with white tunic  tops trimmed with gold braid, gold epaulets and brass buttons, while a string  quartet plays off to the side.  </P> <P> The 63-year-old Hefner, wearing a vested tuxedo, will walk to the wishing well  from the side. Conrad's entrance down the mansion's grand staircase (also  garlanded) will be heralded by trumpeters playing Jeremiah Clarke's "Trumpet  Voluntary." It's the same music that filled St. Paul's Cathedral when Princess  Diana strolled down the aisle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Ceremony  </P> <P> Conrad, 26, will be given away by her father, Robert Conrad (not the actor),  and her matron of honor will be her sister, Resa Miller (there are no  bridesmaids). Hef's best man will be his brother Keith, and the Rev. Charles D.  Ara will perform the nondenominational ceremony described as traditional,  meaning there won't be any original vows or recitation of Kahlil Gibran.  </P> <P> The bridal gown was created by New York designer Jim Hjelm, whose gowns  wholesale for $600 to $2,000. Conrad's is a slightly off-white dress of  taffeta-style silk with a drop waist and full, gathered skirt. The strapless  brocade bodice is decorated with pearls and bows. For the ceremony she'll wear  a jacket with a high neck and sleeves that are puffed at the shoulder and tight  from the elbow down. The chapel-length train is embroidered with the couple's  initials, and Conrad will have a short veil with a wreath-style headpiece  dotted with pearls. Her blond hair will be worn long and slightly curled.  </P> <P> Her sister will wear a rose gown and a wreath-style hairpiece braided with lily  of the valley. Both bouquets will feature white roses and lily of the valley.  </P> <P> After the ceremony guests will go through the house to the party tent with its  rug of Astroturf for champagne and canapes before the multicourse buffet dinner  begins.  </P> <P> Cowie describes the buffet set-up as having "elements of change on a regular  basis." Two buffet tables will be set up on opposite sides of the tent,  decorated with urns of white roses (the only decorative flower) and busts of  women on garlanded pedestals (being custom-made in Palm Springs). After each  course a curtain of white satin twill will be electronically lowered while the  food and the settings are changed. Ceiling lights will be fitted with different  color gels to alter the mood as well. Each table, draped in white taffeta with  a centerpiece of white roses, will have a copy of the menu displayed inside an  antiqued silver frame.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Starts With Caviar  </P> <P> For the first course of caviar the top of the buffet will be draped in purple  satin and accented with purple orchids. Waiters -- wearing those white and gold  uniforms -- will have matching purple sashes.  </P> <P> The cheese course features imported cheeses flown in from Europe, served on  sheet of glass that will rest on a bed of real oak leaves. Red wine and port  will be served alongside.  </P> <P> The fish course will include smoked salmon, smoked halibut and watercress  salad; the background will be a white trellis laced with ivy.  </P> <P> For the meat course (barbecued boneless lamb, New York steak, grilled baby  chicken, haricots verts and baby potatoes) the buffet will be draped in red  satin and gold braiding, there will be bouquets of red roses and waiters will  have traded their purple sashes for red ones. The backdrop will be a trompe  l'oeil scene of an "opulent and decadent dinner."  </P> <P> Once again the curtain will descend and then rise on the Viennese dessert table  trimmed in silver. Diet-busting desserts include a Black Forest torte,  Pithiviers, opera cake and Napoleons. Cowie has also had Teuscher champagne  truffles flown in from Switzerland.  </P> <P> Cowie wanted to end the dinner with cigars and Cognac, but will have to settle  for just the cognac since the mansion is in a fire zone.  </P> <P> And then there is the wedding cake, a five-tier chocolate cake with white  chocolate icing scrolled on top and a filling of strawberries and whipped  cream.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They Wanted Chocolate'  </P> <P> "For me the cake is not the right thing," said Cowie, who prefers the  traditional dense British fruitcake, of which guests are supposed to take a  piece and place it under their pillow. "But they wanted chocolate cake so I'll  give them chocolate cake." He chuckles. "If you stuck chocolate cake under your  pillow can you imagine what your laundry bill would be?"  </P> <P> When asked if there would be little bride and bridegroom dolls at the top,  Cowie stops for a moment and stares. "No," he sniffs. "I actually think it's  corny. I prefer those fresh white roses, you know, those big garden roses that  open to this size," he says, his hands estimating the circumference of a hefty  grapefruit. "We're having those flown in from Northern California."  </P> <P> There will be no assigned seating, although the happy couple and their families  will take the three tables nearest the black-and-white checkerboard dance  floor. "My concept I think works very well with a California wedding," Cowie  says. "People are not going to be seated at a formal dinner; they'll get to  move, to dance. It'll have a very good flow to it."  </P> <P> Cowie, who has planned and catered parties and weddings for socialites,  celebrities and prominent business people in other parts of the country, Europe  and Africa, said he'll be working with his own staff along with the Playboy  Mansion's staff and chefs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Detailed Instructions  </P> <P> He has mailed out detailed manuals to the crew so there will be nothing left to  chance. Ushers, for instance, "will know not to wear strong cologne, no jewelry  and they ought to be suntanned."  </P> <P> Ought to be suntanned?  </P> <P> "Yes, I think people look better when they have a nice glow to their skin."  </P> <P> The wedding will be videotaped as well as photographed, the latter being done  by former White House photographer and Pulitzer Prize-winner David Hume  Kennerly.  </P> <P> The wedding and reception are strictly off limits to the media. A two-page  advisory sent out last week details when photographs, press releases and "video  news releases" will be available. Playboy personnel are hoping that by allowing  limited coverage they'll avoid the "Apocalypse Now"-style helicopter invasions  that occurred at Madonna and Michael J. Fox's weddings.  </P> <P> Cowie's detail-oriented mind has thought of everything, down to having an extra  pair of shoes a half-size larger on hand for the bride should her feet swell  during the party. He'll be communicating via a walkie-talkie with his staff the  day of the wedding to make sure things run smoothly.  </P> <P> "Kimberley has wanted to keep it as traditional as possible," he says of the  Playmate of the Year. "I think she has a good eye for good things, and when she  sees something that's done in fine taste she recognizes it immediately and will  respond to it. Hef has a very refined eye for detail as well, and he knows what  he likes and doesn't like. I tuned right into them, and everything I've  proposed to do they've given me the go-ahead."  </P> <P> There will be the standard throwing of the garter and the bride's bouquet, and  the couple will honeymoon at the mansion (Hef is a known homebody).  </P> <P> The one thing Cowie hasn't decided on is a wedding present. "I wanted to  purchase the Bulgari drinking cups, but someone already purchased other cups  for them. So I'm back to Square One again. Can you imagine trying to find them  a wedding present? I've been racking my brain for quite a while."  </P> <P> One thing he does know: After the wedding he's going on a nice, long Caribbean  vacation.  </P></p>

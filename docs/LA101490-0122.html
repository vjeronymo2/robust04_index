			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINGING IT ON BEACHES WHERE BUTTERFLIES GO  </P> <P> Monarch butterflies and mellow beaches are the highlights of this coast walk  north of Santa Barbara. Autumn, when the crowds have thinned and the  butterflies have arrived, is a particularly fine time to roam the coast, from  El Capitan State Beach to Refugio State Beach.  </P> <P> El Capitan is a narrow beach at the mouth of El Capitan Creek. Shading the  creek is a woodland of coast live oak and sycamore.  </P> <P> During autumn, monarch butterflies congregate and breed in the trees here. Ask  park rangers where the monarchs cluster in large numbers.  </P> <P> The butterflies have a distinctive coloring -- brownish-red wings with black  veins. The outer edge of the wings are dark brown, with white and yellow spots.  </P> <P> During October and November, the woodland of El Capitan Creek offers the twin  delights of falling autumn leaves and fluttering butterflies.  </P> <P> El Capitan refers to Capt. Jose Francisco de Ortega, a rotund Spanish army  officer who served as trail scout for the Portola expedition. When he retired  from service to the Crown in 1795, he owed the army money and offered to square  things by raising cattle.  </P> <P> The government granted him his chosen land: a coastal strip, two miles wide and  25 miles long, extending from just east of Pt. Conception to Refugio Canyon.  </P> <P> He called his land Nuestra Senora del Refugio, "Our Lady of Refuge." Alas,  Capt. Ortega's retirement was short-lived; he died three years later and was  buried at the Santa Barbara Mission.  </P> <P> After the death of El Capitan, the Ortega family continued living in Refugio  Canyon for many years.  </P> <P> The mouth of the canyon at the Pacific was the major contraband-loading point  for Southern California during the early years of the 19th Century when Spanish  settlers were forbidden to trade with Americans. From the Ortega Ranch, hides,  tallow, leather goods and wine were loaded onto Boston-bound sailing ships.  </P> <P> Smuggling activity came to an end in 1818 when French Capt. (some would say  pirate) Hippoloyte de Bouchard sailed by. Bouchard, a mercenary hired by the  Argentines, who were then struggling for independence against Spain, put ashore  and burned Ortega's ranch buildings to the ground.  </P> <P> Beach, bluff and bike trails link El Capitan and Refugio State beaches.  Depending on the tide, you can usually travel up-coast along El Capitan Beach  as far as Coral Canyon Beach. Then you can join the bluff trails or the bike  path, which is also open to hikers, for the balance of the trip to Refugio  Beach.  </P> <P> El Capitan and Refugio are popular beach campgrounds and nice places to spend a  weekend.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: From Highway 101, 19 miles up-coast from Santa  Barbara, take the El Capitan State Beach exit. Park in one of the day-use  areas. There's a $5 state park day-use fee that is also honored at Refugio and  Gaviota State beaches.  </P> <P> The hike: Descend one of the paths or staircases to the shore, then head  up-coast along the sandy and rocky beach. Sea cliffs are steep here because  they are constantly being cut back by wave erosion. You'll pass wide Coral  Canyon, its walls covered with beds of highly deformed, light-colored shales.  </P> <P> At Coral Beach, the tides often discourage beach-walking, so head up to the  bluffs and follow the bike path.  </P> <P> Approaching Refugio State Beach, you'll see abundant kelp just offshore. If a  breeze is blowing over the water, note how areas with kelp are smooth, while  kelpless areas are rippled.  </P> <P> Refugio State Beach, at the mouth of Refugio Canyon, is a rocky beach with  tidepools. Turn around here or continue beach-walking up-coast (it's 10 more  miles to Gaviota State Beach) for as long as time and tides permit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hiking / Santa Barbara Coast  </P> <P> El Capitan and Refugio State Beaches  </P> <P> Length: Six miles round trip.  </P> <P> Terrain: Sycamore woodland; rocky, sandy beach.  </P> <P> Highlights: Quiet beaches, monarch butterflies.  </P> <P> Degree of Diffculty: Easy.  </P> <P> Precautions: Consult tide table; best at low tide.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the California Department of Parks and Recreation,  Gaviota District, at (805) 968-1033.

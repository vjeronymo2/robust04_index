The eyes and hearts of the peace- and freedom-hungry Angolan  people, in particular, will be following developments in Lusaka  with great interest.    UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye was still in  Luanda this morning, after quick diplomatic visits to Gabon and  Zaire to explain the complexities of the Lusaka peace talks to  the heads of state of those two African nations. Later, Blondin  Beye left for the Zambian capital, where, according to him,  things are likely to start happening at 1400 GMT. This second  round of talks will concentrate solely on political issues,  notably the formation of a new national police force, national  reconciliation, UNITA's participation in government, the future  role of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2, and the setting of  a date for the cease-fire accord to come into force. Military  issues had already been discussed and agreed on after about  three weeks of talks.</p>

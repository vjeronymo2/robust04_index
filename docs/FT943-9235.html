			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Coppelia - Ballet Always let your conscience be your guide. This may be sound moral advice, but in ballet it should take second place to letting music be the guide. By and large, our dancers, choreographers, producers, have been musically sensitive in the past - it was a virtue instilled into our fledgling ballet in the 1930s by Constant Lambert. (Lambert, that superb musician and conductor, that dazzling arbiter of taste, sacrificed something of his own self as composer in serving the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Without him as artistic guide and musical conscience, our national ballet would have been far less good). Musical things have got more brutish of late: scores mauled by obstinate creators, a plethora of junk composition, dancers ploughing through the classics as if tobogganing down a slope. There is no excuse, except arrogance and bad musical education, for the mayhem lately committed on Sylvia or the sound-track provided a few years ago for Frankenstein, or the recent bloodbath of Don Quixote. And in not listening carefully to the ineffable charm of Delibes' Coppelia music, English National Ballet's cast on Monday night were minimising everything they did. ENB ends it summer season on the South Bank with this week's run of that dear and sunny masterpiece. Perhaps the hideous muddle of the Festival Hall itself - a shopping mall in Hades, with its restaurants and bars and stalls and side-shows of amateur dancing and exhibitions of the unlovely and trumpery - has percolated onto the stage. Certainly, the performance of Coppelia I saw, led by Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur, was brisk, jolly, unsubtle, and fatally unresponsive to the music's grace. Delibes' score must be the guide, and Ronald Hynd's staging really knows this. Hynd was inspired by two great Swanildas - Pamela May, Alexandra Danilova (his wife, Annette Page, was also enchanting). The wit and musical responsiveness of such performances echo in this staging, but briskness and peasant jollity (acceptable in its place, but an unrelenting companion all evening) now ride unrestrained through the action. I longed for delicacy, for some expansiveness of style, in almost every interpretation, at every moment. Agnes Oaks projects her view of Swanilda with greater verve than heretofore. It is a buoyant but somehow unrelaxed reading. There are no problems in nipping through the dances, which she does with splendid aplomb. I wish, though, that she would lighten her reading with more innocent grace, and a less determined vivacity. The music's spirit, Delibes' mellifluous and shapely melodies, should be her guide. Thomas Edur is a faultless Frantz. Faced with a character of boundless lack of interest - the role was only intriguing when played, as it was created, by a pretty girl en travesti at the Paris Opera - Edur lives every moment with a wonderful enthusiasm, and dances with impeccable ease. He alone warms, illuminates the evening. The Coppelius, on whom much depends, was Wayne Sleep. He is too astute a player not to seize every opportunity, but it is as himself rather than as Coppelius that he does so. The role, and the central crisis of the story - which is the creation of life by alchemical means - is lost. From everyone else, bounce, peasant gaiety, furred jerkins, and expressions of extravagant joy. What fun they have] What fun, indeed, the audience has] I wish, though, that we might have seen what Delibes score was really about. English National Ballet's summer season is sponsored by Nomura. It continues, with Coppelia, until the end of this week.</p>

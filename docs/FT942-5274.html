			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Selling beer for a smoked-salmon life: Motoko Rich and William Lewis on the trade driving brewers into disagreement with the Treasury In the hot, dusty car park of a warehouse less than a mile from the Calais ferry port in France three British men loaded 40 cases of German lager into a tatty red van. As they shoved boxes between plastic bags of duty-free whisky and wine they traded insults and braggadacio with the staff of EastEnders, a cash and carry which caters to bulk buyers. 'This lot will all be gone tomorrow,' a twenty-something man boasted. Identified only as Ernie, he lurched forward and declared: 'I make bundles of money. You want to know how much? Think smoked salmon on Friday, veal on Sunday.' His friend, about 30-years-old with freckles, a visible belly and a fading tattoo, talked specifics. 'We sell it around and it's Pounds 1,000 a week for each of us,' he said. 'It's hard work, but it's worth it.' These men, and others like them - including an 11-man gang from Cardiff whose three ringleaders were jailed last week - are taking advantage of the mammoth duty differential between the UK and France. A duty ratio of seven to one on beer, nearly 50 to one on wine and just over two to one on spirits has prompted them to shuttle between the UK and the Continent to bring back alcohol for re-sale at home. Such activities have initiated a growing rift between brewers and the government. Mr Robin Simpson, director of the Brewers and Licensed Retailers' Association, says the duty differential provides a 'direct incentive to organised crime'. Brewers claim sales of smuggled beer are eroding the British drinks market at the rate of Pounds 1bn a year. They also say the illegal trade costs the Treasury Pounds 40m a year in beer duty and value added tax alone. These industry protests have met with scepticism at the Treasury. Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, said: 'There has not so far been a haemorrhaging of duty receipts.' In 1993, the first year of the single market when travellers in the European Union could bring in alcohol up to the level of personal consumption, revenue from alcohol duty was up, if only by less than 1 per cent for beer receipts. Customs &amp; Excise estimates the dutiable value of all undetected bootleg goods - beer, wine, spirits and tobacco - at Pounds 35m. But Customs officers on the ground say their policing efforts only 'touch on the subject' and anecdotes of a burgeoning black market in excise goods are rife. So how much is going on and how organised is it? The recent conviction of the Cardiff gang, as well as a Wolverhampton trio who admitted evading duty on alcohol and cigarettes worth more than Pounds 73,000 last month, has led to suspicions of a growing organised element. But most of the stories - and the cases which Customs has dealt with - concern small-time operators, unemployed or low-paid people trying to make some extra money. Mr Don Price, a senior Customs officer in south Wales, said: 'We believe the entrepreneur type of bootlegger - the guy who hires a van and goes over to France and then flogs the stuff around the council estates - is the most prevalent at the moment.' In two trips to Calais over the past two weeks we found that Transit vans, assumed by brewers to be used primarily for carrying alcohol for re-sale in the UK, comprised no more than 10 per cent of vehicles on ferries. One group we met in Calais said they made the trip from the Isle of Dogs in London to France or Belgium five times a week. One said: 'The key is having a buyer lined up beforehand. I have a mate who goes on a milk round.' John, another Londoner who travels regularly to France and brings back vanloads of beer or wine to sell to friends and family, seems typical of the illegal trade. He said: 'As far as I'm concerned it's not organised. It's just off-the-cuff stuff. We are not great big cartels or anything like that.' Customs is keen, however, to crack any group trafficking excise goods on a regular basis. Since the single market opened 250 excise verification officers have been deployed to track the trade inland. The officers make regular visits to clubs, pubs and off-licences looking for proof of illegal sales. On a recent visit to a run-down workmen's club in Barry, on the outskirts of Cardiff, three officers found only a one-litre bottle of whisky and two 25cl bottles of cheap French lager. Mr Charles Templing, one of the officers, said: 'All we have is a couple bottles. What you want is cases of it.' Customs has detected 1,588 cases of cross-channel smuggling to date. The total revenue value of the goods seized amounts to Pounds 2.3m. The seized alcohol and tobacco are stored in warehouses in 21 regions around the country. In Cardiff, Customs has filled three rooms with contraband. In Dover a week's worth of booty is stacked three feet deep in a 20 sq ft confinement. In spite of the volume of goods being seized, excise verification officers believe there is much they cannot catch. Mr Noel Weare, an officer in south Wales, said: 'The bootleggers are virtually getting away with it. Unless Customs increases the enforcement role or decreases the duty then the problem will increase. I do not think they realise the scale of this thing.' The scale of the trade is vigorously disputed, but clearly there is some hype involved. Mr Kostadinoski Goce, manager of a warehouse for Pidou, a cash and carry in Calais, initially said about 50 vans a day now shopped at Pidou, but when no vans appeared at his warehouse on our second trip to see him he revised his estimate to 'anything between one and 25'. He said business was at its height from October to December, when he claimed more than 100 vans a day came to the warehouse, spending as much as Pounds 1,200 a vanload. Mr Dave West, owner of EastEnders, said about 150 vans made a daily 'beer run' to Calais. Around Christmas, he said, the traffic stepped up to more than 1,000 vans a day. Many of his customers admitted to selling the alcohol. Mr West believes it is the hype, rather than the duty differential, which has created the trade. 'Every time the brewers and Customs get worried about it, they give it more publicity,' he said. 'Then the people who did not even know it was cheaper over here get the idea to come over.'</p>

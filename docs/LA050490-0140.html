			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: FORD TARGETS UCI'S RED INK  </P> <P> It is Tom Ford's third day on the job and his office is still designed in  Modern Cardboard, but behind the stacks of unpacked boxes, UC Irvine's new  athletic director is doing his best to get acclimated.  </P> <P> A ceramic Anteater pin is affixed to Ford's coat lapel. His navy necktie is  dotted with tiny yellow Anteaters.  </P> <P> But more than just wear them, Ford has done research.  </P> <P> "I checked a book out of the library, just to understand and learn more about  anteaters," Ford says. "Maybe we should get a live one.  </P> <P> "At Houston, we had a live Cougar. Baylor has their bear. Texas has Bevo (a  longhorn steer) and the Aggies have their dogs."  </P> <P> But Ford went by the book and the idea went by the wayside.  </P> <P> "I read that they're quite destructive to land," he says. "They're going to dig  up an acre real quick.  </P> <P> "So, we're probably going to stick with the bronze statue in front of the Bren  Center."  </P> <P> Ford, they say, is thorough. Give him a problem and he'll file a report on it,  complete with three-ring binder and plastic dividers. Ask him about  fund-raising and he'll whip up a quick lecture on the athletic endowment  program.  </P> <P> Name him athletic director and he'll commission a personal study on the mascot.  </P> <P> This is a valuable quality, considering the close attention Irvine's sports  program presently needs. Irvine's athletic teams have been operating in the red  for at least the past six years -- and for most years since the school turned  Division I in 1977.  </P> <P> Ford was hired on April 16 to try and find a different color ink.  </P> <P> Fund-raising is Ford's background. In addition to his two years as athletic  director at the University of Houston, Ford also spent three years as the  school's associate athletic director in charge of fund development. Most  recently, Ford ran a consulting firm known as Pacific Research Associates,  which, basically, conducted inventory of major college sports programs.  </P> <P> "Most of the schools that we went to were undergoing a transition of athletic  directors," Ford says, "where an outside, unbiased group is needed to make some  decisions.  </P> <P> "Generally, at those institutions, it was all financially driven, probably  relative to revenues being a shortfall. In some cases, we'd make  recommendations to the sports programs -- maybe eliminate some sports, maybe  make some suggestions about promotion and marketing."  </P> <P> In short, Ford was an athletic department trouble-shooter. And, this spring,  one name stood out at the top of his hit list.  </P> <P> UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Ford never got the chance to go in as an outside observer. At the same time,  UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis contacted Ford about the AD vacancy at  Irvine and nominated him to the board of chancellors.  </P> <P> By mid-April, Ford's job had gone inside.  </P> <P> "The chancellor mentioned to me that he'd like this to be 'the Berkeley of the  South,' where the emphasis is on academics first and athletics second," Ford  says. "Well, Berkeley's athletic program is improving, especially in  basketball. But I told the chancellor I'd prefer us to be 'the Duke of the  West.' "  </P> <P> Irvine has a ways to go. For one, Duke has students who enjoy going to  basketball games.  </P> <P> "I recently sat down with a student representative," Ford said, "and,  basically, there's not a lot of (student) interest there. . . . With all the UC  schools, there's a certain amount of apathy toward intercollegiate athletics.  The students here are students first; their commitment to study time outside  the classroom is high.  </P> <P> "This is where winning comes in. Our students are going to prudently decide  where to spend their leisure time and dollars. We need to let them know who  we're playing and when we're playing. And, we need to win."  </P> <P> Basketball being the high-visibility sport at Irvine, Ford has made it a high  priority. If you want to attract fans and sponsors and athletic endowments,  Ford reasons, your bread-and-butter sport had better be better than 5-23.  </P> <P> "I think Bill (Mulligan) has done a good job recruiting this year and landed  three impact players," Ford says. "His contract was rolled over for another  year just before I got here, which I think was the right thing to do.  </P> <P> "Even though he had a poor record this year, Bill has had good success in the  past. He needs more resources to be successful on the Division I level -- and  he hasn't had them."  </P> <P> Translation: Ford needs to get Mulligan the money, and the schedule, to recruit  on a national level.  </P> <P> "A few impact players are all you need in basketball," Ford says. "The year  Akeem Olajuwon stepped out of a taxicab in front of my office at Houston.  That's how we recruited him. Clyde Drexler. Scott Brooks and Kevin Magee here.  It doesn't take much in basketball."  </P> <P> Ford is planning to look into it now that the riddle of the Anteater has been  solved.  </P> <P> "You know," Ford says, "we don't even have the most unique nickname in college  sports. No, it's Scottsdale Community College. They're the Artichokes. Their  colors are pink and green. They've won a national championship in golf."  </P> <P> Ford grins.  </P> <P> "I much prefer 'Anteater.' "  </P> <P> At least from a marketing standpoint, it's easier to swallow.  </P></p>

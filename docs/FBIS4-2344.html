			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  (CPPCC) National Committee, met with visiting Finnish Prime  Minister Esko Aho here today.    Extending Aho a welcome on the CPPCC's behalf, Li expressed  the belief that Aho's China visit will greatly boost the  existing friendship between the two countries.    Li said China is now focusing its attention on modernization  construction and that it has achieved a lot in every field over  the past decade.    However, as a large and populous country, China faces many  difficulties in striving toward modernization, Li said.    China needs a stable and harmonious domestic situation as  well as a peaceful and friendly external environment, Li said.    He noted that despite all the changes on the world stage,  the  relations between China and Finland remain as good as ever and  that these ties can be described as a model of friendly  cooperation between countries with different social systems.    He expressed the hope that both sides make efforts to expand  cooperation and further consolidate and develop friendly  bilateral ties.    Aho expressed agreement with this. Finland and China have  been cooperating in political and economic and trade fields for  a long period of time, aho said.    The two economies are complementary and have great potential  for cooperation, he said, adding that his visit is sure to  further promote the development of these and other ties.    During the meeting, Li also briefed the guests on the  CPPCC's  national role, China's economic restructuring and its political  reform.    Also today, Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for  the Promotion of International Trade, hosted a luncheon in Aho's  honor.    The Finnish prime minister told all the participants that  Finnish-China cooperation in infrastructure, telecommunications,  environmental protection and other fields has great potential.</p>

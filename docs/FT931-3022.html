			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Revenue-neutral tax measures - Lloyd's Underwriters This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE chancellor proposed in his Budget to introduce a package of measures to reform the tax arrangements applying to Lloyd's underwriters. Overall the reform is revenue-neutral. The main features are: A new tax deductible reserve, replacing the present limited special reserve fund, to enable underwriters to put aside profits free of tax to meet future losses. Removing the special treatment of gains on assets representing invested premiums and incorporating them in trading profits. A more coherent and comprehensive set of rules for taxing receipts and giving relief for various expenses. The chancellor's intention is to help underwriters build up reserves to meet future losses and to simplify and rationalise the present system of taxing underwriters. The chancellor proposed in his Budget to introduce a power to make regulations about the timing of repayments to friendly societies which have some tax-exempt business. The chancellor's intention is that the present concessional arrangements under which these societies receive repayments of tax should be replaced by a statutory scheme coming into effect on January 1 1994. It is proposed that the new repayment arrangements will be based on the existing rules for repaying income tax to both friendly societies and life assurance companies in respect of their pension business. The new provision will allow regulations to be made to adapt the pension business rules to the circumstances of friendly societies with some tax-exempt business.</p>

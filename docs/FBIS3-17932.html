Shipovskiy]    [Text] [video opens with men in uniform sitting at table  taking part in meeting] [Belov] During a visit by Russian  First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin to St. Petersburg  a whole range of problems was finally resolved. For instance,  his meeting with heads of the city's leading industrial  enterprises outlined some ways to eliminate the chronic crisis  of unpaid debts in the defense industry. During a visit to the  Petr Velikiy, a nuclear-powered heavy missile cruiser which is  under construction, the intention of both the Defense Ministry  and the workers themselves to commission the ship on schedule  was confirmed. This offers the hope that, despite funding  difficulties, the Russian Navy is beginning to see a revival in  its fortunes.    [A. Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense minister,  identified by caption] I believe that by the joint efforts of  the fleet, the Defense Ministry, and the shipyard the  construction of this ship will be completed and it will join the  Navy.</p>

Speaking at the local  government conference at the World Trade Centre outside  Johannesburg, Mr de Klerk said the end of township rent and  services boycotts would help pay the R[rand]1.8 billion township  services debt. It would also impact enormously on the cash flow  of local authorities. "But it is a matter of debate whether  that will be enough to redress the legacy of the past. I do not  think so."    It was accepted that the financing and implementation of  upgrading local services would require regional and national  support. Something more would be needed, however, and many  local authorities would be in a position to make substantial  contributions. "For the sake of peace and stability I believe  they should do so."</p>

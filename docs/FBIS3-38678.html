Beilin said this was not a case of lip service, seeing that  it is inconceivable that Iranian officials should be given an  audience while Ron Arad is rotting in captivity.    During his three-day stay, Deputy Minister Beilin conferred  with top German Foreign Ministry officials, including the deputy  foreign minister.    Kinkel earlier conferred with Arab League Chairman  'Abd-al-Majid, who was visiting Bonn. He told Beilin that there  is a chance the Arab League might lift the boycott on subsidiary  companies, due to the positive developments in the peace  process, and that, contrary to his custom, 'Abd-al-Majid sounded  optimistic about the success of the peace process.    Kinkel opined that failure to comply with the timetable for  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho could affect credibility in the  negotiations with the Palestinians.    The foreign minister promised to support Israel and  facilitate its discussions with the European Union on the  renewal of trade agreements when Germany has its turn as  president in the second half of 1994. Also, Germany will  reconsider its involvement in the multilateral talks in view of  Israel's contentions that it has neglected and ignored the  subject compared to Japan and the United States.    Kinkel stressed to Beilin that Germany will continue to  uphold its special bilateral relations with the State of Israel.  He evinced interest in the referendum on a Golan withdrawal and  the possibility of intense negotiations with the Syrians in  anticipation of a peace agreement.</p>

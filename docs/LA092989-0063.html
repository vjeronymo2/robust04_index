			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES;  </P> <P> BRANIFF CUTS FLIGHTS, TRIMS WORK FORCE BY 2,700  </P> <P> Braniff sharply cut its schedule to two only flights Thursday, just hours after  filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.  </P> <P> The Orlando-based airline said it expected to resume service to Los Angeles  Friday, as it expands its schedule to seven flights today and eight flights  over the weekend.  </P> <P> The airline sharply reduced its work force to 2,000 from 4,700 and slashed  flight destinations to five from 40. It normally had about 250 flights daily.  </P> <P> Braniff Chairman William G. McGee blamed competition from stronger airlines for  Braniff's woes. "Major airlines enjoy a distinct advantage over small carriers  in their use of computer reservation systems, frequent flier packages," and  their control of landing rights at airports in New York, Washington and  Chicago, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsecured Debts  </P> <P> McGee said that Braniff ran low on cash during the last few months and was  unable to arrange a $75-million cash infusion. The airline's finances were also  strained by its move from Dallas to Orlando and its $3.5-billion order for 50  Airbus A320 aircraft and options to buy another 50, he said.  </P> <P> Braniff's quarterly statement showed it had only $3 million in cash at the end  of July, while it had current debts of $169.9 million.  </P> <P> In its bankruptcy filing Thursday, Braniff said it had assets totaling $326  million and liabilities of $347.3 million, about $297 million of that  unsecured. Among its biggest unsecured creditors are American Airlines, Dalfort  Corp., a Dallas firm that formerly owned Braniff and is controlled by Jay A.  Pritzker, and the New York investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> Dalfort said it was owed $15 million for aircraft maintenance work, and a  Drexel spokesman said the firm held $15 million in privately placed Braniff  debt. American is owed $21.3 million that it loaned to Braniff as part of a  deal to lease aircraft.  </P> <P> Despite the airline's fragile cash position, Leon Foreman, one of Braniff's  bankruptpcy lawyers, said the airline had enough money to meet its  pre-bankruptcy payroll.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action Was a Surprise  </P> <P> For many Braniff employees, this was the second time they had been through the  turmoil of a bankruptcy with the company. After an overly ambitious expansion,  the airline filed for bankruptcy in May, 1982. It emerged two years later owned  by hotel magnate Pritzker, chairman of Hyatt Corp. Pritzker sold all but 10% of  his stake to a group led by Philadelphia financier Jeffrey R. Chodorow, whose  investments also include a doll manufacturer, and New York real estate investor  Arthur G. Cohen.  </P> <P> Cindy Yeast, a spokeswoman for the Assn. of Flight Attendants, said two-thirds  of Braniff's 900 flight attendants had been through the first bankruptcy seven  years ago. Though Braniff's poor financial condition came as no surprise, she  said, "no one expected them to act so quickly and so drastically."  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for the employees who had to go through this twice," said Howard  Putnam, chairman of Braniff during the first bankruptcy. He said employees had  taken hefty concessions to get the carrier back on its feet under a five-year  agreement that ended in March.  </P> <P> Putnam said he wasn't surprised by Braniff's second bankruptcy. "They changed  their strategy," he said. "They moved into Kansas City and Orlando and they  became a higher fare carrier. They drove away their passengers or they ran  themselves out of cash."  </P> <P> Airline industry analysts said that Braniff's new management probably tried to  expand too quickly. Analysts said the move to Orlando was costly and could have  been put off until the company was more financially secure. In addition,  analysts said that while Braniff needed to replenish its aging fleet, the new  aircraft added a huge cost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Customers Calm  </P> <P> "My gut feeling is they tried to do too much too fast," said Paul Turk, an  analyst with Avmark, a Washington aviation consulting firm.  </P> <P> Travel agents said Thursday that Braniff customers took the flight  cancellations in stride. "I expected a lot of upset people, but most customers  were pretty calm," said Kimberly Denning, an agent with Ask Mr. Foster agency  in Kansas City.  </P> <P> Denning said her employer protected customers by issuing them new tickets on  other airlines. A number of airlines, including Continental, American and  America West, were honoring Braniff tickets on a stand-by basis.  </P> <P> Time staff writer Robert E. Dallos in New York contributed to this story.  </P></p>

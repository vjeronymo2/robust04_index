			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (13): Bridgehead for ABB - A power engineering success story The Czech Republic has represented a special opportunity in central Europe for ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group. For one thing, the country is likely to be a big market for the Zurich-based group's products. Programmes to renovate power generation and distribution infrastructure have high priority in the Czech Republic. For another, the very strong tradition of engineering skills in the country offers ABB a fresh pool of talent to add to its global network. 'There is a strong urge among the people, especially in Bohemia, to get back their industrial strength,' says Mr Erik Fougner, ABB's country manager in the Czech Republic. ABB's advance into the republic began in 1990, and the group has been an active participant in the privatisation process. To date, it has established six operating subsidiaries mainly based on existing Czech companies, some of them in joint ventures. The most important of these is ABB Prvni brnenska strojirna Brno (ABB PRS), based on the First Brno Engineering Works, a power engineering company dating from early in the 19th century. ABB and PRS established their joint venture in April 1993, taking the core of PRS's boiler, turbine and power plant operations and 3,800 employees. ABB has a two-thirds stake. Last year, ABB also acquired EJF, a Brno-based maker of switchgear for all voltage levels. Its other Czech subsidiaries include ABB Energo, a supplier of power transmission and network control systems, ABB Lummus Chemoproject, which supplies engineering services and ABB Elektro-Praga, a producer of household electrical fittings. In addition, a division was set up in 1991 to sell ABB's process instrumentation, robots and AC and DC drives. Altogether, the group employs just under 7,000 people in the Czech Republic and operates 13 factories. No business figures have been published, but Mr Fougner says new orders totalled approximately Dollars 220m in the first half of this year, as much as in the whole of last year. Except for Elektro-Praga, all of the group's activity is directed at the large-scale power generation and distribution market. It has not attempted to bring its railway locomotive business to the republic. Mr Fougner points out that strict new anti-pollution laws come into force in the Czech republic in 1998, so the potential for contracts to clean up or renovate existing power plants is considerable. The group has just won an order to install its new pressurised fluidised bed combustion (PFBC) system to renovate a coal-fired plant at Trebovice, and Mr Fougner hopes for many more such contracts. The group's Czech companies are also very quickly winning themselves roles within the overall ABB organisation. Mr Fougner says that exports from the Czech Republic now amount to about a quarter of turnover with imports at about the same level. He expects exports to rise to 40 or 50 per cent of turnover and for the Czech companies to become net exporters. ABB has transferred technology in several areas - boilers, turbines, coal combustion, medium voltage switchgear, engineering tools and household fittings - to its Czech companies. PRS has been designated the group's single European supplier of waste heat boilers. The priority now is on bringing the companies' performance up to western standards, in terms of productivity and quality. 'We are getting very close, although the mix of capital and labour is not the same as in the west,' Mr Fougner says. All the companies are in various stages of earning their ISO 9001 certification, and all but one are expected to have it by the end of next year. ABB's Czech companies have not been too badly hurt by the separation of Slovakia. Most of the operations were on the Czech side. ABB's Czech offices are no longer responsible for Slovakia, although that country remains an important market for many of the Czech companies' products. Relations with ABB subsidiaries in other central and eastern European countries are at a formative stage. Poland is the only other country with a substantial ABB presence, with Russia coming up quickly. Other large Swiss companies have ventured into the Czech republic in the past few years. The foods group Nestle was a pioneer, joining forces with BSN, the leading French food group, in 1992 to take over the country's biggest food producer, Cokoladovny, with 8,000 employees in 15 plants across both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There was speculation at the time that Cokoladovny would be split up in a few years, with Nestle taking the confectionery business and BSN the biscuits. This has not yet happened, and Nestle indicates the existing arrangement is still working well. Holderbank, the Swiss-based cement group, is one of five leading western European cement makers that have invested heavily in the Czech Republic in recent years, partly to prevent exports from the country upsetting western European markets. Ceva Prachovice, the Holderbank subsidiary, suffered a 12.5 per cent decline in volume sales of cement last year to 1.06m tonnes, and market conditions continue to be difficult. Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, said last month that operations in eastern Europe were making only 'a very modest' contribution to profit. A more unexpected source of large Swiss activity in the Czech Republic is the publishing industry. Ringier, one of Switzerland's biggest publishers, produces Blesk, a highly successful saucy tabloid newspaper in the republic as well as Profit, a popular business newspaper and some 20 other titles. Mr Jurg Marquard, another Swiss publisher who has expanded in eastern Europe, publishes Czech versions of the pop culture magazine, Popcorn and Divka (Girl).</p>

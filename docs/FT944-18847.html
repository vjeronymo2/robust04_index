			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Benetton disappoints with small profits rise Shares in Benetton, the Italian-based clothing group, fell sharply yesterday after it announced a rise in net profit to L100.5bn (Dollars 64.7m) in the first half of 1994, from L98.6bn in the equivalent 1993 period. Operating profit, however, fell by 8.5 per cent to L193bn from L211bn, as the company persisted with the price-cutting policy introduced two years ago to combat the international slump in consumer demand. Investors were disappointed with the performance, and marked the shares down by 4.7 per cent, to L20,927, in a depressed Milan stock market. Benetton said it expected the full-year increase in net profit to be 'slightly higher' than the 1.9 per cent first-half improvement. In 1993, Benetton's consolidated profits rose 12.6 per cent to L208bn. The continuation of the price-reduction policy in the first half - with cuts ranging from 6 per cent in Italy to 28 per cent in Japan - allowed Benetton to pursue its increase in sales volume. Total turnover rose slightly to L1,367bn from L1,362bn.</p>

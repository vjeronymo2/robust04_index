			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 4 FIREFIGHTERS HURT IN FACTORY FIRE  </P> <P> A fire raced through a sofa factory in Sepulveda, causing $700,000 in damage  and slightly injuring four firefighters, the Los Angeles Fire Department said  this morning.  </P> <P> The cause of the blaze at Krause's Sofa Factory, a large one-story  warehouse-style building, was unknown and under investigation, Fire Department  spokesman Jim Wells said.  </P> <P> The fire broke out at 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, Wells said. About 70 firefighters  were able to control the fire in 40 minutes.  </P> <P> While firefighters were battling the blaze, an apparent air draft inside the  building caused a fireball to explode through a side door, Fire Department  officials said. The blast shattered the windows on one fire truck parked on  Orion Street and flames singed another truck.  </P> <P> Four firefighters suffered minor injuries while fighting the blaze, including  one man who was struck in the leg by a fire hose that broke loose, officials  said. Two firefighters were treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and  released, and the other two were treated at the scene by paramedics.  </P> <P> A pool supply company adjoining the factory was also slightly damaged by the  blaze, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> KIRIBATI'S PRESIDENT TABAI STRESSES SELF-RELIANCE;  </P> <P> LEADER OF PACIFIC ISLAND STATE MARCHES TO OWN DRUMMER  </P> <P> On a sultry equatorial afternoon, Ieremia Tabai welcomes guests to his  presidential office. He is dressed in a pinstriped shirt, shorts and bare feet.  He exudes quiet confidence and a down-to-earth pragmatism.  </P> <P> In a decade of leadership, such traits have made Kiribati's president one of  the most respected of the Pacific Island leaders.  </P> <P> Where many resource-poor island nations have become dependent on infusions of  foreign aid, Tabai still bangs the drum of self-reliance. "It is better to  subsist on your own than to rely on someone. It is hard for the people. But I  am convinced we can do it," the bearded leader said.  </P> <P> Many might consider Tabai's optimism unrealistic. In addition to typical  problems of crowded, typhoon-prone island nations lying thousands of miles from  major markets, the Republic of Kiribati (pronounced Kiribass) has its share of  unique development hurdles:  </P> <P> * The size of Kiribati poses challenges for transportation, communication and  government management. The micro-state consists of 65,000 people living on 33  coral island specks strewn across an ocean area as wide as the continental  United States.  </P> <P> * In 1979, when it gained independence from Britain, Kiribati lost its largest  revenue source when mining of phosphate ore from Banaba Island ceased because  of a dispute with landowners. Government income was halved and export earnings  fell 80%. The nation was left with coconuts and fish as exports.  </P> <P> * Scientists are now warning that rising sea levels, due to the so-called  greenhouse effect, could flood low-lying atolls. Kiribati could become a nation  of "environmental refugees."  </P> <P> Yet Tabai insists Kiribati will overcome these hurdles. His attitude is  typified by his now legendary refusal of certain aid.  </P> <P> In 1985, he canceled a multimillion-dollar British aid agreement. He decided to  curb spending rather than to continue reliance on foreign handouts to subsidize  the government's recurring operational costs.  </P> <P> Recently, Tabai gave politely declined Australia's offer to give 20 cars for  chauffeuring regional leaders when they gather in Tarawa for this year's South  Pacific Forum meeting in July. "It's embarrassing for me to receive Bob Hawke  in my country in his car. I prefer to receive them in a car I've bought  myself."  </P> <P> Tabai has a commerce degree from Victoria University in Wellington, New  Zealand, and keeps a tight hold on his nation's purse strings. Government  spending has been slashed, in real terms, by 5% a year since 1979. But spending  is still more than the revenue from the nation's limited sources. Budgetary  shortfalls are covered by interest from the $148 million in the Revenue  Equalization Reserve Fund. The fund, an accumulation of phosphate royalties,  has been praised as a model for developing countries.  </P> <P> But the loss of the phosphate exports has meant Kiribati runs a trade deficit  of $8 million to $16 million annually. To boost exports, Kiribati is developing  small businesses, such as garment making -- something other island states have  done successfully. And efforts are under way to curb food imports, as sweet  aromas from the new Tarawa Biscuit factory attest. "Already it's producing 60%  of local requirements," Tabai boasts.  </P> <P> But economic growth since independence has been sluggish, at best. A  government-funded fishing company has struggled to break even. Yet, Tabai  remains confident. He's excited about an Italian developer's plans to build a  $160-million resort complex on Fanning Island -- possibly breaking ground next  year. Apart from a few sports fishermen, not many tourists visit Kiribati. The  Fanning Island project could put this out-of-the-way nation on travelers' maps.  </P> <P> And Tabai hopes to restart the phosphate mines. He recently reached a verbal  agreement with landowners on Banaba. "If all goes well, we will start mining  again next year," he said.  </P> <P> In recent years, royalty payments from foreign boats fishing in Kiribati waters  have generated some funds -- and controversy. In 1985, Tabai shocked Washington  and Canberra by giving the Soviet Union fishing access rights. It was the  Soviets' first island toehold in a region long dominated by Western interests.  The agreement lapsed after a year, when Tabai refused to lower access fees. But  for the right price, he said, the Soviets would be welcome back.  </P></p>

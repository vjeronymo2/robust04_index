			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Drug company raises Pounds 10m for growth CHIROS, a new company specialising in refining drug manufacturing techniques, is expected next week to raise Pounds 10m from venture capitalists and institutions ahead of a flotation probably early next year. The placing has been arranged by Mr Chris Evans, a microbiologist and the company's founder, and Mr Nowell Stebbing, a former co-ordinator of research at Genentech and more recently Amgen. Many pharmaceutical compounds, although chemically pure, are made up of slightly different substances or isomers. Each has the same atoms but they are arranged differently. Only one isomer will carry most of the therapeutic activity. The other, because of the different structure, can have toxic side effects, as was the case with Thalidomide. Chiros has developed what it believes is a unique collection of technical knowledge to isolate the beneficial forms to make purer drugs and intermediary compounds for large pharmaceutical companies. Mr Evans says Chiros is meeting a demand from the largest pharmaceutical companies to produce new drugs, and to modify existing formulations, that exist as single isomers. There is some competiton, but he says Chiros is ahead of the field in the difficult procedures required to make single isomers. The shares are being placed with Schroder Ventures, Apax Partners, 3i Group and Mr Evans, who provided the Pounds 3m seed capital when the company was formed last year. Mr Evans, who is chief scientific officer, says Chiros will pursue three business strands. It will supply purer intermediary products to companies like Glaxo and Wellcome and forcasts sales of Pounds 30m a year within six years. It will be involved in the clinical development of single isomer versions of drugs that are now are only available in multi-isomer form. Chiros thinks two drugs will have been launched and several others will be in late clinical development within six years. And it will try to develop new drugs for eventual licensing or clinical development. Though no products are likely to be launched before 1999.</p>

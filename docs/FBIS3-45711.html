Qiao Shi stressed: In developing its relations with Germany,  China focuses not only on this century but also on the 21st  century. China approaches its relations with Germany from a  strategic point of view.    He expressed the hope that China and Germany will develop  long- term and stable friendship and cooperation over the next  century based on the principles of seeking common ground while  reserving differences; mutual trust, equality, and mutual  benefit.    In pointing out the series of important agreements signed in  Beijing last November, Kohl pledged to abide by the things that  he promised. He said he believed that Germany and China share  special ties and that the two countries should closely cooperate  not only in the economic field but also in other areas, such as  science and technology and culture.

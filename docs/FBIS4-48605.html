			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Connie Molusi] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 21 SAPA -- State President Nelson  Mandela on Saturday vowed to go ahead with his Reconstruction  and Development Programme [RDP] as a tribute to fellow  countrymen who had sacrificed themselves in the anti-apartheid  struggle -- in spite of criticism of the huge spending involved.  Speaking at the funeral service of his former co-accused and  fellow Robben Island prisoner Elias Motsoaledi in Soweto, Mr  Mandela said delivering on the ANC election promises was the  best tribute to the victims of apartheid and its stalwarts.    The RDP programme came under criticism this week, with  experts predicting it would cost between 80 and 90 billion rand,  more than twice the initial ANC costing of 39 billion rand over  five years. He said the ANC-led government of national unity was  constituted by people from different backgrounds, with genuine  and well-meaning white colleagues not used to huge expenditures  to meet the needs of African people.    Defending the RDP, Mr Mandela said the ANC leadership came  from a background of squalor and misery and understood the  deprivation of black South Africans better than their white  colleagues who had had a wealthy and comfortable upbringing.  "Delivery on the RDP should not threaten the property of  minorities and their living standards, but have to meet the  expectations of people within a reasonable space of time.    "There are minorities in this country who believe the  implementation of this programme will lead to falling living  standards."    But he added that a balance had to be maintained between  uplifting the black majority and not destroying the wealth the  country already had.    While there was broad agreement, the ANC leadership would  have to take the initiative for delivering quality education,  electricity and water in urban and rural areas, he added.    Mr Mandela took off time from his tight schedule to share  his  experiences with Mr Motsoaledi during their long spell of  imprisonment on Robben Island. Paying tribute to a comrade and  their long friendship, he said Mr Motsoaledi had helped ordinary  people regain their pride and dignity and had inspired hope. "We  are honouring a man who helped to end South Africa's isolation."    "Motsoaledi was a non-conformist. He did not agree with  ideas  unless he considered them carefully.    "He was a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation]  (the ANC's armed wing) and was crucial in recruiting and sending  young people out the country for military training."    He said Mr Motsoaledi's experiences should inspire young  people to know that an ordinary person without education could  pull himself up by his bootstraps to assume the stature of a  national figure.    Among those gathered at the stadium to pay their last  respects were former prison mates Pan Africanist Congress  President Clarence Makwetu, ANC stalwart Walter Sisulu, First  Deputy Preisdent Thabo Mbeki and human rights lawyer George  Bizos.</p>

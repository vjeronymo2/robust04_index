Liupanshui City  will become a transportation node forming the Gui-Kun  [Guiyang-Kunming] Railroad, Nan-Kun Railroad, Nei-Kun  [Neijiang-Kunming] Railroad, Zhu-Liu [Zhuzhou-Liupanshui]  Multiple Railroad, Shui-Xiao [Shuicheng-Panxian] Railroad, and  Pan-Bai [Panxian-Baise] high-grade highway, running north to  Chengdu, west to Kunming, south to Beihai and Fangcheng, and  east to Guiyang and Zhuzhou, making it a key communication hub  for southwest China.    Liupanshui City is south China's biggest coal base area, but  because of communication limitations, it has had overstocks of  millions of tons of raw coal, coking coal, and refined coal  every year for many years. At the same time, demand for coal has  been constantly growing in nearby Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan,  Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces and autonomous regions and  some enterprises have had to shut down because of coal  shortages. The 10 million tons-plus of coal produced each year  in the Liupanshui Mining Region have only been able to rely on  the Gui-Kun Railroad and Panxi Railroad branchline which have  been overloaded for many years, so the important role of  Jiangnan's Coal Capital has been hard to foster due to  communication restrictions.    During the past several years, because of the extremely  acute  energy resource shortages in the south China and southwest China  economic regions, the state has been reconsidering the role and  status of the new energy resource city Liupanshui City. It has  included Liupanshui in the state's Panxi-Liupanshui resource  development zone, and it has decided to invest in the short term  10 billion yuan to develop Liupanshui's energy resource and raw  materials industries and has started with a large-scale  investment in communication construction for Liupanshui to turn  it into a railroad crossroads within five years. The Panxian  section of the Nan-Kun Railroad which is already under  construction is now being speeded up. Preparations for the  initial engineering for the Shui-Xiao Railroad from Shuicheng to  Panxian are now ready, and it is possible that construction may  begin soon. A decision has already been made for a short-term  return of construction on the Nei-Kun Railroad from Neijiang in  Sichuan to Kunming in Yunnan and to connect it at Dawan in  Shuicheng. The additional line for the Liupanshui to Zhuzhou,  Hunan Railroad is now being surveyed and plans call for it to be  opened to traffic in five years. The site for southwest China's  biggest railroad marshalling yard has now been chosen at Shilong  Village in Fenghuang Township, Zhongshan Prefecture.  Construction of the Pan-Bai high-grade highway from Baise in  Guangxi to Panxian in Guizhou is now underway. A preliminary  discussion has already been conducted for the project to extend  the Gui-Huang high-grade highway to Shuicheng. It has been  projected that within five years Liupanshui's railroad  transportation capacity can be increased almost 10-fold compared  to now, and the density of its railway network will be the  greatest in southwest China.    Since large-scale development in the 1960s at Liupanshui,  the  1990s have welcomed a second golden era. The economic  development program recently approved by the State Council fully  confirms the strategic status and important role of Liupanshui  in south and southwest China's economy and has included  development of Liupanshui in the state's important orders of the  day to turn Liupanshui in the short term into one of south  China's biggest heavy industrial cities and a communication hub.</p>

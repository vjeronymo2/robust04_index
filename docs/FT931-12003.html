			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Drug companies warned of south-east skill shortage MANUFACTURERS of pharmaceuticals in south-east England face skill shortages in spite of the recession, says a report to be published next week. It says some companies in Hertfordshire are finding it difficult to recruit people with appropriate skills, training and experience, though the companies insist there is no recruitment crisis. The report from South East Economic Strategy, a research group, concentrates on Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Merck and Roche, which plan to increase their total staff in the county from 5,500 to 8,000 by the mid 1990s. Glaxo, which is building a Pounds 500m research and development centre in Stevenage, believes it may face difficulties in finding people with good A-levels and post-doctoral qualifications in chemistry. The study estimates that 10 per cent of senior managers and post-doctoral scientists employed in the sector come from Hertfordshire. This compares with half of the technicians and all the clerical and manual workers. The shortage has been caused by declining numbers of young people and less interest in science. Only 12 per cent of pupils taking A-level and GCSE science examinations had any interest in employment in the sector. Glaxo executives say this is because local schools have tended to teach engineering-orientated subjects rather than chemistry. Many pupils have been potential recruits for the aerospace industry, a large local employer. A decline in engineering companies in the county does not mean redundant engineers can switch into the pharmaceuticals industry, warns the report. The local workforce is highly skilled, but not necessarily in the right areas. Health and Wealth? South East Economic Development Strategy. 0279 446489.</p>

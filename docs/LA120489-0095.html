			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TASTE OF SHORTAGES TO COME  </P> <P> Water shortages threaten to squeeze California from all sides in 1990. State  officials are not yet saying the word drought out loud, but that is a matter of  semantics. Absent heavy winter storms in both Northern and Southern California,  the coming year could give the state a sharp taste of a future in which water  shortages are the norm, not the occasional inconvenience.  </P> <P> A wet March prevented 1989 from being a disastrous third consecutive drought  year in California. A bountiful Thanksgiving Week storm is all that keeps  California now from slipping into official drought-watch status. As it is,  State Water Project officials will announce this week that its farmer customers  can expect to receive only about two-thirds of the irrigation water they seek  for the coming growing season. This could change, of course, if heavy winter  storms fill the reservoirs on the Sacramento River system.  </P> <P> But the fact is that most of California is experiencing drought right now.  Those hoped-for Northern California storms that feed the State Water Project  will not guarantee the buffer Southern California has enjoyed in past years  because of pumping capacity problems. Recent dry years in the Rocky Mountains  and increased water diversions to Arizona may limit, for the first time, the  Metropolitan Water District's draw on the Colorado River to about 1 million  acre-feet, down by about 20% from this year. A MWD official commented: "Our  system is absolutely maxed out."  </P> <P> Growth in the six-county region served by the district is one reason for  impending shortages. Just five years ago, officials were predicting that they  would be providing 2.3 million acre-feet of water to their retail water  districts, serving an estimated 15 million people, by the year 2000. The future  is now: MWD already has reached that level.  </P> <P> The district is working on a number of innovative projects that will stretch  its supplies in coming years. But the most effective method of meeting  immediate shortages is through strict conservation -- voluntary conservation if  it works; actual water rationing if it does not. Southern California officials  must begin preparing the people for such a contingency now.  </P></p>

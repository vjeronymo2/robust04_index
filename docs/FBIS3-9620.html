			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 27 Mar (TANJUG) -- As the talks between  the delegations of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and the  Republic of Croatia are about to resume in the Russian Embassy  in Zagreb on 29 March, RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic  said that the talks will pick up where they have stopped, but  added that the Serb side will raise the issue of "organized  state terror against Serbs in the Republic of Croatia."    Taking part in the Pecat Vremena program on Kragujevac  Radio,  Jarcevic said that the Serbian Council nongovernmental  organization has established that 14,000 Serbs have been killed  in Croatia by personnel of the Croatian Ministry of Internal  Affairs. This fact speaks of the most serious form of state  terror.    "The United Nations and the international community do not  see or do not want to see what has been happening on  three-quarters of the Croatian territory. As far as they are  concerned the source of all evil in the past four years is  one-quarter of the territory -- the RSK -- which clearly shows  that the Serbian-Croatian conflict has not been approached in a  just manner and that a just solution to the conflict between  these two ethnic communities is being avoided."    Jarcevic said that the UN Security Council will be informed  about Croatia's state terror against the Serbian people outside  the RSK over the next few days. Asked to comment on the new U.S.  plan and the Double K formula which conditions the solving of  Krajina's autonomy to Kosovo's autonomy, Jarcevic said:    "That is yet another confirmation that people from developed  countries do not understand our problems or are trying to  realize their strategic goals in the Balkans with that move. No  autonomy should be granted to Kosovo because it has been  developing since 1945. The Albanians were granted all minority  rights guaranteed and recognized in the world, but they did not  want to exercise them; they wanted secession from the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia." "That situation cannot be compared with  the situation in the RSK because it was the Serb people who  created the AVNOJ [World War II government in Yugoslavia] in  Croatia and who entered into an agreement with the Croatian  ethnic community in 1944 for both nations to join their  territories and create a single union in the federal Yugoslavia;  it was stressed that the borders must not sever the link between  all Serbs in Yugoslavia, as it was called in 1944 and 1945." [as  received]    "We can cite many more examples which will not equate the  problems of Kosovo-Metohija with those of the RSK and Croatia,  but at the moment everyone is turning a deaf ear to those  facts," Jarcevic said.</p>

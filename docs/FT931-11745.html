			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Recovery at Marine Midland MARINE MIDLAND Banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary, reported a substantial recovery from losses for both its 1992 fourth quarter and its results for the full-year. The New York-based bank, which has Dollars 17.1bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in assets, said net profits in the fourth quarter were Dollars 35.7m, compared to losses of Dollars 23.8m in the last quarter of 1991. For the whole of 1992, net profits were Dollars 109.2m, a significant turnround from losses of Dollars 189.9m for 1991. Mr James Cleave, president and chief executive, said this was the first time Marine Midland had returned to profit for three years. He said 1992 was a benchmark year in the bank's recovery and pledged to continue to focus on controlling expenses, especially in light of the soft New York state regional economy. Fourth quarter operating expenses were Dollars 241.4m, up slightly from Dollars 238.3m in the same period of 1991. The bank's revenues in the quarter were Dollars 283.3m, against Dollars 258.6m a year earlier. Bad debt provisions amounted to Dollars 3.4m in the fourth quarter, down sharply from Dollars 41m. Provisions for the whole year were Dollars 73.2m, down from Dollars 230m in 1991. The bank ended 1992 with a Tier One risk-weighted capital ratio of 9.12 per cent. The return on assets rose to 0.66 per cent in 1992, against a loss on assets of 1.06 per cent in 1991.</p>

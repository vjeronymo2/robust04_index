Uncertain How Ukrainian  Parliament Will Act"]    [Text] Kiev -- "Temporary inconvenience equals improvement  forever," Bill Clinton and Leonid Kravchuk gave a press  conference next to this promising poster, which does,  admittedly, pertain to repair work at Borispol Airport.    According to Leonid Kravchuk, this brief visit is as  valuable  as a long one. Bill Clinton said that the three countries'  presidents are ready to sign an agreement on Friday that will  commit Ukraine to eliminate the 176 ICBM's and around 1,500  nuclear warheads targeted against the United States and open up  new forms of cooperation in the economy, politics, and security.  "Let me give credit to President Kravchuk for his statesmanlike  way of thinking and his guidance in reaching this accord," he  said.    However, the credit still has to be given: The U.S.  President promised that he would take care to ensure that  Ukraine receives most speedily the proper compensation for the  tactical nuclear weapons that have already been taken to Russia  and, in addition, that Ukraine gets a considerable amount of  money for dismantling the weapons -- money that can be used for  defense and conversion. The United States pledged to help  Ukraine during the difficult period of its transition to a  market economy. In Kiev Clinton announced the creation of an  enterprise support fund for Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus.    Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" will  provide additional guarantees that it can cooperate with the  U.S. Armed Forces and with NATO countries, and Ukraine's  decision to become a nuclear-free state will make it possible  for it to obtain economic aid from the World Bank, the IMF, the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the G-7  countries.    "I believe that Ukraine cannot be confident of its security  in the 21st century unless it is strong economically," Bill  Clinton said.    The Ukrainian president decided to act without recourse to  the parliament, which not so long ago even had a fair number of  complaints to make about the START-I Treaty. "Philosophers say  that everything in the world is changing and that you cannot  step into the same river twice," Leonid Kravchuk said. "It is  the same with the parliament: I hope that it will understand  the crux of this global problem facing the world, the crux of  our relations, and given the three states' mutual desire we will  fulfill our commitments with its support."    The last session of the current Supreme Council next week  could upset this: The accusation of "disarming" Ukraine is one  that many people respond to, particularly during an election  campaign. During Clinton's visit the youth faction of the  People's Rukh demonstrated at the airport with the Ukrainian  Students' Union. Boys stood under banners proclaiming "Careful,  Clinton: First Crimea, then Alaska"; "Bill, would you disarm if  you were in the same cage as a Russian bear?"; and "All Missiles  to Zhirinovskiy?"    The last question is of interest to many Ukrainian  inhabitants -- it may be cleared up by the three president's  meeting in Moscow.</p>

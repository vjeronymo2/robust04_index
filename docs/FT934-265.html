			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Mafia crackdown The Italian cabinet yesterday decided to send troops to crime-ridden Calabria and Naples and extended a similar anti-Mafia operation in Sicily, Reuter reports. The government first flew troops to Sicily in July 1992 after a car bomb killed Mr Paolo Borsellino, the top anti-Mafia judge, and five of his escorts in Palermo. Mr Borsellino died two months after the Mafia killed Mr Giovanni Falcone, another leading judge. Thousands of troops have served in Sicily, with 7,000 stationed there at all times.</p>

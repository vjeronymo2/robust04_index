			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 27 TASS -- "The situation  in Ukraine is an internal affair of that country and does not  require outside intervention," Moldavian [Moldovan] President  Mircea Snegur said today. "Any advice and instruction might  result in grave consequences. Ukraine, according to its  Constitution, is an integral state, and we hope that it will  resolve the problems, which have cropped up through peaceful  negotiations. We are not indifferent to how the situation  develops in our neighbouring state with whom we maintain cordial  relations," the Moldavian head of state said.    According to Mircea Snegur, the events in Ukraine belong to  the category of those which are caused by seperatism.  Seperatist tendencies should be condemned, since they do not  lead to anything good. Conflicting situations in the former  Soviet Union and in the whole world testify to this fact. I  condemn seperatism as a phenomenon," the Moldavian leader  emphasised.    The Moldavian president expressed the hope that forces  capable of regulating problems in the Crimea would be found.  According to him, these problems "are a result of the  populistic activities of certain politicians, who are  unwarrantedly claiming too much."</p>

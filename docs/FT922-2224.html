			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / NFC says recession may be ending MR JAMES WATSON, chairman of NFC, the transport and distribution business, yesterday said there were signs that the UK recession was coming to an end. In spite of reporting unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 39.5m for the half year ending April 18, Mr Watson said he was encouraged by a sustained improvement in the truck rental market. Mr Watson said: 'We have seen signs of recovery in the past which have not lasted, although the present signs of an uplift appear to be more sustained than before. Nonetheless, growth is likely to be slow.' NFC's traditional transport division reported a fall in operating profits from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 12.8m. In the second quarter, however, it reported Pounds 7.5m profits, just Pounds 100,000 down on the comparable figure. At the end of the August the group has the option of taking another 650 vehicles increasing its fleet of trucks from 1,500 to 2,200. The group confirmed its 'best view' of pre-tax profits for the year-end in the range of Pounds 90m to Pounds 100m. Half-year sales were Pounds 879m, up from Pounds 831m. Logistics, which provides transportation and warehousing facilities for goods sent from manufacturers to distributors, increased profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 22.4m. One of the ways NFC is expanding Logistics is by following its clients into different countries. For example, when Marks and Spencer opened shops in Spain, it asked NFC to establish a distribution centre there. Operating profits from Hyperion's property division were Pounds 2.9m compared with Pounds 3.1m. NFC is looking for a buyer for its Pickfords retail travel business. Mr Watson said: 'We are having a close conversation with someone at the moment.' The group expanded its international business with acquisitions in Europe and the US. Mr Watson said he was confident more than half the group's profits would come from operations outside the UK by 1995. Overseas profits now account for 35 per cent of the group's operating profits. Interest costs were Pounds 200,000 down at Pounds 4.6m, as gearing was reduced to 32 per cent from 45 per cent at the first quarter-end. Earnings per share remained unchanged at 5.7p. A second interim dividend of 1.4p makes a total of 2.7p for the year so far compared with 2.5p. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: France to toughen counterfeit laws FRANCE'S government yesterday took steps to crack down on the booming trade in counterfeit goods, many of them fakes of French fashion designs or luxury products, David Buchan and Alice Rawsthorn report from Paris. It has proposed a law, virtually assured of parliamentary approval, which would increase sharply the penalties for manufacture, sale or import of counterfeits and give customs and police officers scope to take quicker action. The maximum fine for counterfeiting would be increased from FFr20,000 (Pounds 2,300) to FFr500,000 (Pounds 57,000), with a possible two years in jail. Companies convicted of producing fakes could have their factories closed indefinitely and be fined FFr2.5m. An EC regulation to crack down on the counterfeit trade within the Community has been drafted by Mrs Christiane Scrivener, France's commissioner responsible for customs matters. It is due to come into force early next year</p>

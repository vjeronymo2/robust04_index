			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Kazakhstan's President  Nursultan Nazarbayev said Saturday [9 April] that Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation will not alter Japanese policy  or affect agreements signed between the two countries.  Nazarbayev told reporters at a Tokyo hotel that bilateral  agreements will remain valid and projects planned between  Japanese corporations and his country will remain unchanged.    Nazarbayev said that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  announcement Friday that he will resign was unexpected but did  not come as a surprise. He said he received no prior indication  that Hosokawa would announce his resignation when he met the  prime minister on Thursday.    But Nazarbayev said he is aware that "when a large number of  parties make up a coalition, the problems usually become complex.    "From an international perspective, it (Hosokawa's  resignation) is nothing to be surprised about," he said.    Nazarbayev arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a four-day  visit. In addition to his talks with Hosokawa, Nazarbayev met  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Friday.</p>

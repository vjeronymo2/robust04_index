			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADY BACKS NEIL BUSH: 'CAN'T IMAGINE HE BROKE LAW';  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE TREASURY SECRETARY NOTES THAT THE PRESIDENT'S SON WAS A DIRECTOR,  BUT NOT AN OFFICER, OF A FAILED SAVINGS AND LOAN IN COLORADO.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady Sunday defended Neil Bush, the President's  son who is under fire for his actions as a savings and loan director. "I can't  imagine that he broke the law," Brady said.  </P> <P> Brady, in a television interview, noted that Bush was only a director of the  failed Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Colorado and that "there  are thousands of directors all over this world who sit on boards and (their)  management go ahead and do things."  </P> <P> It was disclosed last Tuesday that the enforcement staff of the federal Office  of Thrift Supervision had charged that Neil Bush had engaged in "personal  dishonesty" while on the board of Silverado, one of the biggest failures among  hundreds of S&amp;L insolvencies.  </P> <P> An OTS staff memo said that Bush had "willfully breached" his duty as a  director by failing to inform his fellow board members that a major borrower at  the S&amp;L, Kenneth M. Good, was going to pay $3 million for an 80% interest  in Bush's oil exploration company.  </P> <P> Appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley," Brady, a close friend of  the President, said he knew the younger Bush and could not believe the  allegations. "I cannot imagine that he willfully did anything wrong," he said.  ". . . I just don't see this as anything more than an issue that's aimed at the  President's son."  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, meanwhile, declined to disclose whether Bush is  under investigation by his department, saying: "I can't discuss any pending  investigations."  </P> <P> But Thornburgh, appearing on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," brushed aside the  question of whether the Justice Department should stand aside to permit an  independent counsel to look at the matter. "We go where the evidence leads,"  Thornburgh said. "And I don't mean to suggest that any particular individual is  the subject of investigation, but wherever there's evidence of wrongdoing,  we'll pursue it."  </P> <P> Brady, asked whether Neil Bush would be investigated as strongly as anyone else  against whom allegations had been leveled, said: "I would think so. When they  fault him, one individual, up before the House Banking Committee -- there are a  lot of people who were directors. This man wasn't even in the savings and loan  business.  </P> <P> "He was a director. If every director of a savings and loan and bank was  brought before Congress for something that bank did, we wouldn't have time to  do anything else," Brady said.  </P> <P> Bush has strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with his 1985-1988 tenure  as a Silverado director. He is challenging in an administrative proceeding the  government's allegations that he violated thrift rules.  </P> <P> The OTS staff found that at about the same time that Good was buying control of  Bush's firm, JNB, the board of Silverado agreed to forgive $11 million in loans  and obligations to the institution that Good said he could not repay.  </P> <P> Bush abstained from voting on Silverado's loans to Good, but the OTS document  said he did not disclose his business relations with Good as required by  federal regulations affecting thrift directors.  </P> <P> Good and another investor in Bush's firm, William L. Walters, ultimately  defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at Denver-based Silverado. The  cleanup of the institution, which was seized by federal regulators last  December, could cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion.  </P> <P> In May, Bush told the House Banking Committee that Good had loaned him $100,000  "that was never meant to be repaid" if a speculative commodities scheme in  which it was invested failed to show profits. Good invested the money for Bush  in 1984, a year before Bush joined the Silverado board.  </P> <P> The investment later went sour, and Good formally canceled the loan in January.  </P> <P> "It sounds a little fishy," Bush told the House panel in attempting to explain  why he never mentioned the loan on a conflict-of-interest form required of  directors.  </P> <P> Bush told the House committee that he never had any conflicts of interest while  serving on Silverado's board, as regulators have charged in an administrative  complaint.  </P> <P> He described the complaints as "frivolous. The fact they're being pursued is  baffling to me."  </P></p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Tenneco profits double as Case maintains recovery Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, saw operating income double in the fourth quarter as its J. I. Case farm equipment division continued to improve. Mr Mike Walsh, Tenneco's chairman, projected Case's worldwide production would rise 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. The group's natural gas division put in a strong performance but the packaging and automotive parts businesses saw income and revenues tumble during the quarter. For the quarter, Tenneco reported net income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges, of Dollars 150m, or 83 cents a share, compared with Dollars 29m, or 17 cents, in the fourth quarter a year ago. Sales were Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.31bn a year ago. Operating income jumped to Dollars 317m, from Dollars 160m in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, Tenneco reported income from continuing operations, before special charges, of Dollars 451m, or Dollars 2.59, up from Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.00, in 1992. Sales were Dollars 13.3bn, up slightly from Dollars 13.1bn. Case reported an operating profit of Dollars 82m for the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 260m in 1992. It also reduced its inventories by Dollars 400m during the year. However, sales dipped to Dollars 3.7bn for the year, from Dollars 3.8bn in 1992, but improved in the fourth quarter as US demand strengthened. In the fourth quarter, Case had sales of Dollars 1bn, up from Dollars 966m a year ago. Tenneco Gas recorded operating earnings of Dollars 120m in the quarter and Dollars 411m for the year, up from Dollars 111m and Dollars 360m respectively. Natural gas sales rose to Dollars 689m in the fourth quarter, from Dollars 685m a year ago, while for the year, sales increased to Dollars 2.9bn, from Dollars 2.1bn last year. Operating income from the automotive parts division fell to Dollars 29m, from Dollars 54m in the quarter, and to Dollars 215m from Dollars 230m for the year. The packaging side saw fourth-quarter operating income drop to Dollars 21m from Dollars 64m and to Dollars 139m from Dollars 221m for the year. Tenneco president Mr Dana Mead, responding to speculation that Tenneco wished to sell J. I. Case, said that the unit was not on the block, Reuter adds. 'We haven't put it on the block. We haven't gone out peddling it,' Mr Mead told a media teleconference in reply to speculation that Tenneco was interested in divesting Case. 'Yet we've always said we are opportunistic. We're interested in building shareholder value,' Mr Mead added.</p>

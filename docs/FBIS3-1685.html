			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman  of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of  China, said here today that reform would dominate the  forthcoming annual session of the Eighth National People's  Congress.    Qiao made the remarks at a meeting with George Shultz,  chairman of the International Council of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.  Incorporated, and other council members here this morning.    The council also includes former British Foreign Secretary  Sir Geoffrey Howe and former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee  Kuan Yew. They have been here to attend the 40th session of the  council held in Beijing on February 27 and 28.    This year, China is taking major steps to reform its systems  of tax, finance, investment, planning, foreign exchange and  trade, Qiao told the guests.    Some reform measures have been phased in and even more  measures are being considered and in the drafting stage, Qiao  said.    China is confident of the realization of its modernization,  Qiao said. However, it is fully aware that to achieve this  demands strenuous efforts of generations.    "We have taken note of the gaps between the workers and  peasants, and between regions in the east and west of the  country," Qiao said, adding that "we are trying to narrow these  gaps."    Briefing the guests on the NPC's work, Qiao said that the  current NPC and its Standing Committee are committed to promote  the construction of the country's democracy and legislation, and  to establish an initial legal framework suited to China's  socialist market economy.    Shultz said the fact that the council chose Beijing as the  meeting site was itself a good indication of the strong interest  of its members in China.</p>

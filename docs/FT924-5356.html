			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Bhutto set to fight on in Islamabad A BAN excluding Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani opposition leader, from the capital, Islamabad, was lifted last night, but there were no signs the continuing government-opposition rift would end soon. Ms Bhutto, who last week tried to lead a march to parliament to demand the dismissal of the government of prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif, was yesterday in Lahore vowing to continue her campaign to remove the administration on allegations of corruption. Opposition politicians will meet in Rawalpindi today to discuss strategy. In Rawalpindi, police fired tear gas and beat back demonstrators with batons as opposition politicians, including Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, Ms Bhutto's mother, arrived. The campaign is the most aggressive attack on Mr Sharif's government during its two years in office. Concern is growing that the confrontation is causing nervousness among investors, western diplomats say.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Short Commentary" by Ru Nan (3067 2809): "Britain Cannot </F> Possibly Realize Its Attempt To Extend Its Influence in Hong  Kong"]    [Text] After a fierce debate lasting nine hours, the  British Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] passed, in the  early morning of 24 February, the partial bill on the  arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong tabled by  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten. This action by the British Hong  Kong authorities reflects that the British side is determined to  move along the road of confrontation with the Chinese side on  the issue of Hong Kong. Moreover, it has moved even further  down this path and has become even more bogged down.    In May and June last year, as the representatives of the  Chinese and British Governments were holding talks on the  arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong, the British  Hong Kong authorities continuously took unilateral actions, such  as approving the "Draft Regulations on the Boundary and Election  Committees" and supporting the Legco constitutional panel in  discussing the gazetted bill comprising the Patten package in  order to pursue the practice of "discussing while talking,"  which had been rejected by the Chinese side. Furthermore,  despite the strong opposition of district board members, they  merged into one the two district boards of Yaotsim and Mongkok.  While the British Hong Kong authorities were interfering with  the talks, the people raised a question: Why have the British  Hong Kong authorities repeatedly placed obstacles before the  Sino-British talks?    Real intentions are revealed in the end, and the development  of the situation has provided a definite answer to this  question. Specifically, the British side has no sincerity toward  the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994-95  elections in Hong Kong and has no wish whatsoever to reach an  agreement.    Formerly, the two sides agreed through consultations that  the  representatives of the two governments would hold talks in  accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant  agreements and understandings reached between the two sides.  Even from the White Paper on the "Representative Development in  Hong Kong" published by the British Government, however, we can  also see that the British side -- apart from admitting that  there was identical views between China and Britain on the need  to have 18 directly elected seats in the 1991 Legco elections --  "there was no agreement whatsoever" on the electoral  arrangements for 1995. This ran counter to the agreements and  understandings reached through the seven letters exchanged  between the two foreign ministers in early 1990. The British  side has agreed in word that the talks between the two sides  should conform with the aforesaid "three principles." In fact,  however, they have acted otherwise, thus depriving the talks of  their basis.    In rounds 15, 16, and 17 of the Sino-British talks, in an  effort to speed up the process, the Chinese side made tremendous  efforts to quickly solve the less difficult issues of the  district board and municipal council elections in line with the  principle of "solving the less contentious issues first." Just  as the differences between the two sides on this issue were  narrowing and the talks entered the stage of discussing the  clauses for an agreement, the British side deliberately found a  pretext to leave the negotiating table first. They also tabled a  partial political system package at Legco for discussion, which  led to the termination of the talks. In spite of this, the  Chinese side continued to repeat: As long as the British side  withdraws the partial package that has been tabled at Legco, the  Chinese side will continue to hope to resume talks on the  1994/95 electoral arrangements and reach agreement on this  issue. The British side willfully took a series of actions,  however, such as approving the partial political system bill at  Legco, making a unilateral decision on publishing the substance  of the Sino-British talks, and deciding to table the rest of the  Patten bill at Legco. Thus, it has shut the door to the  resumption of the talks. Consequently, the responsibility of  disrupting the talks lies squarely with the British side.    Why has the British side stubbornly persisted in  contravening  the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of converging  with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and  understandings reached between the two sides? It is by no means  in order to have an electoral arrangement that is "open, fair,  and acceptable to the Hong Kong people," as advertised by the  British side. The true objective of the British side is to take  advantage of the remaining time of its administration in Hong  Kong to make some electoral arrangements favorable to the  British side so as to extend British political influence in Hong  Kong beyond 1997.    Britain's attempt will certainly come to naught. In his  statement on the passage of Patten's partial political system  bill by the British Hong Kong Legco, a spokesman for the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office put it very  clearly: It is stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law that Britain's administration over Hong Kong  will terminate on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will  resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July  1997. In line with this provision, the last district boards,  municipal councils, and Legco, as component parts of the Hong  Kong political structure of the British administration, will  terminate with the end of the British administration. As of 1  July 1997, the political structure of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region will be set up in accordance with the  decisions of the National People's Congress and the relevant  stipulations of the Basic Law.    The historical trend of China's reunification is  irresistible  and the principle of "one country, two systems" will certainly  be implemented in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, the "pearl of the  Orient," will become even more resplendent after 1997.</p>

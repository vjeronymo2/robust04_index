			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE SWEEPS LUXURY CAIRO HOTEL; 16 INCLUDING AN AMERICAN ARE KILLED  </P> <P> Fire broke out in a luxury hotel's tent restaurant early Thursday, and  wind-whipped flames leaped to the main building, killing 16 people and injuring  about 70. At least one American was among the dead.  </P> <P> Frantic guests at the six-story Heliopolis Sheraton jumped from windows and  clambered down bedsheets that they tied together. Many of the injuries were  broken bones suffered in falls.  </P> <P> A relative identified the American victim as Robert D. Cresap, 67, a retired  accountant from Houston.  </P> <P> Three Americans were seriously injured, said police Brig. Abdel Rehim Kenawy.  </P> <P> The blaze broke out at 1 a.m. and burned for nine hours. The hotel northeast of  Cairo has no fire alarms or sprinklers, and many guests heard of the fire from  other guests.  </P> <P> Tourism Minister Fuad Sultan said the blaze started accidentally in the Nubian  Tent restaurant -- a cotton canvas tent attached to one of the three blocks of  the T-shaped hotel. The head of Cairo's fire brigade, Maj. Gen. Adel Nigm, said  such tents are fire hazards and the Sheraton put it up without consulting the  fire department.  </P> <P> Sparks jumped from a clay oven to the ceiling of the tent, igniting flames that  quickly spread to the hotel, Sultan said. Officials said the use of hotel tents  will be reviewed.  </P> <P> The Heliopolis Sheraton, about 10 years old, is the only one of Egypt's six  Sheratons without an alarm system or sprinklers. Sultan said they are not  mandatory under Egyptian law.  </P></p>

This proposal would require inspections to detect cracking of H&hyph;11 attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer and replacement of these bolts and associated nuts with Inconel bolts and nuts. This proposal is prompted by reports of failure of the attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer due to stress corrosion. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent undetected cracked or failed attach bolts that may lead to reduced structural integrity of the vertical stabilizer.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by November 10, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;79&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That AD requires the implementation of a Structural Inspection Document (SID) program of structural inspections to detect fatigue cracking, and repair or replacement, as necessary, to ensure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes as they approach the manufacturer's original fatigue design life goal. AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;09 requires inspection of the attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer [designated Principal Structural Element (PSE) 55.10.001/002 in McDonnell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Douglas Report Number L26&hyph;012, ``DC&hyph;10 Supplemental Inspection Document,'' which is referenced in that AD as the appropriate source of service information] under the fleet leader operator sampling criteria. The fatigue life for these attach bolts is (N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> th <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) 119,334 flight hours. The sampling period for this PSE started in September 1989, and will end in June 2001. Sampling inspections are to be accomplished within that interval for airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the candidate fleet that have accumulated more than 59,667 total flight hours (N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> th <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inspection threshold for the SID program was based upon a fatigue analysis conducted by the manufacturer. The FAA is not aware of any operator having, as yet, accomplished the inspection of these bolts for the purpose of complying with the requirements of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;09. McDonnell Douglas has advised the FAA that the planning data contained in Volume III of the SID will be revised to indicate that H&hyph;11 bolts have been replaced with new Inconel bolts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, operators of Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes have recently reported that the attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer had failed on several in-service airplanes. These failures had occurred on airplanes that had accumulated between 40,000 total flight hours and 67,000 total flight hours. The attach bolts and associated nuts on these airplanes were made of H&hyph;11 material, which is susceptible to failure due to stress corrosion. The FAA has determined that replacement of the H&hyph;11 bolts and associated nuts with Inconel bolts and associated nuts will eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of failure due to stress corrosion. Failure of the attach bolts in the upper vertical stabilizer, if not corrected, could compromise the structural integrity of the vertical stabilizer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1, dated March 8, 1991, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994, of McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 55&hyph;20, which describe procedures for repetitive ultrasonic inspections at 12-month intervals to detect cracking in H&hyph;11 attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer, and replacement of H&hyph;11 attach bolts and associated nuts with Inconel attach bolts and associated nuts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require ultrasonic inspections at 18-month intervals to detect cracking in H&hyph;11 attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer, and replacement of H&hyph;11 attach bolts and associated nuts with Inconel attach bolts and associated nuts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the procedures specified in the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the referenced service bulletins recommend that these inspections be performed at 12-month intervals, the FAA has determined that 18-month intervals will not adversely affect safety and will allow these repetitive inspections to be performed at a base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

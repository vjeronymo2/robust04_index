			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Please take a seat there, sir - The training of restaurant and hotel staff Remember Manuel, the inept waiter in BBC TV's Fawlty Towers? Just a mention of his name in connection with any hotel was enough for people to cancel their reservations. But to Stuart Scher, 32, and Alan Wick, 38, 'Manuels' are a challenge. Scher and Wick run Scher Associates, a company which in its fourth year will earn almost Pounds 1m in fees from training front-of-house staff in the restaurant, hotel and leisure industries. Educate staff as to how customers should be treated, and hotel bookings increase. Training in the catering industry has traditionally concentrated on kitchen skills. Hotels have rigid, rather impersonal, training plans for front-of-house staff. And for small restaurateurs, training has always posed a problem. Lack of human and financial resources is often exacerbated by lack of time between meal services. The hiring of staff has usually been based on a successful rendition of the 'three-plate trick' (asking a prospective waiter to clear a table of three correctly) and regular admonitions on hygiene and customer care. Scher Associates' success in winning contracts with its wide range of clients - from Roux Fine Dining and Sutcliffe Catering, both contract caterers, to hotel groups such as Jarvis Hotels, Mount Charlotte Thistle and Edwardian Hotels, to brewers Scottish and Newcastle and Tetley, plus a string of restaurant groups including ABC Cafes, the Pelican Group, Garfunkels and Langans - stems from the fact that they have made training easy for their clients. Prospective clients are, naturally, attracted by the concept of training but invariably say they have no money. Scher has gone straight to one of the 80 government-funded Training and Enterprise Councils - its programme 'Investors in People' is aimed at improving the skills of the British workforce - and has now become the biggest source of government training funds to companies in the catering industry. This allows for an initial, free, diagnosis to take place which can last from one day for a small restaurant, to three months in the case of a contract caterer. Then, if the personalities fit, an action plan follows. This may begin with a training session in Scher's offices but usually takes place in the restaurant. An integral aspect is 'training the trainer', when a member of the restaurant's staff is chosen to ensure standards are maintained. But Scher has also changed its clients' - and my own - perception of the importance of training. Invariably, the catering industry is described as a service industry, a phrase with which Scher and Wick have little truck. Today, according to Scher, those who look after customers in restaurants, hotel lobbies or across the counter of a wine bar are in a sales industry. It is at this stage that Scher and Wick's non-catering background has proved most effective. When still in his 20s, Scher was general manager of a 400-bedroom Sheraton hotel in Arizona and Wick was winning a Queen's Award for Export manufacturing professional audio equipment. This commercial experience has left them with no qualms about suggesting to one restaurateur that a small mirror be fixed to the cash register to ensure the cashier always smiles when presenting the bill, and to taking the entire management of a restaurant group around the studios of CNN, the TV news station, to show the value of communicating to staff. Perhaps, the biggest compliment to Scher's approach to training comes from its involvement with the Aroma group of cafes, started by Michael Zur-Szpiro, a former management consultant with the Boston Consultancy Group. There are now six Aromas in central London employing more than 60 staff selling sandwiches, coffee and pastries. Customers call in spontaneously and can, if they are not well treated, walk out just as promptly. To ensure that they do not, Scher has devised a training checklist that is pinned behind every door in each cafe. Against an employee's name is a series of training modules which incorporates how a customer should be welcomed, food hygiene and customer care procedures. Each employee is taken regularly through the checklist and there are plans to attach incentives to reward best performers. Scher is aware that, apart from their own expertise and enthusiasm for the restaurant business, a key factor in their growth is the fact that many have considered the restaurant business a 'Cinderella industry' - one to dabble in but not take too seriously. The recession has changed that - as it has changed the structure of the industry. In the UK today, there are fewer individual restaurants but more restaurant groups, most with an annual turnover between Pounds 5m and Pounds 50m. These are able, in a way a single chef/proprietor is not, to open seven days a week, to implement changes required under the Food Act and, crucially, to hold down menu prices. But, like others in the retailing industry, these businesses are continually looking to maximise sales, to retain regular customers and to train new staff without increasing the size of head office. Scher's approach to the training of waiting staff enables restaurants to achieve many of those objectives. And, as it improves restaurant service, it might eventually make us remember Manuel not as a stereotypical hapless waiter but, simply, as a comic character from the past.

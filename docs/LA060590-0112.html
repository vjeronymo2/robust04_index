			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WISCONSIN GROUP OPPOSES STATES' NEA PLAN;  </P> <P> FUNDING: RESISTANCE TO THE PROPOSAL DEALS A BLOW TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS.  CALIFORNIA COULD SUFFER A $3-MILLION CUT IN FEDERAL SUPPORT.  </P> <P> In a blow to House Republicans, Wisconsin's state arts council came out in  opposition Monday to a proposal to radically alter federal support for the  arts.  </P> <P> The council joined growing political opposition to the plan, which would divert  60% of the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts to states.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, meanwhile, the California Legislative Joint Committee on the  Arts released calculations concluding that the restructuring of the NEA would  produce a net cut in the state's federal arts money of $6 million to $9  million.  </P> <P> Direct federal aid to the California Arts Council would be increased from  $727,000 this year to $2.8 million using budget projections for future funding  under the plan, according to the staff of the committee. But its chair, State  Sen. Henry Mello (D-Watsonville), said California's share of total money would  be cut as much as 50% or more.  </P> <P> The Republican proposal would reserve 40% of NEA money for grants to large  established arts organizations. The remaining 60% would go to state agencies --  triple the proportion now.  </P> <P> The unrelated Wisconsin and California announcements raised new questions about  the controversial Republican proposal two days before a House subcommittee  resumes consideration of legislative reauthorization of the NEA, which has been  wracked by political controversy for more than a year.  </P> <P> But the chairman of the subcommittee observed Monday that the continuing swirl  of concern about the endowment's political future makes it increasingly likely  that the NEA will undergo some form of restructuring this year. Rep. Pat  Williams (D-Mont.) said in a telephone interview that the GOP proposal and  political uncertainties facing the NEA "do seem to me to create the opportunity  to consider necessary changes."  </P> <P> The House subcommittee, Williams said, "has moved a little now from total  defense in trying to keep the NEA alive to serious consideration of necessary  changes." He offered no specifics and said he believes it may be fall -- when  separate House and Senate reauthorization bills are rationalized in conference  committee -- before the NEA's fate is known.  </P> <P> The Wisconsin action -- a unanimous vote of the five-member executive committee  of the Wisconsin Arts Board in Madison -- was significant because a co-sponsor  of the Republican plan is Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.), the House chief deputy  whip, who now must grapple with the dilemma of advocating a shift in funding  that his own state arts agency opposes. Gunderson did not return calls seeking  his reaction to the situation.  </P> <P> Gunderson's political plight is complicated by the fact that the Missouri Arts  Council -- home agency of the other co-sponsor, Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.) --  opposed the plan May 16.  </P> <P> Rejection of the Coleman-Gunderson plan by the two councils appeared to create  significant difficulties for advancing the proposal. The Wednesday hearing is  to hear further testimony on the Republican proposal, as well as on a competing  plan drawn up by a coalition of arts organizations at Williams' behest.  </P> <P> Technically, the Wisconsin statement was of support for the arts organization  plan, which, in turn, emphatically rejected the 60%/40% split. The strategy  enabled the Wisconsin arts board to avoid opposing Gunderson directly. The  Missouri Arts Council chose a similar tactic by opposing the National Assembly  of State Arts Agencies, which proposed the alternative in the first place --  but has since backed off from it -- and leaving Coleman unnamed.  </P> <P> The Wisconsin action came after three members of the arts board met in  Milwaukee Friday with representatives of several large cultural institutions,  including the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, Pabst Theater, Milwaukee Ballet and  Milwaukee Symphony.  </P> <P> Coleman said Monday that the opposition left him undeterred. "I think the  effort here by Missouri and Wisconsin obviously is to embarrass the two  sponsors," Coleman said. "I think the wagons have been circled and there is an  effort (by) these agencies to get back in step with the so-called arts  community."  </P> <P> In Sacramento, Mello attacked the Republican proposal, which has been opposed  by at least eight influential state arts councils. The California Arts Council  was the first in the country to announce its opposition. "I understand the  motives of Congressmen Coleman and Gunderson are good in that they are trying  to find a compromise for reauthorization," Mello said in a statement, "but this  proposal has a very negative impact on California."  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Boeing wins Dollars 600m Malaysian order MALAYSIA Airlines yesterday placed firm orders worth Dollars 600m (Pounds 339m) with Boeing of the US for 17 737-400 twin engine aircraft. The deal comes at a time when general demand for narrow-body jets remains sluggish. Boeing plans to reduce monthly production of 737s from 21 to 14 aircraft from October, to adjust to the weaker market. The deal with Malaysia Airlines involves 12 new orders for 737s and the conversion of five earlier options. It brings to 45 the number of 146-seater 737-400 jets the Kuala Lumpur carrier has ordered, making it Boeing's biggest airline customer for this aircraft. The airline plans to use the new aircraft to expand its domestic and regional services. The new aircraft will be powered by CFM56-3 engines made by the CFM International joint venture between General Electric of the US and Snecma of France. Boeing has also delivered the last of its 707 Awacs (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft to the Royal Air Force. Production of the 707 Awacs ended last year and Boeing is now offering a militarised version of its twin-engine 767 airliner as the future Awacs airframe. Rolls-Royce jet engine sales to China have been boosted by an order for three Fokker 100 aircraft from China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC). The UK group will supply Tay 650 engines to power CAAC's twin-engine Fokker 100 airliners.</p>

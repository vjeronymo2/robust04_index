			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 8 MONTHS LATER, DEATHS OF STUDENTS STILL ROCK CLOSE-KNIT N.Y. HAMLET;  </P> <P> DISASTER: A STORM TORE DOWN A CAFETERIA WALL, KILLING NINE STUDENTS. SOME  PARENTS WANT TO FORGET THE DISASTER. OTHERS CAN'T, AND GRIEF HAS TURNED TO  ANGER.  </P> <P> Peter Orsino's eyes flash with anger when anyone tells him the death of his  8-year-old son was an act of God.  </P> <P> Peter Orsino Jr. was eating in the cafeteria of the East Coldenham Elementary  School last Nov. 16 when a 90-m.p.h. wind demolished a 12-foot cafeteria wall,  later shown to be of defective design. Peter and eight other children died in a  shower of concrete and glass.  </P> <P> "It wasn't an act of God," the boy's father said, "because God doesn't make  buildings."  </P> <P> Orsino and several other bereaved parents have channeled their grief and anger  into a tenacious effort to get the state to change laws regarding inspections  of school buildings. But a top school official said these efforts, and lawsuits  filed in the wake of the disaster, have caused bitterness.  </P> <P> Eight months after the storm clouds lifted, this close-knit rural hamlet 50  miles north of New York City is divided between those who want to forget the  tragedy and those who can't.  </P> <P> Pictures from that day remain etched in memory: tearful parents rushing up to  the school to see if their children were alive or dead.  </P> <P> Sympathy poured in from across the country, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo attended a  memorial service for the nine dead children three days after the disaster.  </P> <P> When the initial shock wore off, parents from seven of the nine families  started to meet regularly at the town firehouse. It was a way to talk through  their grief, said John Lichtler, whose 7-year-old daughter, Joanna, was killed.  </P> <P> That grief turned to anger when a state report on the disaster concluded that  the cafeteria wall, built with the rest of the school in 1959, was not capable  of withstanding hurricane-force winds.  </P> <P> "Accidents happen every day, people are hurt and killed," said Frances Soltis,  who lost her 7-year-old son, Adam. "But our children were not out in the street  running in front of cars and they weren't playing with matches. They were  eating their lunch in a school cafeteria. They were in a place where they were  supposed to be safe."  </P> <P> In March, the parents of seven East Coldenham victims signed a letter to Cuomo,  urging legislative action on school-building safety.  </P> <P> The parents want architects and engineers sent to every school in the state at  regular intervals to detect possible dangers. They want blueprints checked to  see if others have design flaws similar to East Coldenham's. Defects were  discovered at four other New York schools after the disaster.  </P> <P> The parents' anger, their continued outspokenness, has not been well received  by some of their neighbors.  </P> <P> Bruce Armbrister, who lost his 7-year-old stepson, said he had to restrain  himself from attacking one man who told him, "What are you fighting for? You're  going to be a millionaire."  </P> <P> Armbrister and 32 others -- parents of the 24 children who were injured or  killed, along with others who say their children were traumatized -- have filed  negligence lawsuits against the state, Orange County and the school district.  </P> <P> The lawsuits have caused resentment among unaffected parents who wonder what  the claims could do to tax bills, said James Coonan, superintendent of the  Valley Central School District.  </P> <P> School officials are stuck between two emotional camps, Coonan said.  </P> <P> An incident about three weeks after the disaster typified some of the problems.  </P> <P> While driving one of her three surviving children to East Coldenham to school,  Soltis saw the building's American flag flying at full-staff for the first time  since the storm. It was like a "dagger through my heart," she said.  </P> <P> She lowered the flag to half-staff in the late autumn chill.  </P> <P> The next day, she found the flag at full-staff again. Again, she lowered it.  </P> <P> "They reach a point where they don't want to confront it anymore," Soltis said.  "I see it in the (other) families. They got through with minimal damage to  their family. They survived, so there's a tendency to block it.  </P> <P> "I don't expect people to feel what I feel," she said. "But I expect them to  respect my son's memory and to respect my family's grief."  </P> <P> Coonan said no disrespect was intended to storm victims. School officials  agreed to keep the flag flying at half-staff for the rest of the school year --  drawing phone calls from other parents who complained that it was an unpleasant  reminder for their children, he said.  </P> <P> The flag will be flying at full-staff again when school opens in September.  </P> <P> "You get trouble when you go from sad to mad," Coonan said. "There's a lot of  anger when people lose children, and that anger is kind of out there looking  for someplace to land, and it lands on different people at different times.  It's not always pleasant when it happens, but people tell us it's normal."  </P> <P> Lichtler leads the effort to change state school inspection laws. A computer  programmer at the U.S. Military Academy, he has compiled a bulging file of  newspaper stories about shoddy school construction.  </P> <P> The chairman of the Education Committee in the New York state Assembly, Angelo  Del Toro, is backing the parents with a bill that would require schools to be  inspected once every three years.  </P> <P> Lawmakers did not act on the proposal before recessing for the summer earlier  this year, partly because of a last-minute proposal from Cuomo. The governor,  concerned about the cost of mandatory inspections, suggested training local  school officials to make the inspections themselves.  </P> <P> Although the Valley Central schools all have been inspected, some school  districts are concerned about the expense of hiring experts for regular  inspections, said Richard Jansen, until recently the school board president.  </P> <P> "Our children should be safe, but there has to be a real rational way of doing  it," Jansen said. "I could see some problems down the road when the expenses  would just get bigger and bigger."  </P> <P> To the bereaved, no price is too high.  </P> <P> Soltis said her three children will go to private school this fall, and  Armbrister said he isn't sure if East Coldenham is safe enough for him to send  his daughter to kindergarten there next year.  </P> <P> "We have to feel that our children's lives amounted to something," Lichtler  said. "If we can save one child, then their lives would have been at least been  . . . for a purpose."  </P></p>

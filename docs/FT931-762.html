			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Breedon drops 34% to Pounds 1.82m Breedon, the limestone quarry operator and housebuilder, suffered a 34 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 1.82m, for the year ended January 31. Group turnover fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 8.73m (Pounds 9.49m) but an increase since October in turnover of the core quarrying business, gave the Derbyshire-based group cause for cautious optimism. The housing market was still in the doldrums, the directors said. An unchanged final dividend of 2.85p is proposed making a maintained total for the year of 4.6p. Earnings per share were shown as 4.41p down from a previous 6.85p.</p>

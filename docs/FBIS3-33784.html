This runs counter to what he said just a  few months ago in the wake of the signing of the Oslo agreement  amidst all the media clamor.    Despite the fact that the Israeli prime minister has always  sought to hit one track with another and fabricate  contradictions among the Arab parties involved in the peace  process, and despite the fact that he managed to take on the  Palestinian party separately, all of the subsequent developments  and the stumbling of the Oslo agreement brought to the forefront  the facts of the established, just solution in the Middle East.  Israel had to acknowledge Syria's central role in the peace  process. The Geneva summit came to consecrate this role and to  confirm the bases and facts of the desired peace in the region.    Thus, when Rabin acknowledges the importance of peace with  Syria, he is in fact acquiescing to the facts of the conflict.  Rabin's statements should have reflected decisively on the  talks currently being held in Washington on the level of heads  of delegations. Despite the relatively practical atmosphere in  these talks, the Israeli negotiating team has not yet given a  satisfactory answer on Israel's complete withdrawal from the  Golan Heights -- a withdrawal which Syria expects in return for  peace in the region. Rabin returned to his tune on holding a  plebiscite for the Israelis on withdrawal from the Golan Heights  and on what he termed peace with Syria after reaching a draft  Syrian-Israeli agreement. Rabin thinks he is authorized to sign  agreements on the other tracks, but not the Syrian one, and  justifies this by saying the Golan Height are strategically  important and that the Israelis are suspicious of the Syrians.    The fact is that the Israeli prime minister is contradicting  himself. He uses a plebiscite as an excuse for extortion  against Syria and to deflect it away from the demand of the just  and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Peace is the most  important guarantee for security and there is no area of special  strategic importance for any region in the world in the age of  missiles and aircraft. Syria, as the world acknowledges, has  always been faithful to what it says. President al-Asad  expressed Syria's firm, principled stand in his well known  statement "we fight in honor, and we make peace in honor."  Geographic expansion did not, and will not, guarantee security  for Israel. That expansion will only be a tool to ignite wars  in the region in the future. Syria has offered a just and  comprehensive peace, a peace with no occupation, one that will  lead to stable conditions in the Middle East in return for  regaining the occupied territories.    If peace with Syria is a basic element, as Israel's leaders  acknowledge, and the key to peace in the Middle East, then peace  is now at hand. It only requires a positive Israeli response to  the UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of  international law by ending its occupation of the Arab  territories, recognizing the rights of the Palestinians, and  getting involved in the crucible of the just and comprehensive  peace.    We do not believe that any two people in the world will  dispute the fact that returning the entire Golan Heights is a  basic condition for peace with Syria. Throughout the long years  of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Syria has never relinquished, and  will never relinquish, an inch of land or a single right. Nor  will it ever yield to the Israeli extortion.    Thus, Rabin is playing the plebiscite game in the wrong  place. The Golan Heights have been Syrian territory since time  immemorial. This fact cannot be changed by a thousand Israeli  plebiscites. Syria in the past ignored the [Israeli] annexation  of the Golan Heights. Equally, Syria will not give any weight  to these threats. The Israeli prime minister should instead  instruct his negotiating team in Washington to address the  substantial issues and approve the return of the entire Golan  Heights to Syria because this is a basic condition for any  progress in the talks. When Syria sets the condition of  returning all the occupied territories in return for peace, it  is showing respect, in letter and spirit, to the UN Security  Council resolutions, the principles of international law, and  the UN Charter. The Israeli occupation, which continues to  date, is a flagrant infringement on these resolutions,  principles, and charter and constitutes a defiance of the entire  world community. Israel's submission to international law will  mark the beginning of the road to the established of a lasting  peace in the Middle East that will benefit every state in the  region.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The two American F-16 fighters, which this afternoon  attacked Serb positions around the town of Gorazde, have  returned safely to the U.S. Air Force base at Aviano in  northeast Italy.    In the meantime it has been revealed that the two planes  were  flying a reconaissence mission over Bosnia when they received  the order -- using a secret code -- to intervene in Gorazde.    Tomorrow a permanent intervention squadron will be installed  at Aviano, the first of its type at an Italian airbase.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / UN exposed by debacle in Gorazde: Member states' political expediencies will ultimately determine fate of Bosnia effort Britain's Ministry of Defence was yesterday referring all inquiries about its troops' involvement in the worsening conflict in Bosnia to Unprofor, the UN protection force. But when Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, is challenged about the issue in parliament this week, that sort of answer will not be enough. He will have to account for his own stewardship of Britain's armed forces. In Washington, politicians sometimes talk about the US involvement in Bosnia as though it was a purely national concern; and other times they remember to proclaim their dogged compliance with whatever they are told by the UN. With the UN's firepower and bureaucratic empire growing by the day, politicians in many countries have been tempted to use it as an alibi when things go wrong. But the disastrous setbacks of recent days have left the UN in danger of being exposed as a colossus with feet of clay: certainly no more, and often less, than the sum of its national parts. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the senior UN representative in Yugoslavia, suggested at the weekend that the UN might have to withdraw from Bosnia altogether. For Mr Akashi and the UN secretariat, this would be a logical response to an unsustainable position. But individual members of the Security Council have entirely different, often conflicting, considerations to take into account. Therein lies the UN's weakness. It does not speak with a single voice, and not even its enemies treat it as a single institution. The Serbs' attack on a British unit in the Sarajevo area over the weekend would suggest that they, at least, are not influenced by the colour of soldiers' helmets. The five permanent members of the Security Council have vested huge powers in the UN and its bureaucracy, but as the Gorazde debacle has shown they have sharply contrasting ideas about how those powers should be used. Moreover, the UN's ability to exercise its responsibilities depends in practice on contributions of men and money from governments which can be abruptly withdrawn. The UN in Bosnia has been forced to combine the jobs of consensus-builder - dependent on co-operation from the warring parties - and policeman. Mr Akashi found himself in the former role yesterday when he unsuccessfully asked the Serbs to hold their fire in Gorazde and release 150 UN personnel. He stated on Saturday that if the Bosnian Serbs continued to withhold co-operation, then it would be 'meaningless' for the UN forces to remain in Bosnia. His logic was clear enough. It might have been possible for the UN to mix consensus with coercion if the coercion had been so massive that it brought all the parties to the table in a conciliatory mood. But, in practice, coercion has proved less effective than western governments hoped, leaving the UN's position almost untenable. In the end, however, the fate of the UN effort in Bosnia will depend not on Mr Akashi's sound logic, but on the political expediencies weighing on national governments. The UN's vulnerability reflects Washington's recent refusal to finance an increase in Unprofor's numbers. US and British officials will be weighing up the domestic political cost of casualties in an ugly, confusing war against the outrage that a massacre of Moslems would arouse both at home and in friendly Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Nato governments have insisted that air strikes have been used to protect a handful of UN personnel, not the 65,000 residents of Gorazde. But western leaders will not escape the political consequences of a rout in Gorazde even if the formal purpose of the UN mission - to protect its staff - is secured through a successful evacuation. Islamic wrath will fall more on the west, which has disappointed the Bosnians with false promises, than on Russia, which is openly pro-Serb. Moscow has some reason to be embarrassed by the Serbs' continued offensive. Yet Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Moscow's foreign minister, never made the extravagant claims on behalf of his diplomatic approach that were repeatedly advanced by armchair advocates in the west of 'bombing the Serbs'. Mr Kozyrev will now tell his western counterparts in the Security Council that Russian diplomacy sometimes works whereas western air strikes do not work at all.</p>

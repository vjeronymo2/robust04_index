As to Sarajevo, in particular, the letter went on to say,  such initiatives would be aimed at moving forward in time the  administration of the city by the United Nations so that the  "dramatic social problems" there could be dealt with  internationally, as envisaged in the European Union [EU] peace  plan.    The contents of the letter were made known in a communique  released here today by the Farnesina (foreign ministry).  Andreatta wrote that in Bosnia, from a humanitarian point of  view, solutions complementary to those of the UN and of the EU  should be quickly developed. He suggested, for example, that UN  troops might be assigned to more strictly humanitarian tasks  such as medical and health assistence, and that an all-out  effort be made to "immediately" get schools reopened and to  create safe centers for children, their mothers and the elderly.    He urged that attending this Florence conference should be  those responsible for relevant international bodies such as  UNHCR; UNICEF, the Red Cross and the World Health Organization;  United States, Russian and European Community ministers in  charge of humanitarian aid; the president of the Conference of  Islamic States, and the Nobel Peace Prize laureates of recent  years.    In the text of his letter, Andreatta quoted Holocaust  survivor and writer Primo Levi who said that "if we are in a  position to alleviate suffering and fail to do so, we ourselves  become torturers."    Ever since the very start of this tragedy, Italy has given  wholehearted support to those specialized agencies responsibile  for humanitarian actions which have carried out, "with admirable  dedication", the tough job of alleviating the suffering of civil  populations in that part of the Balkans, the letter continued.  It is now necessary to build on the growing public awareness of  the tragedy, coming up with viable and effective solutions and  putting them into practice, Andreatta said.    An immediate program of support for social health and  education services could be quickly set up and made operative in  the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, for example; a program  free from any sort of ethnic or religious discrimination, the  Italian foreign minister said.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 3 SUPERVISORS DISAPPROVE OF MAJOR PROJECTS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: INCREASED SMOG AND TRAFFIC OUTLINED IN ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS ON  THE JORDAN AND AHMANSON RANCH PROPOSALS ARE THE PRIMARY REASONS CITED.  </P> <P> Following the release of reports that two large housing developments would  cause irreparable harm to southeast Ventura County's rural environment, three  of five Board of Supervisors members scheduled to vote on the projects early  next year said they probably will not support them.  </P> <P> The reports released Monday on the Ahmanson and Jordan ranch developments found  that the two projects, as they are proposed, would have significant and  unavoidable effects on air quality and traffic, among other things.  </P> <P> Supervisor John Flynn said the reports "came up with what I predicted, which is  that there are so many problems that I do not see how they could ever be  mitigated."  </P> <P> Supervisor Maggie Erickson and Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, who will take  office Jan. 1, said that the increased traffic and smog that would be generated  by the two developments outweigh any benefits they would provide to the county.  </P> <P> "My inclination is to think that this is not going to be something that I  support," Erickson said.  </P> <P> Supervisor Susan Lacey, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, has  repeatedly said she opposes both developments. Supervisor Jim Dougherty's term  expires in November, and candidates Vicky Howard and Bill Davis, both Simi  Valley council members, have not taken a position on the projects.  </P> <P> Fred Maas, vice president of Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option  to purchase and develop Jordan Ranch from entertainer Bob Hope, said he is not  surprised by the comments.  </P> <P> "It doesn't change our plans," Maas said. "We pledge to work very hard, whether  it's with the county or the city of Simi Valley, to address all of the negative  impacts."  </P> <P> Anticipating opposition from the supervisors, Hope in July asked Simi Valley to  annex Jordan Ranch along with 3,600 acres of his Runkle Ranch northeast of the  city.  </P> <P> Simi Valley has petitioned the Local Agency Formation Commission for a  preliminary ruling to determine whether annexation of Jordan Ranch is feasible.  The commission is scheduled to take up the issue at its next meeting, Sept. 12.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Maas said he would consider an alternative presented in the  environmental impact report regarding the incorporation of Oak Park and Jordan  Ranch as a city.  </P> <P> "We're open to any ideas," Maas said. "Geographically, that makes a lot of  sense. Politically, there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed."  </P> <P> One such issue is whether Oak Park residents want to become a city. Residents  there are considering the issue.  </P> <P> Another factor would be whether the two communities combined would be able to  generate enough revenue to support incorporation, said Dennis Hawkins, a senior  planner with the Ventura County Resources Agency. Hawkins said LAFCO would have  to conduct an incorporation study to make that determination.  </P> <P> In addition to causing significant increases in traffic and smog, the  environmental reports released Monday concluded that the Jordan Ranch housing  project would destroy 10 to 20 acres of wetlands and 1,100 trees in Liberty and  Cheeseboro canyons and development areas.  </P> <P> But Maas said Hope's offer to sell and donate 5,700 acres in the Santa Monica  and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies if the Jordan Ranch development is  approved should be an overriding consideration.  </P> <P> "You have to look at the entirety of what is being proposed," Maas said. "Our  project clearly benefits all of Ventura County."  </P> <P> Maas also noted that the environmental report on Jordan Ranch is based on an  outdated design proposal and that Hope and the developer already have  voluntarily agreed to reduce the size of the housing project by about 40%. The  report analyzes the original proposal for 1,152 residences on the ranch and a  four-lane access road, instead of a two-lane road and 750 houses now being  proposed.  </P> <P> VanderKolk, however, said 750 houses still constitutes too much development for  the ranch property.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, they'd have to whittle it down to 50, and even if  they did that, the golf course alone would have devastating impacts" on Palo  Comado Canyon in the development area, she said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the environmental report on the Ahmanson Ranch development concluded  that emissions from traffic generated by the project would far exceed county  air-quality standards. The amount of affordable housing in the area will not be  sufficient to accommodate the number of jobs created by the development, the  report said.  </P> <P> The Ahmanson Land Co. has proposed building 3,000 houses, 3 million square feet  of office space, two hotels and two golf courses on nearly 2,000 acres of  vacant land. About 3,000 acres of the 5,477-acre Ahmanson Ranch will be left in  open space or be used for community recreational facilities.  </P> <P> One alternative presented in the environmental report was for the developer to  scale back the project to include 250,000 to 400,000 square feet of commercial  space and to reduce the number of housing units to between 600 and 900. It also  advised that development should only occur in the south-central, southeastern  and southwestern portions of the project site.  </P> <P> Officials of the Ahmanson Land Co. said they want more time to review the  environmental report before making any decisions.  </P> <P> VanderKolk said that although she likes the design and some of the other  amenities in the Ahmanson project, she simply cannot support it because of its  location.  </P> <P> "The proposal would be wonderful in Iowa," VanderKolk said, "but it's terrible  for the property where they want to build it."  </P> <P> Flynn, on the other hand, is less critical of Ahmanson than Jordan.  </P> <P> "When I look at the aerial of the Ahmanson project, it's surrounded by urban  development," Flynn said, "so it seems to present a different picture than  Jordan, especially if Victory Boulevard goes through."  </P> <P> The Ahmanson Land Co. has proposed extending Victory Boulevard in the San  Fernando Valley west into Ventura County, where the housing development would  be located.  </P> <P> However, the proposal has come under attack by Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy  Picus. She is concerned that a large amount of traffic would be funneled onto  Victory Boulevard in West Hills, which is in her district. The project is  expected to generate an additional 70,000 vehicle trips per day throughout the  surrounding area, Ventura County officials have said.  </P> <P> The first public hearing on the environmental documents is scheduled for Oct.  31. at the Ventura County Hall of Administration.  </P></p>

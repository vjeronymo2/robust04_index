			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Irish business and politics under spotlight: Tim Coone on continuing hearings on corruption allegations in beef industry ONCE a week at the Maynooth livestock market, just west of Dublin, thousands of grass-fattened cattle are sold under the auctioneer's hammer to a mixed audience of gruff, ruddy-faced farmers, slaughterhouse agents and overseas buyers. The nod of a head here may be reflected in the price of a pack of vacuum-packed mince in London or Paris. For the past 35 years, it has been one of Ireland's main livestock markets. It is a price-setting market for the industry: an industry which sustains 100,000 farmers, accounts for around 8 per cent of Irish exports and which has become the subject of one of the longest running public inquiries in the history of the Irish state. For the past 18 months, in the sombre buildings of Dublin Castle, the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry, has been investigating allegations made by opposition parliamentarians of fraud, malpractice and political connivance in the Irish beef industry. Legal teams have been ruminating over a paper trail of government documents, memos, ministers' diary entries, heard over a thousand hours of sworn evidence from witnesses which have included slaughterhousemen up to the prime minister himself, and produced enough documentation to fill several cattle trucks. The central character in this legal epic is Mr Larry Goodman, whose company Goodman International, is Europe's biggest meat processor, and which has been accused of breaching export regulations, abusing government export credit insurance, and of using political influence to cut competitors out of the market and to steer government policy in its favour. In the past week, managers from his slaughterhouses have been giving evidence denying that any deliberate breaches of regulations took place, contradicting earlier evidence given by witnesses that some breaches discovered at the plants may have been planned. Mr Goodman himself sat in the witness box for a week earlier this month, attired in a neat, dark-blue suit, with a red silk handkerchief tucked into his top pocket. He spoke mildly but made no apologies for being a tough businessmen. 'We lobbied for as much as we could as often as we could. . . I did have access (to senior politicians) and I did use (that access) whenever I could to the benefit of the company. . . On every occasion that I met with a minister, yes, I would have used that to put our case,' were some of the statements he made. But he emphatically denied that there was ever any impropriety in any of these dealings. Mr Goodman left school at 16 to help in his father's cattle trade business, and over the next 37 years transformed Ireland's meat processing industry into one of the most efficient in Europe and the largest supplier to the UK supermarket chains in what is one of the most competitive and lowest-margin industries. Few people feel ambivalent about Ireland's so-called 'beef baron'. His detractors see him as a secretive and unscrupulous entrepreneur, who has built up an unhealthy level of market power, which they claim he has used to bully and bend governments to his will. His perceived close relationships with former prime minister, Mr Charles Haughey, and the present prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, were seen by opponents as legitimate targets of attack. In his evidence Mr Goodman said that the 'genesis' of his problems began in 1987 'in stepping on to the stand with Mr Haughey and doing what I was asked to do' in announcing a new IPounds 260m (Pounds 261m) beef industry development plan. His admirers view him as someone who has directly or indirectly created tens of thousands of jobs in Ireland, who paid farmers promptly and fairly and paid his workforce well. 'The farmers would have little bad to say about Larry,' said Mr Sean Doyle, who helps run the family company that owns the Maynooth livestock market. 'He put money into the farmers' pockets and found export markets where nobody else did. At times he was in there buying everything.' No rural politician or party leader in Ireland can afford to ignore the voice of their constituencies. The question being asked though by Mr Justice Liam Hamilton, the chairman of the tribunal, is whether those politicians have also ignored the ethical standards expected of elected public representatives. A number of allegations against Mr Goodman have already been withdrawn, in the absence of evidence to substantiate them. Mr Dermot Gleeson, the counsel for Goodman International, has pointed out that political contributions by the company to all political parties amounted to no more than 0.06 per cent of the company's turnover over the past 10 years. Some crucial evidence has been denied to Justice Hamilton. The Supreme Court ruled last year that cabinet discussions cannot be probed by the tribunal or the courts, as it would undermine cabinet confidentiality and the process of government. Key documents relating to some allegations have simply disappeared from government files as well as from the Goodman company. When Justice Hamilton's findings are published later in the year, many of the allegations may be left hanging ambiguously in the air. It is hoped, however, that at least the tribunal may give some lessons for the future as to how the intertwining strands of politics, business and government might be better separated in Ireland.</p>

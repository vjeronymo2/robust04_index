			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / S Africa may back peace force Mr Joe Modise, South Africa's defence minister, said yesterday the country would be prepared to take part in peace-keeping operations on the continent, provided such actions were carried out on a multilateral basis. Speaking at a conference in Johannesburg, Mr Modise said South Africa would support the establishment of regional security alliances to help prevent armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. But he noted that South Africa would not undertake any peace-keeping duties unilaterally. The announcement, which marks the first time South Africa has publicly committed itself to a military role outside its borders, has fuelled speculation that the country, which has by far the most powerful army in the region, might share in a peace-keeping force in Angola to help bolster the peace treaty signed last weekend between the Angolan government and the rebel Unita movement.</p>

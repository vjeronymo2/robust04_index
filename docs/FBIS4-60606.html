			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Margin of the President's Remarks"] </F>   [Excerpts] Even though the president's remarks to  journalists and authors were very timely and appropriate,  nevertheless parts of them were disappointing. [passage omitted]    The president referred to two confidential reports in his  remarks. One was about the discovery of "bugging" devices at  the Iranian Embassy in London and the other about foreign debts.    If he had considered the press to be trustworthy, the best  thing to do would have been to call in the press and explain  things. His reference to coordination with Western countries  should be viewed within this context. In other words, all the  lie disseminators and mass media in the West know everything,  while no one in Iran does.    Our press always gets its major news from others, so the  press has no alternative but to refer to foreign news and mass  media among its other news sources. If the officials of the  country are not aware of this, then they should be; and if they  are aware of this and still do not give information to the  press, then they should expect such reactions.    The president also said coordination of some of the items  published in our press with foreign radios that later reported  them was negative in value. It is all right if the foreign  press cites millions of words uttered by our officials, but when  one sentence that we write is cited by a foreign publication or  mass media -- and possibly by the counterrevolution -- this is  considered to be coordination and cooperation with the  counterrevolution.    More important still, should the press, which complains  about  high prices and inflation, be subsidized? Does this not  actually mean that if the press is able to overcome its  problems, it will cease to report about high prices and  inflation? If this ever happens, then the press will distance  itself from the people and the people will sever their links  with the press because they will clearly realize that since it  is subsidized, the press will no longer protest against high  prices and the absence of correct economic planning.    Has the press not carried numerous articles about economic  issues? Has anyone read these articles? Or have these economic  views been buried in politicking? As many economic articles  have been published over the past four years as in the whole  previous history of Iran. But who listens to such analyses?  Unfortunately it is apparent that some of the economic analyses  have been completely ignored simply because they would have  benefited the opposing faction.    Theories on how to increase the strength of the national  currency have been put forward. But unfortunately the Central  Bank, which should undertake this task, has itself become a  major factor in devaluing the national currency.    As for the esteemed president's remarks that each  publication  should become an economic analyst and study the situation, this  has been done. But it has not yielded any results. Of course  it is hoped that gradually, when the problems of some of the  theories are clarified, there will at least be a willingness to  accept criticism. And this might help us to turn away from the  wrong path that is being tread and to chose the correct  path--even if only for the sake of the people.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S MEASURE N AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY  </P> <P> Christina L. Shea's Commentary (Oct. 22) in defense of Measure N is fraught  with the hypocrisy, contradiction and legal ignorance characteristic of the  entire campaign by the Irvine Values Coalition to trash Irvine's Human Rights  Ordinance. It is hypocritical, as well as illogical, for Shea to claim that the  ordinance is unnecessary because there is no discrimination against homosexuals  in Irvine. How absurd! The coalition's campaign clearly shows -- in word and  deed -- that latent discrimination against homosexuals is all too abundant in  Irvine. We dare not imagine how fashionable it will become to openly manifest  such attitudes if the "sexual orientation" clause of the ordinance is repealed.  </P> <P> The question of whether homosexuality is behavior-based or an innate  characteristic is legally irrelevant. We do not need to decide whether one is  born a homosexual or becomes one in order to treat homosexuals as a protected  minority.  </P> <P> Protection against discrimination neither implies nor creates "special rights"  or "affirmative action requirement." To reject Measure N is to affirm our  collective belief in the right of all individuals to lead lives free from  unwarranted governmental intrusion and discrimination. Irvine's Human Rights  Ordinance cannot eliminate Shea's suspicion and hatred of homosexuals, but it  can prevent those attitudes from determining the course of local public policy.  </P> <P> MARK P. PETRACCA  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

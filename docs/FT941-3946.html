			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Monday Interview: Survivor in a youth industry - Peter Bonfield tells Lucy Kellaway why he is content to grow older with ICL If Peter Bonfield, chairman of ICL, could be anyone in the world who would he choose? The younger and richer Bill Gates? The head of Fujitsu, ICL's parent company? Far from it: Bonfield's hero is veteran guitarist Eric Clapton. He loves the music, admires the man, and even copies his taste in footwear with a pair of Timberland boots. At Clapton's concert in the Albert Hall last month, the chairman of ICL was to be seen clapping and stomping at the front while his guests watched at a polite distance in the corporate box. Both Clapton and Bonfield are Peter Pan figures in their professions. This year the businessman celebrates his 50th birthday and his tenth anniversary running ICL, making him - like the guitarist - a successful elderly survivor in a youth industry. What Bonfield admires most about Clapton is his ability to change. That, too, is what he is most proud of in his decade at ICL. On Wednesday the company will announce results that will show ICL is still outrunning most of the European competition. The day I met him in his unassuming Putney office he was not wearing his Timberland boots, but was looking a dapper Jack the Lad in a pair of woven black leather shoes and double breasted suit. Neither was he jumping up and down, but sitting bolt upright on the edge of his sofa, answering questions briefly, directly and openly. In his lapel he was wearing a little enamel badge with a tick - a sign of ICL's commitment to quality and part of the uniform of the ICL manager. Bonfield is never without his badge - or almost never. When, at a recent weekend ICL brainstorming conference, he turned up for breakfast without it, he was challenged by his colleagues. 'I forgot to take it off my pyjamas,' he said. It was a joke, but only just. Bonfield takes this sort of thing very seriously. Total Quality Management, benchmarking, empowerment, investing in people . . .every good practice in the management book - you name it, Bonfield embraces it. He is a classic workaholic - working punishingly long days, weekends, and almost never taking holidays. He says he feels no stress; he just loves the job. When he is not working he is running or peddling furiously away on his exercise bike. And when he is not doing that he is asleep. Is he, I wonder, like Margaret Thatcher, the kind of person who thrives on just five hours sleep a night? 'Oh no. I'm not like Margaret Thatcher at all,' he says, his face deadpan but eyes shining to suggest he has made a joke. 'I'm a quite different person.' His wife, also a fitness freak, sees him seldom, although last year they did go whitewater rafting together. It was his first holiday in a decade, and was such a success that Bonfield may even take a few days off this year to take her for a climb up Ben Nevis. A man who sets such high standards for himself might be expected to be a nightmare to work for. Especially one who unfailingly takes the tough decision - most famously he closed down the factory in which his own father worked. Yet even those who by rights should dislike him speak as if Bonfield is their best friend. 'Peter is a visionary,' says Professor Garry Hunt, an ex-director of ICL who lost his job in a reshuffle. 'He's got respect in the industry.' Even trade unionists who have quarrelled with ICL over its attempts to push them out of the picture feel admiration for the company's chief. 'He understands the importance of high technology and the need to promote it to a wider audience,' says Larry Brooke of the MSF manufacturing union. Bonfield makes it his business to be involved in industry matters beyond the corporate confines of ICL. He is on the board of the British Quality Foundation, is a member of an EU technology task force, and (unusually for a British businessman) sits on the board of various US and European companies. He says - half seriously - that when he became managing director of ICL at 39 he was already 'getting on a bit', and ten years later he refers to himself as an 'old grey beard'. The key to survival in the business is to be 'very fast-moving, very international and very flexible. If you've got those it doesn't matter how old you are'. Bonfield appears to have all three traits. This south Londoner with his flat vowels is one of Britain's most international businessmen. After university he spent ten years working for Texas Instruments in the US, which he says shifted his focus forever. 'The thing that really changed me was that six months out of university I was running a team in Dallas. My mates were still in digs in Leicester.' At ICL he has been immersed in the European computer market, and since 1990 he has been running a company 80 per cent-owned by the Japanese. Even though he can't speak Japanese, (he admits to being barely able to speak French) he goes down well in Japan. Contrary to the popular fear that Fujitsu would swamp ICL, Bonfield has continued to run the company autonomously. 'A lot of people wouldn't believe that Fujitsu has dumped Dollars 1.3bn into this company and left me to run it,' he says. Part of the reason is that ICL has performed, making profits when almost every other European computer company was making losses. But it is also due to a personal affinity between Bonfield and his Japanese bosses. He says his approach to business is similar to theirs. Both, he says, are 'open, transparent, trusting, and think in a long-term strategic way'. The flip side of his success is the danger that he has made himself too important to the company and its relationship with its parent. Hunt argues that his one serious mistake is not to have paid enough attention to grooming successors. The problem is made worse by the fact that Bonfield combines the roles of chairman and chief executive, thus committing a serious sin of the modern boardroom. He excuses himself by arguing that with two major shareholders breathing down his neck there is no shortage of checks and balances. That would change if the company fulfils its ambition and floats on the stockmarket, in which case the roles would be split. Bonfield has hinted in the past that he might go when the company floats, but that possibility is receding. 'I'd never float the company and run off,' he says.</p>

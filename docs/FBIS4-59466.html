			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by HATZOFE correspondent and news agencies] </F>   [Text] Senior PLO members and Israeli legal experts are  due to meet in Vienna today for an initial discussion of the  final status of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, which is to be  determined after a period of temporary self government. This  was reported by Palestinian sources yesterday.    "This would be a first meeting between the PLO and Israel on  this level," one of the Palestinian sources said. According to  the source, the Israelis taking part in the meeting are: Eli  Dayan, chairman of the Labor Knesset faction; Labor Knesset  Members Yosi Katz and Avigdor Qahalani; Shim'on Shamir, formerly  Israel's ambassador in Egypt; and Peace Now representative Orit  Rosen.    The Palestinians are represented by Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi,  adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat; Hasan 'Abd-al-Rahman, PLO  representative in Washington; Furayh Abu-Middayn, who was  recently appointed member of the Palestinian administrative  council; Ibrahim Kar'in, head of the Palestinian information  office in Jerusalem; and Rahhab al-'Isawi, a Hebron University  professor.    The interim self government in the Gaza Strip and the  Jericho  region will operate for a limited period, and negotiations on  the final status of the territories are to begin no later than  three years after the implementation of the autonomy agreement  begins.    The two-day "private" meeting in Vienna, however, is taking  place with the full knowledge of the Israeli and the PLO  leaders, the source told a REUTER correspondent.    The meeting is sponsored by the Austrian Kreisky Fund. It  will deal with issues such as refugees, settlements, borders,  and the confederation. According to the sources, these issue  were left as a basis for negotiations on the final status of  Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 13 May  carries a live telephone interview with Knesset Member Eli Dayan  in Vienna. Asked to confirm the above report, Dayan says: "It  is true that we are holding a meeting, but not on the issue you  have mentioned. It is important to hold meetings with  Palestinian representatives and see how they deal with the  interim agreement."    [Dayan later denies that he and the other Israelis are  following instructions from the prime minister and the foreign  minister to discuss the permanent arrangement. Stressing that  the meeting is private, he adds: "The interim agreement says  that its duration can be cut shorter since, by nature, an  interim agreement is temporary. We want it to succeed and want  to hear what can be done to promote the permanent arrangement,  which is more stable." Dayan goes on to say that he will report  to the prime minister upon his return to Israel.]</p>

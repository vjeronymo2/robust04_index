			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Patten sees little chance of being PM MR CHRIS PATTEN, who will become governor of Hong Kong in July, said yesterday that he was unlikely to become prime minister. 'Given that John Major and I are more or less the same age - and given that he has proved such an outstandingly successful political leader - he will go on for a very long time,' he said on TV-am. 'Anyone of my generation is very unlikely to be prime minister.' He hoped he would not be 'entirely over the hill' in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to China. He will then be 52. Mr Patten added that in Hong Kong he might abandon the governor's ceremonial dress, which is seen by some people as an emblem of colonialism. 'It is perfectly possible to maintain the authority and dignity of the office through the way you carry it out,' he said. He said he intended to work to ensure that the joint declaration about Hong Kong by the UK and China, in which a degree of democracy and a free-market economy are guaranteed, was put into effect. 'What China is talking about is pretty unique - one country with two different systems operating within it,' he said. 'The Chinese want to see it work as successfully as we do and the people of Hong Kong do.' Mr Patten, outgoing Conservative party chairman and a former environment secretary, was MP for Bath from 1979 until last month's general election, when he lost the seat to the Liberal Democrats.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Office space glut hits Tokyo property market A GLUT of office space has finally struck the Tokyo property market, with a resulting decline in rents, according to a study by KK Halifax Associates, the property agent and developer. While the excess of office space may be seen as a natural result of the high pace of building in recent years combined with the slowdown in the economy, many analysts had expected the plunge in property prices in the past year would have little impact on rents. Halifax, however, says rents are already falling, and it forecasts an 11 per cent decline in rates this year, largely because Japanese companies have largely stopped seeking new leases. It says that about 12m sq ft of office space was built in Tokyo annually from 1981 to 1985, but that this increased to 30m sq ft a year in the subsequent five years, an annual increase of 6.42 per cent. Between 1985, the office population in Tokyo increased by 13 per cent to 4m, but additions to floor space rose 42 per cent, leaving a current potential surplus of 62m sq ft. Large additions to current stock are also expected this year and next, after which the momentum will give out. Halifax says the vacant-building rate should climb from less than a quarter of 1 per cent in 1990 to 2 per cent this year. Vacant space in older buildings has climbed from 8.75m sq ft in 1990, to 29m sq ft on May 1.</p>

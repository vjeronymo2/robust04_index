			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Talabani: Turkey Must </F> Mediate in the Dispute"]    [Text] An explosive situation still exists in northern  Iraq. The Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK], which is headed  by Mas'ud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK],  which is headed by Jalal Talabani, are involved in a serious  struggle for power. Ankara has been very worried by the  clashes, which began over an insignificant piece of territory  and which quickly turned into a war between the two sides.  Turkey is worried that the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] may  benefit from the internal clashes in northern Iraq and  strengthen its position in the region.    Receiving reliable information on the clashes, particularly  on whether or not one of the two sides has established  superiority, has been difficult. The intelligence reports  Ankara has received are not clear. It is difficult to determine  which side tells the truth and which side distorts the facts.    DPK leader Mas'ud Barzani has held PUK leader Jalal Talabani  entirely responsible for the clashes. He has accused Talabani's  forces of starting the clashes in order to expand the territory  they control. Furthermore, Barzani has claimed that Talabani  has cooperated with the PKK and allowed that organization's  armed units to join his forces.    We conferred with Jalal Talabani in Damascus yesterday  morning. His views were different. He said that a personal  problem does not exist between him and Mas'ud Barzani and that  he frequently confers with him by telephone. Talabani argued  that the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan [IMK], which is headed by  Ethem Barzani and supported by Iran, is the main problem.  Talabani also argued that several DPK units have joined the  clashes with the arms they have received from Iran. He  asserted: "Iran has interfered. It has armed the IMK groups  and sent them to our region through al-Sulaymaniyah. Several  DPK groups also have been involved. Mas'ud Barzani has failed  to intervene. It may be that he is unable to do so. The matter  is an Iranian design."    According to Talabani, the situation in al-Sulaymaniyah has  been placed under control. Nevertheless, clashes have continued  from time to time. In other words, the tension has not been  completely defused.  <H5>  Turkey's Mediation Is Essential.... </H5>   Talabani rejected DPK's allegations that he secretly  cooperates with the PKK. He said that he does not need that  organization. Talabani asserted: "Most of PKK's militants are  in Turkey. The rest were in the camp in Zalakh. Turkish  aircraft have intensively bombed it. Only the wounded and sick  militants are in that camp now. We have never been involved in  secret bargaining talks with the PKK."    However, Foreign Ministry officials in Ankara and the  intelligence units are skeptical. They have said that Talabani  maintains an unreliable policy and supports the PKK from time to  time. A Turkish official has asserted: "Compared with the  peshmerga forces of the DPK and PUK in northern Iraq, PKK's  armed groups are more ambitious and reckless. Consequently, the  PKK gains from divisions and clashes." The same official also  asserted that the clashes must end in order to prevent the PKK  from benefiting from the present situation.    Turkey has made an effort during the past week to have  Barzani and Talabani hold talks on the situation. The officials  of the Internal Affairs Ministry, the intelligence organization,  and the Foreign Ministry met several times to consider what  Turkey can do. Talabani informed us during our telephone  conversation that Turkey must intervene to mediate between the  two sides. He said: "Turkey must make its weight felt because  Iran's intervention will upset the balances in the region. I am  prepared to meet Barzani in any part of Turkey. I am prepared  to hold talks with him to end the dispute. I have explained my  approach to the Turkish officials. I am waiting for them to  respond."    The officials maintained their contacts in Ankara the night  before last and yesterday. Messages were conveyed to the two  leaders. However, a final result was not yet achieved by the  time this column was written. The meeting will take place in  Turkey. Talabani does not wish to meet Barzani in northern Iraq.  He said: "I shall either go to Turkey or remain where I am at  the present time."    On his part, Mas'ud Barzani prefers to meet Talabani in  northern Iraq. He wants only the Turkish officials to attend  the summit he will have with Talabani. Furthermore, he wishes  to avoid creating uneasiness in Baghdad. That is why he prefers  not to involve the Iraqi opposition groups in the matter.  <H5>  Foreign Ministry: Talabani's Supporters Are To Blame for the </H5> Incidents    Considering the intelligence reports, the Foreign Ministry  is  convinced that the incidents in northern Iraq were caused by  Talabani's supporters. Officials have said: "Nevertheless, we  shall approach the two sides and try to convince them to end the  fighting."    Foreign Ministry officials are convinced that Saddam Husayn  stands to gain from the clashes between the two most important  groups in northern Iraq and they believe that they have  exaggerated the dispute between them. A high-ranking official  has explained Ankara's position as follows:    1. We cannot ignore an attempt by Saddam Husayn to suppress  the Kurds in northern Iraq yet again.    2. Peace must be established in the region. A cease-fire  must be imposed in order to normalize the situation.    3. The problems must be resolved in accordance with the  principle of maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity. We  cannot condone any activity that may be aimed at the  establishment of a Kurdish state in the region.    The Foreign Ministry officials' approach on the possibility  of establishing a Kurdish state is very clear. They have  persistently reiterated that a satisfactory guarantee has been  given to Turkey and that the possibility is no longer considered.    Ankara is gradually encouraging Talabani and Barzani to  reach  an agreement with the Baghdad administration. Officials have  suggested that the two leaders should hold talks with the Iraqi  Administration on all the formulas, including the concept of  autonomy for the Kurds. However, a significant distance has not  yet been covered in that direction....    Northern Iraq is the number one problem in Turkey's foreign  policy. Obviously, any confusion in that region will make  Ankara feel uneasy.</p>

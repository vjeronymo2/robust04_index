			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Financial services still face curbs to market entry Intensive bilateral and multilateral negotiations over the past four years have broken down market barriers to foreign banks and securities firms in countries around the world. But lack of competitive opportunity for foreign financial institutions remains 'the rule rather than the exception'. These are the findings of a new 739-page US Treasury report covering the last four years. Bilateral talks between the US and Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan have 'yielded progress in a number of key areas,' according to the report. Japan has permitted establishment of foreign investment trust management companies and has expanded the range of securities foreign firms can underwrite and sell. The report says China has expanded the number of locations for foreign branch banking and lets foreign banks buy and sell foreign exchange on behalf of foreign-invested joint ventures. Korea has formulated a three stage framework for comprehensive financial sector liberalisation, and Taiwan has partially lifted a ban on foreign bank branch entry. Brazil, on the other hand, still prohibits new entry of foreign banks and has frozen increases in foreign participation in the ownership of existing institutions. Several countries - including Chile, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand - have bans on the issuance of new domestic banking licenses. The EU's single market in financial services is being implemented on a reciprocal basis, but a number of European countries impose capital requirements on branches of foreign banks which do not apply to EU banks, according to the report. Negotiations completed in the Uruguay Round established a framework of multilateral disciplines under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats). In these talks - due to conclude six months after the launch of the World Trade Organisation - the US is seeking binding commitments to reduce or eliminate a broad range of barriers. In a statement accompanying the report, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, outlined a three-step strategy to press for further financial liberalisation. First the US will not agree to provide national treatment, equalising the opportunities for foreign and US banks, unless other 'commercially important countries' commit to further openings. The US will continue to press openings in bilateral negotiations. It is also pushing for development and integration of capital markets around the world, using as enticement technical assistance and loan programmes offered by the multilateral financial institutions. The US has been simplifying access to its own markets. Since 1990, a total of 305 new foreign securities groups have entered the US market.</p>

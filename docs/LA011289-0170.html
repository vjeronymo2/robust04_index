			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> A plan to revive steam train passenger service to the Grand Canyon has won  tentative approval from the National Park Service, provided its operators can  show that it will reduce automobile traffic. Grand Canyon Railway earlier in  the week said it plans to establish service over the 64 miles between Grand  Canyon Village on the south rim and Williams, a town of 2,400 people near  Flagstaff, Ariz. The line was built in 1901, but passenger service was halted  in 1968. The Park Service says it supports restoration of train service because  it might help reduce automobile traffic at Grand Canyon National Park.  </P></p>

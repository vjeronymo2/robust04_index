			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN ON WORKFARE OBSTACLES AND BUDGET CUTS IN SOCIAL PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Deukmejian's article illustrates how little he knows about the plight of the  working mother raising children alone. He proposes that welfare mothers be  required to take a job at the minimum wage or lose their benefits, rather than  remaining in school to help them get a better job.  </P> <P> This means that, working full-time, a mother would only earn about $700 a  month, and bring home even less, after deductions.  </P> <P> With rents in Los Angeles for a one bedroom apartment averaging $595 a month  and child care costs at $200 to $400 a month, it only takes a little simple  arithmetic to see that her family would be penniless and quite possibly  homeless before she started her second month at work. As the director of a  shelter for homeless women and children, I already see too many families  struggling to survive on too little. The governor needs to sign up for one of  workfare's remedial math programs that he'd like to cut back so that he can  learn why his figures only add up to disaster.  </P> <P> NANCY BERLIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles House of Ruth  </P></p>

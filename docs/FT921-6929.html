			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Kuwaiti bank well ahead THE United Bank of Kuwait, the London-based consortium bank, has announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m (Dollars 17.7m) for 1991, up from Pounds 5.5m in 1990, and written back Pounds 4.5m out of Pounds 13.5m worth of provisions made against Kuwaiti and Iraqi exposure in the bank's 1990 accounts. UBK, jointly owned by 13 Kuwaiti institutions, has taken the write-back and after-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m into reserves, restoring them to pre-Gulf war levels of Pounds 21m. UBK made an overall loss in 1990 of Pounds 9.9m which it charged to reserves. In addition to provisions against loans in Kuwait and Iraq, the bank suffered a Pounds 4.4m loss on securities in 1990, largely certificates of deposit, sold after the Iraqi invasion to increase liquidity. The bank's overall footings fell in 1991 to Pounds 1.72bn from Pounds 1.96bn largely as a result of the standstill in the Kuwait interbank market, where UBK is traditionally highly active with local counterparties. However, Mr Christopher Keen, general manager, said he expected footings to recover above Pounds 2bn over this year as the Kuwait market revived. He said the bank had performed well in its UK and US commercial and mortgage operations.</p>

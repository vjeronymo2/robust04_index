			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Selling Fininvest, </F> RAI"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Premier Silvio Berlusconi has  thought of selling off his vast retail-to-media empire Fininvest  but is in a quandary about potential purchasers, the government  chief said in a state television interview on Thursday [9 June].    "I will not rule out, in the future, selling off my  holdings," Berlusconi told the interviewer. "I confess I have  thought of handing my company over to my five children and to  those friends who have laboured with me to create it." But,  said the premier, referring to opposition demands that he  off-load his businesses, "I have to say that I would not know  who to sell it to. It just is not that simple."    According to Berlusconi Fininvest is now run by others, and  even his shares are in the hands of trustees, who have formed a  de facto blind trust for his interests. "My business is now  something which does not belong to me," the premier said.    Berlusconi was at pains to stress that his ownership of  Fininvest, and particularly of its television interests, in no  way interfered with his role as premier which, he said, he is  involved in "one hundred per cent."    Fininvest owns three of Italy's eight television stations  with licenses to broadcast nationally. Some of Fininvest's news  and current events programmes have been accused of bias towards  Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.    The situation within the Fininvest group is "absolutely  clear", according to Berlusconi who said that "multiple  guarantees" exist to safeguard public interests in the field.  Listing the press, antitrust authorities, and the judiciary,  the premier added that the best safeguard of all was his own  conscience.    Chatting to journalists after the interview was recorded,  Berlusconi returned to his recent statement on the RAI's  allegedly anti-government stance which provoked an outcry.    "It did not even enter my mind that the government would  want  the RAI to be pro-government. That would have been squalid,"  the premier said.</p>

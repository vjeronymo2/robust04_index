			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: SA bank turns in 18% rise for half First National Bank, South Africa's third-biggest banking group, announced a better than expected 18.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to R500.5m (Dollars 141m) for the six months to March 1994, compared with R421.5m a year ago. Total assets rose by R10.4bn to R58.5bn, spurred by a 22.3 per cent increase in deposits and current accounts and an 18.8 per cent increase in advances. Net interest income rose by 14.8 per cent to R1.24bn from R1.08bn, while bad debt charges dropped to R184.1m from R184.8m a year ago. A sharp boost in other operating income, to R964.8m from R755.4m a year ago, was due to the inclusion of insurance group First Bowring and Associates in group results for the first time. Other operating expenditure also rose sharply as a result of the acquisition, increasing to R1.52bn from R1.22bn. The dividend has been raised 8 cents to 63 cents despite a 1.2 per cent increase in the weighted number of shares. The bank has also announced its intention to pursue a five-for-one share split.</p>

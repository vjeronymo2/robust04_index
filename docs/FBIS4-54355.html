			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the two principal  opposition forces, are unlikely to forge a grand coalition, the  leader of a minor political party predicted Friday [27 May].    "We don't expect the LDP and the SDP to get together and  form  a new government," Michihiko Kano of New Party Mirai said in a  lecture.    Kano, who bolted the LDP with four others and launched the  new conservative party in April, reasoned that it is "unnatural"  for those with a different political philosophy to form a  coalition.    A coalition between the LDP and the SDP, long archrivals  under the LDP rule that ended last summer, would "be against the  principle of political reform," said Kano, a former director  general of the Management and Coordination Agency.    Noting the several months that will follow the passage of  the  fiscal 1994 national budget will be a critical stage for Japan's  politics, he urged the formation of a "powerful" government to  institute political, economic and administrative reforms toward  the 21st century.    Mirai has generally supported Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  from outside the cabinet.</p>

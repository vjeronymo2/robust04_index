			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> TONY SOLLIDAY  </P> <P> School: Capistrano Valley  </P> <P> Sport: Football  </P> <P> Position: Quarterback  </P> <P> Class: Senior  </P> <P> In his third year as the Cougars' starting quarterback, Solliday continues to  be one of the most consistently effective quarterbacks in Orange County.  Friday, Solliday completed 12 of 16 passes for 134 yards in Capistrano Valley's  37-13 victory over Servite. But his most important numbers were the four  touchdown passes. Solliday, 6 feet and 175 pounds, now has 12 touchdown passes  in five games this season, tops in the county.  </P> <P> He also has completed nearly 64% of his passes for 930 yards with only one  interception. Three of the touchdowns Friday -- of four, 23 and four yards --  went to Dave Poltl, a fellow three-year starter. Solliday said it's good to  know that he has such a familiar receiver on his side. "I know what he's going  to do and he knows what I'm going to do and that really helps a lot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> * Ace Chiles, who gained 138 yards in 13 carries -- including touch-down runs  of 50 and 43 yards -- and recovered a fumble in Orange's 24-6 victory Friday  over Western.  </P> <P> * Scott Pannier, who had three interceptions to help Corona del Mar to a 10-9  victory over Trabuco Hills Friday.  </P> <P> * Daniel Niednagel, a Dana Hills cross-country runner who ran the fastest time  in the county -- 14 minutes 51 seconds -- to win the Division I race at  Saturday's Dana Hills Invitational.  </P> <P> * Chris Reed, who completed 16 of 28 passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns in  Katella's 28-14 victory over Estancia Friday.  </P> <P> * Ryan Weir, who had 17 goals in four games to lead Corona del Mar to the  championship of the South Coast water polo tournament. Weir scored four goals  in the Sea Kings' 8-6 victory over El Dorado in the title game Saturday.  </P></p>

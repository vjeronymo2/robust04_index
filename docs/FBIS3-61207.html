The following average retail prices will go into effect on 1  December 1993:    meat--3,000 rubles per kilogram,    milk--200 rubles per liter,    vegetable oil--1,000 rubles per kilogram,    sugar--1,000 rubles per kilogram,    tea--2,000 rubles per kilogram,    household soap--100 rubles per bar    On 1 December 1993 noodles will be removed from the list of  quota goods and will be sold to the public at effective current  prices.

Subsidies for  December, for example, have been estimated at 9.1 billion rubles  for meat, 2.1 billion for whole milk, 1.6 billion for tea, and 1  billion for soap.</p>

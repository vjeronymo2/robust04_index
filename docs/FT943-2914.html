			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved cash flow lets Booker edge to Pounds 30.5m Improved cash generation allowed Booker, the food group, to lift its interim pre-tax profits and dividend yesterday despite difficult trading conditions in the UK and US. Pre-tax profits edged ahead from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 30.5m, thanks to interest costs falling from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 6.3m. Net debt was cut to Pounds 149.1m (Pounds 202.4m) by proceeds from disposals and tighter control of working capital. Gearing fell to 79 per cent (123 per cent). Against City expectations, the interim payout was raised to 7.7p from 7.5p. 'We aim to increase the dividend at least in line with inflation,' said Mr Charles Bowen, who joined the the group as chief executive 15 months ago. Mr Bowen said this year should see the sale of the last few small businesses earmarked for disposal and an improved performance from the recently reorganised food service division. Distribution margins remained under severe pressure and products such as cigarettes could be adversely affected by the November Budget. The group's operating profits fell to Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 38.3m) in the 24 weeks to June 18. The biggest problem was Booker's US agribusiness, where profits dropped 60 per cent to Pounds 2m. Arbor Acres, a chicken breeder, suffered a fall in market share and higher research and development expenses. No pick-up is expected before 1996, Mr Bowen said. The UK agribusiness was ahead by Pounds 0.6m at Pounds 4.7m. Fish processing profits fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.9m), mainly reflecting a lower fish catch and thus higher prices which the company was unable to pass on. Booker's biggest business, food wholesaling, pushed up sales by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn but profits were flat at Pounds 13.7m. This was because of the the change in Budget date from April to November, the company said. Earnings per share were 9.8p (10.25p) including a 0.04p exceptional gain against a 0.26p exceptional loss. COMMENT Mr Bowen has delivered the first part of what he promised when he joined Booker: better management and cashflow and a tighter focus to its businesses. In some ways, part two is harder. He wants to build and buy businesses in notoriously difficult sectors. Cash and carry will always bear the brunt of retail price wars as independent grocers struggle to compete. Booker would like to land another big fish operation but there are good economic reasons why targets might come up for sale. Given difficult trading conditions and the long horizon for phase two, Booker will be lucky this year to better the Pounds 89.7m pre-tax before exceptionals of last year. On a prospective p/e of 16, the shares are carrying an over-optimistic view of earnings growth.</p>

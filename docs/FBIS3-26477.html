Consequently, the leading  indicators of social and economic development for this inland  province have reached record levels: The province's total  annual output value of goods and services amounted to 94 billion  yuan in 1993, an increase of more than 19 billion yuan over the  previous year, and equivalent to the total increase of any given  four years during the eighties. The output of major agricultural  products reached an all-time high, with the output value  increasing 8 percent over the previous year. The province  achieved 132.8 billion yuan in total industrial output value, up  37 percent over the previous year. Financial revenue exceeded  7.3 billion yuan, up 1.8 billion yuan from the preceding year.  Village and town enterprises, infrastructure construction, and  foreign trade all reached record levels, registering the highest  increases in the nation.    It is reported that Anhui has reached new levels in three  areas of reform:    -- Changing concepts and opening up in all directions. Anhui  recovered rapidly following the massive [flood] disaster in  1992. Mindful of the fact that coastal areas were developing  rapidly and inland areas were catching up, the Anhui provincial  committee and government made the correct policy decision to  raise its economy to a new level through internal and external  cooperation, beginning with changing concepts and opening up in  all directions. The implementation of the policy of opening up  to the outside world based on "two points and one line" -- in  Hefei and Huangshan and along the Chang Jiang -- quickly turned  the hinterland into the forefront of opening up to the outside  world, thereby promoting the opening up of the entire province.  Meanwhile, unremitting efforts were made to cultivate a new  type of cadre. The relevant departments selected and educated  cadres based on their creativity and awareness of market forces  and overall interests, and they organized efforts to ensure  substantial headway in reform and opening up. Last year, Anhui  reversed the previously unstoppable flow of trained personnel  and funds to coastal areas, as developed coastal areas scrambled  to invest and find cooperation opportunities in Anhui. All this  injected strong vitality into Anhui's rapid development.    -- Seizing opportunities to make reform the largest growth  factor. By deepening reform, Anhui tapped its potential,  inspired enthusiasm, and solved problems arising from the need  for high input in development. In 1993, Anhui scaled new  heights in rural reform as it took advantage of changes in the  rural labor force, as well as urban construction in the  countryside, to introduce a series of measures to reform the  rural ownership structure, the industrial structure, the  development of markets in factors of production, and household  registration administration. This effectively promoted high  quality and high efficiency in agricultural production, as well  as the industrialization and urbanization of the rural economy.  More than 3,000 small towns of a substantial size were initially  built across the provinces, and a market system was born. More  than 5 million peasants switched to secondary and tertiary  industries. The output value of village and town enterprises  totaled 110 billion yuan, increasing by nearly 100 percent in a  year. The per capita income of peasants across the province  increased by more than 100 yuan.    -- Improving overall competitiveness through comprehensive  reform and solving new development-related problems through  reform means. Anhui accelerated supplementary reforms aimed at  changing governmental functions, establishing a social security  system, cultivating markets, and developing individual and  private enterprises. This ensured breakthroughs in economic  reform and improvements in overall strength, resulting in a  three-way development pattern. Specifically in market  construction, more than 4,000 good-sized markets were built  across the province. With the approval of the province and the  state, more than 50 specialized markets concerning factors of  production were established, and there were a dozen or so  country markets whose annual business volume exceeded 100  million yuan.</p>

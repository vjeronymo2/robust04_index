			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Forecast of 4,500 cable jobs The US telecommunications operator Nynex is to invest Pounds 1.1bn in north-west England over the next five years in a project which it predicts could create about 4,500 jobs. The company is to start work next month on a 53-mile multimedia 'super-highway' for cable TV, telephone, data and general telecommunications. The hybrid fibre optics and coaxial ring main will run through parts of Merseyside, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and north-east Lancashire. Nynex said the new system would have the advantages of a single control centre and economies of scale in servicing and administration in comparison with fragmented and separate cable networks. The company plans branch networks and spurs from the ring main, including one to north Staffordshire, bringing the system's reach to about 1.6m homes and at least 90,000 businesses. Nynex will employ about 2,500 people directly and said a further 2,000 jobs would be created among contractors and suppliers. Nynex recently bought several north-west cable franchises from Pactel, McClean Hunter and Telecable, giving it nine contiguous territories. The company is talking to adjacent franchisees about mutual servicing and is looking for more acquisitions. Mr Eugene Connell, president and chief executive, said in Manchester yesterday that Nynex aimed to undercut British Telecommunications by 15 per cent and offer a wider range and better quality of services to business subscribers. The system will have interactive capabilities. Business users and the emergency services will able to set up direct links between each other for voice, data and video communications. It should also be able to link into global multi-media information highways and offer technology for local TV production and programming. Funding is being split between Nynex Corporation in the US, debt finance from financial institutions and cashflow from Nynex's UK operations as people and businesses subscribe. About Pounds 460m of debt finance will be raised next year, including Pounds 130m for the ring main itself. The first customers will come on stream next month. Mr Connell said ultimate profitability relied on achieving 50 per cent household penetration for cable TV, and 20 per cent of the telephone market targets.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The right to sue Mr Rat Mr Andrew Toad has every right to publish extracts from Mr Andrew Rattlesnake's book about Princess Diana. Mr Rupert Rat breaks no law when he profits from the croakings and slitherings of his employees. They are all exercising - I nearly said exploiting - the freedom of the press. They have every right to do so. The law should not be changed to prevent this. The First Amendment to the constitution of the United States is a model for us all. I would go further. Sooner or later Britain's parliament must pass a Freedom of Information Act. Mr John Major's strategy, which is to release almost as much information as would such an act, while maintaining control over the process, is likely to turn out to be an inadequate substitute. The Civil Service will almost certainly make it so. What is required right now, however, is a law to protect individual privacy. As it says in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights: 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' The new law should not prevent publication. That would be censorship. It should, however, enable any citizen who is treated as the princess has been to sue, sue and sue again - and, with luck, to win the kind of damages that would have Messrs Toad, Rattlesnake and Rat crying all the way from the bank. The US courts have established the tort of intrusion into an individual's privacy. Canada, France, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have privacy laws. Parliament should set the ball rolling in Britain's courts. The minister in charge of deciding whether it will do so is Mr David Mellor, the secretary for the national heritage. When he was a junior minister at the home office a couple of years ago he said that the press was drinking in 'last-chance saloon'. His implication was plain. The excesses of the tabloids had to cease, or parliament would curb them. After the Calcutt committee on privacy reported in June 1990, everything was put on hold while the newspapers tried self-regulation. What has transpired has been more like self-abuse. Yet Mr Mellor faces a delicate problem of balance. People have been upset by the tales told about Princess Diana. If false, they are libellous. If true, they are unacceptably intrusive. Against that there is the government's debt to the Tory tabloids for their support during the recent general election. Messrs Cockroach, Scorpion, Weasel and Viper were indefatigable in their efforts to misrepresent Labour policy. Can these distinguished gentlemen, some of them knights, now be denied their reward? May they not continue to enjoy the unfettered right to tear the heart out of any individual, high or low, in the name of a spurious public interest? Mr Mellor, who has not always been written up to his own complete satisfaction, will doubtless deliberate with care before advising the prime minister. He should think thrice before accepting the Calcutt recommendation that media intrusion into private property without consent, and for the purpose of obtaining personal information, should become a criminal offence. It might create martyrs for the wrong cause. Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, Justinian of the FT, favours a tort of 'unwarranted invasion of privacy', subject to a public interest defence. The courts could build on that. Mr Mellor should also consider the rifle-shot strategy propounded by Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, a media expert. Specific documents, such as hospital records or stolen documents containing intimate personal details, would be protected. Following the US precedent you could sue doorsteppers armed with cameras and notebooks for 'watching and besetting' your home. It may be that none of this would help the princess. If the royal refusal to go to court were to persist, the law of privacy that I favour would not protect them. If the Prince of Wales or his wife did sue under such an act they would come up against a public interest defence, which a jury might accept. I have no knowledge of whether the princess has tried her utmost to prevent her friends from spreading information about her, or whether she has acquiesced in their co-operation with the author. If she has acquiesced, Messrs Toad and Rattlesnake would have nothing to fear from a privacy law. Yet I believe that even royals should have a chance to sue the socks off any Brute of The Beast who unjustifiably intrudes upon their private lives. Iago, who would have made an excellent tabloid editor, tells us that the theft of one's good name is the greatest of all. The law of libel prevents such an outrage if the allegations are untrue. But purveyors of true intimate personal details break into the lives of their victims and steal their privacy. Only a genuine public interest can excuse such behaviour. The law should enable juries to determine where the public interest lies.</p>

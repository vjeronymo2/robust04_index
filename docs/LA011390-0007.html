			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPANDING L.A. COUNTY BOARD  </P> <P> I must respectfully take issue with some of the points raised in your  editorial.  </P> <P> The Times has long supported expansion of the five-member Board of Supervisors  and election of a county executive; so have Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and I, and  we signed the ballot arguments for proposed county charter amendments to  accomplish that in 1976 and 1978.  </P> <P> The Times has called upon the board to settle the case out of court and spare  county taxpayers the time and expense of a protracted trial; so have Supervisor  Hahn and myself.  </P> <P> We have made every effort to persuade a majority of our colleagues to this  position. In this light, I believe it is both unfair and inaccurate to ignore a  significant difference of opinion on policy, strategy and tactics among the  board's membership and lump us all together.  </P> <P> EDMUND D. EDELMAN  </P> <P> Supervisor, Third District  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

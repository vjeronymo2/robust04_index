This was stated by National Security Minister Russell  Huggins  in the Senate yesterday.    Noting that there was criticism that the big drug busts were  not taking place in Trinidad and Tobago, but outside, Huggins  said the seizing of drugs outside of Trinidad was "an  intentional act."    "Witnesses (in Trinidad and Tobago) are being bought off as  easy as it is to buy a soft drink in a parlour. We start a case,  we have four state witnesses and by the time the matter comes  up, you can't find any of them. They are in the United States  living it up," he said.    He explained that as a result of this the Ministry had taken  a particular approach to the busting of drug deals.    "When we find out about it (we arrange) to have it seized  outside of Trinidad and not inside," he said, adding:    "We will work with agencies outside of Trinidad and Tobago  and I can tell you that it was largely as a result of our effort  that a drug link between this country and Venezuela was  destroyed recently."    Huggins noted that one of the main perpetrators, a  Trinidadian received a 10-year jail sentence within eight days  of his arrest.    "Now that is the kind of swift justice I will like to see  here. But we have skilled lawyers who know how to delay justice  when it suits them," he added.    The Minister also referred to a recent bust "as far as  Holland" in which both the narcotic units here and the OSS  (Organisation of Strategic Services) played an important role in  the discovery of shipment of drugs on board a British Airways  craft leaving Piarco.    Huggins noted that the task of preventing drugs from coming  into Trinidad and Tobago was far more difficult. Those who  import cocaine have a lot of opportunity to do so, he said,  adding that the south-eastern coast, given the present size of  our Coast Guard, was impossible to patrol on a full-time basis.    He recalled that only recently the Coast Guard had acquired  boats with the capability to chase the small fast boats used by  drug traffickers.    Turning to the Point Lisas Port, he noted that it was  virtually impossible to search 1,000 containers.    "The only way you can do it is by random checks and a  container may slip by and the government and the security at  Point Lisas are blamed," he noted.    He said that while Point Lisas had put in a very good system  to deal with that, it was virtually impossible to completely  eradicate the problem.    He stressed that good intelligence in detecting the drugs  was  still the best option and urged citizens to assist the  authorities in this regard.    Huggins said the U.S. Government had provided govenrment  with  US$303,000; the Canadian Government $1 million, the French  Government had given technical assistance as did the Royal  Canadian Mounted Police.    But, he stressed, foreign assistance was extremely difficult  to access. "Although public pronouncements are made that some  governments are providing assistance, because of the bureaucracy  involved, that assistance is extremely difficult to get our  hands on," he said.    He said on regional basis--Caribbean Financial Action Task  Force--was established to deal with the problem of money  laundering.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague February 21 (CTK) -- The left-leaning RUDE  PRAVO carries an interview with the deputy chairman of  parliament's Defence and Security Committee, Tomas Fejfar, whom  the paper says is known as a supporter of thorough cleansing in  the army.    On this point, Fejfar says that while, on one hand, he  believes the Czech Republic needs a less strong army, such as  will be acceptable to NATO, on the other hand, during three  years nothing much has changed in the army, and therefore it has  to be cleansed. However, he does not mean the removal of former  communists, whom he says formed 90 percent of the army command.    The categories Fejfar has in mind are firstly the former  members of the military counterintelligence, of whom several  hundred remained in the army. The second class are the former  official political indoctrinators, who are still hiding in the  army. They are very experienced and capable, with their own  information channels, and are thus very dangerous, Fejfar says.  Baudys' talk of how much has changed in the army he calls "a  very optimistic view."    Asked to comment on his past statements concerning the  operation of KGB officials in the army, Fejfar says they arose  from a combination of concrete knowledge and certain suspicions,  but he cannot talk about them in the paper.    On the subject of the "gentlemanly agreement" between  Interior Minister Jiri Ruml [name as received] with the head of  Russian counterintelligence that the two countries' intelligence  services would not work against each other, Fejfar says it would  be naive to imagine that foreign intelligence agents, including  Russian ones, did not operate here. The question is whether  they are working against the Czechs or whether they are merely  monitoring the situation, whether their interest has not shifted  to the economic sphere. Fejfar thinks Russian intelligence  understands that the Czech Republic is no longer in their sphere  of influence, and thus their aims are definitely changing.  However, there has to be some cooperation, especially in the  area of organised crime. Intelligence services work here, it is  a question of keeping their activities within bounds, he says.    Asked what he thinks of the opinion that the Interior  Ministry is run by a group of friends who know nothing about  being professional, Fejfar says there are two options, either  you leave the old (pre- revolution) professionals in place,  which is no good, or you rely on friends whom you can trust  fully. If there are affairs in the ministry, it is because the  old is clashing with the new. There is the same problem in the  army, but the affairs there are not written about, although they  might be after there is radical change, he says.</p>

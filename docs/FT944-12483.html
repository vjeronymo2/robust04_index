			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Challenge Bank advances to ADollars 40.3m Challenge Bank, the Western Australian banking group, yesterday announced a profit after tax and abnormals of ADollars 40.3m (USDollars 29.9m) in the year to end-September. This compared with ADollars 21.4m last year. Operating profit, before abnormals and tax, rose to ADollars 65.4m from ADollars 32.4m. Challenge attributed the improved performance to the diversity of its business and the relatively buoyant Western Australian economy.</p>

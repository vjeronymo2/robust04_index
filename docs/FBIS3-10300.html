The Guatemalan official told ACAN-EFE that the Mexican-Costa  Rican agreement is "positive" and added that "we have been  closely following the process that Costa Rica was carrying out  with Mexico." Nevertheless, he said Guatemala has decided along  with Honduras and El Salvador, which form the so-called CA-3  [Central America-3] group, to jointly negotiate an economic  agreement with Mexico. "The agreement between Costa Rica and  Mexico will serve as an example and a foundation for the  negotiations" that will be held with the Mexican authorities, he  said. Gonzalez announced that the CA-3 technical groups will  meet in El Salvador on 7 and 8 March to continue analyzing a  joint mechanism for an economic complementation agreement with  Mexico, which jointly with the United States and Canada forms  the world's biggest economic bloc.    Ministers of the three Central American countries are  scheduled to meet with their Mexican counterpart, Herminio  Blanco [name as received], on 11 March to analyze the marketing  obstacles that some products of the region have in Mexico.    Gonzalez said efforts will be made to have the closer trade  ties with Mexico lead to Central America's integration into the  NAFTA.</p>

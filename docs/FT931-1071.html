			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Government to save 12 pits: British Coal told to start preparations for industry's privatisation THE GOVERNMENT yesterday instructed British Coal immediately to begin preparations for privatisation as it unveiled plans by the company to reprieve 12 of 31 threatened pits and provide a hope of rescue for another seven. Another 12 pits where British Coal intends to stop mining will be offered to the private sector to run along with the seven mothballed pits. Legislation for full privatisation is likely to be brought forward in the next parliamentary session for implementation in 1995. Presenting a white paper on coal, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the House of Commons that the private sector would play a critical role in the coal industry. 'We believe that privatisation is the only way of enabling this industry to take full advantage of the opportunities the market offers.' The government's partial climbdown over pit closures means that an additional 5,800 jobs will be lost in the short term on top of 8,000 miners who have taken redundancy since last October. The total of nearly 14,000 job losses compares with more than 30,000 which were expected when the government announced its original pit closures plan last October. The revised plan was attacked by supporters of the coal industry and unions which viewed it as a short-term fix which would provide only a temporary reprieve for most of the 12 pits as it failed to create more room in the energy market for coal. Mr Norman Willis, Trades Union Congress general secretary, described the white paper as a 'deliberate deception' and said it signalled the demise of the coal industry. 'The reality is that 18 pits will shut down immediately and the remainder will be closed within two years.' Mr Heseltine announced that the electricity industry had agreed to buy 160m tonnes of coal over five years from British Coal. He expected the deals to be signed by the end of March. He also committed the government to subsidise, by an unspecified amount, additional sales by British Coal to the electricity industry. The subsidy would bridge the gap with world prices but would last only until privatisation. The trade and industry select committee suggested in January that up to Pounds 500m would be needed over five years to subsidise tonnages above base contracts. Yesterday's white paper was imprecise, saying the government would embrace the committee's range of figures for subsidies. The generators are discussing the size of extra contracts with British Coal but are resisting anything above 40m tonnes over five years. That would provide a future for a few of the 12 pits. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, would not predict how many of the 12 reprieved pits would last following a market testing exercise to determine extra sales. Negotiations will be complicated by the government's decision to encourage the private coal-mining sector which will increase competition. Mr Heseltine also announced that the Connah's Quay gas project in north Wales and two smaller gas projects should be allowed to go ahead. These projects would involve investment of over Pounds 2bn and would lead to the creation of over 5,000 construction jobs, he said. They will further erode the potential market for coal. In addition, Mr Heseltine said the market for coal would diminish for environmental reasons. The European Commission gave its broad approval to the white paper after telephone discussions between Mr Heseltine and the two commissioners responsible for the sector, Mr Abel Matutes, energy commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, who is in charge of competition policy. The detailed programme will still have to be submitted to the Brussels authorities and receive the formal approval of all 17 commissioners. Mr Heseltine announced that two pits - Bolsover in Derbyshire and Sharleston in Yorkshire - would close because of 'impending exhaustion'. Ten pits where production has already ceased will not reopen. COAL WHITE PAPER: THE MAIN POINTS Twelve pits to be closed, 12 to be reprieved, six to be mothballed, one to have development work only. Generators to buy 160m tonnes over five years from British Coal; government to subsidise additional sales. Privatisation of British Coal to be speeded up. Subsidies to be phased out before privatisation; all pits to be offered for sale or lease before being closed. Total of Pounds 200m to help areas affected by closure. Magnox nuclear power stations to be kept open and nuclear review brought forward a year. 'Dash for gas' to continue with no restrictions on gas-fired power stations; three projects get go-ahead No restrictions on French sales of electricity to the UK. New energy panel to offer advice on development of markets; government to publish an annual energy review. More money for research into clean coal technology.

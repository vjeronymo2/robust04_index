			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Varity cuts deficit to Dollars 2.4m as sales rise VARITY Corp, the loss-making international farm equipment, automotive and industrial machinery group, came close to breaking even in the first quarter, thanks to a 21 per cent boost in sales, higher margins and foreign currency gains. The net loss narrowed to USDollars 2.4m, or 28 cents a share, from Dollars 37.3m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to Dollars 823m from Dollars 681.5m. The biggest improvement was at Kelsey-Hayes, the Michigan-based automotive parts maker, whose sales climbed by almost a third to Dollars 389m, with operating profit doubling to Dollars 31m. Varity acquired Kelsey-Hayes less than three years ago, but automotive products now account for 47 per cent of the parent's sales and more than two-thirds of operating profits. Operating income of the Perkins diesel engine group climbed by 29 per cent, while Massey-Ferguson, the farm machinery maker, broke even, against a Dollars 9m loss last year. But Pacoma, a German hydraulic systems unit, remains in the red, with a Dollars 1m first-quarter loss. Varity is rumoured to be seeking a buyer for Pacoma. Mr Victor Rice, chairman, predicted continued improvement.</p>

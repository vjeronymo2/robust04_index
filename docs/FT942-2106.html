			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Ghosts of Labour past The world has turned. The British Labour party, founded by the trade unions, is no longer wholly their creature. This is about to be demonstrated, perhaps conclusively, during the leadership election. It is a historic change. Some of us have long believed that Labour would not form another government until it made itself as institutionally separate from the unions as the American AFL-CIO is of the Democratic party. In Britain we are nowhere near that happy state, but the management of the party by powerful trade union leaders has become so diminished as to be a mere irritant. It did not seem like that in 1992, when the late Mr John Smith was elected leader with heavy and visible union support. Progress was made at last year's conference, when one-member-one-vote was adopted for the selection of parliamentary candidates, but it looked then as if the price Mr Smith paid - a speech appearing to offer the unions favourable legislation by a future Labour government - was too high. Now it can be seen that the most celebrated decision of that conference was worth the effort expended in engineering it. For the new method of voting for a leader, Mr Smith's successor, is closer to genuinely democratic than anything in the party's history. The electoral college is divided into three: Labour representatives in the Westminster parliament and the European assembly; constituency Labour party members; and trade unionists who are also Labour supporters. Most, but not all of the 3.75m or so individuals entitled to vote in the union section may make their decisions without benefit of guidance or pressure from union leaders. Of Britain's big five unions only the T&amp;G - the Transport and General Workers - has recommended a candidate, Mrs Margaret Beckett. Yet all five will send Labour's standard ballot forms to members' homes. These will be accompanied by a leaflet produced by Labour party HQ, with each candidate allowed a photograph and short election address. The last page will invite recipients to join the party as direct members. With fond memories of my long service in direct mail, that sounds convincing to me. Yet if Labour is turning postal-democratic, it is the Tories who must take some of the credit. Two companies, the Electoral Reform Society's ballotting subsidiary and Unity Security Ballotting Services, will scrutinise, and count the returns. They have had much practice as a result of Conservative legislation obliging unions to consult their members every other afternoon. Nothing is perfect. The T &amp; G will stuff its envelopes with a statement urging recipients to vote for Mrs Beckett. It may regret that. When its general secretary, Mr Bill Morris, was elected there was a 24 per cent return. Perhaps with all the publicity there may be 30 per cent this time. That suggests that only the most politically aware in the T &amp; G will participate. There is no telling how much those who do bother to mark their ballots and send them in the reply-paid envelopes will be swayed by their union's leaflet as against all the other influences on their thinking, but there has to be some bias in favour of Mrs Beckett. There had better be a bit, or Mr Morris and his executive will be seen to be as politically impotent as in truth they have become. The big five will account for something like three-quarters of the vote. Some of the smaller unions have stated a preference for Mr John Prescott. One is the railway union, the RMT, to which Mr Prescott offered strong support yesterday. It will conduct a full postal ballot of 80,000 of its members. Another, the GPMU printers' union, will hold workplace ballots for 97,000 political levy-paying members. Naturally it expects a higher turnout, perhaps 75 per cent. We can be sure that these voters will be influenced by the union officials who distribute and collect the papers, and may even watch while the choice is made. Such wrinkles aside, the national primary that is now being conducted should produce a result that reflects the views of Labour supporters, or at least those interested enough to vote. Some expect that proportion to reach 40 per cent, on the grounds that the winner may well be the next prime minister. Whatever the figure, the process will set union influence where it belongs, on the margin of party affairs. Sooner or later the union block vote at party conferences, already diluted, will be swept away, thus concluding the divorce between party and 'movement'. Everyone should now be able to see that coming. What a pity, then, that none of the three leadership candidates - not even Mr Tony Blair - has yet had the courage to say directly and in trenchant terms that the RMT does no service by bringing its members out on strike. In 1964, when an unofficial stoppage shut down London's underground railway during election week the then Mr Harold Wilson described it as 'intolerable', and went on to win with the greatest swing to Labour since 1945. In the current, official dispute the RMT has done everything by the book. The management has played the government's hand badly. There is some sympathy for the railway workers. That is still no reason for Labour's putative leaders to be mealy-mouthed about an action that causes great inconvenience to many people. Such fearfulness of the spirit of union power past is Old Labour talking. It still burbles. When the BBC went on strike on the night of the Euro-elections the party ruled that none of its leaders should cross picket lines. That was plainly absurd. Over the weekend Mrs Beckett contrived to show that she was more sympathetic to secondary picketing, that scourge of the 1970s, than either of the other two candidates. Mr Prescott neatly stepped aside from that one, but he was not so robust as Mr Blair, who has made it clear that his programme for labour legislation would not start with a clear-out of the Thatcherite union laws. The ideal Labour leader would replace the habit of supporting all official strikes with a less predictable approach. Yet Mrs Beckett and Mr Prescott evidently believe that they need the unions' approval. That may be why Mr Blair, the likely winner as leader, and the most robust on unions, has declined to state a preference for deputy. He must find it difficult to choose between a millstone and an albatross.</p>

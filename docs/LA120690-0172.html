			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHEERS FOR BRASSY APPROACH TO CLASSICAL;  </P> <P> MUSIC: CANADIAN QUINTET KNOCKS PERFORMING ARTS CENTER CROWD ON ITS EAR WITH ITS  PLAYFUL PROGRAM OF STANDARDS.  </P> <P> The Orange County Philharmonic held its third annual high school night Sunday  at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, where it played host to students  from around the county for a free performance by the Canadian Brass.  </P> <P> Here are some reviews of the performance by the brass quintet from Canada,  written by some of the teen-agers in attendance:  </P> <P> Attending a concert by a quintet with the intimidating name of the Canadian  Brass at the prestigious Performing Arts Center Sunday, an evening of comedy  was not exactly foremost in the minds of the waiting teen-agers.  </P> <P> However, after the playful way in which the band members reacted to the hyper  high-school crowd, the audience spent the better part of the hourlong  performance laughing out loud.  </P> <P> The quintet began the evening playing music as they entered the hall from the  back and made their way toward the stage. Their first number, "Canzona," was  played as they dispersed themselves throughout the audience. Such interactions  made the crowd feel especially close to the band.  </P> <P> While introducing a Christmas medley, Canadian Brass trumpeter Ronald Romm  talked about the different words that can be used in songs. "For example," he  said, "Chestnuts roasting in a forest fire . . . "  </P> <P> The craziest part of the evening came when the band performed ballet songs,  ranging from "Swan Lake" to "The Nutcracker." The twist was that the group's  members danced, ballet-style, as they played. And the crowd was worked into an  uproar when trombone player Eugene Watts came out in a tutu and danced in  circles.  </P> <P> The quintet did show it also has a serious side. French horn player David  Ohanian played the lead in Adagio for Strings, the theme song from the movie  "Platoon." The slow, sweeping melody was in direct contrast to many of the  evening's other songs, such as "Beale Street Blues," during which the audience  was encouraged to clap along and yell.  </P> <P> Occasionally, a member of the Canadian Brass would address the audience between  numbers. Speaking about Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,  tuba player Charles Daellenbach related what he believed were the most  interesting parts of the piece. Pointing to the music as if the audience could  actually see it, he said, "See Measure 115? It's very important. That is where  I come in."  </P> <P> The evening culminated with the "The Saints' Hallelujah," a mix of "When the  Saints Come Marching In" with Handel's "Hallelujah" chorus in which trumpeter  Frederic Mills led the band in its foot-stomping attack.  </P> <P>  -- JIM EICHSTEADT  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> The performance of the Canadian Brass was a new and refreshing experience. I  have been to the Performing Arts Center on several occasions, and Sunday's  performance was a great opportunity for me to share my love of music with one  of my best friends.  </P> <P> The communication between artists and audience created a chemistry and made for  an entertaining show.  </P> <P> Tuba player Charles Daellenbach added humor and character to the show. I  especially enjoyed the "Tribute to the Ballet," and only wish the performance  could have been longer. It is rare for me to have so much fun at a classical  music concert.  </P> <P>  -- HEATHER LEE  </P> <P> Villa Park  </P> <P> The talented clowns of classical music -- the Canadian Brass -- presented a  spirited welcome to the holiday season Sunday.  </P> <P> Clad in wrinkled tuxedos and white Oxford shoes -- their trademark -- this  crazy quintet strolled through the aisles, flirted with audience members,  danced around the stage in tutus and encouraged cheering and clapping during  their performance.  </P> <P> Their booming brass sounds overwhelmed the crowd, and their sarcastic humor  left all laughing.  </P> <P> Romm explained that the Canadian Brass uses comedy to keep itself and its  audience from losing appreciation for the music.  </P> <P> "I believe that once you've become bored, you've lost them (the audience)," he  said. "We try everything to avoid that."  </P> <P>  -- STEPHANIE AUSTIN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> Hollering and stamping, the predominantly high-school-aged crowd roared,  whistled and cheered after a particularly rousing performance of Bach's Toccata  and Fugue in D Minor.  </P> <P> Though by no means a personal slight to B-aa-ch-t, as Daellenbach jokingly  pronounced the composer's name, the crowd's uproarious reaction was a bit  unusual. But, hey, no one ever said the Canadian Brass were run-of-the-mill  classical musicians, either.  </P> <P> The quintet astounded the audience with musical virtuosity and down-home humor.  </P> <P> The Canadian Brass has achieved worldwide fame as a witty band that performs  pieces ranging from such classical staples as Vivaldi's Concerto for Two  Trumpets in C Major to seasonal favorites like "Frosty the Snowman."  </P> <P> Several comic touches, such as their trademark donning of white dance Oxfords,  leaves an indelible impression.  </P> <P> "It's become a tradition," Romm said. "Once we showed up in Virginia (for a  performance) and all of the people in the audience had worn white shoes. You  saw these ladies in nice gowns with them (white shoes) on."  </P> <P> The band's show demonstrated its flair for eclectic programming, but in  actuality, Romm explained, "Things are very structured."  </P> <P> This doesn't mean the Canadian Brass plays the same songs over and over again.  They said a considerable amount of time goes into learning new material.  </P> <P> "We substitute things as they are learned," Romm said. "You just can't allow  yourself to get bored because then you allow the bad things to creep in."  </P> <P> The Canadian Brass has helped introduce classical music to an audience ranging  from seasoned concert-goers to first-timers. It's the audience, in fact, that  helps inspire the quintet to perform with zeal.  </P> <P> And when the right chord is struck between the two, Romm said, "it's a really  amazing feeling. There aren't words to describe it."  </P> <P>  -- JUNE FANG  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

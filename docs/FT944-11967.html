			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: SBC forecasts drop in net income Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, said annual consolidated net income for 1994 would be 'clearly below' the record SFr1.37bn (Dollars 1.1bn) achieved last year. SBC said operating income after nine months failed to match 1993's performance. The bank was echoing recent statements from Switzerland's two other large banks. No figures were given, but the bank blamed the uncertainty in financial markets for most of the decline. The trend of trading income was the same as in the first half of the year, when it tumbled 63 per cent. Income from securities trading picked up in the third quarter, but revenues from foreign exchange were down. Net commission income, up 11 per cent in the first half, was down in the third quarter because of a fall in brokerage and syndication and placement fees.</p>

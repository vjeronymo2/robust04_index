			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Police Minister Moshe Shahal by </F> Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning, Police Minister Moshe  Shahal.    [Shahal] Good morning, Hayim.    [Zissowitz] I suppose you are calling us to react to what  the foreign minister said.    [Shahal] I am also prepared to talk about that, but first I  would like to discuss something else. It is a real shame that  you did not talk to me about the report on my meeting with  Faysal al-Husayni, because it is entirely untrue.    First, I did not meet with Faysal al-Husayni because of the  foreign minister's letter. The truth is that I only learned  about the existence of a letter to the Norwegian foreign  minister yesterday evening.    Second, this was not an emergency meeting.    Third, what was discussed in it was the exact opposite of  what you reported. I unequivocally told Faysal al-Husayni that  if any Palestinian security or police personnel are deployed in  Orient House or elsewhere [in East Jerusalem], we will arrest  them, take them into police custody, and bring them to trial;  that if we find a man bearing arms in Jerusalem without a  license or permit, he will be thrown in jail; that if we discern  any pan-Palestinian activities in Orient House, we will simply  take legal action against it. I cited the example of the  Palestinian Bureau of Statistics and categorically told him that  we will shut it down. I told him in the most unambiguous manner  that Jerusalem is unequivocally the capital of Israel; that the  status quo will not change as far as Jerusalem is concerned;  that it is totally inconceivable to us to allow any change  whatsoever, either creeping or otherwise, that would alter the  status of Jerusalem during the interim period. This was a very  comprehensive meeting, and it was attended by Mr. Moshe Sason  and the Jerusalem District police commander. That is why I am  very sorry that you aired this report without asking me.    [Zissowitz] Well, so you have now clarified what was said in  the meeting. Since you called us, I would like to seize this  opportunity to ask you: Do you feel embarrassed this morning  after learning that you were sent to the Knesset to declare from  the podium that no letter was sent to Yasir 'Arafat and that the  whole thing was the figment of someone's imagination?    [Shahal] First of all, I am not embarrassed when facts are  revealed. After asking the Prime Minister's Office for  details, I went to the Knesset podium and gave an answer in  accordance with what I had been told in the clearest and most  categorical fashion. I did not know about the existence of a  letter to the Norwegian foreign minister, but after I talked to  Foreign Minister Peres yesterday....    [Zissowitz, interrupting] Were you misled?    [Shahal] I would not say that. I do not think anybody had  such intentions. After talking to the foreign minister  yesterday and asking him for explanations, and after he read the  letter to me, I must note another point that was not  sufficiently stressed, which is that the letter to Holst speaks  about institutions for the residents of East Jerusalem.  Nevertheless, I did not know about the existence of such a  letter.    [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, Minister Shahal.</p>

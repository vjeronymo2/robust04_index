			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent continues its record setting ways Another round of strong and, in some cases, record performances were seen yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT went into the weekend in positive spirit with a rise in the DAX index at the official close of 10.08 to 2,120.61, its second successive record high . However, this was slightly below an intraday high of 2,123.13. In the post-bourse the unofficial Ibis indicated index made further gains, ending at 2,128. The DAX index gained 3.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was DM9.1bn. The authorities announced yesterday that from December 14 the DAX index will be available after the close of official trading at 1.30pm, with data calculated up to 5pm 'on the basis of prices determined in the electronic trading system Ibis'. The stronger dollar helped a number of stocks while interest was also seen in the chemical sector, Bayer for instance gaining DM4.30 to DM343.00. This stock was helped by a positive meeting earlier in the week, with Goldman Sachs rating the shares now as moderate outperformers: 'We continue to feel that management's stated expectations of only a stable 1994 reflect a very cautious stance and that earnings progress should begin to emerge during the course of next year.' The market's attraction to RWE followed on ahead of next week's dividend payment, the shares rising a further DM2.80 to DM490.80. PARIS built up throughout the session with the CAC-40 index closing up 27.95 at 2,188.40 following the cut in rates by the Bank of France early on. The market has gained 3.2 per cent during the week. Turnover was FFr3.9bn. Canal Plus and Peugeot, which had both been depressed on Thursday by different factor, picked up again, with respective gains of FFr50 and FFr15 to FFr1,300 and FFr730. Investors still see short-term potential in Canal Plus in spite of worries over the extension of its franchise. STOCKHOLM fell prey to profit-taking in Volvo B shares after their surge during the week ahead of Thursday's decision to abandon the Renault merger. The Affarsvarldsen index fell 9.3 to 1,336.2 for a 1.8 per cent rise on the week. Turnover of SKr1.2bn was dominated by SKr436m of business in the Volvo B shares, which fell SKr17 to SKr441. James Capel which upgraded the stock to a buy yesterday, noted that in the short term, Volvo's earnings were in a recovery phase, helped by currency considerations, cost-cutting and higher sales in the US and Britain. As a result, 1994 earnings per share were likely to be substantially higher than if the merger had gone ahead. MILAN received a late boost as the head of the lower chamber of deputies budget committee said that agreement with opposition parties had been reached on a package that will be sent to the full chamber. The Comit index finished 0.90 higher at 549.84, also benefiting from short covering ahead of the weekend. The index rose 1.5 per cent over the week. Kleinwort Benson which has upgraded its recommendation on Italy from neutral to overweight, noted that Milan had been Europe's worst performing market recently and commented that investors had overreacted to the first round of local election results a fortnight ago. Kleinwort added that the 1994 budget package should be approved by the end of the year, paving the way for lower interest rates and early elections. Foreign demand took Fiat L38 higher to L3,976. Ifil, a Fiat group company, rose L256 or 5.7 per cent to L4,770 on news that Arab Banking Corporation had taken a stake in its retailer, Rinascente. Credito Italiano dipped L10 to L2,309 ahead of today's pricing for the privatisation. BRUSSELS rose to a new high with the Bel-20 index finishing up 15.85 at 1,423.67, for a week's gain of 2.3 per cent. Turnover was BFr2.2bn. Banking stocks went against the trend with some analysts commenting that they might be asked to make extra contributions to the government's austerity programme. Banque Bruxelles Lambert fell BFr65 to BFr4,250 in good volume. AMSTERDAM was supported by the easing in domestic interest rates and the CBS Tendency index gained 0.7 to 139.0, for a week's rise of 1.6 per cent. Hoogovens put on Fl 2.60 to Fl 43.10 as the steel group announced that that its rights issue was heavily oversubscribed. ING, which produced good figures on Thursday, eased 40 cents to Fl 85.50. MADRID was pulled higher by the strength of the futures market and the general index added 3.34 to 304.15 or 2.3 per cent up on the week. Turnover was a high Pta29bn. Foreign demand took Repsol Pta150 or 3.6 per cent higher to Pta4,290.

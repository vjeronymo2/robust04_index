In an exclusive statement to MENA, al-Tahir said that the  holding of 21 experts as hostages reflects the power struggle  between the militias of Abdirahman Ali, former President of  northern Somalia, and Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, current president of  the so-called northern Somalia.    Al-Tahir, who is on a visit to Cairo, said that the  abduction  is also a result of the widespread frustration in Burco and  Hargeysa, the two provinces that support secession. The three  other provinces are opposed to secession, he stated.    The Somali official expressed his hope that the United  Kingdom would withhold its support to the secession following  this incident and instead help the Somalis emerge united, not  divided, from the current crisis.    Al-Tahir said that he briefed Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and  Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on the  current developments in the country. Egypt, he added, promised  to hold consultations with foreign countries and utilize its  friendship with these countries in helping the Somalis face the  current crisis.</p>

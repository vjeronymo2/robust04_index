			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Members of the Intervention Board investigating  Banco Latino have disclosed that they sent a message to Bank  Superintendent Roger Urbina resigning from their duties at that  financial institution. Members Julio Santodomingo, German  Ollar, and Tasalio Cadena were appointed to the Intervention  Board on 21 January. The three board members said they were to  have broad powers of administration, disposition, control, and  surveillance, including all duties that the law and by-laws  grant to the general assembly, the board of directors, and the  other bodies of the intervened institution.    Nevertheless, the treasury minister reported that the  executive had decided -- within a special program set up to  handle the Banco Latino problem -- to appoint an administrative  board that would cooperate with the Intervention Board. Tesalio  Cadena, Julio Santodomingo, and German Ollar Sabal rejected the  appointment, saying that there cannot be an administrator of the  administrators. In any event, these high-ranking officials  believe they have fulfilled their duty to the extent possible.    [Begin recording] [Tasalio] We are acting in keeping with  our  consciences. We were not consulted on this measure. We have  our self-respect, and that is why we have resigned.    [Unidentified reporter] So where does that leave the Bank?    [Tasalio] That's the problem of the other board.    [Santodomingo] Our priority was to protect the account  holders. I do not participate in politics. I am not looking for  a ministry or an economic position. I accepted this position  only to defend the depositors. [end recording]    In any event, the new intervention board must wait for a  report on the Bank's current status to decide if this financial  institution can be salvaged or not, although the auditors have  the last word. Meanwhile, Bank Superintendency Director Roger  Urbina replied to the members of the Banco Latino Intervention  Board.    [Begin Urbina recording] I have not been officially informed  of their resignation. If I receive their resignation, another  intervention board will be appointed; if not, the same board  will continue, whatever is appropriate. The important thing is  to do whatever must be done quickly, because we can't lose  another minute in Banco Latino's follow-up, intervention, and  possible recovery. [end recording]    The Banco Latino situation, far from being solved, is  becoming more difficult as it will force the Venezuelan  Government to make specific decisions to punish those  responsible for this financial institution's crisis. In any  event, Roger Urbina will not accept the Intervention Board's  resignation until it is official.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F> correspondent Gadi Sukenik on 2 June; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Rabin] It is an ongoing war. Whenever there is a  opportunity to hit the terrorist organization Hizballah without  necessarily harming civilians, we do so, and we will continue  doing so. They violated the understandings and responded with  Katyusha attacks on civilian targets on Israeli soil. The fact  that there have been no casualties or damage up to this point  does not change the fact that they violated the understandings.  And if they continue, we will have to respond to the violations.    I presented the matter to the Americans via the ambassador  here. It was the Americans who mediated the understandings. I  prefer that they first try to arrange something within the  framework of the understandings with Hizballah's patrons, the  Syrians, but if this situation continues, we will not be able to  abide it.    [Sukenik] What prevented Israel from hitting that base  before? Why today?    [Rabin] We chose the right time because they are not always  there.    [Sukenik] Did you take into account the possibility that the  price for attacking that base might be painful if Katyushas harm  Israelis?    [Rabin] Yes, because in harming them we harm those who in  another week or two months will operate against us. [end  recording]    [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew on  1700  GMT on 2 June carries similar remarks by Prime Minister Rabin at  an Armored Corps gathering in Latrun. Asked by correspondent  'Imanu'el Rosen whether the air raid might harm negotiations  with Syria, Rabin says in a recorded passage: "There is no tie  between the political negotiations with Syria and our war  against Hizballah. Hizballah is the one that initiates the  attacks against the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and SLA [South  Lebanese Army] in the security zone, therefore the war against  it is not carried out by responding to an act, but through an  ongoing war based on the understandings reached in the wake of  Operation Accountability in July 1993."]</p>

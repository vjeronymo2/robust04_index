			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (6): Rise of a new, bolder breed / A look at the expanding role of accountancy firms GERRY ACHER and Stephen Barrett seem to have little in common as they sit next to each other on the far side of a desk in an office at KPMG Peat Marwick. Mr Acher is quietly-spoken, soberly dressed with a plain shirt and a conservative tie. Mr Barrett has a mellifluous voice and youthful looks to match his wide, pin-striped suit, loud, green braces and pink shirt. Yet both men work in the same firm - the former a lifetime accountant with what he calls 'The House of Peat' and now one of its senior partners and head of KPMG Corporate Finance; the latter a newly-recruited partner into the division from Lloyds Merchant Bank. They epitomise the increasingly blurred description of what constitutes an accountancy firm. They serve particularly to illustrate the new, aggressive breed in the larger firms encroaching into the terrain of the banks in both strategy and culture. Take, for corroboration's sake, Howard Hyman and Anthony Browne, sitting in an office less than a mile downstream at Price Waterhouse. Both trained as auditors, but the former in particular has taken on much of the charismatic manner more usually associated with bankers than accountants. Mr Hyman, head of corporate finance for Europe for the firm, is keen to show off his trophies. As he talks, he bounces up from his chair and reaches for an armful of paperweight 'tombstones' encased in acrylic plastic, mini reproductions of the documents on deals in which Price Waterhouse has been involved. It is an appropriate gesture in a market dominated by show and aggressive marketing. Warming to his theme, Mr Hyman finishes filling the table in front of him with the tombstones and reaches for a trade magazine survey showing PW top among accountants for cross-border mergers and acquisition work in Europe. 'We are genuinely a four-business firm,' says Mr Hyman, arguing that corporate finance - including insolvency - is a strong contributor alongside the traditional areas of accounting and audit, tax and consulting. He says that in the year to June, his division contributed one quarter of the UK's profits, and more than 15 per cent of those across Europe. KPMG, needless to say, points to a different set of statistics than PW's, which shows to the contrary that it has dominance of the key elements in the corporate finance sector. Of course, the same trick reverberates around the other Big Six firms - and many of their smaller counterparts. Each highlights its pre-eminence by some measure, while the partners concerned hint darkly and discreetly about the viability of their competitors. Is a pan-European structure a needless additional cost? Does investigations work logically sit within corporate finance? Mr Hyman goes so far as to say that he does not want to reveal too much about his own strategy, since he is sure that - as so often in the past - it will quickly be taken up by his rivals. There is no doubt that accountants have made significant inroads into corporate finance in the past few years. They have gone well beyond the traditional role of due diligence work or accounting investigation, into the realms of brokering marriages between companies and finding financial support. That is a trend which has not been altogether favourably received by the merchant banks. They may have been nonchalant during the late 1980s, when there was enough business for everyone; but in the recession of the early 1990s, at a time of far more talk than action, they are becoming more resentful. But the accountants believe there is room for both sectors. Mr Acher says his target markets are privatisations, deals worth below Pounds 20m, and the documentary aspects of larger takeovers. 'I'm pretty relaxed about it and the merchant banks are pretty relaxed about it,' he says. 'We are not a threat to them.' Mr Hyman adds that accountants have proved their worth to banks, especially when it comes to providing large numbers of staff who can work on a single deal - quantities which could not be easily provided by a bank. New Stock Exchange regulations allow the accountants to act as sponsors on new issues for the first time this year - although Mr Acher believes this is probably a less profitable and enticing area for KPMG. In more indirect ways, the merchant banks have struck back. Not all those who have left to join accountancy firms have stayed. Mr Barrett believes he will, because he has entered at the right level - a junior partner, young enough to adapt to the partnership culture. But there is also an element of concern in the expanding accountants' role within the profession. Mr Andy Pollock of Rees Pollock, a London firm created by former Ernst &amp; Young people, says: 'Accountants should be accountants. They should keep to investigations work and leave much of the other work to the merchant banks and corporate finance boutiques.' He argues there is a fundamental conflict of interest - which is particularly strong in the Big Six firms - acting for both or, in the extreme, several different sides in corporate finance work; an auditor finding a financier, advising management, and conducting due diligence for both sides - and partly paid through success fees. 'You have to ask why so many deals have fallen through so quickly,' he says. 'Nobody is taking a good, independent look at the figures.' He cites a recent case in which a bank has commissioned his firm, which found problems overlooked by the auditor. The problems hardly something that auditor would have been happy mentioning to the bank if it had been commissioned to do the work instead. But this argument leaves Mr Acher unmoved. 'Very often there is a degree of comfort in using the same firm,' he says. 'But if any party believes there is a conflict, I would be happy to drop away. Goodwill is so important and we are of such a size that it doesn't cause us a conflict to do so.'</p>

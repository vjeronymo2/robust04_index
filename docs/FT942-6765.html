			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protecting the future Sir, In the interests of accuracy, I point out that Lawnside School in Malvern is not closing 'at the end of this year because its governors believe it is no longer commercially viable', as stated in your article, 'Sums don't add up: dog days in Britain's independent schools' (May 13). It is merging in September with a neighbouring school because its governors have the wisdom to see that current trends might otherwise result in the school becoming commercially unviable. By this means they have protected the educational future of all current students and ensured continuity for them. Janet A Harvey, headteacher, Lawnside School, Great Malvern, Worcestershire, WR14 3AJ</p>

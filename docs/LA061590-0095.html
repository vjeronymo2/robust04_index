			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> $2.5-MILLION WATER TREATMENT PLANT OKD  </P> <P> Los Angeles water officials approved a construction contract Thursday for a  $2.5-million treatment plant in North Hollywood that will purge ground water of  toxic solvents.  </P> <P> The Board of Water and Power Commissioners, which oversees the Department of  Water and Power, chose R.L. Hartley of Burbank to install the experimental  system, which will extract and treat about 2,000 gallons per minute of ground  water tainted by trichloroethylene, or TCE, a solvent linked to cancer in  animal studies.  </P> <P> The system, which will be installed adjacent to existing city water supply  wells under electrical transmission lines near Vanowen and Camelia streets,  will use a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ozone to break down  contaminants into harmless byproducts -- carbon dioxide, water and chloride  ions.  </P> <P> The system, scheduled to begin operating in January, will be the second pilot  treatment system built by the DWP. The other is an aeration treatment plant on  Vose Street in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Well fields in North Hollywood, Burbank and Glendale have been designated  federal Superfund sites because of chemical pollution of ground water.  Eventually, big cleanup systems will be installed. In the meantime, utilities  have kept water supplies within health standards by shutting down the most  tainted wells and blending water from less tainted wells with fresh supplies.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Barred Lloyd's syndicates hope to reopen soon MANAGERS OF two synd-icates at the Lloyd's insurance market which were ordered to stop trading this week are hopeful that they will be back in business soon. Syndicate 65, which has a capacity, or capital base, of Pounds 38m, and the smaller 640, with a capital base of Pounds 4m, were ordered on Thursday not to place or accept new business. Syndicate 65 is one of the biggest marine syndicates at Lloyd's, but has lost support from members' agents - who funnel Names on to syndicates - over the past two years. The Lloyd's decision was made as a result of the financial difficulties of the Chester agency, which manages both syndicates. The agency manages both syndicates. Since October Chester has been supported by another agency, Hayter Brockbank, which will now lead efforts to find new agents for the syndicates. Hayter agreed an option to buy the Chester agency, but has indicated that it now believes the syndicates would benefit from completely new management. Mr George Stevens, managing director, says that although neither syndicate has particular problems they would not fit easily alongside Hayter's other syndicates. Among other considerations, added Mr Stevens, Chester syndicates have different information systems. Chester has also experienced difficulties in buying errors-and-omissions insurance - which covers the agency managers against losses arising from unintentional errors or omissions by their employees. Premium rates for such cover - also provided by Lloyd's syndicates - have risen in the wake of a large payout by underwriters after the settlement in the Outhwaite case last month. Pulbrook Underwriting Management, a subsidiary of the Merrett Group, announced that it is to merge syndicates 731 and 1038. The successor syndicate 1038 will have a capacity of about Pounds 25m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under general heading: "The Aim Is To </F> Stabilize Living Standard"]    [Text] Believing that in 1994 the problem of the  population's employment will become the dominant one in  socioeconomic policy, the Russian Federation Government intends  to take active steps to curb unemployment, to create conditions  for the expansion of employment in the nonstate sectors of the  economy, and to ensure the protection of citizens forced into  redundancy. That was the opinion reached yesterday by the  participants in a session of the Russian Federation Government  Presidium which approved as a whole the draft federal program  for assisting the employment of the Russian federation  population for 1994.    Presenting the draft program, Fedor Prokopov, leader of the  Federal Employment Service, noted that its operation will extend  mainly to able bodied citizens who have work but are at risk of  losing it and to unemployed registered at the state employment  service organs.    Providing information on the employment situation in 1994,  Fedor Prokopov stated that one of the most characteristic  features of the labor market will be the large army of partly  unemployed people who have for a long time been under threat of  dismissal. In February this year alone 4,300 enterprises had  long production stoppages and 428 enterprises stopped  completely. These enterprises have expanded the practice of  leave at the administration's initiative. Thus the threat of  concealed unemployment developing into open unemployment is  intensified. Over the course of 1994 possible "partial"  unemployment is assessed at 5-8 million people.    Fedor Prokopov also predicts that there will be an enhanced  risk of citizens losing work -- the total number of layoffs of  workers in 1994 will be 2.4-3.8 million. There will also be an  increase in the supply of manpower on the labor market: The  number of citizens who did not have work before or who lost it  and are seeking work will be in excess of 12 million. As a  result of the discrepancy between the supply and demand for  manpower, the unsatisfied demand for jobs could be in excess of  6.1 million people, or 8.7 percent of the economically active  population. It is expected that the numerical strength of the  unemployed officially registered at the unemployment service  will reach 3 million by the end of 1994.    In the sphere of economic support for employment the  government intends to curb the reduction of economically  expedient and promising jobs and to promote the growth of  investment activity, which creates new jobs, through the  implementation of institutional transformations, selective  structural policy, and the implementation of investment and  other targeted programs.    Funds for the implementation of the federal program will be  earmarked from the state employment fund and will total 4  trillion rubles. After the draft's discussion at Viktor  Chernomyrdin's suggestion it was decided to send the document  for further work.</p>

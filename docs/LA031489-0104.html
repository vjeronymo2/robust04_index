			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRISH LAUNCH TEST OF NEW FUTURES EXCHANGE  </P> <P> The Irish Futures and Options Exchange, Dublin's first new financial market in  almost 200 years, will begin a dummy run Wednesday to prepare for going live in  mid-April, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The exchange, or IFOX, has decided to reject the "open outcry" systems favored  in London and Chicago and will instead use an automated trading system for its  23 members.  </P> <P> All the exchange's seats, priced at $90,000 (60,000 punts) each, have been  sold, mainly to leading Irish institutions such as Allied Irish Banks and the  Bank of Ireland.  </P> <P> Trading will begin in three futures contracts -- 20-year Irish government  bonds, an interest rate future based on the three-month Dublin interbank-rate  and a future based on the Irish punt/dollar rate. IFOX will be Ireland's first  new exchange since the Dublin Stock Market was founded in 1799.  </P></p>

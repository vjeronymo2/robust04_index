			<p>BFN     [Text] "The war of nerves between Kiev and Simferopol was  doomed to aggravate," a member of Russia's Presidential Council,  Emil Payn, told Interfax in comments on developments in and  around the Crimea.    According to him, on the one hand, a negative impact on the  development of events was made by the tough stand taken by the  Kiev authorities toward the Crimea as a means of consolidating  the polarized Ukrainian society on the eve of presidential  elections. On the other, the Crimean leadership showed no  particular inclination for compromises, being disposed to take  decisions made by Kiev too nervously, said Payn.    According to him, energetic measures designed to cool the  situation should be taken by the Russian authorities urgently.  Such steps should be addressed to both Simferopol and Kiev.  "They must be not threats, but purely diplomatic measures --  statements and actions aimed at preventing the conflict from  further aggravating," Payn said.    He drew attention to the one-sided coverage of the  developments in and around the Crimea by some Russian news  media, in particular television, whose solidarity with the  Crimean authorities might stimulate Simferopol's tough stand  toward Kiev.</p>

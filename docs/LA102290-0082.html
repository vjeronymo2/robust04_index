			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE FIND LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT TO S.E. ASIANS;  </P> <P> CULTURAL RIFT: OFFICERS IN ORANGE COUNTY'S LITTLE SAIGON MUST LEARN NEW SYSTEM  OF VALUES TO BE EFFECTIVE.  </P> <P> On the streets of Orange County's Little Saigon, it's the little things that  can close the rift between an American police officer trying to get to the  bottom of a crime and a Vietnamese-American caught between two cultures.  </P> <P> It is disrespectful to touch a Vietnamese man on the head, summon him with an  index finger or show him the bottom of one's shoe while sitting. So is shaking  hands with a Vietnamese woman unless she is Americanized. If she is not, a  simple bow will do.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of little things to be aware of with newcomers," said Santa  Ana Police Officer Di Au, a Vietnam War refugee. "In Vietnam, for example, it's  customary when stopped by police to get out of your car and walk to the  officer. Here, you don't do that. It can cause tensions if police don't know  what to expect."  </P> <P> Today, peace officers assigned to Southeast Asian communities in Orange County  and other parts of the nation receive cultural training to overcome a  traditional mistrust of law enforcement that impedes efforts to protect  Southeast Asian communities.  </P> <P> "As police officers, you have to learn to work in Asian communities in a  different way," said San Francisco Police Sgt. Tom Perdue, of the city's Asian  gang detail. "You subtly approach people and learn to function from their  perspective. Our concepts of right and wrong are the same, but we are 180  degrees apart in the way we act."  </P> <P> Influenced by Buddhism, Taoism and Confucian thought, say Southeast Asian  historians, Southeast Asians dislike confrontation, and often try to take an  indirect approach to problems on their own. If a crime befalls them, they tend  to blame themselves for letting it happen.  </P> <P> Southeast Asians also are less likely than other Americans to talk about their  feelings in public or with someone they do not know, such as a police officer  who tries to question them about an incident.  </P> <P> "Saving face," the act of avoiding shameful or embarrassing situations, comes  into play strongly when a crime has occurred. Police say Southeast Asians are  especially reluctant to report or talk about drug use, gang involvement, child  abuse, rape and other sexual assaults because of the risk of embarrassment to  their families.  </P> <P> "They don't volunteer things. They only answer your questions, so you have to  dig a lot more to get any information," said Thien N. Cao, a Vietnamese refugee  who is now a police liaison officer in Garden Grove's Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> Further distancing police from the Southeast Asian community are customs that  are not accepted or legal in the United States, a situation that can lead to  misunderstandings with law enforcement.  </P> <P> For example, "nickeling," a Vietnamese home remedy in which a coin is rubbed  hard on the side of a sick child's neck, could be misinterpreted as child abuse  by educators or social workers because it often leaves bruises.  </P> <P> Corporal punishment by parents is accepted as well, and many Southeast Asians  believe domestic violence should be solved within the family and without the  help of police or social service agencies.  </P> <P> The hesitancy to get involved, specifically for the Vietnamese and Cambodians,  is exacerbated by their experience with law enforcement in their home  countries.  </P> <P> Officers were often low paid, uneducated and corrupt. They often employed  methods such as coerced confessions, beatings and immediate jailings. After the  fall of Saigon in 1975, police were used by the communists to enforce the  regime and to jail political dissidents.  </P> <P> "You need to sit back and ask, 'Where do these people come from?' You will see  they were brought up in an era of violence and not knowing who to trust, not  even the police," Perdue said.  </P> <P> Police and sheriff's departments have tried to close the culture gap with a  variety of training techniques ranging from 45-minute videotapes to  full-fledged classes at police academies.  </P> <P> In addition, the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a social service  agency that provides counseling and crime-prevention information, offers  quarterly seminars to police, probation officers and schoolteachers to teach  them how to cope with cultural differences.  </P> <P> "Law enforcement officials are becoming more effective in communications," said  Nhu-hao Duong, a refugee coordinator for the Orange County Social Services  Agency. "They are now careful about body language, their voices and hand  gestures."  </P> <P> Duong said officers often misinterpret innocuous behavior, such as lack of eye  contact, as indications of deceit. Vietnamese, she said, look at the ground to  show respect and put their hands on their belts, one hand covering the other.  </P> <P> "Police feel this can be shifty. They ask more questions and things can get  worse," Duong said.  </P> <P> Similarly, Officer Au said he has seen police get upset with Vietnamese who  were smiling when detained. The smile also can be a sign of respect. " 'What,  do you think it's funny?' " Au quoted officers as saying.  </P> <P> At the Orange County Sheriff's Academy, Westminster Detective Marcus Frank, who  specializes in Southeast Asian crime, teaches an eight-hour course. Videotapes  also have been produced by the Anaheim Police Department and the Orange County  Human Relations Commission.  </P> <P> Officers learn that they should, when practical, get permission from the head  of the household before talking to anyone else in the family. Out of respect,  men should be addressed as ong and women as ba.  </P> <P> "If you don't see there is a cultural difference, you won't get anywhere," said  Garden Grove Sgt. Frank Hauptmann, who is assigned to the Asian detail. "Just  the way you summon people can get you in trouble. Don't use your finger. That  is how a dog is summoned in Vietnam."  </P> <P> Westminster Officer Robert Trotter, who is assigned to the Little Saigon  substation, said Vietnamese are more sensitive than others to being embarrassed  in front of their friends. So he tries to separate everyone at a crime scene  and question witnesses privately as much as possible.  </P> <P> Police officers in other communities have learned similar lessons over the  years.  </P> <P> Officer Al Lotz, a Vietnam War veteran who specializes in Southeast Asian crime  in Houston and teaches the culture to his fellow officers, said working in  Houston's Southeast Asian community demands patience and empathy.  </P> <P> "I have developed compassion for them," Lotz said. "They are being ripped off  by their own people, and they went through hell to get to this country, and all  they want to do is live in freedom. In my class, I try to explain how lost they  are and what it is like living between two cultures."  </P> <P> Because Southeast Asians like to know whom they are dealing with, police soon  find out that they have to spend a great deal of time getting to know victims  and witnesses on a personal level before they will cooperate. On a social  level, they must attend merchant association meetings and cultural events.  </P> <P> Many times, officers say, they have to serve subpoenas in person and then drive  the witnesses to court to assure that they show up. Police also have to  re-interview witnesses and victims repeatedly before they begin to get usable  information.  </P> <P> On their rounds, officers try to explain that being a crime victim, even of  rape or sexual abuse, is not something to be so ashamed of that nothing should  done about it.  </P> <P> A few departments have created permanent community liaisons, usually a  Vietnamese, who stays in constant contact with the city's Southeast Asian  merchants and civic leaders.  </P> <P> "If they don't know you, they won't talk to you," Garden Grove Police Chief  John Robertson said. "We try to make regular rounds, but it takes years and  years to develop relationships. You have got to be in it for the long run."  </P> <P> Cao, who fled Vietnam in 1975, has been the Garden Grove Police Department's  emissary of good will since 1981. Every week he goes door to door, covering  miles of pavement at scores of strip malls that are home to the county's  Vietnamese retailers.  </P> <P> His weapons are crime-prevention pamphlets in English and Vietnamese. It is a  treadmill of hair salons, groceries, bakeries, restaurants, jewelers,  clothiers, billiard parlors and drug stores.  </P> <P> "This is like a sales job, only I am selling security," Cao said. "At the  beginning, it was really humiliating. They didn't even want us in the store.  They'd look away or ignore us or ease us out the door."  </P> <P> Cao said he did not wear his white and blue uniform for a while to make  merchants more comfortable when he dropped by to see them. Today, he leaves his  uniform on, testimony to some of the department's progress.  </P> <P> More Southeast Asians are reporting crime, but there are still difficulties  getting them to testify in court and cooperate with investigators.  </P> <P> Robertson said he repeatedly gets critical mail from citizens complaining that  the Southeast Asian community is getting special attention. He recently  received a batch of letters after his department sent out a bilingual  crime-prevention brochure in the city water bills.  </P> <P> "I call this bigotry," Robertson said. "If people could only understand that  everything is reversed for them -- culture, food, speech, clothes. They don't  know what to expect. They are fearful and wonder why it is held against them  for being here."  </P></p>

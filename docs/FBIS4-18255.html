			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turkish side is trying to create tensions in  Cyprus following the final deadlock in the proximity talks due  to the intransigent stance maintained by Rauf Denktas. The  fabrication of false reports about the existence of camps for  the training of Kurdish guerrillas in Troodos is part of this  attempt. According to CyBC's [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  reliable information, the Attila [Turkish troops in Cyprus] and  pseudostate forces have been placed on a state of alert in order  to make an impression.    A competent government source told CyBC this evening that  the  Turkish claims about the existence of camps for the training of  Kurds in the free areas of Cyprus are absolutely unfounded. The  source also stressed that these are fabrications that aim at  serving Turkish propaganda and diverting public attention from  the Turkish side's responsibility for the deadlock in the  proximity talks. The same source recalled that in the past  Turkish propaganda also tried to present Cyprus as a center for  the training of Armenian commandos. If the Turks have any  evidence, the source stressed, let them submit such evidence to  the United Nations for investigation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Due to several  violent incidents on the Haitian border, today, Dominican  Republic authorities suspended the crossing of Haitians into the  Dominican Republic to seek food and medicine.    Army sources told the international press that the crossing  of Haitians to purchase food and medicine was suspended on  Friday after small groups were allowed to cross early in the day.    The crossing of people carrying food and medicine into Haiti  continues to be restricted on the border after a Dominican  soldier, posted in Dajabon in northern Dominican Republic, had  his rifles snatched away from him on Thursday, provincial  governor Abilio Escoto explained.    Local authorities said that in similar incidents, Haitians  hurled stones at soldiers who patrol the common border. None of  the attacks have been repelled up to now.    The UN Security Council augmented the economic embargo  against Haiti on 21 May to force the coupist military officers  who overthrew Jean Bertrand Aristide in 1991 to abandon power.    The Dominican Republic shares with Haiti the Caribbean  island  of Hispaniola and the common border is patrolled by  approximately 15,000 Dominican soldiers under the observation of  a U.S. mission that analyzes local Army needs to comply with the  UN mandate. President Joaquin Balaguer was against sanctions on  Haiti, but he promised to comply with them.    On Thursday, the president announced that according to a  list  sent by the United Nations, the sale of food and medicine to  Haitians is to be allowed.</p>

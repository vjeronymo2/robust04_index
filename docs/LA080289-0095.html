			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD LAUNCHES NEW PROGRAM OF INCENTIVES  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co., acknowledging that U.S. vehicle sales would "hit the skids"  without buyer lures, announced Tuesday yet another incentive program designed  to clear its remaining inventories of 1989 models.  </P> <P> The program, which replaces one that expired July 31, raises the cash rebates  on several car and truck lines, with $1,000 or more offered on 21 models and  between $300 to $750 back on 13 others.  </P> <P> The rebates are paid directly from Ford to car buyers, with no dealer  participation required, the No. 2 car maker said.  </P> <P> "Incentives are a way of life. . . . Everybody's in the game," said Thomas  Wagner, general manager of the Ford division. "Nobody can figure out how to get  away from them without the market hitting the skids for a long time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Estimates Lowered  </P> <P> Ford follows industry leader General Motors Corp. and third-ranked Chrysler  Corp. in sweetening buyer promotions that were last changed in the spring.  </P> <P> But despite the better deals -- which have cut heavily into auto makers'  profits -- U.S. car and truck sales have been declining this year, forcing  industry executives to lower earlier estimates from more than 15 million units  to about 14.7 million vehicles.  </P> <P> "We kind of bet on the market earlier this year, but it has not jumped as we  thought it would," Wagner said.  </P> <P> Last year, 15.8 million cars and trucks, including imports, were sold in the  United States.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ford announced that its Atlanta assembly plant will be idled from  Aug. 7 through Aug. 16 because of slow dealer orders.  </P></p>

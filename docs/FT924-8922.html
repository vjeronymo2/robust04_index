			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Mitterrand TV talk on Aids row FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand will tonight try to take the initiative from the government's critics by staging a television interview on the recent scandal over the distribution of Aids-tainted blood to haemophiliacs. This will be his first set-piece television appearance since a marathon three-hour debate two months ago, shortly before the Maastricht referendum, and his first since undergoing surgery for cancer of the prostate. It will therefore give valuable clues to the mental and physical fitness of the 76-year-old president, said by government ministers to be on combative form. Since he won a narrow victory in the referendum, Mr Mitterrand's popularity ratings have improved. However, his government is dogged by minor internal splits, continuing high unemployment and a sluggish economy and faces defeat in next March's legislative elections. Mr Mitterrand wants to use today's interview to hit back at criticisms of Socialist ministers over the Aids scandal, relating to a period in 1985 when the national blood transfusion service allowed infected blood to be given to more than 1,200 haemophiliacs. The president is also likely to face questions on other big issues of the day, such as the looming trade war with the US and the British decision to delay ratifying the Maastricht treaty until after Danish ratification. Mr Mitterrand is also likely to be questioned on possible constitutional reforms, including giving more influence to France's relatively powerless parliament and shortening the president's renewable seven-year mandate. He announced plans for such reforms on television a year ago, since when the issue has been pushed aside by the debate on European monetary and political union.</p>

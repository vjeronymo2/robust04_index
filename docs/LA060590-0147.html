			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIRING PLANS TO SLOW A BIT, SURVEY SHOWS  </P> <P> Orange County employers are gearing up for a productive but not spectacular  summer season and are adjusting their hiring goals accordingly, according to a  new survey by Manpower Inc.  </P> <P> An estimated 22% of the county's employers expect to add to their payrolls  during the summer months, with 7% anticipating layoffs or payroll reductions  through attrition, the employment firm found.  </P> <P> A year ago, 25% said they intended to add staff while 8% predicted cutbacks.  </P> <P> Manpower, which specializes in placing temporary hourly workers, surveys about  1,500 employers nationally each quarter to gauge national and regional hiring  outlooks. The most recent survey covers hiring for July, August and September.  </P> <P> The survey also deals with hourly employment, generally in clerical, office,  and assembly or manufacturing positions.  </P> <P> Sue Foigelman, area manager for Manpower's Irvine-based Orange County  operations, said Monday that the results of the local portion of the survey  show a slight slowing of job growth as county employers echo the national trend  of cautious concern about the economy.  </P> <P> Still, she said, the survey results don't point to a downturn. The number of  firms hiring or maintaining the status quo far outweighs the number expecting  to cut back.  </P> <P> Manpower does not break down local hiring trends by job category, as it does  nationally, but Foigelman said the local results show that manufacturing,  education, services and public administration are areas with the strongest  potential for job hunters.  </P> <P> She said job opportunities in construction are expected to slow a bit, largely  because builders have slowed new development activity in the wake of a sales  slowdown.  </P> <P> Foigelman said that while the requests for temporary workers that her office  handles don't always mirror the demand for permanent employees, she has noticed  a sharp increase in recent months in demand for clerical workers with computer  skills, especially those familiar with major word-processing software programs.  </P> <P> "There is also a great demand for (temporary) receptionists," she said.  </P> <P> That, she said, means there is a marked shortage of receptionists and  word-processing specialists in the permanent job market.  </P> <P> "I have also noticed that in the past six months, there is almost no demand for  anyone without some level of computer knowledge," Foigelman added. "Almost  every job request we get requires some computer knowledge, even in  manufacturing, warehousing and assembly-type jobs." O.C. JOB MARKET  </P> <P> Here are the results of a survey of Orange County executives regarding their  hiring plans for the upcoming quarter.  </P> <P> 3rd quarter 1989: Hire more workers: 25%. Reduce Staffing: 8%.  </P> <P> 3rd quarter 1990: Hire more workers: 22%. Reduce Staffing: 7%.  </P></p>

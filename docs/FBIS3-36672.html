Dmitry Ryurikov, the president's international affairs aide,  in an interview with Interfax reaffirmed that Yeltsin would  shortly discuss the Bosnian crisis with U.S. President Bill  Clinton and other world leaders.    "We still believe there are chances to settle it by  non-violent means," Ryurikov said, citing the Russian Foreign  Ministry's recent proposals for the demilitarization of  Sarajevo. "It's along those lines that discussions should  proceed," he said.    He expressed the hope that the incident in the Bosnian  capital would bring it home to all parties to the conflict that  "they should end their confrontation, which will be of no  benefit to anybody, neither to the Serbs nor to the Croats nor  to the Muslims, and which may provoke a negative reaction on the  part of the world community."    Ryurikov was skeptical about the idea of making one of the  parties a potential target for an air strike.</p>

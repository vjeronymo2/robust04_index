			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu plans FM527m rights issue OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced plans to raise FM527m (Dollars 96m) through a one-for-five rights issue at FM33 a share. The proceeds will be used to strengthen the company's balance sheet and help fund a FM1.8bn scheme to expand copper and nickel production at the group's Harjavalta plant over the next three years. The Finnish state, which is the group's main shareholder with a 57.5 per cent direct stake, has already agreed to support the issue. Skopbank, the third largest Finnish commercial bank, cut its losses sharply in the first four months, but warned of worse figures later in the year. It said it would need further state support. The bank's operating loss for the January-April period fell to FM501m from FM1.38bn, as credit losses halved to FM526m from FM1.01bn. However, the bank predicted that operating losses for the full year would amount to FM2.1bn as credit losses reached FM1.8bn. It said it would need a further FM700-800m from the state this year, in addition to a FM700m injection announced last week, to help it keep its capital adequacy ratio above 8 per cent. At the end of April, the bank's capital adequacy stood at 8.6 per cent, compared to 8.2 per cent at the end of 1992, when it made a FM3.46bn operating loss.</p>

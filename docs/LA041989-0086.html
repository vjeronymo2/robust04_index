			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORDER HALTS NEW RECORD BY OSMOND  </P> <P> A Los Angeles federal judge Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order  against a record company belonging to former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, stopping it  from releasing a "comeback" single recorded by singer Donny Osmond.  </P> <P> Curb Records had said that it had exclusive rights to distribute Osmond's  single and album, while Capitol Records asserted that it had the sole  distribution rights.  </P> <P> Both firms asked U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi to issue a temporary  restraining order. Curb wanted to stop Capitol from releasing the Osmond album;  Capitol asked that Curb be ordered not to release the hit single from the  album.  </P> <P> Takasugi ruled in favor of Capitol, which said it had spent more than $1  million to publicize and promote Osmond's album, his first in 10 years.  </P></p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bank not left homeless if it never had a home Sir, I do not think that your headline, 'Forerunner of European central bank is left homeless' (December 29) is true. It would have been left homeless if it had a home and then left it, for whatever reason, with nowhere to go. I suspect there is a little wry amusement at the bank's initial difficulties in that headline. But we have lost this one for good and it would be best to learn to live with it.

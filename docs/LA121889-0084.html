			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SECOND BOMB MAILED TO 11TH CIRCUIT COURT  </P> <P> Bomb squads found explosives in a package addressed to "someone in the court  system" at the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals headquarters today, two days  after a letter bomb killed an 11th Circuit judge in Alabama.  </P> <P> Shaken employees were evacuated from the five-story court building in downtown  Atlanta shortly before 10 a.m. The bomb, in a small brown package, was  discovered during a random sampling of the mail.  </P> <P> An officer in head-to-toe protective gear removed the package -- about 10  inches by 10 inches and four inches deep -- and placed it in a bomb-proof  canister. It was taken "to a safe location," police Maj. W. W. Holley said.  </P> <P> The Atlanta incident occurred just two days after 11th Circuit Judge Robert  Vance was killed by a letter bomb in his Alabama home. Vance's wife remains  hospitalized with injuries suffered in the blast.  </P> <P> "While screening the mail in the federal courthouse in Atlanta, a second device  containing a similar explosive device was found," FBI Agent Allen Whittaker  said. "That matter is being approached with a great deal of caution."  </P> <P> Whittaker said the package was addressed to "someone in the court system" but  would not elaborate.  </P> <P> Police and military bomb experts continued to search the court building, a  national historic site.  </P> <P> Military explosives experts from nearby Ft. Gillem arrived on the scene and  carried bomb disposal equipment into the structure.  </P> <P> The package had an address label on the front and had come by mail, not hand  delivery, Holley said. He refused to say to whom the package was addressed.  </P> <P> Officers examined X-ray pictures before removing the package through the  court's front door under a large flag flying at half-staff in memory of Vance.  </P> <P> Officials have speculated that Vance's murder may have had something to do with  his reviews of drug cases in Florida, including a connection to Colombian drug  lords. One official played down the Colombian drug angle, saying, "We have no  motive and no suspects."  </P></p>

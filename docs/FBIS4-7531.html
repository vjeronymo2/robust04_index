			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslav Basta, former deputy chief of </F> intelligence and current chairman of the Independent Screening  Commission, by Evzen Stanek; place and date not given: "KGB  Launched Its Offensive"]    [Text] "Certain recent events indicate a very  considerable offensive on the part of the Russian security  forces. I consider also the affair with resident-agent Ames  recently discovered in the ranks of the CIA to be evidence of  this. I believe that his arrest was prompted by the Russians  themselves." This was stated in an interview by Jaroslav Basta,  former deputy chief of intelligence and current chairman of the  Independent Screening Commission, who engages in the study of  the development of secret services. "It is something similar to  the Kozeny-Wallis affair, when Mr. Kozeny informed on Wallis in  such a way that the case could no longer be processed by  intelligence means but only by penal ones."    [Stanek] What does it have to do with the Czech Republic?    [Basta] According to the postwar statistics, the KGB had its  "moles" in every security service. Under the circumstances  existing in the Czech Republic since November 1989, it is  completely impossible for someone like Ames not to sit in the  Czech secret services. If the Czech secret service has not  discovered any agent so far, it means either that we are an  exception or that we are incapable of finding him.    [Stanek] What makes our small country so interesting for the  KGB now?    [Basta] Intelligence services are working in anticipation.  Their main task is to detect future dangers and possibilities.  It is advantageous for Russia to be here if it has imperial  aspirations, which has been demonstrated more than once.    Moreover, it is possible to have cover firms in the Czech  Republic, or firms making money for espionage. In this context,  I remember how Ames drew attention to himself--his expenses were  higher than his income. It is customary in the United States to  examine the financial situation of all government employees, and  not just of the secret service staff. The common practice in  the Czech Republic, on the other hand, is that only disagreeable  people are checked. Hence, no one cares whether a prominent  person purchased a Jaguar like Mr. Ames, or how much the house  in which he lives cost.    [Stanek] Why would the Russians eliminate their own  resident-agent?    [Basta] The KGB needs to improve its reputation. It is a  part of the revival of the empire. I cannot but recall the  words uttered by Zhirinovskiy as he burst in at the conference  on the KGB in Moscow last May and attacked its participants for  aggression against the KGB, which, in his opinion, belongs to  the best tradition of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union.    By the "Ames action," the KGB immediately improved its  reputation at home, because it demonstrated--look, the supreme  boss of the U.S. counterintelligence against Russian  intelligence was in fact our man; that is the kind of person we  can recruit. Shortly thereafter, the Russians also came up with  the exposure of the British spy.    [Stanek] Was it worth it to them?    [Basta] The Americans had suspected Ames for three years,  which would present the possibility of Ames being recruited back  to the U.S. side, or the Russians could have thought that this  was in the works. As far as Ames's arrest goes, there was no  need for FBI agents to go through the waste baskets. They could  have foisted well-prepared disinformation upon him, for  instance, and waited until it appeared on the Russian side. That  would suffice for his condemnation. In the end, it was not the  FBI but, rather, the Russians who won this discreet game.    [Stanek] Immediately after Ames was exposed, KGB head  Golushko resigned, allegedly for health reasons. How do you  feel about this?    [Basta] Although Russian intelligence officially disclosed  that Golushko's resignation had nothing to do with the Ames  affair, Nikolay Golushko is, after Vadim Bakatin, the second KGB  head who came to the organization from without and had to leave.  The similarity between their fates is also in their start  following a failed coup. It seems that the immunity ability of  the KGB and its successor organizations remains completely  unhurt. If such a person as Golushko leaves, it does not mean  anything good for our future. Every such event brings up the  question of whether something like that is also possible here.</p>

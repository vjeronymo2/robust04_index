			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA CAMPUS OF CSUN HALTS SPRING ENROLLMENT IN 7 PROGRAMS  </P> <P> For the first time in its 15-year history, the University Center, now the  Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge, closed enrollment Nov. 1 in seven of  its degree programs for next year's spring semester.  </P> <P> Students seeking classes in Chicano studies, liberal studies, English, history,  teaching credential programs and an administrative services credential are  being told to apply for entry to the fall, 1990, semester. At that time, the  center's enrollment cap will be expanded and more classrooms will be available.  </P> <P> "The need is here and we have people that are just not being served," said  campus director Joyce Kennedy. "We have hundreds of people on our waiting  lists."  </P> <P> The campus serves about 1,000 mostly part-time students. That translates to the  equivalent of 349 full-time students, or 24 more than the 325 enrollment cap.  </P> <P> For the fall semester of 1990, the top enrollment will be 450. In addition to  bachelor's degrees in areas ranging from public health to public  administration, campus officials are deciding whether to add a journalism  degree, Kennedy said.  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Frustrated electorate Sir, Far from leading to the government's defeat in the next election ('Brittan and Howe hit back on EU', October 14), I suspect that in the next two years Conservative strategists will come to realise that an anti-federal stance will represent their only chance of winning the next election. As one who spent a considerable amount of time canvassing in the Euro election, I can advise Lord Howe and Sir Leon Brittan that present policy over Europe is deeply unpopular with the majority of the electorate, who are frustrated at having no democratic way of expressing their resentment at the steady encroachment of their national identity and institutions. They also resent being described as 'right wing' for opinions which are held across the whole political spectrum. A D Gatling, White Lodge, Berwick St James, Salisbury, Wilts SP3 4TZ</p>

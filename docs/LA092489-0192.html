			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUBWAY-BUS LINK EMERGES AS FAVORED RAIL PROPOSAL;  </P> <P> INITIAL FUNDING UNDER ROBBINS-BRAUDE PLAN MAY ONLY PAY TO BUILD ROUTE TO  SEPULVEDA BASIN  </P> <P> After three years of fighting over what kind of San Fernando Valley rail line  to build and where to build it, one plan appears to have emerged from the smoke  and debris -- extending the Metro Rail subway partly underground from North  Hollywood to Encino, then busing passengers to Warner Center.  </P> <P> The Metro Rail-express bus plan, which requires both homeowner and business  leaders to give up some of their demands, for the moment appears to have  squeezed out all other schemes touted in recent years, including several  different configurations of ground-level or elevated light rail.  </P> <P> Even if, as is considered likely, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoes a bill aimed at  forcing construction of the seven-mile Metro Rail extension, the proposal has  been endorsed by so many elected officials, homeowner leaders and business  groups that it seems likely to prevail, local officials say.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a late convert to the plan, said  last week that support was "virtually wall to wall."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consolidated Support  </P> <P> "It looks like the Valley has finally gotten behind a single plan, as we have  been asking them to do," said Richard Stanger, rail development director for  the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a  countywide network of rail lines.  </P> <P> And Commissioner Jacki Bacharach, who heads the commission's Rail Construction  Committee, added: "If the Valley is finally speaking with one voice, as appears  to be the case, then we will probably do what the Valley asks or not build  anything there for now."  </P> <P> On the other hand, both Stanger and Bacharach said the Metro Rail extension may  prove too costly to build, no matter how much support it enjoys.  </P> <P> Since proposed four months ago by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los  Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, the plan to extend the downtown-to-North  Hollywood Metro Rail across the eastern Valley has steadily muscled aside all  rival proposals, several of which had strong support.  </P> <P> These include a controversial plan to build a 15-mile rail system from North  Hollywood to Warner Center along a Southern Pacific railroad right of way that  follows Chandler and Victory boulevards, and Oxnard and Topham streets from  Metro Rail's northern terminus at Chandler and Lankershim boulevards to Warner  Center.  </P> <P> That plan had strong backing from business leaders because it would bring rail  all the way to fast-growing Warner Center and apparently can be built with the  uncommitted funds that the commission expects to have during the 1990s.  </P> <P> Another rival proposal is construction of an elevated line on the Ventura  Freeway's south shoulder from Universal City to Warner Center.  </P> <P> The commission is studying both routes, either as Metro Rail extensions or for  light-rail trolleys, which are slower and have less capacity.  </P> <P> The commission study, expected to be completed in November, will provide cost  and ridership estimates for each combination of route and technology.  </P> <P> Homeowner leaders along both routes vigorously opposed any plan, whether light  rail or Metro Rail extension, that was not a subway in residential areas.  </P> <P> Noise, traffic congestion and ground vibrations from trains running as often as  every three minutes during rush hour would make single-family neighborhoods  unlivable, they argued.  </P> <P> They saw little relief in two other schemes under study by the commission --  placing trains in shallow trenches lined with earthen berms or placing trains  fully underground but with trenches open to the air or covered with grates.  </P> <P> The Robbins-Braude plan differs from others in that it acknowledges that there  will be only enough money initially to build as far as the Sepulveda Basin, and  that homeowner opposition is so strong that a ground-level system is not  politically feasible.  </P> <P> Endorsing a plan that does not provide rail service all the way to Warner  Center was a difficult decision, said Roger Stanard, a Warner Center business  leader and co-chairman of a light-rail support group.  </P> <P> "But it appears to be what we can get, and the Valley needs something  desperately," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 25-Foot Depth  </P> <P> On the other hand, the Robbins-Braude plan, which follows the route of the  Southern Pacific right of way, gives homeowner groups the 25-foot-deep subway  they demanded only in a brief segment, between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and  Woodman Avenue.  </P> <P> Between the Hollywood Freeway and Laurel Canyon and between Woodman and  Hazeltine Avenue -- both solidly residential areas -- the trains must be below  ground but there is no depth requirement and the line could be open to the air.  From Hazeltine to Balboa Boulevard, the presumed point of transfer to express  buses, the line would not pass through any residential areas and could be  ground-level.  </P> <P> The differing depth requirements initially led to grumbling by homeowner  activists about "first- and second-class citizens."  </P> <P> But in recent weeks, homeowner leaders from Studio City, Sherman Oaks and North  Hollywood have endorsed the plan, partly through realization that to get to the  25-foot depth, the trains would have to start descending some distance away,  leaving only a small area with an open trench.  </P> <P> Tom Paterson, president of Valley Village Homeowners Assn. in North Hollywood,  at first denounced the Robbins-Braude plan as a "divide-and-conquer strategy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Settle for It'  </P> <P> But last week, Paterson, who represents a neighborhood bisected by the proposed  line, said: "It's all the mitigation we are going to get, and we might as well  settle for it."  </P> <P> Unwilling to endorse the plan are two large coalitions formed in recent years  along the Southern Pacific route -- the Eastern Sector Transit Coalition and  the Western Sector Transit Coalition.  </P> <P> Tom Herman, president of the eastern group, said the plan "just doesn't go far  enough" in protecting residents from noise.  </P> <P> Julie Fine, chairwoman of the western group, based in Reseda and Woodland  Hills, was more vehement: "For us, this is the worst possible situation. It  brings the rail line right to our doorsteps but gives us no protection  whatsoever."  </P> <P> A political activist who asked not to be identified said Robbins and Braude, in  putting together their consensus, theorized that single-issue groups such as  the two transit coalitions were "less of a threat than long-established groups  of homeowners, who you don't want to get on the wrong side of if possible."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bipartisan Backing  </P> <P> A bill introduced by Robbins in the Legislature includes key elements of the  Metro Rail extension plan. It quickly drew bipartisan support among Valley  legislators in Sacramento, was passed by the Senate and Assembly and is  awaiting action by the governor.  </P> <P> The county Transportation Commission has mounted a formidable lobbying effort,  arguing that since the Valley rail line would be built solely with local sales  tax funds, the legislation would be an improper intrusion by the state into a  local issue.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, who has frequently vetoed bills that he determined were attempts to  settle local issues in the Legislature, has until Oct. 2 to act.  </P> <P> The bill would not force the commission to build a Valley line but, through  tunneling requirements, would leave it with only two options -- build no Valley  line or build according to the Robbins-Braude plan.  </P> <P> Even while fighting the Robbins bill, Bacharach predicted that the commission  would be strongly influenced by the widespread support the plan has gathered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Affordability Issue  </P> <P> "It's our policy not to buck communities," she said. "If a halfway system is  truly what the Valley wants and we can afford it, we'll probably build it."  </P> <P> But the question of affordability looms large with the commission, which is  building the Long Beach-Los Angeles and Century Freeway light-rail lines and  contributing to Metro Rail construction.  </P> <P> Rough estimates of Valley rail plans are $900 million for a 15-mile light-rail  system and $2.4 billion for a 15-mile all-subway system. No estimates for a  part-subway system of only seven miles -- the Robbins-Braude plan -- are  available.  </P> <P> Commission planners say they hope to have $800 million to start another rail  line during the 1990s, but they admit that with cost overruns on projects under  way, it could be only half that much.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the extra half-cent sales tax that county voters approved in  1980 produces about $110 million in rail construction money each year, and the  three projects under way are expected to be completed and paid for by the turn  of the century.  </P> <P> Stanger, the commission's rail development director, said that by dragging out  the Valley project, "it's possible that it could be done, but we just won't  know until our study is done."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comparing Valley Rail Plans  </P> <P> Metro Rail Extension  </P> <P> Advantages  </P> <P> No disruption of residential area where trains are underground, minimal where  trains are in deep trench.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No need to transfer to downtown-bound Metro Rail  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top speed of 70 m.p.h.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extra capacity should ridership exceed estimates  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disadvantages  </P> <P> Higher construction cost (about $180 million a mile) means enough money to  build only to Balboa Boulevard, about seven miles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transfer to buses might prove unpopular with riders traveling to and from West  Valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Might be difficult to justify per-mile cost based on ridership estimates, which  are not yet available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Capacity of 19,000 riders per hour likely to exceed need.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LIGHT RAIL  </P> <P> Advantages  </P> <P> Less costly (about $45 million per mile).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Although revenue estimates are not available, there is potentially enough to  build 15 miles from North Hollywood Metro Rail terminus to Warner Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Construction cost more likely to be justified by ridership projections, which  are not yet available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of tunneling results in less disruption during construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disadvantages  </P> <P> Disrupts residents where trains operate at ground level or in shallow trenches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All suggested routes contain numerous residential areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Usually combined with unsightly overhead power lines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riders must switch to Metro Rail in North Hollywood to go downtown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Requires its own storage and repair yard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limited to about 6,000 riders per hour.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top speed is only 55 m.p.h.  </P></p>

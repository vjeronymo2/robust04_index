			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Southern Business rides out storm and rises 6% SOUTHERN Business Group, the photocopier and vending machine supplier, yesterday announced a 15 per cent dividend increase in spite of much smaller rises in turnover and profits. A final dividend of 2.23p is proposed, making a total of 3.38p, an increase of 15 per cent. Mr David McErlain, chairman, said the company was confident about the outlook and had ridden out the recession. The shares added 4p to 115p. Pre-tax profits advanced 6 per cent from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 15.3m in the year to September 30. The increase was due to acquisitions made during the period, which contributed Pounds 850,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.47m. Profits from continuing operations were unchanged at Pounds 14.4m. Turnover from continuing operations gained 5.6 per cent to Pounds 53.8m. Including acquisitions, turnover increased 12 per cent to Pounds 57.3m. Earnings rose 5.5 per cent to 10.62p per share. Forward contracted income increased 5 per cent to Pounds 313m, helped by about 1,000 new customers signed up during the period. These customers made up for reduced volumes from customers affected by recession, Mr McErlain said.</p>

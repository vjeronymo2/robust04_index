			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: German stores Kaufhof Holding's offer for the outstanding shares in Horten is a prelude to a full-scale merger of the two companies' department store operations. Much needed rationalisation, impossible to implement had Kaufhof stuck with a mere majority stake, should follow. The result will be a further shake-up of the German retail sector following the merger of Karstadt and Hertie last year. This is welcome, as German retailing is inefficient by international standards. For example, the return on assets at the big stores groups is around 1 per cent, assuming freehold properties are written up to market value. Wages as a proportion of turnover are high, reflecting cosy relations between management and workforce. Innovation and competition are stifled by regulation which not even the free-market oriented Chancellor Helmut Kohl has the courage to eliminate. The deals show that the big retailers are at last determined to address some of these deep-seated problems. Profitability will improve as the merged groups pool purchasing and distribution and rationalise their property portfolios. There will also be staff reductions, but these are unlikely to be dramatic. One problem is that the benefits of these measures, especially pronounced in the case of Karstadt/Hertie, will take years to feed through to the bottom line. Against a deteriorating consumer spending background, shares in the large German retailers are likely to continue to underperform.</p>

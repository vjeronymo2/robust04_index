			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, mufti of the </F> Republic, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz; place and date not given]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Pope Shanudah, in an interview with  AL-'ARABI, has called for a meeting with al-Azhar's grand imam  to discuss ways to liberate the Arab sanctities in Jerusalem.  Along the same line, al-Azhar's imam called on Muslims to work  toward liberating these sanctities. What is your comment?    [Tantawi] I support what both the al-Azhar imam and Pope  Shanudah said in this regard. I am fully prepared to cooperate  and coordinate with them to discuss ways to regain our  sanctities in Palestine. I strongly support this call, because  Jerusalem occupies a special place in our hearts. It is the  place Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, visited [in his night  journey]. We all have to work together for its liberation.  This does not mean that we should ignore the other religions'  rights in Jerusalem. The Islamic shari'ah reaches out with  peace to all those who wish to live in peace with us, but God  has ordered us to defend ourselves if we are attacked or  oppressed.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What do you think are the ways to liberate  Jerusalem from the Zionist enemy?    [Tantawi] There are several ways and means, some political,  religious, and economic and some others that relate to our  Palestinian brothers, who are primarily concerned. If the  efforts are combined and the intentions are sincere, we will  regain our right, God willing, because no right is lost if  someone pursues it.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The U.S. President's recent acknowledgment  of  Jerusalem as the capital of the Zionist entity has aroused  overwhelming Arab and Islamic anger. What is your comment?    [Tantawi] First of all, Jerusalem must be Arab and Islamic  in  flesh and blood. Neither the United States nor anybody else can  change Jerusalem's historic status. I support what Dr. Usamah  al- Baz has stated; namely, that only Muslims and Arabs can  settle this problem. But I repeat that this does not mean that  we should deny other religions the right to practice their rites  in Jerusalem and to have their share, proceeding from the  Prophet's saying: They are entitled to what we are entitled and  they owe what we owe. This is precisely the status that  Jerusalem has lived under for centuries under Arab sovereignty.  Before it was usurped, it was an Arab holy city in which the  rights of all religions were safeguarded.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The al-Azhar imam and Pope Shanudah have  emphasized that the Hebron massacre resulted from the weakness  of the international institutions and that retribution is  obligatory. What do you think?    [Tantawi] The Hebron massacre is a calamity and constitutes  one of the meanest acts of treachery. I believe that it must  not go unpunished, because all heavenly messages endorse  retribution, which is a necessity, particularly for such an  appalling crime.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you believe that the massacre has exposed  the falsehood of the alleged peace with the Zionist enemy?    [Tantawi] Undoubtedly it has cast a dark shadow on the  Middle  East peace process and made it more difficult. At any rate,  this makes it necessary for us to struggle [mujahadat] with our  enemies, because we have a right to look after ourselves and  defend ourselves relentlessly until death.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There are calls for normalization with  Israel  in different ways, such as pilgrimage [to sacred sites], which  Pope Shanudah has rejected. What do you say about such calls?    [Tantawi] First of all, let met tell you that I believe in  the exchange of benefits among people, because man cannot live  alone without cooperating with those around him. States, too,  cannot survive without cooperating with other states. Thus, we  welcome any exchange of benefits, but this does not mean that we  must fall prey to deceit or that, under the slogan of narrow  benefits, we should get involved in things that may harm our  entity, beliefs, and sanctities by our enemies and that may  bring evil to our country and religion. Damned are those  benefits that may lead us to such an abyss.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Jews claim that they are God's chosen  people. What do you think of this claim, particularly since  your doctorate degree was based on the "Israelites in the Koran"?    [Tantawi] There is nothing called God's chosen people in the  Islamic shari'ah, the Koran, or the sunnah [tradition] of the  Prophet. Faith and goodness are the only criteria for judging  any people or human group. This is what the Koran has  emphasized. As to the reference in the Koran that they [the  Jews] were given preference over all other people, the context  relates to a specific time and place when the Jews were  committed to heavenly laws. Later on, no people were so  strongly vilified in the Koran as the Jews.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How true are reports that Israelis were in  the Fatwa Office [which passes religious rulings] (during a  conference on religions attended by university professors,  physicians, and clerics from the three heavenly religions)?    [Tantawi] I stress to you that the matter was nothing more  than an ordinary conference. I did not know about the  conference in advance; Dr. Jamal Madi Abu-al-'Azayim, in whom I  have full confidence, told me about it. I do not see any reason  why we should discuss and scrutinize the identities of those who  attended the conference. But I emphasize to you that I did not  know that those people were among the conferees. When I am  asked to emphasize this, I do not mean to embarrass anyone; I  only want to clarify the truth. However, I am fully convinced  that the Israelis who entered the Fatwa Office by way of the  conference did not, in any way, harm the office or what it  symbolizes. If they had tried to do any harm, we would have  stopped them and struck back more forcefully, and we have the  means and ways to do it.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Some believe that the conference was an  attempt to drag the Fatwa Office into the quagmire of  normalization [of relations with Israel], especially that the  al-Azhar imam has announced his full rejection of cooperation  with Israel in any field.    [Tantawi] First, I am not with or against anyone; everybody  is entitled to his opinion. But I can tell you that when the  Fatwa Office is dragged into normalization or other things as an  attempt to harm my religion or my country, then I will be  available to be called to account at any time. But I believe in  a principle that says: Do not say who visited you, but say what  you told him. I want to tell you something else: When  President Anwar al-Sadat visited Israel, why did the Israelis  not say that those who received him were betrayers because they  allowed the man to infiltrate Israel? It is not logical to  raise these accusations because somebody visited us and in the  context I explained. Accusations of infiltration, treason, and  so on should not be leveled in this way. In short, I believe  that the courageous man is the one who faces the enemy, whether  in the enemy's house or in his own. Retreat is a kind of  cowardliness that does not find its way to Egypt's mufti.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you view the growing violence in  society, and how do you envision the way out of this full  national crisis?    [Tantawi] Any act that horrifies innocent and peaceful  people, no matter who perpetrates it, is a criminal and inhuman  act rejected by religion and the Koran. As to the solution, I  call for the cohesiveness and solidarity of society and  individuals in an attempt to establish what is right and abolish  what is wrong. There should be objectivity, honesty, and  flexibility. We must proceed from a spirit of love for the  homeland. If such cohesiveness is displayed, I believe God will  guide us to the best solution to this problem because God  certainly rewards those who do good. Security treatment alone  is not enough; all institutions and bodies must demonstrate  cohesiveness, as I said.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Many intellectuals and other people  concerned  with the phenomenon of violence believe that democracy is the  main solution to this problem. They are urging further  democracy. Do you agree with them?    [Tantawi] I personally support this demand strongly and  persistently. I demand further democracy because democracy  begets more democracy and awareness, justice begets justice,  good dialogue begets good understanding, and the good word has  its good impact on enemies and friends.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This leads us to the so-called national  dialogue. How does Your Eminence view this dialogue?    [Tantawi] I believe dialogue, especially between wise men,  is  the best way to persuade. I welcome dialogue as long as it is  meant as a search for the truth regarding disputed issues. The  Fatwa Office is open to all people, rulers and ruled, young and  old, poor and rich for dialogue and discussion on issues with  religious dimensions within our capabilities. I fully support  and welcome dialogue over any issue with a view to reaching the  truth and serving the country. But I do not favor dialogue that  aims at boastfulness, publicity, stubbornness, and so on.  Dialogue should be held over issues about which people have  different views with the purpose of finding the truth; it should  not be meant for showing off.</p>

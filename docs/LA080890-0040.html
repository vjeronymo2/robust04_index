			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVRATILOVA HURT, WITHDRAWS;  </P> <P> TENNIS: SECOND-SEEDED PLAYER'S CALF MUSCLE IS INJURED DURING PRACTICE FOR SAN  DIEGO TOURNAMENT. SHE HOPES TO BE READY FOR L.A. COMPETITION.  </P> <P> What tennis fans had hoped would be a showdown Sunday between the two top  female players in the world, No. 1 Steffi Graf and No. 2 Martina Navratilova,  won't take place.  </P> <P> Navratilova suffered an injured calf muscle during a practice set Monday  against doubles partner Gigi Fernandez, and withdrew from the Great American  Bank tennis tournament Tuesday.  </P> <P> Navratilova said that although she is a quick healer, she would have to monitor  the injury a day at a time. She said she is unsure whether she will be ready to  play at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, beginning Aug. 13 in Manhattan  Beach.  </P> <P> "I should be able to play next week," Navratilova said, "but certainly not  (Wednesday). I'm hoping three or four days. The doctor said two or three weeks,  but I'm a little more optimistic. I'll take it on a day-by-day basis."  </P> <P> Navratilova said she bent down low to hit a slice backhand when her left foot  slipped and she jammed her Achilles' tendon.  </P> <P> "The ground is porous and normally my foot would have held," she said, "but it  didn't. I was still getting used to the footing."  </P> <P> This was to be Navratilova's first tournament since she won her record ninth  singles title at Wimbledon. She had planned to play back-to-back events here  and in Manhattan Beach to prepare her for the U.S. Open, beginning Aug. 27 in  New York.  </P> <P> Seeded second, Navratilova was to play Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer in a  first-round match Tuesday night. She was replaced by Luanne Spadea of Boca  Raton, Fla., in singles, and by former San Diego State All-American Monique  Javer and Spadea in doubles.  </P> <P> Fairbank-Nideffer made short work of Navratilova's replacement, winning 7-5,  6-1 before of 3,875.  </P> <P> The announcement that Navratilova had withdrawn came after Graf's 6-0, 6-3  afternoon singles victory over Oceanside's Stephanie Rehe, a wild-card entrant.  </P> <P> Graf, seeded first, said Navratilova's withdrawal will have no effect on how  she prepares for the rest of the event.  </P> <P> "There's no difference," Graf said. "I'll still prepare the same way to get  myself ready for the next match."  </P> <P> Third-seeded Zina Garrison, Wimbledon finalist this year and runner-up to Graf  in this event last year, had her opening match delayed a day because of a bout  with flu. Garrison's coach, Sherwood Stewart, said she will be ready for her  singles match today against Fernandez, which follows the 11 a.m. center-court  match between Patty Fendick and Manuela Maleeva.  </P> <P> "She could have played singles (Tuesday)," Stewart said.  </P> <P> "But she was a little sick Saturday night and I asked them if she could delay  her first (singles) match a day."  </P> <P> The loss of Navratilova is a mixed blessing for Coronado's Angelica Gavaldon.  Had she advanced to tonight's second round, Navratilova and Gavaldon would have  played in the featured match on center court.  </P> <P> "It would be a great experience to play Martina," Gavaldon said last Friday  immediately after the draw was made. "But everyone looks forward to playing a  top player."  </P> <P> Like Gavaldon, Oceanside's Stehpanie Rehe, formerly of Highland, Calif., was  looking forward to playing a top player. But Graf is no longer suffering from  the sinus problems that plagued her at Wimbledon and she played at full  strength against Rehe, winning, 6-0, 6-3. Rehe scored only nine points in the  first set.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Japanese industrial production rises by 0.5% A MODEST rise in Japanese industrial production, a sharp fall in inventories and a marked upturn in housing starts last month, announced by the government yesterday, confirm that the decline in the economy may have bottomed out in the first three months of the year. Industrial production rose 0.5 per cent in March, the second consecutive monthly increase. Production was 2.3 per cent down on March last year, the smallest annual decline in industrial production for 15 months. Most significantly there are signs that manufacturing companies are finally starting to make some headway in reducing their inventories of unsold products. With shipments of products rising by 1.6 per cent in March, the index which measures the ratio of inventories to shipments fell 3.4 per cent to 106.7, the lowest level since last September. The inventory to shipment ratio has fallen for each of the last four months. The upturn in production was mainly due to increased demand for cars and consumer electronics such as camcorders. Chemical, steel and paper output fell. However, the modest rise in March production was well below expectations, according to Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities. Ministry of International Trade and Industry officials warned it was too early to claim production was set to expand again as consumer spending remains depressed. Miti expects further declines in the next two months. The housing market continued to rally in March with the first annual increase for two years in construction starts for condominiums. Starts on condominiums for sale rose by 8.6 per cent last month, compared with the year before, while starts on houses for rent were 13.3 per cent higher. Publicly funded rental housing starts rose 52 per cent, reflecting the surge in public spending on construction in the government's pump priming programme. Total housing starts were 9.2 per cent up from last year. Industrial investment will continue to be severely cut in the coming year, according to a survey published by the Economic Planning Agency. Corporate investment will fall by 11.9 per cent from the likely outturn for this year, the steepest drop on record, the EPA said. The forecast was based on the EPA's quarterly survey of 4,565 large companies.</p>

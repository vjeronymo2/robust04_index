			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "AM/PM" newscast] </F>   [Text] Throughout last week, the relationship between  Antonio Navarro Wolff and Ernesto Samper was very active, so  much so that Navarro accused Samper of harassment. The story  began 5 April in Cartagena at the Socialist International Summit.    Samper, in a first seductive move, tried to have his picture  taken next to Navarro. Navarro played hard to get, but in the  end the picture was taken. Samper said his social and economic  platform coincided with Navarro's. Next in this new love  affair, Navarro told Samper this was not true and described  Samper as a neoliberal, saying in social matters, the peace  process, and concerning corruption their views were very  different.    The next day when the coastal press published reports on the  alleged love affair, Navarro reacted. He spoke of harassment  similar to that of Miguel Angel Bermudez. Then, on 7 April  there was a commotion on the air of RCN [Radio Cadena Nacional].  Samper's harassment reached the point where he proposed to  Navarro a legal matrimony and told him the doors were open until  the day of the elections. Navarro answered his suitor  [pretendiente] yesterday in Cali.    [Begin Navarro recording] I want to tell Dr. Samper once and  for all, with all due respect but with all clarity, to quit that  story. We represent a different project from the one he  represents, and we do not accept terms or invitations that  definitely do not match our way of doing things or that of our  people. [end recording]    Today Samper insisted on the wedding.    [Begin recording] [Samper] I believe Navarro thinks  deep-down  that if we are close to a 51-percent popularity rating and there  will not seemingly be a runoff election, it is best to jump onto  the winning bus.    [Navarro] Dr. Samper is hoping I give up my candidacy to  support him, but no way. The dawn shall come, and I will not  support him. [end recording]</p>

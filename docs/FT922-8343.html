			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea crop 25% behind last year's THE INDIAN tea crop was down by 14.55m kg in the first quarter of 1992 compared with the corresponding period last year. The shortfall was biggest in south India, which remains under the grip of a severe drought. Out of total production till March of 44.12m kg south India contributed 29.85m kg, which was 10m kg lower than the crop in the first quarter of 1991. Tamil Nadu the crop fell by 6.9m kg, in Kerala by 3.03m kg and in Karnataka 7,000 kg. In north India, according to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the industry, the output decline of 4.55m kg was caused by the absence of early showers in north Bengal, where tea bushes have suffered a large-scale pest attack. And in large tracts of Assam tea plucking has been hindered by the prolonged winter. Parts of Assam have also been hit by exceptionally dry weather. The first quarter north Indian crop was 14.27m kg. Of the total Indian first quarter crop the share of CTC - cut, tear and curl, the type favoured in Britain - was 33.12m kg, of orthodox 10.65m kg and of green tea 350,000 kg. To cater for the change in demand pattern, particularly following the shrinkage in orders from Russia and the other constituents of the former Soviet Union, the Indian tea industry is gradually reducing production of orthodox tea. According to Mr Dudeja, there have been tea production setbacks in other countries too. Sri Lanka which is in the same agro-climatic zone as south India is way behind last year's production and the African producers have also been contending with drought. It is estimated that by the end of April, the world tea crop shortfall could be as much as 40m kg, of which India's share is likely to be 25m kg. Tea industry officials consider it highly improbable that the shortfall can be made good in the remaining period of 1992. In spite of the sharp fall in production, tea prices remain depressed . For example, at the Calcutta auction the average price for leaf CTC up to the end of April was Rs38.49 a kilogram (70.5p), compared with Rs41.07 a kilogram in the corresponding period of 1991. As for orthodox leaf, the price has been Rs38.56 a kilogram, down from Rs43.92. The virtual disappearance of Russian buying earlier in the season is said to have been the principal reason for the depression in tea prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 20 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic early Wednesday [20 April] authorised the  deployment of 100 UN troops in the beleagured Moslem enclave of  Gorazde, Bosnian Serb radio said. The UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) "can from Wednesday morning deploy 100 soldiers in  the part of the town situated on the left bank of the Drina"  river, Karadzic announced. The authorisation came as part of a  third ceasefire the Serb leader has negotiated with UN  representatives in as many days.    The details of the agreement remain to be discussed with the  United Nations special envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi, the radio quoted him as saying. Akashi has come under  criticism from Bosnian Moslems after holding fruitless talks  with Karadzic Sunday as Serb tanks poured into Gorazde, giving  the Serbs virtual control of the town.    Karadzic said Wednesday that UN soldiers would be allowed to  "protect the civilian population but not the Bosnian Army," Serb  radio reported. "The aim of the Serb counter-offensive is not  to take the town but only the right bank of the Drina which  belongs to the Serbs," the Serb leader added. But relations  between the Serbs and the military wing of the UN mission in  Bosnia would remain suspended "because of the active role it is  playing in the civil war." Reponsibility for the fighting  around Gorazde rests with the United Nations, as "it has not  disarmed the Moslem (Bosnian) army in a region that was supposed  to be demilitarised," Karadzic argued.    The radio made no mention of the release by Bosnian Serb  forces Tuesday of six out of eight teams of UN military  observers that they had detained last week in retaliation for  NATO airstrikes around Gorazde. The teams, comprising three to  five people, were reported by the UN Tuesday to have been been  freed.</p>

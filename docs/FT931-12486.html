			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Changing the prescription - The pressures forcing US drugs companies to trim their salesforces Pharmaceuticals groups are being forced to alter the way they market their products in the US. The result is likely to be big cost savings as drugs companies restructure their salesforces, once their biggest cost-centres. The move is being driven by two important changes. First, the structure of the healthcare market is being transformed by a rapid expansion in the number of managed healthcare organisations. In an effort to keep down drugs expenditure, these organisations purchase prescription medicines centrally, making sales teams at least partly redundant. Second, drugs companies are being forced for the first time to cut costs as pricing pressures hit margins. 'Other businesses have been evaluating cost containment for years, it is just new to pharmaceuticals,' said Joseph Jackson, director of health economics at Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical, based in Wilmington, Delaware. Less than 10 per cent of skyrocketing US healthcare costs stem from drugs, but prescription costs make up the fastest rising component of the medical care index. Traditionally, drug firms sent out representatives to scores of physicians who were responsible for choosing the medications their patients used. Nowadays, an increasing number of physicians belong to managed care plans, such as HMOs (health maintenance organisations) that are interested in curtailing costs. Many impose controls on prescribing by devising lists of drugs - known as formularies - from which physicians are allowed to prescribe. To gain access to these formularies, pharmaceutical groups are offering more discounts, rebates and other services, say analysts, hospital administrators and industry executives. Richard de Leon, director of pharmacy services at the University of Michigan Medical Centre, Ann Arbor, says that pharmaceutical firms are also putting together a much larger number of promotional packages, typically called 'bundles,' where, for example, a price break is given on a fifth drug if four others are put on a formulary. Some companies may bid their entire line of drugs, and provide incentives if certain requirements are met. As more physicians join the plans and large buying groups like insurance-controlled HMOs gain more power in the marketplace, drugs companies no longer need as big a sales force to call on as many physicians, according to industry observers and executives. 'It is influencing the marketplace right now to the point that there will be fewer detail men because they aren't necessarily going to be calling on every prescriber in the future,' said Andrew Stergachis, chairman of the pharmacy department at the University of Washington. 'Some of the major companies are already thinking this way.' As a harbinger of this trend, Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, said last year that large institutional customers account for 52 per cent of Merck's sales volume. By 1995, such purchasers are expected to account for 67 per cent of Merck's sales. The large customers are supplanting 'traditional markets drive by private fee-for-service physicians,' Vagelos said. Consequently, he said Merck would begin reducing its direct sales force by attrition and restructuring. Last year, Merck had a sales force of about 2,700. Such cuts will help margins which are coming under pressure. Industry analysts said it costs roughly Dollars 150,000 to keep a direct-sales person on staff annually. Not all drug firms have yet committed to reducing the size of their direct-sales forces. 'We don't see any reduction in the near term,' said Harvey Weintraub, vice president and marketing and sales support at Schering Laboratories, a subsidiary of Schering-Plough. However, Weintraub acknowledged that in the 'longer term,' the sales force 'is not likely to expand if the trend towards fewer and larger customers and formulary constraints continue'. Tony Bonelli, vice president of institutional health care at Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of drug firm Warner-Lambert, said distribution channels for pharmaceuticals had 'changed dramatically, with at least 50 per cent (of volume) going through distribution or procurement channels of managed care'. The nature of salesmen is also likely to change. Since they will be negotiating with only a few managed care organisations, rather than general practitioners, they will need to be of better quality. Clearly, the death of the US drugs salesmen is premature, but they are likely to be better qualified and fewer of them.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MARGIN AND RATIO COMPARISON  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage   Wellcome  Glaxo  SmithKline  Merck  Lilly  Upjohn  Pfizer sales  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Selling, general &amp; admini- stration      36.7      36.2      33.1    29.9    26.8   39.2    39.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Research and development   14.3      14.0       9.2    11.5    13.4   14.4    10.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales per employee (Dollars'00) 152.7     165.8     153.6   228.2   185.9  179.4   157.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

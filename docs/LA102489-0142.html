			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY OFFICIALLY DECLARED A REPUBLIC  </P> <P> Forty years of Communist rule formally came to an end Monday as Hungary  officially declared itself an independent republic.  </P> <P> "This is a prelude to a new historical age," acting head of state Matyas Szuros  said, declaring the republic at noon in a speech to tens of thousands packing  Parliament Square in Budapest. "The Hungarian republic is going to be an  independent, democratic and legal state in which the values of bourgeois  democracy and democratic socialism are expressed equally."  </P> <P> The Communist People's Republic of Hungary is dead, Szuros declared. "As of  today, our nation's name is the Republic of Hungary."  </P> <P> As Szuros pronounced the words "Republic of Hungary," the crowd erupted in  cheers. Church bells throughout the country peeled at noon.  </P> <P> The proclamation came on the 33rd anniversary of the Hungarian Uprising, the  revolt against Communist rule that began on Oct. 23, 1956, and was crushed by  Soviet tanks 12 days later, killing as many as 32,000 people.  </P> <P> In the evening, a crowd bearing flashlights and estimated by organizers at more  than 100,000 interrupted speeches before Parliament with shouts of "Russians  Out! Russians Out!"  </P> <P> Others tore the Communist hammer-and-sickle symbol from red, white and green  Hungarian flags, as had the activists of the 1956 uprising.  </P> <P> Announcement of Hungary's new status followed a purge by Parliament last week  of all Stalinist elements from Hungary's 1949 constitution, which defined the  country as a socialist people's republic according supreme power to the working  class.  </P> <P> Apart from East Germany, which calls itself a democratic republic, all of  Hungary's East Bloc allies define themselves as either people's republics or  socialist republics.  </P> <P> "This is a great day for Hungary," said one senior Western diplomat present in  the square, where elderly people with moist eyes mingled with young people in a  mainly festive mood.  </P> <P> In Washington, the State Department congratulated Hungary, saying the choice of  the day for the announcement was particularly significant.  </P> <P> Hungary is well on the way to achieving the ambitions thwarted 33 years ago.  And this time, as Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth said Sunday, Hungary does not  have to fear defeat by a foreign power.  </P> <P> "Our hands are not tied," he said in a televised speech.  </P> <P> Hungary's first multi-party parliamentary elections since 1947 are due to take  place by the middle of next year.  </P></p>

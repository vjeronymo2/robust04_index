			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> 2 TO SERVE SHORT STINTS AS MAYOR  </P> <P> The Moorpark City Council has settled a four-month squabble over the ceremonial  title of mayor by agreeing that two council members will take turns in the post  until the November elections.  </P> <P> Mayor Paul Lawrason will continue as mayor until mid-May, when Councilman  Bernardo Perez takes over, council members decided on a 4-1 vote.  </P> <P> Perez will be the city's ninth mayor.  </P> <P> For the first time, Moorpark voters will select a mayor in November. The mayor  had been selected by the City Council since incorporation in 1983.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Eloise Brown opposed the move, saying that Perez had indicated in  November that he did not want to accept a short-term position.  </P> <P> The decision settles a dispute that broke out at a council meeting Nov. 15 when  Councilman Scott Montgomery suggested that three people who had not served as  mayor share the post. Until that point, Lawrason, Montgomery and Perez had not  served as mayor. At that time, Perez and Councilman Clint Harper opposed the  decision.  </P> <P> However, Montgomery on Wednesday said he decided to give up his ambitions to  the post to resolve what has become a sometimes comic debate referred to as  "musical mayors."  </P> <P> The position of mayor carries no benefits other than presiding over council  meetings and representing the city at official functions.

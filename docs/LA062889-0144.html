			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EX-BOXER BEAT WIFE, WITNESS SAYS  </P> <P> Two witnesses testifying at the murder trial of former world middleweight  boxing champion Carlos Monzon said Monday that he beat his wife and threw her  from a second-floor balcony like a "sack of potatoes."  </P> <P> "He gave her a one-two combination of cross punches to the face and she fell to  the floor," said Rafael Crisanto Baez, a 57-year-old rubbish collector who  passed by the Monzon vacation house with his junk cart on the day of her death,  Feb. 14, 1988.  </P> <P> Monzon testified in his own defense Monday, both denying and admitting that he  hit his wife. He denied throwing her off the balcony.  </P> <P> Monzon stared at Baez impassively during Tuesday's session. Defense attorney  Jorge de la Canale asked that the witness be prosecuted for perjury. But a  second witness, Rafael Moyano, a waiter in a bar, later testified he also saw  Monzon beat his wife and throw her from the balcony.  </P> <P> The public phase of the trial is expected to continue until Friday, with  testimony from 31 witnesses.  </P></p>

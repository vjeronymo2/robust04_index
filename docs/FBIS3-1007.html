Rumors of transactions of up to 40 million rands [R] came  to light here in an urgent bail hearing for a white medicine man  who claimed to have involved with these syndicates as a member  of the AWB.    David Julius Myburg (30) of Myl Avenue, Wildernishoogte, the  herbal medicine doctor, was taken into custody Friday in  connection with a fraud case involving R2.7 million from the  sale of the Gold Reef City Hotel. The court was told that the  money was illegally transferred last year from the account of  Liberty Life at the First National Bank in the Braamfontein  suburb of Johannesburg. In the urgent hearing that lasted until  late Friday night in Magistrate H. Buhr's court, bail in the  amount of R20,000 was granted to Myburg, who last week opened a  practice and store here on Sandkraal Road, Thembalethu.  Myburg's passport was seized, and the case remanded to the  Johannesburg District Court and scheduled for 18 February.    Myburg, a married man with two daughters, testified that  until about eight months ago he had been engaged in obtaining  money for the AWB from Gold Reef City. The former owner of the  hotel, who sold it last month, had paid all of his expenses  while he was acting as an intermediary among the various fraud  syndicates and had no income. He testified that he accompanied a  Gerhard Anderson, who had been responsible for the transactions  because the AWB did not trust him. Anderson had allegedly  claimed that the sale and transfer of the hotel was an  authorized transaction, but he subsequently fled. Myburg  received a commission of R150,000 from the owner of the hotel  for his part in its sale as well as for the sale of another  hotel.    According to him, the bank stopped payment on a second check  for the same amount and some of those involved fled with the  money. Because things went awry and he was being held  responsible for the missing money, he fled here. He called up  John Vorster Square [police headquarters] about the conspiracy  to defraud. "We were convinced that the money was coming from  leftists but we only discovered where the money was coming from  after the banks stopped payment on the checks," he maintained,  referring to the electronic transfer of funds from Liberty  Life's account.    "There was a long list of transactions involving money  transfers that I knew about. Up to R40 million were supposedly  transferred from the ANC's account. This went on after I had  already left. I am now giving second-hand information," he said  in response to questioning.    Since he and his family established themselves here, Myburg  has been making money from Thembalethu's people by "telling  their fortune." Previously, he had earned as much as R60,000 per  month as a medicine man at The Wheel in Durban. His inventory  consists of, among other things, ivory valued at R40,000.</p>

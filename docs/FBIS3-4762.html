The March 1st, 1919, popular uprising was an all-people  resistance against Japan, in which the Korean people rose up and  undauntedly fought to take back the country lost to the Japanese  imperialist aggressors and restore national sovereignty.    In his report at the meeting, Chong Tu-hwan, Presidium  member  of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland, said the uprising dealt a heavy  blow at the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists and had a  great inspiring impact on the national-liberation movement of  the oppressed peoples in colonies.    "It is 75 years since the participants in the uprising  fought  for independence, shedding their blood of patriotism, and it is  nearly half a century since our country was liberated from the  colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists, but their desire for  independence and sovereignty of the country has yet to be  realised nationwide," he said.    He said in South Korea under the military occupation by the  U.S. imperialists, the people's demand for independence,  democratic rights and even their elementary right to existence  are ruthlessly violated. "South Korea remains a forward base of  nuclear war because the Kim Yong-sam `regime' sticks to the  anti-national policy of dependence on outside forces," the  reporter said, and added:    "To establish national sovereignty in South Korea and  reunify  the country independently and peacefully is a noble cause of  realising what the participants in the March 1st popular  uprising desired and the supreme national task facing the entire  Korean people."    He called on the South Korean people to launch a courageous  struggle to overthrow the puppet government, saying that with  the "civilian"-veiled traitor Kim Yong-sam left alone, neither  the independence and democratisation of South Korean society nor  the independent and peaceful reunification of the country can be  expected and nothing but the scourge of war will be inflicted on  the Korean nation.    He demanded that the United States renounce the policy of  "strength" and approach DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere attitude  in the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement, if it really  wants to find a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    He urged the Japanese reactionaries to discard the foolish  dream of gaining something from their involvement in the  anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and the South Korean  puppets and make a sincere apology and adequate compensation to  the Korean people for their past crimes.    The meeting was attended by Yang Hyong-sop, alternate  Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers'  Party of Korea and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly.</p>

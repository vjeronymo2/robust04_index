			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Hurd backs Portillo and denies intention to quit Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday firmly backed the sharp attack launched last week by his cabinet colleague Mr Michael Portillo on critics of Britain's national institutions. As ministers continued their struggle to rescue Mr John Major's 'back to basics' initiative, Mr Hurd also dismissed weekend reports that he had remained in the government only after a plea from the prime minister. In a confident performance that reinforced hopes among Conservative MPs that the recent political storms were beginning to fade, Mr Hurd said: 'If I was prepared to leave I would have left.' Speaking on BBC Radio 2's Jimmy Young programme, he added: 'I enjoy what I do. I seem to have a good deal to do and I have no present intention of leaving and no one seems to be asking me to do so. In short, I stay.' Mr Hurd rejected suggestions that the speech by Mr Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, which attacked critics of the Church, monarchy and parliament, represented another attempt by the Tory right to hijack Mr Major's call for a return to traditional values. The foreign secretary said that Mr Portillo, the cabinet's Thatcherite standard-bearer, had in fact delivered a 'high Tory' speech. The chief secretary had been saying that 'the business of the Conservative party, of the Tory party, is to protect and defend the institutions of this country'. Mr Hurd added: 'There was nothing in it with which I disagreed.' In another effort to dispel the ambiguity surrounding 'back to basics', Mr Hurd said there was no doubt that the initiative had a moral element. He also accepted that there were occasions when acts of personal immorality by politicians must disqualify them from office. However, he said each case had to be examined individually: 'I do not think people want the government to have an inspector in every politician's bedroom.' Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

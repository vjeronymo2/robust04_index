			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica lifts bauxite production Jamaica's bauxite (aluminium ore) output grew to 8.77m tonnes in the first nine months of this year, 5 per cent higher than in the corresponding 1993 period, mainly as a result of higher demand from refiners that have expanded capacity. Production of alumina (aluminium oxide) grew by 13 per cent to 2.44m tonnes in the nine months. The inland's largest refiner, Alumina Partners, is expanding its capacity and is producing at a rate of 1.45m tonnes a year, against 1.2m tonnes in 1993, said Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, executive director of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. Other refiners have also increased their productivity, he said. The institute is forecasting total bauxite ore production for this year at 12m tonnes, against actual production of 11.22m tonnes last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The field commander of the West African peacekeeping  force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], Major General John M. Inienger,  has assured that in spite of all difficulties in the peace  process, efforts are still being made at high levels to effect  disarmament and pave the way for a democratically elected  government in Liberia.    Gen. Inienger made the disclosure recently during his  working  visit to the Ugandan contingent at the SOS encampment village  and the Tanzanian troops assigned at Carey near Gbarnga. The  ECOMOG field commander said to ensure the implementation of the  disarmament process, ECOMOG has already begun meetings and  consultations with factional leaders and other players of the  Liberian conflict for the resumption of the disarmament and  deployment exercises. He then urged members of the peacekeeping  force to continue their good work and not to be discouraged by  attempts by the factions to frustrate their efforts.    Meanwhile, officers and soldiers of the Ugandan and  Tanzanian  contingents of expanded ECOMOG have been commended for  exhibiting a high degree of tolerance and restraint in the face  of extreme provocation by fighters of the armed groups. The  commendation was made by the ECOMOG field commander, Maj. Gen.  John M. Inienger, during his working visit to the locations of  (Ugabart), (Sistring), and SOS encampment village and other  [words indistinct] set aside at Carey and Gbarnga.    Referring to incidents in which nine Ugandan ECOMOG soldiers  on a routine patrol were ambushed and abducted and others in  which they were shot at without justification, the ECOMOG field  commander said that the incidents were regrettable and  unfortunate. He enjoined them to continue to exercise restraint  and patience which, he said, were the cornerstone of  peacekeeping.    Gen. Inienger observed that the task of the peacekeeper was  not an easy one, citing as example the case of an unarmed  Senegalese member of the small UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda,  Captain [name indistinct], who was recently shot dead in Kigali,  and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  abduction of five Nigerian ECOMOG soldiers out of which three  have been released. While at the same time of talking to them,  two were still being held. However, he assured them that ECOMOG  was totally behind them, irrespective of whatever happened. He  referred to the recent spate of orchestrated accusations by the  various armed groups, which tended to cast doubts on ECOMOG's  neutrality in its efforts to bring peace to Liberia, saying that  in peacekeeping if you are not accused it means that you are not  working.    Gen. Inienger assured them that in spite of all the  difficulties, efforts, including meetings, consultations are  still being made at higher levels to effect disarmament and pave  the way for a democratically elected government. He urged them  to continue to endure until peace is finally achieved in Liberia  because a large proportion of Liberians are still languishing as  refugees.    The field commander has, meanwhile, promised to look into  the  administrative and logistics problems of the peacekeepers,  especially in the areas of efforts to urge the United Nations to  speedily pay them their stipends which had accumulated for  several months. Gen. Inienger was accompanied by some of his  principal staff officers and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in  Liberia] officials.</p>

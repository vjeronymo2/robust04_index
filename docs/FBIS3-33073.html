According to a joint communique issued  by the UP and the Colombian Communist Party, Abella, a Bogota  municipal official and Senate candidate, has "received serious  threats against her life and had to travel abroad urgently."    The communique added the leftist leader will use her trip to  report to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva "the  systematic violation of human rights in Colombia under President  Cesar Gaviria's government." The communique added Abella "will  go to Amnesty International and other human rights organizations  to reveal the fraudulent conditions in which the government  prepares the 13 March elections."    Furthermore, the UP complained the Prosecutor General's  Office had arrested Jose Antonio Lopez, the UP candidate to the  Chamber of Representatives for the northeastern Department of  Antioquia, and Nelson Campos, the mayor of the banana-producing  community of Apartado and a UP member as well.    The Prosecutor General's Office had ordered their arrest in  relation to its investigation of the massacre of 35 people in an  impoverished Apartado neighborhood on 23 January.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dudley Jenkins ahead 67% CONTINUED progress through the second six months enabled Dudley Jenkins, the USM-quoted direct mail services group, to record a 67 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 779,000 for the full year to April 30. The directors said most companies in the group 'increased sales in their specific markets when, due to the recession, demand in these markets actually contracted.' Turnover advanced from Pounds 9m to Pounds 10.7m leaving operating profits at Pounds 798,000 (Pounds 589,000) after taking account of a Pounds 1.16m rise in administrative costs to Pounds 4.06m. Earnings per share emerged at 4.53p (3.86p). A final dividend of 2.1p makes a 3.1p (4p) total on enlarged capital. The shares rose 7p to 61p.</p>

They discovered 24  fields of hashish varieties of hemp. The plants were sown on  areas ranging from 100 square meters to 3.6 hectares. Over the  past nine months, 127 kg of poppy, 19 kg of marijuana, and more  than 3 kg of opium extract were confiscated. In underground  laboratories, it would be processed into the ready-to-use heroin.    Sergey Poltavskiy, the department chief, made the following  comment: "Kherson Oblast is one of the few oblasts in southern  Ukraine whose climate and soil are suitable for Indian and  southern Chu hemp. And these plants serve as raw material for  such deadly narcotics as hashish, marijuana, and anasha."    The number of illegal hemp fields in Kherson Oblast is  continuing to grow. In some cases, when the fields were left  unattended for several years, plants grew and proliferated  extremely well. This means that Indian and Chu hemp can adjust  to the local environment and proliferate without help of man.    This happened before. Let us just recall the notorious Chu  Valley in Kazakhstan. Once seeds of the Indian hemp found their  way to that area, they immediately spread over tens of square  kilometers, turning it into a paradise for drug traffickers. Is  there a perspective of another Chu Valley looming ahead?  Unfortunately, the answer is "yes."    It is extremely hard to detect illegal fields. In many cases  they can only be spotted from a helicopter. Plants are hidden  between the rows of corn on the corn fields, in plantations of  young trees, or in the rush thicket, reached only by water.    The militia forces are too understaffed and underequipped to  conduct a large scale combing. In the past, forestry officers  and road builders used to help the enforcement agencies,  uprooting man-made plantations and wild hemp. They even had to  make special reports on this. Now, no one has to do anything.  The hemp has been left alone. There is nothing to prevent it  from spreading to new areas. A package of antidrug laws  imposing heavy fines on managers turning a blind eye on hemp in  their businesses is stuck somewhere in the vast reaches of the  Supreme Council. Will it surface at least before the next "hemp  sowing campaign?"</p>

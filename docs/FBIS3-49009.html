			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tibor Kis editorial: "Gift"] </F>   [Text] By denying Hungary's national minorities the right  to set independent election lists, parliament gave an unexpected  Christmas surprise to [Cluj Mayor] Funar, [Slovak Prime  Minister] Meciar, and the anti-Hungarian forces of the  neighboring countries. As long as this decision is in force,  parliament will not have a moral right to speak up against the  violations of national minority rights in the neighborhood,  because it has also joined the lines of those who violate these  rights. After this, what can be said to the accusations that  Hungarian legislation does not practice what it preaches? While  in all Europe, it is probably this parliament that speaks most  about national minority rights, it has not really done anything  more to solve this tense problem of the region than the  parliaments and governments it so often criticizes.    Naturally, there is an explanation to the ominous decision  --  discarding the "corporative element of representation" --  however, this does not at all appears to be convincing when we  consider what is at stake. The decision certainly goes against  the national minorities; mainly because the parliamentary  parties were obviously unable even to bear the thought of the  very hypothetical possibility that the representatives of  national minorities might decide the voting on a certain  political issue. Narrow party political considerations decided  a matter that should not have anything to do with party  politics. If there is an all-national problem then it is the  national minority issue; therefore, it is simply astounding how  little the deputies were able to realize that progress cannot be  made through superficial rhetoric, empty speech, and especially  not through indiscriminately denouncing the neighboring national  minority policies. Instead, it can mainly be done through  example. Among other things, through Hungary generously and  without hesitation granting all rights to its national  minorities that can be given in Europe at the moment, and which  it itself expects from others. This generosity would be simple  in our case, because we have fewer citizens belonging to  national minorities than the neighboring countries have. If we  cannot find acceptable solutions even in these circumstances,  then what right do we have to expect the neighboring countries  to deal with the national minority issues on their merit?    Of course, in the given case, international assessments are  not the major problem. After all, we should settle our national  minority problems for our own good rather than to give an  example to others. These rights would be due to the national  minorities in Hungary even if all Hungarians living beyond the  border were deprived of them. The simple reason is that these  people are Hungarian citizens, the constitutional provisions  apply to them the same way as to others. And Hungary, after  all, is a democratic constitutional state.    This fact of being a constitutional state appears to have  been violated through parliament's antiminority decision. This  in itself is enough shame. It would be even bigger shame if we  cannot find a remedy to this wounding of Hungary's national  minorities before the next elections.</p>

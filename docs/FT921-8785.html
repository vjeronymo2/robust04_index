			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / White names his successor at Hanson: Decision to nominate David Clarke as heir apparent at US arm surprises City LORD WHITE, one of the twin architects of the growth of Hanson, yesterday surprised the City by announcing that Mr David Clarke would succeed him as chairman of Hanson Industries, the industrial conglomerate's US subsidiary. Mr Clarke, president of Hanson Industries since 1978, was introduced by Lord White as his successor at a meeting of fund managers and analysts in London. But Lord White later told the Financial Times he still had no plans to resign before 1996. At the 1991 annual meeting, both he and Lord Hanson, chairman of the UK parent company, said they would carry on for a further five years. Yet his decision to name a successor, after some fund managers and commentators had called for the group to name successors to Lord Hanson, aged 70, and Lord White, aged 69, surprised the group's own advisers. Lord Hanson told shareholders at last month's annual meeting that a successor would not be named on the grounds that the heir apparent would come under undue pressure. The group's financial advisers had confidently predicted that no successor would be named at yesterday's meeting. Lord White, however, said that Lord Hanson had only been referring to Hanson Plc in London. He added: 'I have said it many times before that David Clarke is my natural successor in the US. Our meeting with institutional shareholders was designed to de-emphasise James (Hanson) and myself. We wanted people to understand that we are not a one-man band.' Many fund managers at the meeting had not realised the significance of Lord White's casual remark that Mr Clarke, who is 50, was to succeed him, but some of them said it reflected poorly on the way Hanson planned its presentation. The company made it clear that Lord White's decision was a personal choice and would not affect Lord Hanson's decision not to name his own successor. Unlike Lord White, Mr Clarke is also a member of the Hanson board. His eventual appointment as chairman of Hanson Industries would end the anomaly of having one of the most senior executives unaccountable to shareholders. Mr Clarke, outlining his strategy for the nineties, said it would be misleading to think that Hanson could only grow through hostile deals. 'It would be a mistake to say we have to do a mega-deal,' he said. 'A great deal of our profits will come from organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions to existing businesses.' He also believes that the group will have to be better at explaining itself in light of the criticism levelled at it after it bought a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries.

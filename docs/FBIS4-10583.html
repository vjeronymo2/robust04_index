			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle by EL PAIS </F> reporters Walter Sanchez and Heraclio Labandera; place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] [EL PAIS] What was the scope of your meeting  with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington?    [Lacalle] Apart from being a meeting between the Uruguayan  president and the U.S. President -- the world's most important  political personality -- the occasion on which the meeting was  held gave it certain special characteristics. While the  continent's presidents were in Chile (when President Eduardo  Frei assumed the presidency), we received a fax giving us an  advance copy of a letter, which was later received by our  secretaries, in which President Clinton expounded his idea of a  summit of democratically elected presidents in Miami in  December. Our meeting, which was held at the White House, had  two distinct parts: The first part was held with the director of  the National Security Agency and the under secretary for Latin  American Affairs; and the second with these two gentlemen and  President Clinton himself. The topics that dominated the  meeting included the calling of the presidential summit, its  role, my opinion of the idea, and what I thought my colleagues'  opinions would be. President Clinton's summons is formulated in  a two-page letter: In other words, it is more than an  invitation. He outlines an idea that I would like to elaborate  on because it was the main topic that we discussed. He has  chosen December for the summit, which is too far off -- from  March to December is practically a whole year. In one paragraph  he writes: "From now until December we must work together to  ensure that the agenda of this summit will be very ample and  very productive."    He indicates some topics: "We must jointly consider the best  way to strengthen democracy, to improve the quality of  governments, to collectively defend democracy, to promote  economic growth through expanded trade and larger investments,  and to advance toward a sustained development strategy that will  protect the environment and help overcome poverty."    He then states that a certain point of the meeting had to be  highlighted because it was the most discussed. He says: "I see  this summit as a process. Between now and December we should  organize a series of very intense consultations between  governments. I also foresee meetings among non-government and  government organizations, including meetings with government  officials, to formulate new initiatives for their organizations  and for the summit. A productive summit should generate  consensus, give impetus to new ideas, channel a series of  meetings between ministers, and strengthen multilateral  mechanisms." At this point, I tried to evaluate the difference  between this meeting and others. At this point we must recall  that all U.S. presidents, practically without exception since  Franklin Roosevelt, have had initiatives for Latin America. We  had the "Good Neighbor Policy," which was the first, then the  "Alliance for Progress," then the "Americas Initiative" just to  mention a few. In other words, they all -- under different  names -- have attempted to create stronger links with Latin  America. I told President Clinton that, from the contents of  his letter and from his invitation, my intuition told me he was  less interested in a meeting of governments and more interested  in a meeting of nations, because this will be more than just a  meeting of governments, of foreign or economy ministers; the  meeting should include society's intermediate organizations,  businessmen, cultural and educational sectors, and  non-government organizations that today are having more and more  importance within society. We were in complete agreement.  Without pretending that one meeting will overcome the  disagreements we may have with the United States or that one  meeting will bring immediate results -- because one has lived  long enough to know that this is not the way things happen -- if  President Clinton's formula is accomplished, then I believe this  meeting will see the presidents complete a process instead of  just initiating and beginning a new one.    Interpreting and sharing President Clinton's thoughts allow  us to suppose that the Chambers of Commerce of the involved  countries should get together. Calling a meeting relative to a  specific type of activity will more probably facilitate  agreements because the interests of those involved are  concentrated and intensified. The same can be said of any type  of rectorial meeting. There is understanding among sectors  because the world is interdependent. One can speak as an  educator on topics that are as problematic in the United States  as they are in our country. Talking about investment or trade  brings us to the same conclusion. Thus, I believe doing things  this way is much more intelligent and complex. Those meetings  will be more difficult than getting 20 presidents to sit  together, because drafting a good declaration and listening to  erudite speeches is quite easy. It only takes 15 to 20 days to  prepare. But this other way of doing things is much more  ambitious because the interests at various levels have to be  ironed out. This is where I see the strength and importance  that this meeting can have if this kind of libretto and proposal  are accomplished. But everything must be done in a coordinated  manner. Our idea is to get the Rio Group to have the summit as  the main topic on its agenda; we will thus know how we will  respond collectively to this invitation. It will be useless if  only the Uruguayan, Chilean, or Peruvian Governments are in  agreement when the others are not.    [EL PAIS] Is this an attempt to reactivate -- under another  name -- President Bush's Americas Initiative ?    [Lacalle] The Americas Initiative represented a qualitative  change. Let us not forget it was based on aid for opportunity  and loans for investment. It represented a major change. This  was after the 1970's and the 1980's when foreign aid was  requested and credits were easily obtained. It may seem a  platitude to say this, but those loans had to be repaid.  Partnership in a venture, however, is not repaid because risks  are shared. This is why we were one of the first to share and  endorse, together with President Bush, that qualitative change.  And yet, this new proposal goes even deeper. President Bush  proposed the Americas Initiative, which so recently constituted  progress. This president has now presented a panoply that  includes trade and investment, and other subjects like the  environment, the sustainability of development processes, and  the strengthening and enhancement of government management.  This makes the project quite ambitious. The risk of convening  such a summit is, perhaps, the fact that as it is so  all-encompassing and so complex, it may meet with more  difficulties. Notwithstanding this, I think some conclusions  may be drawn from this -- President Clinton's -- outlook. The  first is that his government was not satisfied with having  established NAFTA, which was one of the risks we foresaw. We  said: The U.S. Government has signed a trade and economic  agreement with one of the leading countries in Latin America and  may therefore deem that this is enough. The U.S. Government did  so because Mexico might cast a shadow on the U.S. horizon. The  U.S. Government is, however, aiming beyond the horizon and at  other countries. I believe that, by joining societies rather  than administrations, it will achieve greater strength because  our administrations will be changing. In December, when I am  scheduled to represent my country, I already will know who will  be my successor. In other words, in December my administration  will end within 60 days. Therefore, if we achieve agreements,  plans, and goals among associations which do not have terms of  office as we the presidents have, then it will be a process  involving the entire society. Therefore, at first glance, I  believe this proposal is different, interesting, profound, and  complex, but also very attractive.    The integration process was another issue that President  Clinton and I discussed. We are constantly quoting [former  Bolivian] President [Jaime] Paz Zamora, who said the American  integration process must be modular and contemporary. Instead  of attempting to achieve everything at the same time, NAFTA was  established to strengthen the North, while the Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] will soon be established. Coincidentally,  an effort is being made to link these processes at a higher  level. Thus, our relationship would be facilitated. During my  visit, I mentioned that we -- the four Mercosur countries --  have signed with the United States a treaty called "4 + 1,"  comprising the four Mercosur countries and the United States. I  suggested making it into a "4 + 3" treaty, comprising the  Mercosur countries, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In  this way, seven nations would be linked.    [EL PAIS] Did they accept the proposal?    [Lacalle] The idea has been sown. No one will say yes to an  idea instantly. I left it with them. We will take the proposal  to our Mercosur partners first. We will see if we can discuss  it during the next presidential summit. I think it is a good  idea. It is, above all, logical. The conversation then moved  around these two main topics. I think Mercosur is acquiring an  increasingly important international stature. The same happened  with the European Union [EU], with which we have a 12 + 4  proposal -- that is, the EU plus Mercosur. Europeans constantly  refer to Mercosur as an entity. That is our big responsibility.  We must develop and launch Mercosur. This does not mean that  we must reject other ideas. We cannot change or start anything  new until we finish building Mercosur. The Uruguayan Government  position is: First finish building Mercosur. When all problems  are overcome and the organization begins functioning, which we  expect will occur before June, then we will be able to look  around. It will probably take 20 years, easily, from the time  Mercosur starts operating until it becomes effective. It is a  very difficult task. I think it has granted the four member  countries a personality in the world we must appreciate. When  Mercosur is finished, there will be four commercially organized  groups in the world: The EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and the Far East  agreements. It is a very small league. Just think what it  means for our country to be, through Mercosur, in what we can  call "the first division" of world economic and commercial  matters. These two issues will give us a lot of work and are  very positive. During my trip I repeatedly said that Latin  America is not part of the problem but part of the solution. It  is an area that does a lot of trade with the United States. The  zone has political and economic stability. Figures are  constantly improving. It is a good field for investment. The  zone has resolved its debt problem to a good extent. We are no  longer ballast, the lead weight on the fishing line, the problem  that sometimes we did not even want to look at. Problems in  Latin America have been gradually ironed out. This is the  message I took to Washington.    [EL PAIS] The "Americas Society" held an important meeting  in  Punta del Este recently. Within the framework of our  international agenda, what can you tell us about that meeting?    [Lacalle] That is not an international agenda of the same  level. The "Americas Society" has existed for many years.  Every year it visits different areas of the world with some of  its main associates. People from Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and  Brazil are represented. It is not a strictly North American  entity. It is based in New York, but many countries are  represented. What is the purpose of the organization? Mutual  understanding and better knowledge of reality. The previous  meeting, if I recall, was in Chile. This time the association  met in Buenos Aires and Punta del Este, trying to cover  Argentina and Uruguay at the same time. We talked about the  situation, just as we do with the many groups that visit us. In  this case [Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de] Posadas  spoke about our economic situation. Then [former President Luis  Maria] Sanguinetti spoke about integration on Saturday morning.  I gave the closing speech around noon. Many people said it was  a "surprise visit" of the "Americas Society." We knew about the  visit seven months in advance and announced it. It was a  meeting of important people, a meeting of important economic  groups. It is never a bad idea to let them know about the  process of change in our country.    [EL PAIS] Right, but is this visit not in the context of  what  was proposed by President Bill Clinton, that is, to take  integration to the continent's private sphere?    [Lacalle] Yes, yes, of course. I think people are  increasingly aware of the idea. Politicians and diplomats' work  is increasingly one of opening doors, building bridges, and then  stepping aside to let those interested walk through. These  people could be economic or cultural agents, or anyone  interested in a proposal.    [EL PAIS] You criticized Congress several times during your  trips abroad. Many people wondered if you would renew your  attacks during your state of the nation address on 15 March.    [Lacalle] First we must clarify the word criticism. We  always take the word criticism as meaning something bad. We  almost consider it as a synonym of "insult" or "attack." Those  in the political arena who cannot tolerate criticism have chosen  the wrong profession. I find it amusing that when I state the  number of times Congress could not muster a majority to pass a  bill -- without adding adjectives, just mentioning facts --  people feel I am attacking and insulting Congress. Let us not  forget the number of times the executive branch was subjected to  the most atrocious -- and here I will not use the word criticism  -- attacks, insults, and inventions. It's the same old story.  It looks like a one-way street. We have been described as  "disorganized," "irresponsible," "that we do not know how,"  "that we do not get things done," without counting the personal  attacks directed against ministers, their personal life, and  their honesty. Is it not so? If we count the number of times  we were attacked the list will be very long. When I talk to my  fellow countrymen, I am usually frank and I say, for instance,  that the police need more than arms and pick-up trucks when they  launch an operation. When our policemen subsequently face a  criminal and the situation tells him he might have to use his  gun, he needs to know that we accept he is representing the law.  This does not mean we give them a blank check, but we must give  them the assurance that he will be supported. Well, when I say  Congress has not voted on the bill regulating this area since it  was presented three years ago, I am only stating a fact. I do  not believe this is an attack but an attempt to state who is  responsible. I have enough with the executive branch  shortcomings. If you want changes in some fields you need  executive branch cooperation. I can list those fields. I say  this as a matter of fact, I do not add a single adjective. I am  sorry if someone is annoyed because I say this.    [EL PAIS] Your administration has only a few months to go.  Do you feel you had the congressional support you expected?    [Lacalle] I remind you of what I said during my state of the  nation address. One-third of my speech was taken up with  explaining the conditions under which the government had to  operate. It is already known that the next government will not  have a congressional majority and will have to form a coalition.  You have seen the result of my government's coalition. Results  have been interpreted in different ways because we were able to  obtain a majority of votes for several projects, perhaps not as  quickly as expected or as quickly as I would have wanted. I  conceived a parliamentary type of government with different  blocs negotiating and giving speed and assurance to  congressional action. I have no doubt that those who supported  the proposal to end the car insurance monopoly in 1993 could  have acted in 1990. I have no doubt that the port reform could  have been approved earlier. There were occasions when votes  were there and other occasions when they were not. You are  aware of the most outstanding case, the case of the bill  reforming the social security system, without a doubt...    [EL PAIS] That was a great frustration...    [Lacalle] Frustration was not the word. It was an objective  that we could not achieve. We said before the election that we  had to do something about it. We talked to all party leaders  here at government house. The BPS [Social Security Bank]  greatly participated, explaining that it was necessary to do  something to defend the system, to strengthen it. The system  has a deficit that year after year has to be covered by the  national budget. It is a very heavy burden for the country. The  deficit amounted to some $200 million in 1993. These funds  could have been used elsewhere, or total spending could have  been reduced. This is something that the next government will  have to face, no matter who is the next president. The problem  involves us all. Pensioners trust the BPS will continue as a  strong bank that will continue to pay their pensions, including  the important recent increase. Pension adjustments were several  percentage points above the inflation rate. This was a great  improvement. It is also important for those who contribute and  want to leave their savings in a place that will give them their  pensions later. Contributions also affect the cost of products.  There is no doubt that social security contributions are a very  heavy burden on productive activities. If there is a topic of  national scope, this is it. The government I have the honor to  preside over has a clear conscience because we tried to  administer a solution to the problem several times. We did not  want to impose our solution, nor did we hear alternative  proposals. Our proposals received a no, a no, and a no, but we  never saw an alternative proposal. Our responsibility here is  totally in the clear.    [EL PAIS] Have some representatives from the Batllist Forum  criticized your handling of the Armed Forces?    [Lacalle] It ill behooves me to sing my own praises. I can  only say that I have abided by the Constitution and the law, and  that during my administration the Armed Forces have been totally  and absolutely subject to the legitimate command -- the  president of the Republic.    [EL PAIS] Do you believe La Republica University is keeping  up with the times?    [Lacalle] The university is undergoing a dramatic and  positive change. We recently discussed this with university  authorities, noting that it is coming into contact with the real  world by drafting reports for public and private companies, and  by selling its services -- like some of the most prestigious  universities in the world -- to obtain financial resources.  This new phase in university life is, therefore, most welcome.  I believe, however, that the university still finds it  difficult to adapt to these changes; it does not instigate  change.    [EL PAIS] What would you tell your detractors about the  exchange lag?    [Lacalle] I think this subject has been analyzed by experts.  In my view, the cost of running the government weighs heavily on  the exchange lag. The current exchange situation stems from the  adverse effect of this cost on the economy, something which we  have been trying to eradicate since we assumed office. We  believe the decline in inflation will be instrumental in  breaching that gap and that a relatively strong currency is a  better indicator than a devalued one. To those who criticize  this, I would ask them to publicly identify a better  alternative, whether to devalue or to liquidate the assets of  all those who have a fixed income.    [EL PAIS] The constitutional reform is beginning to take  shape. Some contend that there is agreement while others deny  this. What is your opinion?    [Lacalle] For obvious reasons, I have not been directly  involved in the dealings of Congress, but I have been following  all the latest developments. [Senator Walter] Santoro, [Senator  Juan Andres] Ramirez, and [Vice President Gonzalo] Aguirre have  always kept me informed. They assure me that congressmen  reached consensus and an agreement will be voted on. [passage  omitted]    [EL PAIS] The press insists that President Lacalle's choice  as presidential candidate is Senator Juan Andres Ramirez ...    [Lacalle] That will be settled by the Herreraist Convention,  at which I suppose -- and believe -- my comrades will take my  opinion into account.    [EL PAIS] ... in your capacity as leader of the Herreraist  sector ...    [Lacalle] No, just as a comrade.    [EL PAIS] Do you think that this "primary election" may give  rise to splits within the sector? You are its leader and  should know how to handle it ...    [Lacalle] The doors of the different factions swing; one can  go in and out through those doors; no one is a prisoner. I have  heard my comrades voice their feelings of unity and vocation to  serve the Herreraist sector. This is not limited to just one  person, it goes beyond that.    [EL PAIS] Do you want the Blanco Party to field a common  candidate for Montevideo mayoralty?    [Lacalle] That issue has not been formally raised for  consideration. Therefore, it will depend on what my  distinguished comrades say when their opinion is sought. I  would thus discuss that when the situation presents itself. We  have to see if there will be a constitutional reform. This is  an important consideration to be taken into account.    [EL PAIS] Your wife recently made some remarks to the effect  that women in Uruguay play a marginal role in politics and that  she will run in the November elections if the people request  that she do so.    [Lacalle] Well, you should ask her about that. My considered  opinion is that Julia Pou [de Lacalle] is a very intelligent  person who is most able to communicate. She has made herself  known through her works, her activities. She could have stayed  at home during these past five years and that would have spared  her much distress. Yet, it is incumbent upon her to reply to  your question. There is total and absolute equality at home.    [EL PAIS] What will President Lacalle do after 1 March 1995?  Will he continue to be involved in politics?    [Lacalle] Yes, because I opted for this walk of life when I  was 17 years old. Thus, it is rather difficult to change my  path.</p>

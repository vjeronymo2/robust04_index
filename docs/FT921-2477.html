			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Dominion puts O&amp;Y ratings under review THE credit rating of two commercial paper programmes of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group, were yesterday put under review for a possible downgrade by Dominion Bond Rating Service, writes Our Financial Staff. The agency said there was 'nothing fundamentally wrong' with the company or with its two commercial paper programmes, but that 'continuing rumours and negative press reports' were making it hard for the company to roll over its commercial paper. News of the possible downgrade comes in the wake of O&amp;Y's decision to wind down its commercial paper programmes. The group's commercial paper is currently rated R-1.</p>

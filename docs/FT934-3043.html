			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: VW's economy drive Despite Volkswagen's persistent protestations that it would break even in 1993, the market long suspected there would be plenty of red ink. VW recently admitted as much, and yesterday raised the estimated loss to DM2.3bn. Being ahead of official pronouncements is one reason why the shares were unmoved by the news. Keeping VW's equity at a high for the year might be justified because the outlook for 1994 is more favourable. Still, an improved operating performance will come entirely from cost cutting, as European car sales are unlikely to increase next year. Germany and Italy, VW's biggest markets, will probably be among the poorer performers. The strong D-Mark is also a disadvantage for German car makers in export markets where devaluation has sparked some recovery. Retrenchment is yielding lower component and labour costs, but VW's need to standardise components will take years to implement fully. Short-time working at the main Wolfsburg site is presented by Mr Piech, VW's chairman, as cheaper than incurring high redundancy costs. Yet that only serves to emphasise the tightness of his straitjacket. Few believe that all of the 30,000 workers moving to a four-day week will be needed full time once the cyclical upturn comes. Perhaps Mr Piech is a shrewd judge who knows the limits to painful change, and thinks that to make yet more workers redundant would be to lose all co-operation. He may equally have side-stepped the difficult decision needed to put Wolfsburg on a viable long-term footing. At present the market seems content to ignore the more worrying signs and give Mr Piech the benefit of the doubt.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government firm over pay body - News in Brief THE GOVERNMENT yesterday defeated a call for a pay review body for university academic staff, as the further and higher education bill (Lords) entered its remaining Commons stages, David Owen writes. The call was defeated with a government majority of 65 after Mr Alan Howarth, education minister, rejected it on the grounds that 40 per cent of higher education institutions' income came from sources other than the taxpayer. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said the notion of a review body had been backed by 56 Conservative backbench signatories to an early day motion. The bill will remove further education and sixth-form colleges from local authority control and enables polytechnics to call themselves universities. Money for the sectors will be channeled through Further Education Funding Councils and Higher Education Funding Councils for England and Wales. The bill was given a third reading by 305 votes to 210, a government majority of 95. It now returns to the Lords. POLL TAX: A call for the Budget to include an interest-free loan from government to local councils to pay for the poll tax 'non-payment surcharge' was made yesterday by Mr David Bellotti, the Liberal Democrats' local government spokesman. Mr Bellotti said a Pounds 300m loan would mean the exchequer lost only the interest, estimated at Pounds 30m, as the principal would be recovered as councils pursued those who had not paid. The party today launches its 'shadow Budget' or two-year recovery programme under the slogan 'Turning Britain Round'. Provisional surcharges in a number of urban areas such as Manchester, Leicester, Reading and Rochdale are likely to be about Pounds 50. Mr Bellotti said it was unacceptable for poll tax payers to have to be charged more because of those who did not pay. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, dismissed the proposal as 'setting up a government bank to bail out authorities which have been least effective in their efforts to collect the community charge.' HOME AFFAIRS: The Aggravated Vehicle-Taking Bill, introduced by home secretary Kenneth Baker to combat joy-riding, gained its Lords third reading last night and now goes for Royal Assent. The bill gives courts power to impose up to five years jail, a driving ban and an unlimited fine on drivers and passengers who take a vehicle which is then damaged, driven dangerously, involved in an accident or damages property.</p>

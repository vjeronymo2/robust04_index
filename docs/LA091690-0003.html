			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'm one of the many viewers delighted with ABC's "Life Goes On." I enjoy it for  many reasons, one of which is its optimistic portrayal of Down's syndrome, but  also for another reason.  </P> <P> I wonder how many of the show's fans realize that Patti LuPone, whose Libby  Thacher is one of the most entertaining TV mothers around, is also one of  Broadway's best? As Reno Sweeney in the Broadway revival of "Anything Goes,"  Fantine in "Les Miserables" on London's West End and the star of "Evita," she  is one of today's most versatile and successful stars.  </P> <P> I am pleased that "Life Goes On" allows such a wonderful arena for LuPone to  display her many talents. Long may it go on!  </P> <P> Daisy Bennett, Rowland Heights  </P></p>

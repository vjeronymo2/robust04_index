			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (17): Heathrow showdown looms - Resistance mounts to bigger airports AIRPORT planners throughout the world face mounting difficulties in finding space, and then winning approval, for new airport facilities. As a result, new airports and associated facilities are taking longer to develop. For despite the sharp downturn in traffic over the past two years caused by the economic recession and the Gulf War, the resumption of air traffic growth, albeit slow, is bringing a resurgence of congestion on the ground and in the air. The Association of European Airlines, representing 24 of the major airlines in Western Europe, has pointed out to the European Commission and Governments that 'air transport can only contribute effectively to European integration and adequately satisfy user requirements if Community policies ensure that the airline industry can conduct its business in a sound economic environment.' This means devoting much more attention and money to the development of a sound and adequate infrastructure in the air through air traffic control and air navigation facilities, and on the ground with adequate terminals and runways . The International Air Transport Association (IATA) two years ago pointed out that before the mid-1990s, 22 out of 46 existing international airports in Europe would run out of runway capacity, while another 11 airports would face similar problems between 1996 and the year 2000 if no corrective measures were taken. IATA, which represents more than 200 airlines, pointed out that congestion was already causing losses of some Dollars 5bn a year to the air transport and related industries and national economies in Western Europe, a figure that would rise to Dollars 10bn a year by the year 2000 if nothing were done. The real difficulty, however, is that while many European Governments recognise the problem, they lack the cash (and in some cases the courage) to take the necessary steps to deal with it in the face of environmental opposition. Expanding existing facilities can and will help, but such measures often take much time to put in place, and they are frequently only temporary solutions before even they are overtaken by the inexorable growth in demand for air travel. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), estimates that between Dollars 250bn and Dollars 350bn will be needed between now and the year 2010 to provide the necessary airport infrastructure to cope with anticipated traffic growth, either through expansion of existing facilities or the development of new airport sites. The ICA0 identifies 35 new airports, including Bangkok, Berlin, Chicago, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Macau, Osaka and Sydney, with 48 new runways planned and almost 150 runway improvements planned or underway, apart from new terminals. But the airlines argue that even this is not likely to be enough - especially, for example, when set against the Dollars 857bn expected to be spent on close to 11,500 new transport aircraft of all kinds by the early years of the next century. The airlines believe that Governments should be urged to spend more, and to speed the pace of implementation of existing and proposed development plans. This task of persuasion takes much of the time of the ATAG's officers who travel ceaselessly world-wide. In the UK, the problem of siting new airport developments is likely to come to a head again with plans by the BAA (the airports authority) for a major new terminal at Heathrow, T-5. The proposal, expected to be submitted in a planning application later this year, is aimed at building on the site of the Perry Oaks sludge works at the Western end of the airport a terminal capable of handling eventually 30m passengers a year, raising Heathrow's capacity to 80m passengers. The cost will be between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m at today's prices, and the terminal will be built in phases, with the first phase opening in 2002 to handle up to 10m passengers a year, with further phases thereafter until phase five is opened in 2016, bringing the terminal to its full 30m passengers a year. The application is certain to result in a major public inquiry starting some time in 1994. BAA believes the inquiry will conclude in 1995, and that allowing for political delays a Government decision on T-5, which BAA hopes will be in its favour, will be taken in 1997 enabling construction to start. But many others, both in the air transport industry and outside, remain dubious, arguing that such a time-scale may be extended because of the severity of environmental objections. It is also argued that the bitter fight for the new Pounds 400m terminal complex at Stansted, opened early last year, was almost won by the environmental lobbies. The battle lines for T-5 are thus now being drawn up. BAA is extensively publicising its plans to local residents and others, stressing that it will require neither another runway at Heathrow nor an increase in night flights, and that the local environmental impact will be minimal. The local residents are not convinced. They point to the likely impact upon the surrounding urban areas of busier roads, especially an enlarged M-25 motorway, and, more significantly, call for the adoIntermediate string overflow ption of radical new concepts, such as offshore airports on reclaimed land, instead of adding more terminals to existing airports. The anti-T-5 lobbies point to the approach employed elsewhere - in Japan at Osaka Bay, in Hong Kong with Chek Lap Kok and Portuguese Macau in China - with offshore airports planned well away from built-up areas. They believe there is a good site in the Thames Estuary (well away from the original Maplin offshore site which was abandoned in the early 1970s). They argue that, if phase one of the new T-5 is not likely to start operating until 2002, there is still time enough to consider such an offshore site and build it, also in phases, to give the 30m passengers a year that T-5 will eventually handle by 2016. The cost might well be more than the Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m estimated for T-5, but immense savings could be achieved far into the next century by having a major airport close to London. They argue that had Maplin not been cancelled, it would have been in service by 1980, at a cost of about Pounds 750m and would have been capable of regular expansion to cope with subsequent traffic growth at costs far lower than the Pounds 1bn-plus total already spent on additional terminals at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, even before taking account of the proposed T-5's near-Pounds 1bn projected cost. The environmental lobbies also reject the argument that the new facilities must be at Heathrow so that travellers can benefit from the inter-change traffic that Heathrow already generates. The UK environmentalists are not alone, for there are many in the world air transport industry who believe that while mainland airports will still have to be built or enlarged, an increasing use of offshore airports offers a solution to the problems of disturbance and increasing pressures on scarce land resources. The future of T-5 is thus still wide open, but this confrontation between airport and environmentalists is set to become the fiercest yet seen in the UK.</p>

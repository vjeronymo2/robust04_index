			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> It is appalling enough to know that in 1989, we would have a need for a "Miss  Black America Pageant," but it is an extra slap in the face when the broadcast  is plagued with audio problems. The entire show was the pits.  </P> <P> Madelon Washington, Whittier  </P></p>

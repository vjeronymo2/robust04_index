			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Detention Without Trial Law `Inauspicious' -- The detention  without trial law, "misnamed the Abolition of Restrictions on  Free Political Activity Act, provides for internment without  trial for up to 10 days," notes a page-20 editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 23 February. "The argument  for the new, improved detention law is that it is a temporary  expedient, designed to protect the transition to democracy and  to last only until the Bill of Rights is enacted when a new  government is installed in April. The situation is different  now, supporters of the law contend: what is being protected is  a process approved by the majority, not a tyrannical oligarchy.  But to accept these arguments is to endorse the maxim that the  end justifies the means. As nuanced as the situation is, it is  not a maxim that liberal democrats can embrace. These defensive  arguments take no account of the crucial point that a law  providing for detention without trial, even on a limited basis,  provides an inauspicious foundation for a new democratic South  Africa."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Intimidation of NP, DP Supporters -- "It does not take  much political savvy to realise that it is crucial" for the  National Party (NP) and the Democratic Party (DP) to recruit  black people if they are to make any electoral breakthroughs in  black communities, contends Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English  on 23 February in a page-16 editorial. "While there is no  suggestion that the ANC is officially countering this trend  through intimidation and murder, it is not beyond the realms of  possibility that some of its over- enthusiastic supporters are."  "The ANC [African National Congress] leadership has often  raised the issue of political tolerance. It now has a duty to  spread a message that this specific kind of intimidation is  unacceptable."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Atrocious Socio-Economic Conditions Spawning Violence --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 23 February in a page-12  editorial views the "outbreak of violence in Bekkersdal," saying  it demands that "political organisations in Bekkersdal come  together as a gesture of solidarity for peace and the defence of  their families and property." SOWETAN believes the violence is  "spawned by atrocious socio-economic conditions. Those who  kill and burn have no hope for the future and have nothing to  lose. It is perhaps time that all involved, including the  Government, inject some hope into these areas."</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Putting the generals out of business / Examining efforts to loosen the military's grip on Thailand's economy THAILAND'S numerous generals have been uncharacteristically quiet since troops shot scores of pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok in May, but they now face a battle on two fronts. Last week the government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, removed their authority to deal with domestic unrest, used repeatedly to enhance their political power. Since May, pro-democracy campaigners have been demanding the resignation of senior commanders responsible for the shooting. Mr Anand has prefered a more legalistic approach and last week's move is seen as a first step towards reorganising the military. Yesterday, Mr Anand turned his attention to loosening their grip on the Thai economy by seeking to end the air force chief's automatic right to chair Thai Airways International, the national airline. Thai Airways International, the national airline, has become the focus of this campaign, both because its chairman is Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the air force chief and supreme military commander, and because its poor financial performance suggests soldiers are ill qualified to run a modern business of such size and complexity. The privatisation of Thai Airways and the impending flotation of 7 per cent of its shares - along with a the decline in tourist arrivals resulting from the violence, for which Air Chief Marshal Kaset is blamed - have also drawn attention to the airline. Suggested boycotts of Thai Airways and of the Thai Military Bank, a third of which is owned by the armed forces, appear to have generated more talk than action, but the technocrats have found a powerful advocate in Mr Anand, the businessman appointed prime minister in June. Mr Nukul Prachuabmoh, thetransport and communications minister, has ordered an inquiry into seven allegations of corruption at the airline, including one about the purchase of Rolls Royce engines for new Boeing 777s and another about the planned purchase of a plot of land from a senior air force officer's wife. Thai Airways has long been the fiefdom of the air force, but Mr Nukul and the finance ministry, which owns 93 per cent of the airline, have now agreed to change the company's articles of association; at present the articles give control of the board to the air force and stipulate that the air force commander automatically becomes chairman. The combative Mr Nukul has not restricted his efforts to Thai Airways. He is also manoeuvring to dislodge the military from the Telephone Organisation of Thailand and the Communications Authority of Thailand. The first is responsible for the domestic telephone system and is controlled by the army, while the second handles international communications and has until now come under the air force. Another minister, Mr Mechai Viravaidya, is attempting to reform the state-controlled media to ensure objective news coverage. During the violence in May, television and radio stations owned by the military were sharply criticised for their biased coverage. Although they intend to reduce the influence of the military in state enterprises, Mr Anand and his cabinet know they will only be able to make a start on removing the generals from their entrenched positions in the Thai economy in the two months before elections in September. Military commanders justify their dominance of communications and air transport on the grounds of national security - an excuse which has looked increasingly thin since the collapse of Soviet communism - but they are also linked directly or through protection rackets to many different kinds of legal and illegal activities with no relevance to security. These include the border trade in gems and timber from Cambodia and Burma, the coastal smuggling of diesel from Singapore, gambling, real estate and golf course deals using state property, and the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly. The Supreme Command declined to answer questions on military involvement in business. Senior military men have grown exceptionally wealthy from various business interests, but Mr Anand, in trying to nudge them back to the barracks, has deliberately avoided publicly antagonising them. He warned civilians in a recent speech to realise 'that the strength and organisation of the military is such that they cannot and should not be excluded from all public affairs unrelated to defence.' Mr Anand and supporters of the armed forces say soldiers play a vital role in developing rural areas, but that is more a reflection of the weakness of successive civilian governments than of the military's expertise in dam-building. Perhaps sensing that the violence in May has left the military businessmen of the armed forces in a vulnerable position, a handful of officers have recently spoken out in favour of a professional army which would leave politics and business to civilians. Thailand faces no perceptible security threat from abroad which could be used to justify continued military control of strategic sectors of the economy, and if there were such a threat, it would increase public demands for a professional army. The Thai security services are regarded as a poor fighting force - they were humiliatingly defeated in a border skirmish with Laos four years ago - because training has been neglected in favour of business, equipment has been chosen on the basis of lucrative commissions rather than suitability, and the top-heavy officer corps is splintered into political factions. The armed forces have become adept, however, at staging coups d'etat, and there are muted fears they will do just that if they object to the efforts to curtail their business activities and attempts to punish them for the deaths in May.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      THE MILITARY IN BUSINESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- State enterprises dominated by military:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thai Airways International (air force) Telephone Organisation of Thailand (domestic network - army) Communications Authority of Thailand (international network - air force) Thai Maritime Navigation (Navy) State Railways of Thailand (supreme command) Transport Co (trucking - army)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other interests include  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Arms purchases, army's ownership of radio stations and TV channels 5 and 7, influence over Thailand Tobacco Monopoly, armed forces' 30 percent stake in Thai Military Bank, and cross-border trade in gems and timber  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

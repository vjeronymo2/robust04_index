We protect  our market more strongly than do Hungarians and Czechs. Contrary  to the comments of PSL [Polish Peasant Party] Sejm deputies,  Polish borders are not at all wide open.    In the West, the average duty rate at present is 4 percent,  while in Poland it is more than 10 percent. Even so, the  developed countries decided that their duty rates are too high  for trade to become a genuine locomotive of the world economy.  During the seven-year-long Uruguay Round, which was completed in  December 1993, it was decided that, in the next few years, the  average duty rate would be reduced to less than 3 percent and  all trade restraints in the form of countervailing fees, border  taxes, etc. would be abolished. According to experts, this will  cause world trade to increase by $200-300 billion. According to  the OECD and the World Bank, the principal beneficiaries of the  new trade agreement, which will begin to be binding as early as  at the beginning of 1995, are, however, to be the developing  countries, which in the next few years will earn an additional  $130 billion. Soon now, sharp rivalry over dividing up that  substantial sum will begin. Yet, at the same time, Polish  industry and farming, instead of getting ready to expand, are  seeking security by advocating higher duty barriers.    Following a temporary slash in Polish duties to a level not  much higher than in the West (5.5 percent), they were jacked up  since mid-1991 to levels several times as high as in the  West--as high as 18.8 percent. The tariff increases applied  chiefly to the least transformed [i.e., least adapted to market  reforms] industries, such as textile, footwear, and food. Thus,  duties of as much as 20 percent became levied on consumer goods,  20-35 percent on farm products and textiles, and 45 percent on  luxury goods. According to Tomasz Jodko, director of the  Department for Multilateral Agreements at the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations, this whole subject is beset by  inconsistency. Sometimes the failures of certain branches of the  economy are blamed on high interest rates and sometimes on  supposedly low tariff duties. It is symptomatic that increases  in tariff duties are considered when miners strike.    Yet, after World War II, the liberalization of trade became  the principal locomotive of world economic growth. The seven  previous GATT rounds have resulted in an eightfold reduction of  duty rates, and, in the years 1950-75, this resulted in a  fivefold growth in the volume of world trade, along with growth  of the generated world product. In 1982, when world trade grew  by only about 3 percent, generated world product diminished by 2  percent. In Belgium and the Netherlands, trade accounts for more  than 70 percent of the gross national product [GNP]. In  contrast, in Poland, foreign trade accounts for barely 20  percent of the GNP. And this proportion is going to be even  lower now that the government wants, contrary to worldwide  trends, to surround Poland with a tariff wall.    Since 1991, protection of domestic products has been  increasing not only through duty raises, which account for 70  percent of its extent. Toward the end of 1992, a 6-percent  border tax, levied on the value of merchandise plus duty, was  introduced. Moreover, the basis for levying duties was augmented  by including the cost of transportation and insurance. In this  connection, unlike in the West, the successive Polish  Governments arrogated to themselves rather than to the  parliament the power of fixing duty rates. As if on purpose,  they provoked pressures from various interest groups. In the  years 1990-91 alone, the government revised more than 90  implementing acts. It was only after signing the Association  Agreement between Poland and the European Union and owing to the  understanding with GATT that the government lost the power to  manipulate duty rates for about 75 percent of goods. [From now  on] tariff revisions will require GATT consultation, but it is  hard to say whether that will cool the fevered temperament of  the Polish farm lobby.    Yet estimates of the Institute for Business Cycles and  Foreign Trade Prices (IKCHZ) indicate that the liberalization of  tariffs owing to the Association Agreement between Poland and  the European Union will contribute to increasing Poland's  foreign trade revenues. In the next few years, exports of Polish  manufactured goods alone should increase by about $70 million.  To be sure, Professor Elzbieta Kawecka-Wyrzykowska of the IKCHZ  admits that it is not much, but, still, tariff liberalization  affords a tremendous opportunity for the Polish economy.    She commented, "Polish exports by now are impeded not so  much  by customs barriers, which are low, with the exception of farm  products, as by their intrinsic weaknesses."    As if that were not enough, we are not utilizing export  quotas--i.e., the opportunities for selling goods on European  markets at preferential duty rates. This applies chiefly to farm  products. For example, Polish exporters sold only 4-10 percent  of the permissible quantities [under the quotas] of pork and  potato starch, and even smaller amounts of butter, cheese, eggs,  and chickens. As for sales of, for example, live geese and their  eggs, they are impeded by a strange regulation--namely, the  Ministry of Agriculture has prohibited the exports of live geese  because it dreads duplication of Polish breeding stock abroad.    Had other countries followed the same mentality, the  invention of television or computers would not to this day be a  widespread boon.    Concerning the growth in exports owing to tariff  liberalization, Andrzej Byrt, deputy minister for foreign  economic relations, is much more optimistic. He estimates that  the ending of the Uruguay Round will result in a $1-billion  annual increase in our exports. At the same time, Poland's GNP  will grow. But that hardly sounds plausible because, in Poland,  duty rates are viewed as a means of not only getting rid of  [foreign] competition but also of enriching the state coffers.  Thus, while in recent years budgetary receipts from customs  duties have been rising, Poland's participation in world trade  has been declining. Too many overprotected sectors of the  economy have remained impervious to market reforms. Thus, while  as recently as in 1991 customs duties accounted for 3.7 percent  of budgetary receipts, a year later they soared to 27 percent.  In 1992, the budget earned 27 trillion zlotys [Z] (Z27 trillion)  in receipts from customs duties alone or, when receipts from the  border tax are included, Z46.5 trillion. In 1993, these receipts  doubled. The duties levied have caused major increases not only  in the prices of imported finished goods but also in the  manufacturing cost of many domestic goods produced with imported  raw materials. In the cosmetics industry, many plants have to  import as much as 70 percent of ingredients. Moreover, duties  also are levied on goods and raw materials not produced in  Poland. For example, there is a 10-percent duty on video cameras  and on many ingredients used in the manufacture of  cosmetics--for example, on basic detergents for shampoo  production (15-percent duty) or on cosmetic packagings (also  15-percent). All the more so considering that, in Poland, unlike  in the West, the differences in the size of duties levied on  semifinished products and raw materials and those levied on  finished products are not appropriately wide.    In some cases, such duties are even the same--for example,  for wine imported in bulk and for bottled wine. This is causing  problems for Warsaw Imported Wine Cellars and six other similar  establishments. As a result, imports of wine in cistern tanks  have almost completely ceased, and bottling plants had to lay  off hundreds of employees. By the same token, the consumer is  condemned to pay higher prices for wine imported in bottles.    Prof. Kawecka-Wyrzykowska said, "Our biggest losses will  come  as our economy becomes a bigger mess and further loses its  competitiveness." She added that, to be sure, farmers are  accusing the government of failing to protect the food market,  but, were not it for the imports, we would certainly be still  waiting a long time before being able to drink milk or yogurt in  colorful packagings. Jolanta Zombirt, adviser to the Government  Commissioner for European Integration, said, "Sometimes initial  losses have to be risked in order to join the company of the  economically strongest countries. We would thus gain the cachet  of a safe country, in which European customs regulations are  binding. To the potential foreign investor, this would mean a  guarantee that Poland is not some banana republic and will not,  unlike it has been doing until recently, keep changing its  customs regulations overnight."    Although duty rates have been fixed in international  agreements, the government is exploring the possibilities for  bypassing them. Apparently it has stumbled on such possibilities  as regards farm products. To be sure, it has presented a  proposal for reducing duty rates by one-third in accordance with  the GATT agreement, but, at the same time, it is raising them to  make up for having to abolish other fees (e.g., countervailing  fees) under the agreement, so that the prices of imported  merchandise are certain to rise. For example, the duty on butter  will be 140 percent after the countervailing fees and the border  tax are abolished, whereas, at present, it is 40 percent. The  duty on wheat is to be doubled. The government intends to raise  duty rates in order to reduce them later from a higher level and  still look like it is following the decisions of the Uruguay  Round.

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Guarded Clinton support for Nafta GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, yesterday endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) but said it must be toughened up in US legislation, which is needed to implement the pact. After several days of debate within his campaign, the governor took a middle course. Instead of urging renegotiation over workers' rights and environmental provisions, as his labour allies have urged, Mr Clinton said he believed the pact could be strengthened unilaterally. He said the treaty should not be seen as a solution to America's economic problems or a threat to its future. It could mean more jobs for American workers and better environmental protection. 'I am convinced I can do it right,' he said. 'I am deeply convinced that (President George) Bush won't' His decision not to seek renegotiation will limit the scope of changes to provisions like job retraining. Mr Bush has offered a Dollars 2bn-a-year (Pounds 1.1bn) retraining scheme but has not identified the means to fund it. However, the president made a point of accusing his opponent of 'waffling' even before the agreement's text was publicly available. Clinton advisers are understood to have felt it was important to get the Nafta issue out of the way before Wednesday, when Mr Bush is due to sign the pact in San Antonio, Texas. Above all, Mr Clinton's position had to be clear before the three 90-minute debates he is to hold with Mr Bush and Mr Ross Perot on October 11, 15 and 19.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECT PLANET, POPE URGES ON VISIT TO ICELAND  </P> <P> Marveling at Nordic scenery of stark and fragile beauty, Pope John Paul II  called Saturday for greater commitment by human beings to the protection of  their environment.  </P> <P> Icy Norwegian fiords seen fitfully from a plane window, snow-capped peaks  nestled in brooding clouds and Icelandic lava fields dressed green for spring  marked the Pope's passage Saturday on the third day of his Nordic visit.  </P> <P> Earlier, about a thousand Norwegians, more curious than devout, braved a gray,  foreboding morning to attend an outdoor Mass in the market square of the  fishing port of Tromso on Europe's northern tip.  </P> <P> Four young Protestant fundamentalists protesting the papal visit to Norway were  hustled away by police as John Paul addressed a congregation that Vatican  specialists considered the smallest of the Pope's 42 foreign trips.  </P> <P> John Paul delivered a wind-tossed homily based on the Book of Genesis -- man  being made in the "image and likeness" of God.  </P> <P> "At the same time, Genesis also speaks of another fundamental gift: the Earth,  which is given to man so that he may use its riches in a creative way," the  Pope said in turning to environmental concerns that are one of the main themes  of his latest pilgrimage.  </P> <P> "How well does man use these fundamental gifts?" the Pope asked. "Does man make  good use of his dominion over the Earth? Is he a conscientious protector of  creatures or brutal exploiter? By misusing the natural environment, does he not  threaten his own future on this planet?"  </P> <P> Praising Iceland's "magnificent landscapes and mountain peaks," John Paul  returned to his theme in a greeting to Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson  on the cold tarmac of the airport here.  </P> <P> "Today, in Iceland and throughout the world, men and woman of good will are  increasingly aware of the need for enduring peace among nations and peoples,"  John Paul said.  </P> <P> "In their concern for the future of the world in which their children will  live, they have come to recognize the threat of a materialism that would  sacrifice the environment itself to the pursuit of a sterile material  progress."  </P> <P> Iceland, a volcanic island of 252,000 that has historically lived from the  surrounding sea, is home today to a prosperous population that has the longest  life expectancy on Earth.  </P> <P> "In spite of all the know-how we have acquired, we are still destroying our  environment. We must set aside our differences and join hands in the effort to  reverse such development," Hermannsson told John Paul.  </P></p>

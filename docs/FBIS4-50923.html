			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The United States and its  Western allies were accused by a leading international  think-tank today of taking a no-risk approach in solving some  turmoils.    "It was a year in which the powers in the West... [ellipses  as received] seemed to be suffering from a serious attack of  strategic arthritis," the London-headquartered International  Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in "Stragetic Survey  1993-1994", its review of the major strategic developments and  trends of the past year.    "This affliction meant that few great risks were taken, or  enduring commitments made, to address large strategic issues."    The IISS, an independent body with members in over 90  countries, said the U.S. appeared to want a guarantee of its  security policy and took an approach of "no risk insurance" to  peacekeeping.    "By the end of the year the U.S. would insist on no  open-ended commitments, assurance of victory without casualties,  and an exit strategy," it said. "These are awesome guarantees to  ask for in today's uncertain world."    "Overall... [ellipses as received] it was clear that passage  from the organized, if undesirable, certainties of the Cold-War  era to a perhaps sounder system will take longer than many  initially thought. One major problem is the reluctance of  global and regional powers to provide the necessary lead."    The survey said the U.S. President Bill Clinton had been  preoccupied with domestic concerns and "blowing a very uncertain  foreign policy trumpet".    The survey concluded that "effective strategic action  requires a judicious combination of conservatism and risk:  Addressing the issues that arise out of the recent turmoil will  require more of the latter, and less of the former."    The IISS said Russia's use of the term "near abroad" to  describe other former Soviet States had "particularly dangerous  implications".    It said Russia did not wish to revive the Soviet Empire  because it was unable to bear the responsibilities and costs.    However, "It wishes to assure that these states act only  with  Russian interests and desires in mind. If need be, it will  meddle in their business, even militarily, to ensure this  outcome," the IISS said.</p>

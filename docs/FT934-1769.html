			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Joint declaration was agreed after more than 20 drafts The men of violence in Northern Ireland will be forgiven if they take some time to understand the Downing Street declaration. As one of the senior officials most closely involved in its drafting admitted this week, it is not a document that would win any prizes for plain English. A Whitehall colleague was less polite, describing the product of nearly two years of negotiation as 'the most badly-written declaration in Anglo-Irish history . . . and that's saying something'. But as the leaders of Sinn Fein yesterday got down to their line-by-line analysis of the Major-Reynolds plea for peace, the officials provided explanation, if not justi-fication, for its tortuous phrasing. The seven-page document released by the two prime ministers was the last of more than 20 substantive drafts which had winged backwards and forwards from London and Dublin over the past few months. If minor changes are taken in the account that number rises above 100. On Tuesday alone, as the prime ministers and their aides engaged in a frantic exercise to complete the document, they went through at least four versions. Each government had to be sure that it could declare with credibility that the document offered something radically new while insisting that it compromised no principles. 'Every word had to be fireproof', said one Whitehall official. The process started two years ago when Mr Reynolds met Mr Major in Downing Street. But the real work got under way only in the summer, when the Irish prime minister sent a draft declaration to Mr Major. That - amended, rewritten, added to and subtracted from - provided the basis for the final declaration. Whitehall insiders were prepared to admit yesterday what their political masters would not - although work was going on before Mr John Hume of the SDLP started his talks with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, the Hume-Adams initiative provided a decisive impetus towards an agreement. So too did the British government's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein. As one insider put it: 'You do not make an offer to a bunch of terrorists unless you think there is a fair chance they will accept it.' Mr Major's meeting with Mr Reynolds in Brussels in October provided the first breakthrough, with an agreed statement of general principle and an explicit call for an end to violence. From there the process went to Dublin, to Brussels again and back to London. The teams of officials on both sides make literally thousands of phone calls. After the revelation of Mr Major's Sinn Fein contacts, Mr Reynolds came close to cancelling the Dublin summit. The key passages relating to unionist consent, self-determination, changes to the Irish constitution and the establishment of an all-Ireland forum all at one stage or another threatened to derail the negotiations. Sinn Fein must take what it will from the resulting linguistic tangle. It will focus on paragraph four, which sets out Britain's acknowledgement of the right to self-determination for the people of Ireland, north and south. An author of the declaration has some advice. To understand it 'you must read every sentence as a whole, every paragraph as a whole and then the statement as a whole'.</p>

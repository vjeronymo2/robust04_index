			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-BRONCO STRONG SAFETY, HARDEN, SIGNED BY RAIDERS  </P> <P> The Raiders' search for an experienced strong safety ended Tuesday when they  signed Mike Harden, recently released by the Denver Broncos. To make room for  Harden, the Raiders put Tim Brown, who had knee surgery Monday, on injured  reserve.  </P> <P> Harden, 30, is a 10-year veteran who started all 16 of the Broncos' games last  season. However, his salary, a reported $450,000, and Denver's draft of  Arkansas safety Steve Atwater made Harden expendable.  </P> <P> Harden, who has started at cornerback, strong and free safety, is the Bronco  that Bo Jackson butted over on his way to his first pro touchdown in 1987.  </P> <P> The Raiders now start Zeph Lee, a converted tailback, at strong safety. Stacey  Toran, their projected starter, was killed in a auto crash. His replacement,  Russell Carter, who started most of last season, has a shoulder injury and will  be gone for another month.

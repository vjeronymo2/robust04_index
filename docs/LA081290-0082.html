			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT TO WRONG  </P> <P> With regard to Daniel Callahan's review of Laurence Tribe's "Abortion: The  Clash of Absolutes" (July 22), there can be little doubt that our Constitution  contains an implied right to privacy.  </P> <P> But if it is an absolute right, can Mr. Tribe, Mr. Callahan or anyone else  offer an explanation that makes sense of how laws which prohibit the ingestion  of drugs into one's own body can be constitutional?  </P> <P> In other words, does the right to privacy permit us -- all of us, men and women  -- to exercise control over our own bodies or doesn't it? Let's make up our  minds.  </P> <P> TIMOTHY A. LAWS  </P> <P> CHINO HILLS  </P></p>

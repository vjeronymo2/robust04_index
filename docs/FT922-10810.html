			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (5): Europe requires change - Agriculture THE ISLAND's agricultural sector is being hit hard by the single European market. Many technical changes are demanded of an industry which consists largely of small farms run by some of the last bastions of Manx tradition. The island is not part of the EC, but is linked to it through being a Crown dependency of the UK. It makes no financial contribution to Europe and receives no financial aid from it. But the special relationship allows the island to market agricultural products in the EC. At least half of the island's produce is exported to the UK; the rest supplies the home market. In order to retain its ability to export, the island must comply with EC regulations on production and processing of food. There are 800 producers in the Isle of Man - 80 per cent with holdings of less than 200 acres. Only 77 have more than 300 acres out of the total 117,000 acres farmed. Together with processing, the industry provides employment for about 1,500 people. Many farms are passed from father to son and have remained traditional mixed farms - sheep, cattle, dairy cows, grain and roots for fodder, potatoes and poultry. Fields are small, some only four acres, and bound by ancient dry stone walls. Farming methods on the smaller units are traditional. Crop rotation has always been practised: dung from the cattle is spread on the land, and the abundance of wildlife in the hedgerows reflects the minimal use of chemicals. In 1934, Manx farmers set up marketing associations. These consist of representatives from the farming community and professional administrators. There is only one slaughterhouse licenced. This is owned by the Manx government and rented and operated by the Fatstock Marketing Association. There is also a government-owned creamery, rented and operated by the Milk Marketing Association. Initially, farmers were pleased to get out of the open market in the island, where prices were being depressed by rings of buyers. But with production costs increasing - not least because of freight costs on all goods imported that are needed in agriculture - they feel restricted by the limitations of the marketing associations' abilities to market. In the UK, producers can specialise and find a market for their products. The strip of water between the Isle of Man and the UK makes it far more difficult for a Manx producer to gain access to these markets at economically viable prices. The smaller farmer is locked into the system. Both his income and expenditure are decreed by others. The downturn over the past 15 years has not left him with the financial resources to institute any major changes in his stock or methods. His best hope is to improve the quality of his produce to gain the maximum return available in his limited market. Those who have kept abreast of technical changes are not finding EC compliance such a burden. By continually updating equipment and systems, they have assured themselves a reasonable income and future. But these farmers are in the minority, and most find compliance an additional chore, on which they see no immediate return. Mr John Corrin, the Manx agricultural minister, said: 'There has not been intensive farming in the island, and stock levels have not increased much over the years. The Manx farmer does not feel he has contributed to European overproduction, and he feels he has a right to continue his traditional farming system.' The Manx government resolved to support the island's farmers to a similar level as their EC counterparts are supported. 'Though this does not necessarily mean the same support schemes as in the EC, in totality the result will be the same,' said Mr Corrin. 'However, we must be mindful not to give our farmers an advantage over those in the EC. 'Though we have limitations in continuity of supply, because of small production levels, if our produce is high quality in a limited range there is a market for it.' The government is negotiating to assist the marketing associations, which are criticised by the farmers for poor results. 'It is in government's interests that the associations work effectively, so that farmers do not look to government to make up their shortfall,' said Mr. Corrin. Investment of Pounds 5m is also planned by the Manx government for a new meat plant. The island's existing abattoir and processing plant cannot be altered to comply permanently with EC requirements. The proposed plant, which will be one of the smallest EC-complying plants in Britain, will be operational by 1994. With abattoirs closing throughout Britain, this is regarded as a vote of confidence by the Manx government in its agricultural industry. But the government also knows that collapse of the industry would create a large unemployment problem in the island. It could also leave thousands of acres of untended land.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MAY REDUCE NUMBER OF CESAREANS;  </P> <P> LASER IMPROVES MONITORING OF FETUSES  </P> <P> A new technique that bounces laser light off brain cells to monitor the amount  of oxygen reaching a fetus could help prevent brain damage and reduce the  number of Cesarean sections, a researcher says.  </P> <P> The technique has shown good results in tests on 12 patients at the University  of Bonn Gynecological Hospital, said Dr. Stephan Schmidt, who heads the  research team. "Its main advantage is that it's a gentle monitoring method  which can give continuous readings without touching the fetus.  </P> <P> "We still have a long way to go before we make definite conclusions, but the  preliminary results are very promising."  </P> <P> The relatively cheap technique -- Schmidt's model costs about $43,000 -- beams  extremely low levels of harmless infrared light into the fetal brain. The light  reflected back provides information about the supply of oxygen in brain cells;  the information is displayed graphically on a desktop computer.  </P> <P> "It is extremely important to us to be able to gauge the level of oxygen in the  tissue cells as often as possible," Schmidt said. Earlier techniques required  blood samples from the fetus, which "has the disadvantage of being a  single-point test and has to be repeated at short intervals.  </P> <P> "A continuous record is far more preferable and less cumbersome."  </P> <P> In 20 out of 100 cases, he said, heart monitors indicate the possibility of  oxygen deficiency, but only five of those 20 have symptoms that would actually  require Cesarean delivery, he said. "With our technique we hope to be able to  determine which of those infants do not really require a Cesarean section."  </P></p>

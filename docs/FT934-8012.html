			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Treasury prices little changed ahead of Nafta vote US Treasury prices were flat-to-weaker across the maturity range yesterday as investors and dealers nervously awaited the outcome of today's Congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 101 31/32 , yielding 6.171 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.059 per cent. Traders said activity was extremely light, with what little business there was conducted mostly in the intermediate range of securities. There was no fresh economic news to drive the market, and investors remained cautious of committing funds to Treasuries ahead of the Nafta vote. The market is concerned Nafta will fail to be approved by the House of Representatives. The treaty is seen as positive for bonds because it would remove trade barriers, which are regarded as inflationary. THE cut in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase - or repo - rate provided a welcome boost for some of Europe's government bond markets yesterday. German bonds had climbed in early trading on expectations of a much lower repo rate, with many market participants looking for a cut of between 5 and 10 basis points. In the event, the Bundesbank announced a minimum repo rate of 6.29 per cent, down nine basis points from 6.38 per cent last week. The central bank's net drain of liquidity of DM3.2bn took the market by surprise, dealers said. The market does not appear to be expecting a cut in the Bundesbank's key interest rates - the Lombard and discount rate - at this week's council meeting. The bund futures contract rallied from 99.96 at the opening to a high of 100.18, but met with some resistance at that level and slipped back to 100.00. ITALY provided the other main highlight in European trading with its first auction of 30-year government paper in the domestic market. Italian government bonds opened on a buoyant note - taking their cue from the lower repo rate in Germany - but ended lower. Market participants were mainly watching for the outcome of the auction of L 2,000bn of 30-year bonds. Dealers said demand for the issue was fairly good, with bids amounting to L 3,067bn. The Bank of Italy announced a net yield of 8.62 per cent and a price of 93.75. Dealers said the yield spread for the 30-year issue over 10-year government bonds widened to about 65 basis points, having been as low as 50-55 basis points in the grey market ahead of the auction. However, they pointed out that the auction price 'seemed fair'. UK government bonds climbed initially on futures-driven trading, with dealers noting strong buying interest out of the US, but fell back later in the day on selling of the cash market. The announcement of a Pounds 2.72bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for October had little impact on the gilt market, although dealers pointed out that it was slightly higher than expected. JAPANESE debt prices closed lower, with medium-dated bonds underperforming the rest of the market. Dealers said this reflected expectations of new supply from corporate issuers in the domestic bond market. The March futures contract opened at 113.90 and traded in a range of 113.75 to 114.18, closing at the low of the day.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Junior staff 'take more sick leave' ENCOURAGING employees to feel in control of their jobs will reduce sickness absence, says a study of the Civil Service published today. The survey of the backgrounds and health records of 10,000 non-industrial civil servants in 20 London departments found 'striking' differences between amounts of sick leave and grades of work. Men in lower posts were six times more likely to take sickness absence than their most senior colleagues. A relationship was also established between employees' attitudes to work and the likelihood of reporting sick. The study, which was by the University College and Middlesex medical school, London, showed that men and women who rated their jobs lowly for control, variety, use of skills and satisfaction were more likely to take sick leave. This was most marked among employees who felt unable to control their working environment and use their range of skills sufficiently: their sickness absence rates were up to 82 per cent higher than for colleagues who were satisfied with those aspects of their jobs. Certified sickness absence causes the UK more than 370m lost working days a year at a cost of about Pounds 5bn, according to the study, which was published in today's British Medical Journal. The survey says the variations in sickness absence 'cannot be attributed to employees in the lower grades being more likely to take the odd day off, or to those in the higher grades staying at work despite minor illness'. The study suggests that financial worries, class-related health factors such as smoking, and influences outside the workplace such as family relationships account for some of the differences in sickness absencebetween the civil service grades.</p>

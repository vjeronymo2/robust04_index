			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / WTO boost for Salinas The latest Brazilian political scandal has strongly increased the chances that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico will become head of the new World Trade Organisation, diplomats and analysts said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva. Mr Rubens Ricupero, who resigned as Brazil's economy minister at the weekend, was widely seen as the main rival to Mr Salinas for leadership of the WTO, due to come into being next year under the world trade accord signed in April. 'I cannot see Ricupero remaining seriously in the race after this affair,' said one trade envoy, whose country had favoured the Brazilian, a widely-respected former ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. An experienced Gatt-watcher said Mr Ricupero's admission that he hid bad financial figures so as to help the Brazilian presidential election campaign of his ministerial predecessor, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 'must spoil his chances for the WTO.' Mr Salinas, who already has the implicit backing of the US and many Latin American governments to become the first head of a world trade body from a developing country, was already viewed as the front-runner for the post. Many trade officials and diplomats say that his record as a president who put aside protectionist policies and liberalised the Mexican economy would provide added political weight to the fledgling WTO. The European Union is expected to endorse the candidature of Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister, although there is little sign that he has much support among other countries in the 125-member Gatt.</p>

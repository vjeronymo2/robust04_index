			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Round-the-world expedition - Skiing Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They began the year in north America and moved to Europe in March. You can always tell when the skiing season is drifting to a close: the Palace Hotel at St Moritz closes until June, the nice Italian head waiter at the Kulm goes home to run his family restaurant in Como, the weather turns colder and it starts snowing again. April, as so often happens, has punished us for casting clouts. After putting away our heavy duty ski suits we promptly paid the price. We shivered in St Moritz as we tried to recognise the contours of Diavolezza and Lagalb, and our toes froze in Klosters as we skied through a blizzard. As we reach Day 100 of our expedition tomorrow we have skied 1,000 runs in more than 100 resorts and are now chasing our 1,000th mile of skiing and our second million vertical feet. Maybe a break on Lake Como would be fun. We could always water-ski.</p>

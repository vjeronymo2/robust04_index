			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Eggar hopeful over oil reserves UK oil reserves will last 'well into the next decade', Mr Tim Eggar, the new energy minister, said yesterday, David Lascelles writes. He also predicted that UK oil production would rise during the 1990s, possibly achieving a record level of 130m tonnes in 1995. A peak of 127m tonnes was reached in 1986, but last year it was only 91m tonnes. In his first press conference since his appointment, Mr Eggar gave an upbeat assessment of the outlook for UK oil and gas. Exploration was continuing at a high level, and large discoveries continued. The annual Brown Book of statistics on the oil and gas industry, published yesterday, says the number of fields in production on the UK continental shelf reached 100 last year and continued to rise during the early months of this year. Brown Book forecasts for petroleum production (m tonnes) are 1992, 85-105; 1993, 85-115; 1994, 95-130; 1995, 95-130; 1996, 90-130. Gas production is also rising steadily, reaching 55.2bn cubic metres last year. Mr Eggar hinted at further relaxation of restrictions on overseas trade in gas. He indicated that plans to privatise British Coal were likely to be unveiled in the Queen's Speech next week.</p>

Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told a joint meeting of the  government and ruling party officials for foreign affairs that  the remarks of Ambassador Kong are not the official position of  the Foreign Ministry. Kong said Monday that the present ban on  Japanese culture should be lifted soon in light of the current  age of advanced telecommunications and mass media, which is  rendering borders insignificant. Kong said, "it is desirable  for Korea to open its markets now to good Japanese cultural  products including movies."    Paek Nam-chi, the party's policy coordinator, quoted  Minister  Han as saying at the meeting, "the government is not studying  the issue of market opening to Japanese cultural products at  this stage."    Paek said, "the joint meeting agreed that studying  importation of Japanese culture is not feasible at this stage  because it could pave the way for a flood of foreign culture.  And considering the special national sentiment toward Japan, it  is not desirable either, as most participants agreed. The DLP  is therefore opposed to any cultural market opening."    The party's position is to refrain from mentioning the issue  anymore, as the Foreign Ministry has decided not to study  opening the market, he added.    Meanwhile, DLP chairman Kim Chong-pil told journalists on  Tuesday that now is not the time to begin importation of  Japanese culture considering the national sentiment. He  clarified his opposition to the issue, saying that the country  should take a prudent attitude toward allowing in Japanese  culture.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / GRE back in the black at Pounds 3m GUARDIAN ROYAL Exchange, one of the largest composite insurers, yesterday surprised the markets by announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m for 1992, compared with a Pounds 210m loss in 1991. The company, which has benefited from rises in premium rates and milder weather in the UK, is the second big insurance company to move back into the black this year, after two years of severe trading losses. However its maintained dividend of 7p dampened investors' enthusiasm. The shares closed only 1p higher at 189p. Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive, said the dividend move had helped strengthen the balance sheet. Analysts had expected losses of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m, but said fourth-quarter trading figures and investment returns were better than expected. Like competitors who have already reported better figures for 1992, GRE's improvement was underpinned by a turnround in the UK, where underwriting losses fell to Pounds 170m compared with Pounds 332m in 1991. Mr Hopkins said that the group was benefiting from 'extremely harsh rate increases' and its decision to 'cull' bad business. UK motor losses fell to Pounds 17m from Pounds 66m, after price increases last year of more than 25 per cent. Overall UK premium income fell to Pounds 943m from Pounds 950m. The group had reduced the number of motorists it insures by 100,000 to 517,000. It had also benefited from a 2 per cent fall in the frequency of motor claims. About 28 per cent insured by GRE made claims last year, compared with 30 per cent in 1991. Worldwide non-life premiums grew marginally to Pounds 2.24bn from Pounds 2.2bn, with life premiums falling to Pounds 821m from Pounds 879m. Underwriting losses of Pounds 314m (against Pounds 491m) were more than offset by life profits of Pounds 21m (down from Pounds 23m) and investment income of Pounds 296m (up from Pounds 268m). The solvency margin - which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - climbed to 51 per cent at the end of 1992, compared with 43 per cent at the end of 1991. Mr Hopkins said GRE was continuing to review its smaller operations, but 'selective expansion' was possible. Lex, Page 20</p>

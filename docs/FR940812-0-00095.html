By signing and submitting this proposal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective lower tier participant is providing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification set out below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The certification in this clause is a material representation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was entered into. If it is later determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective lower tier participant knowingly rendered an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government, the department or agency with which this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction originated may pursue available remedies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including suspension and/or debarment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The prospective lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the person to which this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tier participant learns that its certification was erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The terms ``covered transaction,'' ``debarred,'' ``suspended,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``ineligible,'' ``lower tier covered transaction,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``participant,'' ``person,'' ``primary covered transaction,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``principal,'' ``proposal,'' and ``voluntarily excluded,'' as used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing Executive Order 12549. You may contact the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person to which this proposal is submitted for assistance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining a copy of those regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a person who is debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized by the department or agency with which this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction originated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The prospective lower tier participant further agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by submitting this proposal that it will include this clause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> titled ``Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion_Lower Tier Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transaction,'' without modification, in all lower tier covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered transaction that it is not debarred, suspended,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, check the Nonprocurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records in order to render in good faith the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant is not required to exceed that which is normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these instructions, if a participant in a covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction with a person who is suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in this transaction, in addition to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies available to the Federal Government, the department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of agency with which this transaction originated may pursue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion_Lower Tier Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded from participation in this transaction by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal department or agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, such prospective participant shall attach an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation to this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

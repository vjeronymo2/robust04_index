			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: The Week Ahead ICI is expected to reveal doubled profits of around Pounds 300m for 1993 before exceptional charges when it reports full year results on Thursday. The figures will have benefited from cost-cutting and some improvement in its UK and US markets but ICI is likely to report that continental Europe remains very difficult. Total dividends should be held at 27.5p though uncovered by earnings. Full-year figures from the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever are due on Tuesday with estimated profits ranging from Pounds 2.25bn pre-tax to Pounds 2.325bn, against Pounds 2.029bn previously. Trading has been tough in Europe, mixed in the US and strong in Asia-Pacific. There may be big rationalisation charges, partly offset by gains on disposals. Full-year results from SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs group, also due on Tuesday, are unlikely to be as spectacular as Glaxo's. Pre-tax profits should be close to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.047bn) and the full year dividend is likely to increase from 8.76p last time to at least 10.5p. On Wednesday National Westminster Bank becomes the second large high street bank to disclose its 1993 figures, and is expected to report a pre-tax profit of between Pounds 950m and just over Pounds 1bn, compared with Pounds 398m in 1992. Bad debt provisions are expected to fall substantially, but operating profits are not thought to have grown strongly. The dividend rise is likely to be smaller than those at Lloyds and TSB Group because of NatWest's weaker capital ratios. A year ago BAe reported the biggest annual loss in UK corporate history  - the Pounds 1.2bn pre-tax loss included exceptional costs of Pounds 1bn. On Wednesday the group is expected to report a reduced full year loss of about Pounds 200m after Pounds 250m of exceptionals. On the same day British Gas is due to report full year pre-exceptional profits of between Pounds 900m and Pounds 1bn together with substantial staff redundancy and restructuring provisions. Meanwhile three UK composite insurers reporting results for 1993 next week are all expected to be comfortably back in the black, after three years of difficult trading conditions. Guardian Royal Exchange starts the ball rolling on Tuesday with its pre-tax profits expected to be between Pounds 135m and Pounds 170m, before investment gains are included. That compares to profits of Pounds 3m in 1992  -again before investment gains. Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK composites in recent years, is expected to post profits of between Pounds 179m and Pounds 213m when it reports on Wednesday compared with Pounds 24m last time. Finally on Thursday Royal Insurance is expected to register profits of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 160m against a Pounds 27m loss in 1992.</p>

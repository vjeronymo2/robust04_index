			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Treasury cuts herald Whitehall reform Yesterday's announcement of a radical transformation in the role and staffing of the Treasury could mark a defining moment in the history of Britain's civil service. The Treasury is at the pinnacle of the Whitehall pyramid. Few doubt that with the reform starting there, pressure in Whitehall to slash senior posts and reshape departments will become irresistible. The aim of the Whitehall reform programme was set out in July's white paper on the future of the civil service. It is to remove 'unnecessary layers of management' from central government departments and to define more closely than previously the functions of senior officials. It says baldly: 'The government believes it will be in the national interest to have over a period a somewhat smaller but better-paid senior civil service.' According to those engaged in departmental reviews the result could be the shedding of about one third of the 3,000 mandarins at grade 5 and above - Whitehall's cream - with a significant impact on jobs at lower levels. Although the most significant department to cut so far, the Treasury is not the first to announce big job reductions at the top. In May the Department of Transport unveiled a two-year 'streamlining' which will lead to the loss of about a fifth of the department's 15,000 staff. Large-scale job cuts have also been mooted at the environment and health departments, and almost every part of Whitehall is at some stage in a senior management review. The rationale for the reviews is partly political and partly managerial. At the political level ministers are acutely conscious of the contrast between Tory rhetoric about 'small government' and the reality that the number of non-industrial civil servants has fallen by barely 10 per cent since Baroness Thatcher took office in 1979. Industrial civil servants have borne the brunt of cuts - the early 1990s even saw an increase in the number of non-industrial staff. The managerial imperative flows from the industry-wide drive to devolve responsibility for service delivery to line managers, and to relate 'head office' functions more closely to core responsibilities. As Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, said in a lecture this May to Durham University Business School: 'We have seen a shift away from the 'command and control' style of management towards much greater emphasis on decentralisation.' He said this resulted in 'a more contractual approach of setting objectives against which management units might be judged'. A further pressure on ministers and departments is the freeze in civil service running costs announced in last November's Budget. As resources fall in real terms over the next four years staff will nonetheless be expected to achieve constant improvements in the quality of service, in line with the Citizen's Charter. To help them, government departments will be given greater freedom over budgets, including the right to decide the salaries and grading of staff, whose pay makes up more than half of civil service running costs. As part of the same process, permanent secretaries are being encouraged to 'de-layer' - reorganise their management structures with fewer grades - and to impose personal contracts that emphasise the responsibilities of officials to manage. This means that Whitehall will be taking the same bitter medicine it has imposed on the rest of the public service. Yet pressure for reform does not stop there. A report of the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit last November wanted more top Whitehall jobs to be advertised openly to ensure that non-Whitehall candidates were considered. As the steamroller advances, the Whitehall 'career for life' will be endangered - and some fear that the non-political status of the civil service may come into question.</p>

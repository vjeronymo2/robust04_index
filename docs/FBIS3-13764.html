A spokesman for the Libyan National Salvation Front [words  indistinct] that Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi continued  to deny there had been a rebellion even though Arab diplomatic  sources in Libya assert that a rebellion really did occur.    At the time of the rebellion, press sources said it was  organized by Islamic hardliners among the Army officers. These  sources said the rebellion started on 11 October 1993.</p>

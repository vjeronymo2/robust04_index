			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> CITY WON'T APPEAL SLOW-GROWTH RULING  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday unanimously agreed not to appeal a judge's ruling  that struck down the city's slow-growth initiative.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald in February ruled the initiative,  Measure X, unconstitutional. It officially became invalid March 10.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, brought against the city by Verde San Juan Estates General  Partnership and Kaiser Development Co. in January, claimed that the measure  required developers to build all the streets in their projects as well as deal  with traffic problems on the city's existing roads.  </P> <P> Measure X passed by 379 votes in the city on Nov. 8. It is identical to Measure  A, the countywide slow-growth plan that failed on the June ballot, and San  Clemente's Measure E, which passed last June but also was declared  unconstitutional.  </P></p>

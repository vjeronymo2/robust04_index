Its performance created a lot of excitement among the  delegates and among those present were the IAF top brass who  seemed truly impressed.    The aircraft which displayed its prowess at the Bangalore  air  show was the British Aerospace advanced jet trainer (AJT), Hawk  and exactly a month later the government of India has decided to  acquire this aircraft for the IAF.    The Hawk's immediate rival, the Franco-German Alpha which  was  also to have been displayed at this air show, pulled out and  French aviation officials were unable to explain this sudden  move. This further lent credence to the theory that the Alpha  advanced jet trainer (AJT) had lost the race to get into the IAF  inventory.    The government of India has been dithering over the choice  of  the AJT for more than a decade and efforts by various IAF chiefs  to convince the government to take a quick decision had proved  futile.    The IAF was in dire need of a trainer because of the  difficulties pilots faced while graduating from the subsonic  Kiran trainer to the supersonic aircraft. This transition was  being done on the Hunters but they had now become old.    According to the former deputy chief of air staff, C.V.  Gole,  "the government's perennial excuse for delaying the decision on  the AJT was lack of funds."    While the government remained undecided on such an important  matter, IAF pilots were all the while facing a mismatch between  man and machine, as a pilot took combat training in an aircraft  with old technology, but had to fly a modern fighter like the  Mirage 2000 and Mig-29. This eventually began to take its toll.    Initially, there were four types of AJTs trying for the  attention of the Indian government. These were the British  Aerospace Hawk, the Dassault Breguet-Dornier Alpha, Aeromachhi's  MB-339 and Czechoslovakia's Aero L-39.    After evaluation, the choice narrowed down between the Alpha  and the Hawk. Eventually, the Hawk has emerged victorious.    Explaining why the Alpha was not found suitable, Mr P.  Upendra, MP [,ember of Parliament], said in the Rajya Sabha on  August 27, 1993, that the last model of this aircraft was  produced in 1986.    He said: "All Dassault proposes is to transfer to India its  jigs and tooling equipment, which have been lying idle in France  for years since there is no further market for Alpha jets  anywhere in the world..." Thus the Alpha lost out.    Media reports today speak of the Union cabinet giving the  green signal for the acquisition of 66 British Aerospace Hawks,  expected to cost over Rs 6,000 crores.    The first major Hawk variant was the "50 series" which was  sold to Finland, Kenya and Indonesia. The "50 series" was  succeeded in 1981 by the "60 series" which incorporated changes  in the avionic system. This was the aircraft being considered by  the IAF.    The Hawk-60 with various changes resulted in a 33 percent  payload increase and a 30 percent increase in range. Its  customers include Zimbabwe, Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu  Dhabi and Switzerland.    In 1984 came Hawk-200 which was followed three years later  by  the Hawk 100 which was displayed at Bangalore. The question is  whether the government will now opt for this variant of the Hawk?</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Talks spark 20p rise in Templeton Galbraith shares SHARES IN Templeton Galbraith and Hansberger, the Bermuda-based international fund management company, rose 20p to 309p yesterday following confirmation that it had been approached by various financial managers interested in 'a business combination.' The company provided no details of the talks or of the suitors. However, it is understood that two US financial services companies are engaged in serious talks. Templeton's senior management, who control over 82 per cent of the voting shares, are said to be concerned about protecting the independence of its investment strategy. A statement from the company said: 'All of these (talks) contemplate a continuation of independent operations by the Templeton group with normal service for clients and funds and the same investment personnel, policies and methods.' Templeton is also said to be interested in forming a partnership with a larger firm which could give it access to greater distribution outlets. Sir John Templeton, the founder and chairman, will be 80 in the autumn and is said to be in good health. Templeton manages roughly Dollars 19bn (Pounds 9.9bn) of funds, of which Dollars 12bn is in the form of US-style mutual funds. An additional Dollars 4.6bn are pension fund assets while closed end investment trusts account for Dollars 2.4bn of assets. Its investment style has been to seek international equities with long-term growth prospects.</p>

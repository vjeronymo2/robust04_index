			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> APPROVAL PREDICTED FOR WETLANDS PROJECT  </P> <P> A top Army official who toured the Bolsa Chica Wetlands this week predicted a  quick and smooth review of a long-debated plan for restoration and partial  development of the sensitive coastal area.  </P> <P> The tour of the unincorporated Orange County land near Huntington Beach,  conducted by Col. Charles Thomas, the Army Corps of Engineers' Los Angeles  district commander, officially began the complicated review procedure.  </P> <P> "Typically, this is a controversial process, mainly because you have a  developer that wants to build out the entire property versus conservationists  who don't want any of it developed," Thomas said.  </P> <P> "This is the first time I've seen anyone pull together a coalition involving  (the conflicting interests) that came up with a proposal that makes everybody  happy," Thomas said.  </P> <P> Thomas' comments suggest that, after 15 years of political maneuvering and  bickering over the fate of the 1,635-acre strip of marshland along Pacific  Coast Highway south of Warner Avenue, the planned restoration, which could get  under way as soon as January of 1991, is progressing.  </P> <P> The project, which calls for up to 1,105 acres of wetlands to be restored and  limits residential development to 412 acres, was approved in May by a coalition  representing environmentalists, government and the developer, Signal Landmark.  </P> <P> A group representing those interests will organize in a ceremony Tuesday at the  wetlands. It will serve as a vehicle for community involvement in the project  and monitor its progress.  </P> <P> That group, the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, will be directed by a board made up of  Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, Amigos de Bolsa Chica President  and environmentalist Shirley Dettloff, Signal Landmark President Peter  Denniston, state Lands Commissioner Dan Gorfain and Huntington Beach City  Councilman Peter M. Green.  </P> <P> The ceremony, scheduled for 2 p.m. at a Sea Point Street site overlooking the  Bolsa Chica lowlands, is also scheduled to feature the appointment of Victor  Liepzig, a Huntington Beach biologist and former Amigos de Bolsa Chica  president, as the conservancy's executive director.  </P> <P> Before work can begin on the project, approval must be granted by state and  federal agencies.  </P> <P> Thomas said it is too early to discuss particular issues that the corps will  consider, but he lauded the efforts of the various entities that worked to  forge the development compromise.

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM HIRED TO DESIGN RAIL AND BUS STATION  </P> <P> A Newport Beach architectural firm has been hired to draft plans for converting  the old Santa Fe depot in Claremont into a combined rail and bus station for  commuters.  </P> <P> The $97,000 contract was awarded to Thirtieth Street Architects, which  submitted the lower of two bids on the design phase of the project.  </P> <P> The firm's representatives estimated that the work will be completed by May.  </P> <P> City Councilman Algird G. Leiga said Proposition A money earmarked for the  project would be better used on immediate improvements to public transportation  in the city. The commuter trains that would use the renovated depot are not  expected to run until fall, 1992.  </P> <P> But Mayor Nicholas Presecan said the city must move quickly "so that we won't  be standing at the track without the trains going by."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by newly appointed Minister of </F> International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata with unidentified  correspondents at the prime minister's official residence in  Tokyo -- live]    [Text] I am Eijiro Hata. I was appointed to the post of  minister of international trade and industry. First, I would  like to express my appreciation for the guidance given to me  when I was agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. As you  know, we are in a very severe economic situation and have to  deal with many issues. We need to play a responsible economic  role in the international arena to improve our reliability.  Moreover, we need to deal with other issues as well --  including the issue of economic cooperation between Japan and  the United States, and the issue of easing government  regulations. Now that I have been appointed to the post of  minister of international trade and industry, I will use all my  energy to deal with these issues. While seeking people's  understanding, I will make strenuous efforts to accomplish these  tasks.    [Unidentified reporter] Some people are saying that the new  administration will have difficulties in conducting state  affairs and will be short-lived because it is backed by a  minority ruling coalition. Can you explain what you think of  this situation?    [Hata] I think our major task is to gain support from the  people as we make a series of movements for political reform and  other matters. We need to do that by implementing policies  which will be understood and supported by the people. The  opposition parties, if they deal with various matters in a  gentlemanly manner, will also be able to gain understanding and  support from the people as healthy opposition parties. While  settling these issues, I think we have to build a stable  foundation to enable the new cabinet to fulfill the  responsibilities it is expected to fulfill.    [Unidentified reporter] It seems that the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] is in a chaotic  situation because former MITI Minister Kumagai fired an  influential deputy MITI bureau chief. How are you going to mend  the situation within MITI?    [Hata] I do not know the details. However, the purpose of  personnel reshuffle is, in a way, to renew people's minds. I  think such a purpose is being achieved.</p>

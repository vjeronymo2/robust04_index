			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japan, U.S. to Start Steel Talks: Japan and the United States will begin  negotiations in Tokyo today on a new quota for Japanese steel exports to the  United States, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. Ministry  officials said both sides will present their basic positions and full-scale  talks will start later this month. The session stems from a U.S. decision to  extend the five-year voluntary restraint agreements with major steel producing  countries for 2 1/2 years. The current arrangement, which expires Sept. 30,  limits U.S. steel imports from the European Community, Japan, South Korea and  17 other countries to 18.5% of total domestic consumption. Ministry officials  said Japan will ask the United States not to reduce Japan's quota, now set at a  maximum of 8.5% of U.S. consumption.  </P></p>

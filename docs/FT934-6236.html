			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Italian parties raise hopes of passing budget Italy's main political parties last night appeared to have reached a broad agreement on a formula to ensure parliamentary approval for the 1994 budget without undermining the planned austerity measures. The basis for the agreement was laid in talks yesterday between Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, and his three economic ministers with representatives of the principal parliamentary parties. The prospect of the budget passing through parliament with its principal objectives in tact prompted a recovery of the lira and a modest rise on the Milan stock exchange. In the previous two days the financial markets have been nervous about the prospect of the Ciampi government being able to carry out its pledge to implement a tough budget that reduces the public sector deficit. Mr Ciampi was obliged to call the meetings on Tuesday when it became evident a number of deputies in the Christian and Democrat party were threatening to withdraw their support. Their threat followed the disastrous performance of the four-party ruling coalition in last Sunday's local elections. In the wake of the poll, there have signs of serious strains within the Christian Democrats, the dominant partner of the coalition. Some deputies have openly said it is no longer worthwhile backing unpopular measures, such as pruning the civil service, which they had never fully accepted when first announced two months ago. However, the Christian Democrat leadership has issued a strong call to order. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the party secretary, said he would never be a party to sabotaging the budget. The 1994 budget envisages raising L32,000bn (Pounds 12.9bn), mainly through spending cuts in order to reduce the public sector deficit to 8.7 per cent of GDP. Mr Ciampi has indicated the government is willing to consider small amendments providing the overall framework is unaltered. Yesterday, representatives of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) indicated they would be backing the budget after seeing Mr Ciampi. However, the PDS said it was anxious to ensure the budget was more explicit in providing measures to combat unemployment, with a jobless total close to 11 per cent. As part of yesterday's meetings, the Christian Democrats and PDS were seeking to forge an agreement on avoiding extensive amendments. That could mean the budget passing quickly through parliament. The Christian Democrats are also understood to be demanding that the Northern League makes a formal commitment ot support the budget. Signs of life, page 21</p>

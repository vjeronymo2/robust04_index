			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Slovakia's Foreign  Ministry said today it was concerned about the "unobjective  information" on the meeting of Hungarian elected representatives  in Komarno, south Slovakia, on January 8, spread by the  Hungarian Government Office for Hungarian Ethnic Minorities  Abroad. The ministry handed the protest to the charge  d'affaires of the Hungarian Embassy in Slovakia, Ferenc Boros.    The protest says that the information, destined for foreign  diplomatic missions, is provided "out of context" and is  "unobjective and misleading." Providing false information on  developments in Slovakia by Hungarian authorities does not serve  good neighborly relations, the protest says.    It warns that misleading information on the ongoing process  of the territorial administrative arrangement of Slovakia could  assume the character of interference in Slovakia's internal  affairs.</p>

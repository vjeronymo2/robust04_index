			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Banks set Eurotunnel deadline for dispute BANKERS to Eurotunnel are threatening to withdraw its funding unless the Channel tunnel company reaches a settlement of its longstanding dispute with its building contractors by August. The banks have told Eurotunnel that it must have reached agreement with Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French building consortium, by the time it has spent another Pounds 500m on the project. Eurotunnel is likely to have used this money by late July or August. Eurotunnel is in breach of its covenants and needs to persuade 65 per cent of its bank lenders to waive the relevant covenant by May 29 if it is to continue drawing on loan facilities. As a condition of granting the waiver - which they expect to give - bankers have set the deadline for reaching agreement with TML. It is understood that Sir Alastair Morton, one of the company's joint chairmen, has told bankers that it regards the deadline as 'wholly unrealistic'. However, Eurotunnel yesterday refused to make any comment. Eurotunnel has told the banks that there is little chance of being able to assess the vast amount of financial information relevant to the dispute in the time. Eurotunnel is also concerned that any possible settlement with TML would lead to a change in the basis of the construction contract. This in turn would need the approval of 90 per cent of its 220 banks as measured by the value of their loans - and Eurotunnel is fearful that it would be impossible to get such a majority vote. In other words, Eurotunnel fears that the banks are creating a potentially disastrous financial crisis for the company. Some bankers share this view. However, one of the leading lenders to the group insisted that the deadline for the deal with TML was 'flexible'. The dispute with TML is over responsibility for cost overruns. TML is claiming about Pounds 1.5bn at 1985 prices for this lump sum contract which was originally expected to cost Pounds 620m. Eurotunnel has offered to pay Pounds 1bn, leaving a gap of about Pounds 500m. The company has credit facilities of around Pounds 8bn, but the main lending facility from commercial banks is for Pounds 6.8bn. Of this commercial line, Eurotunnel has already drawn Pounds 4bn.</p>

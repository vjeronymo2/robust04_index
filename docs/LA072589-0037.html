			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEONARD-DURAN BOUT IS EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> A third fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran will be announced  formally at a news conference Wednesday.  </P> <P> The date and site were not known Monday, but the boxers probably will meet in  Las Vegas Nov. 2 or in Atlantic City, N.J., Nov. 30.  </P> <P> "Leonard wants another fight, and Duran's the guy," said a spokesman Monday for  Top Rank, promoter Bob Arum's firm.  </P> <P> Leonard, 33, and Duran, 38, last met in two 1980 fights, when both were  welterweights. On June 20, 1980, Duran won a decision over Leonard in Montreal,  then quit in the eighth round in the famous "No mas" rematch in New Orleans,  Nov. 25, 1980.  </P> <P> Recent speculation was that Leonard's next fight would be against Thomas  Hearns, who fought a 12-round draw with Leonard June 12 at Las Vegas. Leonard  will go into Leonard-Duran III as the WBC's super-middleweight champion, his  fifth title. Duran became a four-time champion when he won the WBC middleweight  title on a 12-round split decision over Iran Barkley Feb. 24 at Atlantic City.  </P></p>

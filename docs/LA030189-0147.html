			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HARDING A STEP CLOSER TO TITLE FIGHT  </P> <P> Unbeaten Australian light-heavyweight boxer Jeff Harding pounded out a  unanimous 10-round decision over American Art Jimmerson today to move a step  closer to a world title fight.  </P> <P> Harding, 23, upped his record to 13-0, including 11 knockouts, by dominating  Jimmerson throughout the one-sided bout. The Australian scored repeatedly with  left jabs and right uppercuts, but Jimmerson stayed on his feet throughout the  fight.  </P> <P> Harding, the Orient and Pacific light-heavyweight champion, is ranked second in  the super-middleweight division by the World Boxing Council and hopes to gain a  world title shot later this year. American Sugar Ray Leonard holds that title.  </P></p>

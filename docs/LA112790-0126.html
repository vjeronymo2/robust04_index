			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Braniff Complaint: Braniff Inc. and its unsecured creditors have filed a  complaint against the bankrupt airline's former management and an adviser,  accusing them of illegally draining cash from the ailing carrier. The complaint  filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court earlier this month seeks $18.5 million in  compensatory and punitive damages, a lawyer representing the creditors said.  The complaint charges that the executives drained more than $6 million from the  ailing Orlando, Fla., firm in part by charging inflated fees in a number of  aircraft transactions between Braniff and its affiliates.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Major business groups  here are trying to entice Korean scientists working abroad,  industry sources said Tuesday.    Yukong Ltd., an affiliate of the Sunkyong Group, recently  ran  an advertisement in a bulletin published by the Association of  Korean Scientists and Technicians in the United States. Yukong  expressed its intention to invite specialists in chemical  engineering, bio- medicine and the environment.    Kumho Co. ran a similar ad in the same bulletin, saying it  hoped to attract scientists with doctorate degrees in mechanical  engineering, computer engineering and polymer science.    Kolon Co. is also seeking several polymer science and  chemical engineering experts while Kia Motors Corp. wants  experts on the environment and safety devices of automobiles.    In an edition of the same bulletin late last year, SKC Co.  sought to attract experts in chemical engineering and material  science while Cheil Foods and Chemicals Co. wanted researchers  in molecular biology and microbiology.    "It was unusual for Korean companies to have direct contacts  with Korean scientists abroad in the past, but now they want to  have direct contacts only after recognizing their names on lists  of scientists' association," an official of the Korean  Federation of Science and Technology Society said.</p>

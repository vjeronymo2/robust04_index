			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKE MICHIGAN SERENADED BY 'SINGING SAND'  </P> <P> The theater is darkened, engulfed in the sound of crashing waves, as the story  of sand dune creation unfolds on screen. First comes formation of the beach --  fore dune, trough, back dune and barrier dune. A fragile environment springs to  life next, grasses at first, followed by woody plants and eventually a forest  of hemlock and sugar maple on the back and barrier dunes.  </P> <P> The theater is part of this 1,054-acre park established in 1967 to protect and  preserve Lake Michigan's 2 1/2-mile stretch of towering sand dunes. The park's  centerpiece is the 13-year-old Genevieve Gillette Nature Center, a $500,000  complex including the Sand Dune Theater dedicated to the interpretation of sand  piles.  </P> <P> "Dunes are home to many unique plants and animals," said Earl Wolf, 37, a park  naturalist here for the last 10 years.  </P> <P> The giant sand piles along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan collectively  represent the world's largest accumulation of sand dunes bordering fresh water.  Michigan, with its unique Sand Dune Protection and Management Statute, has  275,000 acres of sand dunes, 40% in public ownership.  </P> <P> Snow often covers the dunes this time of year and visitors can be seen  navigating the park's 10-mile trail on snow shoes or skis. They are accompanied  by a symphony of chirping birds -- including black cap chickadees,  white-breasted nut hatches, tufted titmice, blue jays, red-bellied woodpeckers  and meadowlarks -- and squirrels who scamper across the snow amid a maze tracks  left by red fox and white-tail deer.  </P> <P> Soon, tiny spring peeper frogs will be peeping robustly as colorful painted  turtles scurry about with spotted salamanders and other wildlife. And as the  snow melts, visitors to the ice-clogged shoreline will experience "singing  sand," a sound heard few places on Earth.  </P> <P> "It's a very special tune played by the sand," said park ranger Elizabeth  Brockwell, 23. "You scoot your feet along the beach and when the right amount  of moisture is present, tiny sand particles scrape against each other and emit  a peculiar musical whistle or squeaking sound."  </P> <P> The center is filled with graphics describing dune formation and growth here  and throughout the world. Exhibits portray plants and animals found in sand  dune ecosystems and a gallery is devoted to works by Jeanne Rockette and other  Michigan sand dune artists.  </P> <P> Visitors, including thousands of schoolchildren, ascend the wooden Dune Climb  Stairway that winds to the top of 220-foot-high Sugar Hill and overlooks  190-foot Mt. Baldy and a breathtaking sweep one of Michigan's most scenic  beaches.  </P> <P> The park is named after the late P. J. (Pete) Hoffmaster, Michigan's first  superintendent of parks; the sand dune museum in honor of Genevieve Gillette,  who died two years ago at 88.  </P> <P> Known as Michigan's "Miss State Park," Gillette was the first woman to receive  a degree in landscape architecture at an American university (Michigan State).  From the 1920s until her death, she was a leader in establishing Michigan's  park system. Gillette wrote Michigan's wilderness bill, was the first president  of Michigan's Parks Assn. and was named to the 12-member Citizen's Advisory  Committee on Recreation and Natural Beauty by President Lyndon B. Johnson in  1966.  </P></p>

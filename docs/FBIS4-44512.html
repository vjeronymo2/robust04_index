			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Gansu Province Higher People's Court Work Report"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During 1993, a total of 73,025  criminal civil, economic, and administrative cases were heard.  This was 18.1 percent more than in 1992. Cases tried numbered  67,473, up 19.5 percent from 1992. These included 7,561 criminal  cases, or 10.4 percent of all cases that the procuratorate  prosecuted. The remaining 89.6 percent of the cases were  accepteed for hearing directly by the courts.  <H5>  I. Strict Punishment According to Law of Offenders Causing </H5> Serious Damage to Public Order for the Safeguarding of Social  Stability    During the year, courts at all levels throughout the  province  continued a policy of working at multiple tasks at the same  time, and working with might and main in light of the province's  public order situation. They persisted in the "severe crackdown"  struggle, severely punishing all kinds of criminal activities  that seriously impair social order. Altogether, the courts heard  8,718 criminal cases of all kinds, 4.2 percent more than in  1992. They tried 8,385 of these cases in which they sentenced  10,128 offenders who had already received due legal process,  38.9 percent of them being sentenced to five years or more in  prison, to life imprisonment, or to death (including commuted  sentences).    (1) Emphasis on Crackdowns Against Major Offenders;  Crackdowns Intensified    Although social order in the province remained basically  stable during 1993, there were numerous problems and the  situation remained serious. Courts at all levels consistently  made crimes that caused serious disruption of social order the  major focus of crackdowns, meting out severe and speedy  punishments according to law. During the year as a whole 4,752  offenders who had caused serious damage to public order were  sentenced after due legal process, 67.8 percent of them being  sentenced to five years or more, to life imprisonment, or to  death (including commuted sentences).    (2) Active Warfare, Concentrating on Both Recurring and  Localized Serious Criminal Activities    Courts at all levels diligently enforced the NPC Standing  Committee's "Decisions on Banning Drugs," and the programs of  the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government in  close coordination with public security and procuratorial  agencies. In July, the courts concentrated forces for a  provincewide battle against drug offenses. The provincial court  issued a special document reiterating the necessity for  enforcing the NPC "Decisions on Prohibition of Drugs," which  clearly provide for conviction and sentencing for the sale of 1  gram or more of heroin. In cases in which less than 1 gram is  sold but the circumstances are serious, criminal responsibility  may also be fixed. During 1993, courts throughout the province  heard 556 drug offense cases meting out sentences in 534 of  them. A total of 558 offenders were sentenced for smuggling,  manufacturing, selling, transporting, or illegally possessing  and illegally growing drugs. Of these, 80.68 percent were  sentenced to five years or more imprisonment, life imprisonment,  and death (including commutation of the death sentence).    People's courts at all levels took active part in the battle  against theft, meting out severe sentences to the ringleaders of  robber gangs, major thieves, habitual offenders, and fugitives.  They also emphasized crackdowns on sellers of stolen goods. The  province's court tried 3,042 thieves. At the same time, the  courts also actively joined the special battle to roundup  "car-jackers and police officers putting up roadblocks to impose  fines and fees on motorists." They also cracked down on the  plundering of ancient tombs, severely sentencing a number of  offenders. In 1993, the provincial court trial committee found  one trial court had given too light sentences; it directed  retrials. Fourteen of the 19 people sentenced to death in the  retrial of 16 cases were mostly "car-jackers and police officer  highway extortionists."    Criminal activities involving the abduction for sale, and  the  kidnapping of women and children, and organizing and forcing  women to become prostitutes are very serious in some parts of  the province. During 1993, people's courts at all levels  diligently enforced the NPC Standing Committee's "Decisions on  Severe Punishment of Offenders Who Abduct and Sell, or Kidnap  Women and Children," and "Decisions on Strict Prohibition of  Prostitution," trying 44 such cases and sentencing 101 offenders.    (3) Active Participation in Comprehensive Control of  Public Order To Reduce and Prevent Crime    First was the use of public trials as part of a widespread  campaign to provide publicity and education about the legal  system; second was emphasis on the omissions of units concerned  found in the handling of cases, making judicial recommendations;  third was adoption of a policy of educating, guiding, and  rescuing offenders who had not yet reached maturity, making  education a part of sentences, thereby combining punishment with  education. Fourth was greater use, according to law, of  probation and public surveillance of offenders whose offenses  were fairly slight as local conditions warranted, relying on  social pressure to effect reform. Fifth was adjudication,  reduction of sentence, or release on parole, according to law,  of offenders sentenced to labor reform who showed evidence of  repentance and intention to change their ways, or who had  performed meritorious deeds.  <H5>  II. Harsh Crackdowns on Serious Economic Crimes; Resolute </H5> Punishment of Graft and Corruption    During 1993, peoples courts at all levels waged more battles  to crack down hard on criminal economic activities, punishing a  number of serious economic criminals. A total of 533 economic  crime cases of various kinds were heard, 298 of them involving  graft and bribe taking. So far 371 offenders have been sentenced  after due process, 34.5 percent of them to five years or more in  prison, life in prison, or death (including those whose death  sentence was commuted). Economic losses amounting to 7,280,600  yuan were recovered for the state and collectives.    In July 1993, the provincial court convened a meeting of  medium level court judges throughout the province at which, on  instructions from the supreme court, it emphasized the need to  use sentences in large and important cases as an object lesson  in continuing the battle against economic crimes. Law courts at  all levels responded conscientiously, sentencing 129 offenders  who had committed economic crimes involving 10,000 yuan or more,  22 of whom had committed crimes involving 100,000 yuan or more,  and seven of whom had committed crimes involving 200,000 yuan or  more. Six of the offenders sentenced were county (or department)  level cadres. Courts at all levels made crackdowns on graft,  acceptance of bribes, and the diversion of public funds to  authorized uses by personnel working in party and government  leadership organs, judicial units, administrative enforcement  units, and economic control units the emphasis of strict  punishment according to law.    In hearing economic crime cases, people's courts at all  levels made sure to move large and important cases forward on  the docket, delve into them, and hear them promptly. In hearing  cases, they adhered to two basic principles: one was to make  sure of the facts and evidence, positively not issuing any  sentences in cases where the facts were unclear or the evidence  insufficient. The second was not to wrangle about non-essentials  when the basic facts and basic evidence was in hand. They  adhered to the principle of "the need for firmness first,  prudence second, and handling matters correctly," strictly  distinguishing between guilt and no guilt.    Although definite accomplishments have been made in the  battle to crack down on economic offenses, some problems also  exist, the main one of which is that an insufficient number of  economic crime cases are being brought to court. During 1993,  courts throughout the province received 489 new economic crimes  cases, 15.4 percent fewer than during the previous year. This  situation does not match the actual economic crimes situation  and the intense reaction of the public to economic crimes. The  problem of imposing fines instead of meting out punishments has  still not been solved. In some cases, the sentences are still  too light. If the battle to crack down on economic crimes is to  be intensified, matters will have to be handled strictly  according to law, these problems diligently resolved.  <H5>  III. Regulation of Economic Relationships According to Law </H5> To Promote Development of the Market Economy    During 1993, people courts at all levels throughout the  province further intensified their economic trial work,  regulated economic relationships according to law, ensured  smooth implementation of national macroeconomic regulation and  control measures, and strove to intensify economic system reform  and service to economic development. The number of cases  involving economic disputes of all kinds that were heard  increased tremendously, breaking the 10,000 mark to reach 11,900  cases. This was a 128.5 percent increase over the previous year.  The courts tried 10,749 cases, the amount of money involved in  the cases tried totaling 797.52 million yuan.    (1) Greater Hearings of Economic Dispute Cases of All  Kinds To Promote the Building of the Market Economy System and  Maintain the Economic Order Following Supreme People's  Court plans to ensure smooth implementation of macroeconomic  regulation and control through trial work, courts at all levels  throughout the province held more hearings of financial dispute  cases. They put special effort into trials for the purpose of  clearing up call loans and recovering overdue credit. The  resolved payment default and settlement disputes for  construction units and construction engineering departments  amounting to 27,715,100 yuan, thereby improving construction  fund returns. They heard 5,260 cases involving procurement and  marketing, property leasing, processing contract, technical  cooperation, and patent and trademark disputes, liquidating or  recovering 171.75 billion yuan in delinquent payments for goods  and services, thereby safeguarding the legal property rights and  interests of enterprises and legitimate competition in routine  business activities and market exchange. They tried 323 cases  involving enterprise contracting, leasing, partnership,  bankruptcy, mergers, and economic equity rights disputes,  including 12 enterprise bankruptcy cases. They heard 108  economic dispute cases stemming from rural reform and  development, most of them rural contract dispute cases, thereby  steadying responsibility systems, notably the family  output-related contact responsibility system to advance rural  economic development.    (2) Reform and Perfection of the Economic Judicature  System Thereby Further Improving Case Handling Quality and  Efficiency The system of placing the burden of proof on  those making allegations continue to be applied in the hearing  of economic dispute cases. In cases in which the facts were  clear and evidence ample, a direct court hearing and speedy  solution was tried out. In cases in which the facts and the  circumstances were uncomplicated, when simple procedures in  accordance with law could be applied, they were applied, and  where oversight procedures were required, they were also  applied. They improved the mediation of economic dispute cases,  the number of cases mediated for the year increasing 72.46  percent over 1992. Courts at all levels paid particularly close  attention to trials of major and important economic dispute  cases.    (3) Improved Service Awareness, Broadening the Service  Realm. The first step taken in improving service awareness  and broadening the service realm was the establishment of a  mediation center for economic disputes for the purpose of  mediating disputes before they went to trial. During 1993, such  centers heard 4,343 economic dispute cases involving a total of  294.34 million yuan, 3,867 of which were successfully mediated.  In August, the provincial court also set up a center to mediate  real estate disputes, which heard 63 cases by the end of the  year, successfully mediating 37 of them involving 7.15 million  yuan. Second was closely linking legal services with case  handling in an effort to extend services. Courts throughout the  province have set up with 1,179 enterprises a system in which  the enterprises designate one or more personnel contact points  on economic judicial matters, 1,269 such contact personnel  having been designated. Some courts also set up enforcement  centers, or some administrative enforcement departments have set  up enforcement courts or enforcement offices to provide special  services. Very many courts also provided training classes that  provide information about the law to persons in charge of  enterprises and administrative personnel. These methods have  yielded very good social benefits for economic construction.  <H5>  IV. Good Performance of Civil Affairs and Administrative </H5> Trials To Safeguard the Legal Rights and Interests of the  Citizens and Legal Entities    Courts at all levels throughout the province have strictly  enforced civil law and policies, actively hearing all sorts of  civil cases. During 1993, they heard 33,372 civil cases, 10.54  percent more than in 1992, and they adjudicated 31,771 of them  for a 95.2 percent adjudication rate. Civil cases account for  more than 60 percent of all cases straight in the courts.  Marriage cases, debt cases, and compensation cases account for a  respective 66.15, 15.42, and 11.6 percent of civil cases. They  occupy first, second, and third place, respectively, among civil  cases. Therefore, people's courts at all levels pay close  attention to the hearing of marriage, family, and inheritance  cases. In the division of property for inheritance, in caring  for women and children, and in the apportionment of housing, the  courts made sure to protect the rights of women, children, the  aged, and those unable to make a living. Second was the hearing  of 6,883 cases involving indebtedness, houses, and labor  disputes, and payment of compensation for damages, 4,823 of  which were adjudicated. This was 22.8 percent more than in 1992.  Third was the adjudication according to law of 2,883 personal  injury compensation cases, 52 reputation and image rights cases,  and 10 intellectual property rights cases. This adjudication  promptly resolved conflicts, thereby advancing popular unity for  substantial effect on society.    Courts at all levels throughout society persisted in the  protection of the legal rights and interests according to law of  citizens, juridical entities, and other organization. They also  adhered to the principle of safeguarding and supervising  administrative organs exercise of functions according to law,  hearing all sorts of administrative cases. They particularly  emphasized large and important cases having a major social  effect and about which there were strong feelings from all  quarters to promote the development of administrative trial  work. During 1993, the province's courts heard and tried 403  administrative cases, 2 percent more than in 1992, successfully  adjudicating 390 of them. Of the administrative cases  successfully adjudicated, the decisions of administrative organs  were upheld in 32.05 percent, overturned in 15.38 percent,  partially overturned in 3.59 percent, appeal rejected in 6.15  percent, and the original complain dismissed in 35.64 percent.

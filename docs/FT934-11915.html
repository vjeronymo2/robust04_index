			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / State to take up Treuhand task THE German government will take control of about 100 enterprises which the Treuhand privatisation agency will be unable to sell by the end of 1994 when its mandate expires, officials confirmed yesterday. At the same time, a new bill will be presented to the Bundestag to extend the life of the Treuhand, whose main task after 1994 will be to complete the privatisation of land, monitor sales contracts, and manage real estate. The plan for the enterprises, which was announced by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, represents a radical shift in policy away from rapid privatisation to a much slower process based on restructuring and better management. The plan, which will be debated by the Bundestag over coming weeks, coincides with growing criticism from the governments of the five eastern states that the Treuhand could have done more to prevent closure and protect jobs. The agency has sold all but 1,392 of its 13,200 enterprises since it was set up in July 1990. Sales have generated more than DM180bn (Pounds 73bn) of committed investment and guaranteed 1.45m jobs. But nearly 3,000 enterprises have been closed at the cost of 313,000 jobs, and a further 2m jobs have been lost through privatisation. Finance officials yesterday would not say which enterprises would come under government control.  However, the giant railway carriage and locomotive maker Deutsche Waggon Bau, machine tool manufacturer Sket, and the Buna chemical works could be on the list. Denying that efforts to find solutions to enterprises employing more than 200,000 people had been influenced by next year's federal and state elections, a finance ministry official said: 'We just need more time to restructure them, prepare them for privatisation, and then find a buyer.' The restructuring phase, which will start in 1995 and end in 2000, will cost DM45bn. Part of the cost will be financed by the federal budget.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's trade  prospects have darkened with exports to China dropping last  month for the first time since ties were normalized, the Bank of  Korea [BOK] said Tuesday.    Exports to China totaled 1.76 billion U.S. dollars in the  first four months, up just 11.5 percent from 1.58 billion  dollars a year earlier.    The January-April growth is dwarfed by the 175.2-percent  surge recorded in the same period last year.    Exports to the vast market grew 28.6 percent in January,  20.5  percent in February and 10.6 percent in March, then slipped 2.3  percent in April.    Exports to China, a major contributor to Korea's trade  balance, have slowed despite the continued popularity of most  items because of a drop in two mainstays, cars and steel.    In the first four months of last year, 294.8 million dollars  worth of cars were sold to China, 227 times more than a year  earlier, but the volume plunged 94 percent to 17.8 million  dollars worth this year.    With steel exports sinking 27.1 percent to 341.4 million  dollars from 468.1 million dollars, the share of the two items  in shipments to China fell to 20.4 percent from last year's 48.2  percent.    Beijing's restrictions on imports to promote its own car  industry since late last year explain the decrease in auto  exports while steel shipments dropped due to a lack of stock for  exports because of high demand at home and an easing of the  construction boom in China.    Exports to China have surged since relations were normalized  in August 1992, to the point of posting 94.1-percent growth last  year.    However, Korea can no longer expect such growth due to  sluggish exports of automobiles and steel products, BOK  officials said.    As exports of other items are still going strong, posting  growth of 71.5 percent in this period, shipments to China are  expected to account for around 6 percent of total exports, close  to last year's 6.3 percent.</p>

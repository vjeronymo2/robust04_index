			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Computer bug alert for 14m credit card accounts NATIONAL Westminster is alert-ing its credit card holders to problems it has had with the com-puter system which processes 14m card accounts, more than half of all of those in Britain. The bank is also considering possible recourse against First Data Resources, the operator of the computer system, for mistakes caused by the glitch. The cards affected include those of Mastercard, Visa and Access offered by NatWest, Midland, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB, which are processed through a computer centre with sites in Southend and Basildon. At least several hundred people are thought to have had problems using their cards because of a change in the computer software which took place in mid-July. First Data Resources and the banks yesterday played down the extent of the errors, which they said had been corrected. NatWest's warning to its credit card holders comes in a letter which also apologises for the problems. They include incorrect charges for late payment and interest, delays in direct debits, fees for cash advances which did not take place, incorrect amounts debited and incorrect transaction dates on statements. Several people have also reported that retailers have been unable to obtain authorisation to accept their credit cards when there has been no apparent reason why they should be refused. Mr Gary Tobin, senior vice-president of communications and government affairs at First Data Corporation, the parent of First Data Resources, said there had been some 'fine-tuning' of the computer system between July 17 and July 23 when the software was changed and tested. But he said all the problems had been overcome, and that a few errors were inevitable on a system processing so many accounts during an exercise described by one of his colleagues as 'the biggest (computer software) conversion in history'. The change from the old system operated by Signet, a company which First Data acquired last year, was designed to improve security, offer more services and operate more quickly. None of the banks would give full details on the number of customers affected, although Lloyds Bank said it had written two weeks ago to 40 card customers who had had more than their monthly payments directly debited from their bank accounts.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol [no date as received] -- The Sevastopol  branch of the Ukraine Officers Union held a meeting on 14 April  to voice a resolute protest against "the attempts by the Russian  naval command and the Black Sea Fleet to further destabilize the  situation and increase the confrontation with the armed forces  of Ukraine." The adopted statement says that the media, spurred  on by the Black Sea Fleet press center, are spreading slander  about the so-called "Odessa incident." Facts show that the  Black Sea Fleet command is constantly involving the officers and  personnel of the fleet in various political actions and  encouraging their active participation in anti-Ukrainian  political parties and movements.    The meeting pointed out that Black Sea Fleet Commander  Eduard  Baltin is continuing to grossly violate the laws of Ukraine, and  appealed to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia for his  dismissal. They also urged everybody who valued peace to resist  provocations by destructive forces.</p>

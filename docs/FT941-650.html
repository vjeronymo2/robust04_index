			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: RJB may bid for all five British Coal regions RJB Mining said it would consider making bids for each of the five regions of British Coal in the forthcoming privatisation, as it yesterday revealed a 10 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.2m. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said his company would look at all the regions, although it was impossible to say whether it would bid for all of them until it saw what was being offered and the terms attached to the packages. The government is expected to outline the packages within the next few months. RJB is one of the frontrunners among UK companies and analysts believe it is likely to bid for a majority and possibly all five of the regions. RJB is already leasing two former British Coal mines, Clipstone, in Nottinghamshire, and Rossington in Yorkshire, and may secure terms for another one or two. Mr Budge said the company would also consider bids for three other pits closed by British Coal, which are to be offered for sale to the private sector alongside the five main packages. In the year to December 31, RJB increased sales to Pounds 74.76m (Pounds 73.85m). It is recommending a final dividend of 7p to take the total for the year to 12p, covered 1.9 times by earnings per share of 22.7p. Mr Budge said the company was in a strong position to grow regardless of whether it was successful in its bids for British Coal regions. The two mines already leased from British Coal were premium pits and the rest of the business, which is mostly opencast mining, was going in line with, or better than, the company predicted when it was floated on the market last year. COMMENT These are heady days for private sector coal mining as it prepares to take over an industry which it believes has enormous potential for making money as soon as the state loosens its grip on it at privatisation. In common with companies like Coal Investments and NSM, RJB has enjoyed a significant re-evaluation of its shares in recent months. After yesterday's 8p rise to 378p, RJB's shares are trading on a prospective p/e ratio of 17, assuming it makes Pounds 14.5m this year. Such a rating may seem high, especially for a company whose gearing would need to rise to about 60 per cent from its current 30 per cent to fund a third leased mine. However, the gearing will fall again next year as the company feels the full benefits of recent acquisitions and leasing deals. The real question for the company is how far it should go in buying the rest of British Coal in a falling and uncertain market. Its growth strategy is not without risks and RJB holds out the promise of much more than it has so far achieved. Nonetheless, it has yet to put a foot wrong since its flotation and it is as well equipped as any UK company to make a go of the industry's privatisation.</p>

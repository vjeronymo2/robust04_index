Figueroa met the Bolivian foreign minister, who considered  the need for an outlet to the sea an important matter for his  government. The Chilean reply was that it was not timely to  discuss the issue. Figueroa, however, said there is goodwill  toward Bolivia:    [Begin recording] Chile wishes to maintain very good  relations with Bolivia, seek ways to reach an understanding on  political, economic, cultural, tourism, investment, and  infrastructure developments, and find peaceful solutions to  border issues. That is, we can agree on many possibilities in  our relations with Bolivia. [end recording]    Concerning the upcoming vote for the OAS secretary general  scheduled to take place in Washington this week, Figueroa  pointed out that the Chilean Government fully supports the Costa  Rican candidate, former Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. He said  Chile honors its commitments, and recalled that in 1992  President Aylwin and [Costa Rican President] Calderon made this  commitment.    Figueroa also reported that the Rio Group member countries  are arranging a future meeting with the EU where Chile will  propose a new political relation between Europe and Latin  America.</p>

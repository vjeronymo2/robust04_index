			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KKGO FORMAT REVISION  </P> <P> The conversion of KKGO to a classical format will have no impact on the jazz  listener; KKGO ceased to be a jazz station some time ago.  </P> <P> One waits in vain for Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, Lester Young, etc., only to  have to wade through endless recordings of synthesizers and of saxophone  players all playing the same solos.  </P> <P> KLON is the only jazz radio station in the L.A. area, and it's a blessing for  lovers of the art.  </P> <P> DAVID M. SHERR  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASEY MAY GET FRONT-OFFICE JOB WITH CLIPPERS  </P> <P> Don Casey will return from New Jersey today without getting the job to coach at  Rider College but apparently in position to land a spot with the Clippers,  albeit not the one he wants.  </P> <P> Officials at Rider, the 3,000-enrollment Division I school in Lawrenceville,  N.J., have scheduled a news conference for today and are expected to name Kevin  Bannon of Trenton State in New Jersey as the new coach. He replaces John  Carpenter, who retired after 23 years but will remain as athletic director.  </P> <P> The Broncos went 5-23 last season while playing in the East Coast Conference.  Bob Dukiet, the former coach at Marquette, had also interviewed for the spot.  </P> <P> Casey, the Clippers' interim coach since Jan. 19, withdrew from consideration  for the Rider job and will meet with team officials early next week. No member  of Clipper management will comment publicly, but most seem to agree that he  will be offered some position, even if not head coach, his first preference.  </P> <P> There is a possibility that a front-office spot will be created for Casey that  will keep him involved in the team's day-to-day operations.

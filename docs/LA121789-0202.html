			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WYCHE FINED $3,000 FOR KEEPING LOCKER ROOM CLOSED  </P> <P> The NFL fined Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche $3,000 for barring reporters  from the Bengals' dressing room after last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks,  Wyche said Saturday.  </P> <P> The National Football League announced Friday that Wyche had been fined for  violating league media access policy, but it did not disclose the amount of the  fine.  </P> <P> Wyche disclosed the amount of the fine while attending a charity fund-raiser.  He said the NFL should donate his fine to charity.  </P> <P> "The money should go to help somebody else, not just to pad the coffers of the  NFL," Wyche said. "I really don't know where the money goes, but wherever it  goes, I'm going to ask that it goes to charity."  </P> <P> League rules prohibit the team from paying Wyche's fine. But Wyche said he  wouldn't be surprised if some of his players kick in contributions.  </P> <P> The league's media policy states that team locker rooms are to be opened after  a brief waiting period, usually five to 10 minutes. But after Sunday's 24-17  loss, Wyche closed the locker room to the media.  </P></p>

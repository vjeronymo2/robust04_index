			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Letter: Justice from colleagues on fair committee Sir, We are saddened by your report 'United front falls apart - Susan Moore finds discord at the Grosvenor House Fair' (June 13). Mr Kenneth Snowman received complete justice from his colleagues on the executive committee of the Grosvenor House Antiques Fair concerning his company's Franco-Burgundian pendant. Any exhibitor who is dissatisfied with the decision of a specialist committee which has rejected an artefact can have the right of appeal to the executive committee of the fair. This procedure was meticulously adhered to, at his request, and a judgment was made in favour of the artefact being allowed into the fair. This is not a unique reversal of a decision. The fact that the pendant later won the 'Artefact of the year' award at the fair should surely be matter of additional satisfaction to Mr Snowman. We regret his decision that 'Wartski's will never exhibit again', but this pre-supposes that the organisers will decide to exercise their prerogative by inviting him. Olga Polizzi, and Raymond O'Shea, co-chairmen of the Grosvenor House Antiques Fair, and the following of the executive committee: William Agnew, Konrad Bernheimer, Christopher Clarke, Elaine Dean, Nicholas Fowle, Roger Keverne, Charles Lee, George Levy, Baden Marston, Nicolas Norton, Kate Trevelyan, Alison Vaissiere, Stewart Whittington, Johnny Van Haeften Grosvenor House, London</p>

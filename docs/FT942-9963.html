			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / France threatens to pull out Bosnia troops Foreign ministers from the US, Russia and the European Union will meet in Geneva today in a desperate effort to prevent a serious escalation of the war in Bosnia. The European and US policies have been increasingly divergent at a time when Croat, Moslem and Serb forces, which appeared close to a settlement last month, are turning back from the negotiating table to the battlefield. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has disturbed US officials with talk of imposing a settlement on Bosnia. The sense that France, along with other countries with troops in the region, is losing its patience was heightened by Mr Juppe's threat to withdraw French troops from the UN peacekeeping operation. Mr Juppe warned that France already viewed its position in the United Nations force in Bosnia as impossible, and would have to pull its 6,000 soldiers out if there were no 'swift diplomatic breakthrough'. 'I think that people should realise that certain troop-contributing countries, like France, will not be able to wait for months and months, because we are in an impossible situation,' he said. A similar mood of frustrution prevailed in Washington, where the Clinton administration came under increasing domestic pressure yesterday to arm the Bosnian Moslems. The US Senate debated a resolution calling for a unilateral lifting of the UN embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia, which has been more disadvantaged by the ban than the other republics of the former Yugoslavia. Other countries with significant numbers of troops in the region, such as Britain, would find it difficult to stay in the area were the French to pull out. However, a senior G7 official said that unilateral French action was unlikely and that any troop pull-out would involve consultation with UN partners. Mr Juppe insisted that there was no serious rift between the American and French positions. He said the Geneva talks offered an opportunity for the contact group countries to say clearly what they want in Bosnia and to increase pressure on the warring parties. 'It's not a question of imposing on the parties a peace plan that they don't want. The question is whether we are ready to exert pressure on the parties to accept a reasonable plan,' Mr Juppe said. France has put forward a 'non-paper' for the Geneva meeting which proposes that the contact group should demand an immediate ceasefire, reaffirm the existence of Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent state and recognise the reality that it can only exist as a confederation of different communities. The US has been unwilling to press the Bosnian government to accept a territorial division that it believes to be unjust, but Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, told Mr Juppe the US backed a division giving 51 per cent to the Moslems and Croats, and the remainder to the Serbs. That ratio came close to winning acceptance before the siege of Gorazde torpedoed peace talks, but the Serbs have now reasserted their claim to the 70 per cent they hold, while Moslem and Croat negotiators claim 58 per cent.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kmart plans shake-up after 25% profit dip Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday reported a 25 per cent fall in earnings for the second quarter and said it was close to announcing plans for a big restructuring. The plans, expected to be announced in the next 30 days, will include fresh proposals for the future of the group's specialty retailing operations and may also embrace a strategy to restore profitable growth to its ailing discount store business. At the beginning of June, dissident institutional investors delivered a humiliating blow to Kmart's management by voting down its plans to create new shares tied to the performance of the specialty retailing subsidiaries. Kmart had planned to sell up to 30 per cent of these shares and use the proceeds to help fund the refurbishment of its ageing discount stores. Investors rejected the plans because they believed Kmart should sell the specialty retailing business outright and devote its energies to revitalising the discount stores, which are losing customers to Kmart's bigger and more successful rival, Wal-Mart Stores. Yesterday the continuing difficulties of the discount stores were illustrated when Kmart reported a decline in group profits from the already depressed level of Dollars 125m in the comparable period to Dollars 94m in the quarter to July, excluding the discontinued PACE Membership Warehouse and PayLess Drug Store businesses. However, the figures were not as bad as the market had expected, and the shares edged up Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 17 1/8 . Sales were up 4.6 per cent at Dollars 8.83bn but earnings per share on continuing operations were down from 27 cents to 20 cents. For the first six months, sales rose 5.4 per cent to Dollars 16.64bn, net income fell from Dollars 183m to Dollars 112m excluding discontinued operations and exceptional items, and earnings per share fell from 39 cents to 24 cents on the same basis. Mr Joseph Antonini said: 'Performance in our core US Kmart division is below our expectations.' The gross margin for the quarter fell from 25.2 per cent to 24.8 per cent, mainly because sales were lower than expected on fixed occupancy costs and because lower margin grocery products took a higher proportion of sales from the new Super Kmart Centers. Mr Antonini said 'aggressive actions' were being taken to improve sales and profitability for the rest of the year.</p>

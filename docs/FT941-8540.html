			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / European Equity Markets tumble A worldwide fall-off in bond markets prompted a tumble in European equity markets yesterday. The FT-SE 100 index, which covers the UK's most highly valued companies, fell 42.7, or 1.25 per cent, to 3,382.6. By the end of after-hours trading, UK stocks were 27 points below their Friday close, indicating more pressure on the market on Monday. However, senior market-makers stressed that the volume of business was lower than it had been in recent weeks and there was very little panic-selling. The German market lost most of the gains it had chalked up following a rate cut on Thursday and the French CAC 40 index ended off 29.40 at 2,251.78.

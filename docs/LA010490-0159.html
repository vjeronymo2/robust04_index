			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L AGENCY TO SELL REAL ESTATE ASSETS AT 'MEASURED PACE'  </P> <P> The sale of billions of dollars in real estate from defunct savings and loan  associations may take several years, preventing any dumping of properties that  might depress local markets, federal officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The government will dispose of real estate assets "at a measured pace," said  Daniel P. Kearney, president of the federal Oversight Board, which on Wednesday  issued its strategic plan for handling the financial cleanup of hundreds of  crippled S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> Kearney's plan provides an operating blueprint for the Resolution Trust Corp.,  which controls 281 ailing S&amp;Ls with $104 billion in assets. The Oversight  Board sets policy for the RTC, an agency created last year to manage asset  sales of failed thrifts. About 25% of the assets are in Texas, which suffered  the largest number of S&amp;L failures.  </P> <P> Kearney's statements represented the government's first formal acknowledgement  of the pace at which it will sell real estate assets. Real estate experts and  others nationwide have expressed concerns that the government, anxious to  dispose of the assets as quickly as possible, might go too fast and  dramatically disturb already depressed local real estate markets.  </P> <P> The assets available for sale "range from cash to mortgage-backed securities to  houses to Pizza Hut parlors," Kearney said. Mortgage loans and securities  backed by mortgages can be sold relatively quickly to investors because the  market for these products is "extremely large," he said.  </P> <P> But the real estate -- office buildings, single-family homes, shopping centers  and stores, condominiums and unimproved land -- may take much longer even if  the government moves "with all deliberate speed," he said.  </P> <P> Legal problems connected to the real estate "will necessitate a lengthy period  of real estate asset sales stretching over several years," Kearney said. "When  the RTC has an asset ready for sale, it should offer it for sale -- at a  measured pace."  </P> <P> The RTC issued its first inventory list Tuesday, a massive compilation of  30,000 properties covering nearly 3,000 pages.  </P> <P> Real estate assets make up about $45 billion to $50 billion of the assets at  the 281 S&amp;Ls under government control. An additional 200 institutions are  having financial difficulties and are likely targets for government takeover.  This would add billions of dollars more to the tally of real estate properties  that will eventually be sold by the government.  </P> <P> "The task facing the RTC for asset disposition is unprecedented in magnitude  and complexity," Kearney noted. The tally of 30,000 pieces of real estate "does  not take into account mortgage loans, servicing rights or securities," he said.  </P> <P> The strategic plan directs the RTC to "rely heavily on the private sector" in  disposing of financial and real estate assets, the Oversight Board said in its  summary description of the plan. Real estate agents, auctioneers and other  business persons would be involved in helping dispose of assets.  </P> <P> "Contractors should be given incentives to generate the best possible return on  assets, but RTC should develop measures that discourage contractors from  speculating by holding properties too long," the Oversight Board said.  </P> <P> The strategic plan says the government should move quickly to stem the  continuing financial losses at the S&amp;Ls under its control. The RTC was  given a deadline of Jan. 15 to develop a system to measure "the rate of  deterioration of each insolvent institution and the financial risk each poses  to the government," the Oversight Board said.  </P> <P> Then the RTC should develop standards to decide which institutions to target  for immediate shut-down or sale. The RTC has $50 billion to dispose of failed  institutions, either by paying off depositors, whose accounts are insured up to  $100,000, or finding outside investors to buy the institutions.  </P> <P> Under the strategic plan, the RTC would be permitted to offer capital to some  prospective buyers to finance their purchases of defunct S&amp;Ls. This drew  sharp criticism from Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of a special House  Banking Committee task force dealing with oversight of the S&amp;L cleanup.  </P> <P> The sale of S&amp;Ls "should be subject to a market test," with prospective  buyers arranging their own financing, Vento said. The RTC "should not gamble  with the taxpayers' money," Vento said. He also expressed concern that the  Oversight Board did not provide details of policies dealing with possible  conflicts of interests among persons dealing with the RTC.  </P></p>

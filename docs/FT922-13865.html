			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Norway may get gas sales boost SEVERAL European buyers of natural gas from Norway's giant Troll field have agreed to a novel adjustment in the terms of their purchase contracts which could increase significantly sales revenue for Europe's biggest gas supplier, reports Karen Fossli from Brussels Norway this year will export more than 28bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas to France, Germany, Holland, and Belgium. It is under pressure from buyers to boost sales further and exports will expand to around 4- bcm of gas in 1994 under the Troll supply accord Under a new clause in the Troll supply contract - a so-called price review clause - both the buyer or seller may demand prices per cubic metre of gas be renegotiated at any given point in time to better reflect prevailing market conditions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet </F> Golhan by NOKTA correspondent Nedret Ersanel; place and date not  given -- punctuation as published]    [Excerpts] [Ersanel] As far as your ministry is concerned,  the question of military conscription is the subject that has  most attracted the attention of the media. In fact, the  argument on the situation of the students who attend the public  education institutions continues. Have you begun to draft those  students? They claim that, compared with the students who attend  the other universities, they have been unjustly treated.    [Golhan] The laws have allowed a certain degree of freedom  to  us. A provision to postpone the conscription of the students  who attend the public education institutions does not exist.  Those who are not full-time students do not have the right to  postpone their conscription. However, the Ministry of National  Defense, considering the fact that a need for additional troops  did not exist during the initial years of the AOF, allowed them  to benefit from the rights of the students in the other  universities. Actually, that was the right thing to do.  However, the number of troops decreased in time. The number of  those who avoided conscription and the number of absentees  totaled 250,000 men. The argument that was made in the media on  the matter in November 1993 provided for the conscription of  30,000 men. We needed just under 210,000 men in February 1994.    We do not wish to draft the young men who attend the public  education institutions when those who have avoided conscription  continue to apply for military service. However, we have  carried out some research that has revealed that 82,000 of the  students who attend the public education institution failed to  pass their classes in two years. That cannot be allowed. We  have refrained from drafting them during the present call-up  period. However, we may do so in August and November, starting  with those who have repeatedly failed. The university colleges  do not attach importance to the failure of their students  because they have a budget to consider. We have not drafted  those students at the present time, that is, except for those  who have applied for military service. [passage omitted]    [Ersanel] Has there been a change in Turkey's "defense  concept?"    [Golhan] Turkey's neighbors are arming themselves.  Furthermore, they are trying to find and acquire nuclear arms.  In view of that, we have to maintain the Turkish Armed Forces'  strength at a certain level. Negative developments are taking  place on each side of Turkey. We maintain the same priorities  in our defense concept. I do not wish to mention the names of  the countries that are trying to acquire nuclear arms. Turkey's  southern neighbors are making an effort in that direction,  however. None of them has acquired a nuclear weapon so far.  However, there are those who have long-range missiles that can  reach Ankara. So, we have to take measures against that state  of affairs.    [Ersanel] Can you explain your viewpoint?    [Golhan] We cannot lag behind them. That is all I want to  say. Those who covet our territory will adopt an aggressive  policy if they realize that we do not have the necessary arms to  deter an aggression. Let me say the following: Turkey is the  strongest country in the region from the military point of view.  What I have said does not apply to the question of missiles.  We do not behave contrary to UN resolutions.    [Ersanel] Germany has again adopted a strong approach on the  use of the arms it supplied to Turkey in southeastern  Anatolia... Can you comment on that matter?    [Golhan] The problem is as follows: We have acquired arms  and military equipment from Russia. They are very similar to  those we have acquired from Germany. That has confused the  foreign journalists who visited that region. They created an  uproar by saying that the arms and military equipment they saw  were supplied to Turkey by Germany. We received a letter from  the German minister of defense today (Friday) [15 April]. He  only thanked us and said nothing else. We will acquire arms  from Germany within the framework of the agreement on  cooperation in the defense industry domain. He informed us that  he will support Turkey. We also received a similar message from  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Nevertheless, he has made  several statements accusing Turkey of using the arms it has  acquired from Germany. His statements have been prompted by the  large number of Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] sympathizers in  Germany, PKK's friendly relations with the press organs in that  country, and other possible material gains. Of course, we also  have to consider the elections that will be held in Germany in  the near future.    The German officials accused us in the past of using the  arms  we acquire from Germany against the Kurdish people. They have  now demanded that we must not "use those arms" against the PKK  either. Alright, let us not do so... We have others that we can  use. We can use the arms we have acquired from the United  States and Russia.    [Ersanel] The United States has recently mentioned the  concept of a "political solution" to the Kurdish problem in  various meetings, particularly in those which have been held in  Turkey... You have attended those meetings. In fact, you held  talks with the U.S. officials on the matter last Thursday. Can  you explain what the United States and the Western countries  mean by their reference to a "political solution?"    [Golhan] We heard the former People's Labor Party deputies  call for a "political and democratic solution" two years ago.  They then joined the Democratic Party. What do they mean by  that solution? They mean to say that the "military forces cannot  impose a solution." Then they should explain the solution they  call for.... Unfortunately, such a solution does not exist....  The meaning behind the call for a political solution, in other  words, the meaning behind the solution called for by our  colleagues, is the establishment of either a separate and  independent Kurdish state or the establishment of a federation  in Turkey. In fact, that is also the meaning behind the "hints"  that have been made by various officials. Yes, the meaning can  be stretched right up to that point. However, how can that be  justified when free elections are held in Turkey and people are  free to trade, do business, and settle and work in any part of  the country they like? Has anyone gotten in trouble for  speaking Kurdish?    [Ersanel] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman  also mentioned the concept of a political solution in the  past.... That means that what the U.S. officials have in mind  is no different from what you have explained.    [Golhan] Yes, what they mean is no different from what I  have  outlined. I met U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles  Freeman on Thursday. He said: "The PKK is definitely a  terrorist organization. Europe will eventually realize that."    [Ersanel] Has he explained what a political solution means?    [Golhan] No. The objective behind the concept of a political  solution is the establishment of a federation.... That is my  sincere viewpoint.</p>

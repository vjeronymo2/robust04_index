			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY  </P> <P> Your editorial attacks the Capital Research Center for its study of corporate  contributions to groups which seek to undermine the system of free enterprise  that has given America peace, prosperity and freedom. As the author of the  preface to that book, I feel compelled to respond.  </P> <P> Your editorial attacks this book as an "exercise of the radical right," of  which I am presumably a representative. I don't know what you mean by "radical"  in this context. My views on the role of corporations in society and on many  other subjects are well known, and mainstream enough that my book, "A Time for  Truth," spent the better part of a year on the best-seller lists. Can a defense  of individual liberty and our free enterprise system be called extreme? I don't  think so, and I doubt the people who read my book -- or indeed most other  Americans -- consider my views very radical.  </P> <P> I believe that many business leaders are quite clearly feeding the mouth that  bites them. They are financing advocacy groups which see free enterprise as the  enemy of the people, which believe that government can make decisions better  than individuals, and which think that "group rights" count for more than the  rights of the individual.  </P> <P> I have recommended for years that corporations wishing to promote peace, a  clean environment and sound race relations, for instance, steer their gifts to  organizations whose work in these fields is consistent with both the  aspirations of our people and the survival of our free enterprise system. To  declaim such views as representative of the "radical right" simply shows the  ease and abandon with which your editorial writers label people whose views  they happen to dislike.  </P> <P> WILLIAM E.

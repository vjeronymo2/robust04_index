			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Berlin approves bank merger THE Berlin city government gave its approval yesterday to the creation of Germany's sixth or seventh largest bank by the merger of Berliner Bank, in which the city holds 56 per cent, and three other banks in the German capital. The merged banks would have a DM130bn (Dollars 80.7bn) balance sheet total and DM5bn capitalisation. Berliner Bank had long urged the merger with Landesbank Berlin and Berliner Pfandbrief-Bank, but the city, anxious to protect its stake in Berliner Bank, delayed the move. Mr Norbert Meisner, Berlin's economics secretary, said earlier that the merger would create a bank large enough to provide the increased investment needs in Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg state. It would help reduce the burden on the city budget when Bonn is cutting its aid to Berlin. Berliner Bank has benefited from expansion into east Berlin and Brandenburg since 1990 and is the only sizeable German bank to have kept its headquarters in the city.</p>

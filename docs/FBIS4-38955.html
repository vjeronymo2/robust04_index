			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the Crimean parliament excluded from its  agenda the issue on giving the force of law to the presidential  decrees on the issues which were not as yet regulated by  legislation. A total of 51 deputies voted for this decision  (the total number of deputies in the Crimean parliament is 98).    Earlier, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov had proposed that  the Crimean parliament give him additional powers. Meshkov said  his proposals concerning force of law to be given to the  presidential decrees was of great importance for Crimea which  would have more possibilities for quick reaction to the changing  situation in Crimea and around it.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Inland Steel on track for Dollars 200m profits Inland Steel is on track to lift its operating profits by Dollars 200m this year over the Dollars 28m it reported in 1993, Mr Robert Darnall, chairman, indicated yesterday, writes Richard Waters. His comment came as the US integrated steel producer reported net earnings for the third quarter of Dollars 30.7m on sales of Dollars 1.13bn, up from Dollars 17m on sales of Dollars 972m the year before, a period in which it benefited from a Dollars 11m tax credit. Inland's revival has come on the back of rising prices and a shift in its product mix towards higher-value steel. Steel shipments this year are running at 6 per cent above 1993's level, while revenues are up 15 per cent. Earnings per share of 54 cents in the quarter, up from 25 cents a year before, were in line with market expectations.</p>

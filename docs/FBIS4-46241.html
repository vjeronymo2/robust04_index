			<p>BFN     [Text] The current Shining Path [SL] leadership is headed  by several regional leaders, among them Oscar Ramirez Durand,  aka "Feliciano," who has great influence but not absolute power,  according to Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate].    This information was granted by Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, aka  "Albino," who was arrested a few days ago in Huacho together  with other SL members whose identities have still not been  revealed. "Albino," according to the Dincote spokesman, also  disclosed that he had belonged to that elite SL group.    Tenorio Barbaran asserted that "Feliciano" is not the only  leader of this unruly faction, but it has still not been  determined who the other leaders of the group's so-called  "collegiate presidency" are.    This SL faction is against the peace agreement upheld by  Abimael Guzman Reinoso.    "Albino" also admitted having been a leader of the so-called  North Zone Committee (Barranca-Huacho) and the intellectual  author of attacks perpetrated by the SL in the zone between the  years 1990- 93.    After being named a member of the SL Central Committee, he  was invited to the capital to plan the attacks they would  perpetrate. At that time he appeared in a video, together with  Guzman, dancing Zorba the Greek.    Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, in his capacity as SL chief in the  northern zone, shared the leadership with Daniel Angel Ramirez  Martel, aka "Oscar," who was arrested last year together with  another nine terrorists of the zone.    Between the years 1990 and 1993 they perpetrated some 30  selective murders against mayors of different towns, policemen,  civilians, an Air Force general, and three Japanese engineers.  Among their victims are Air Force General Julian Olivera Angeles  and the engineer Javier Puigross Planas.</p>

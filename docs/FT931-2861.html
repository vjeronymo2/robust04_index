			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Market expects rate cut THE DOLLAR failed to break through the DM1.6670 barrier yesterday, even though dealers continued to assume that the Bundesbank would cut its officially posted interest rates at its council meeting today, writes James Blitz. The US currency operated in a tight range between DM1.6615 and DM1.6670 throughout European trading, continuing the pattern of recent days. It closed at DM1.6640, virtually unchanged on the day. In New York it slipped to end at DM1.6616. Economic indicators in the US continued to emerge in the dollar's favour. US consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in February, raising suggestions that the Federal Reserve might contemplate tightening policy as the country climbs out of recession. Perceptions about the Bundesbank's monetary policy also continued to be 'dollar-positive'. The German money market is clearly expecting a 50 basis-point cut in the discount rate when the Bundesbank's policy-making central council meets today. A reduction in short-term German rates would further narrow the gains that investors receive for holding D-Marks. The conclusion of a Solidarity Pact between the German government and opposition at the weekend was seen as one reason why the Bundesbank might ease policy today. A dealer also suggested that the Bundesbank would be under strong pressure to widen the difference between the discount rate floor and the rate at which funds are offered to commercial banks on a weekly basis. That differential is currently only 25 basis points, and this provides the central bank with insufficient flexibility in its weekly operations. There are reasons, too, to be cautious about a cut today. The terms of the Solidarity Pact do not legislate for a reduction in the German budget deficit over the next two years, and some dealers suggested yesterday that the Bundesbank had been trying to play down the implications of the agreement. The Bundesbank's announcement that it would not be holding a press conference after its meeting also caused a few jitters, as this is thought to indicate that nothing of significance will be forthcoming. However, the timetable and decisions of recent meetings have had a highly flexible air. Perceptions of an easing in German rates helped sterling to make new gains against the D-Mark, although the main impetus here was Tuesday's UK Budget statement. Mr Norman Lamont's claim that the current level of interest rates was compatible with the government's objectives for inflation and growth has given a firm underpinning to the pound, which finished at DM2.4150, up 1 1/4 pfennigs. Sterling briefly traded above the DM2.42 level. However, a London based analyst claimed that the pound was being bought in short term speculative trading rather than longer term institutional activity.</p>

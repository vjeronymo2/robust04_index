			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Clothing industry in US barter deal The seasons, fickle consumers and changing fashions can all leave clothing manufacturers and retailers with unsold stock, Motoko Rich writes. Traditionally, excess stock is discounted heavily or sold to liquidators for as low as 15 per cent of wholesale value. But yesterday, Apparel Marketing Services, the trading subsidiary of the British Knitting and Clothing Export Council, signed an agreement with Atwood Richards, a US corporate barter company, to offer the council's 1,200 members an opportunity to dispose of assets for better value. Atwood Richards, a private company, has been operating since 1958. It trades in 28 countries and opened its UK office in London last year. 'Where companies can no longer realise the cash or are facing a loss, we will buy their stock at close to wholesale value and exchange it for essential, pre-budgeted goods and services,' said Mr Trevor Edwards, managing director of Atwood Richards in London. The company acts as a principal - as opposed to a broker - and buys products with trade credits, which are redeemable for specified goods and services. These are obtained when Atwood sells a client's excess products, usually outside its cash market.</p>

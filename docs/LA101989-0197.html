			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JERUE PLANS TO CULMINATE COMEBACK AGAINST SAINTS  </P> <P> Mark Jerue's football obituary was written long ago, yet he refused to let it  go to publication.  </P> <P> Jerue has had a nice six-year career with the Rams. He was a starter, at times,  at inside linebacker and made 109 tackles in 1986. He could have let it go at  that, but didn't.  </P> <P> Last February, Dr. Clarence Shields opened Jerue's left knee for the third time  in two years, and what he did inside with his scalpel was meant to get Jerue  walking again, not playing again.  </P> <P> There were four holes the size of quarters, where cartilage had worn through to  the bone.  </P> <P> Explained Jerue: "They drill little holes into the bone and hope that the bone  marrow comes back up and fills in like putty."  </P> <P> Shields told Jerue his chances of playing again were less than 50-50.  </P> <P> In May, Jerue still couldn't run 10 yards.  </P> <P> Wednesday, the Rams moved Jerue to the active roster, and he's expected to play  Sunday against the New Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> Some feel what happened in between defies medical reason and can best be  described as a rehabilitation for the ages.  </P> <P> "You know," Coach John Robinson said, "they don't play music. It's not  uplifting like it is in the movies. It's hard, it's dirty, it's ugly and it's  slow. This guy's a little bit of a nut -- I don't say that critically at all.  It's very complimentary to how hard he's willing to work for it."  </P> <P> Jerue, working closely with Ram strength trainer Garrett Giemont, set out last  spring to confound the experts.  </P> <P> "I told him from the start of this rehab that he will come back and play,"  Giemont said, "that we are not going to be denied. I told him there will come a  day when he will look at me and say, 'I'm tired of this, I'm ready to play.'  Basically, he did exactly that a couple of weeks ago on the football field, and  that was a nice day."  </P> <P> Jerue, who could play for as many as 20 snaps against the Saints, joins a  depleted Ram linebacking unit that has indefinitely lost Fred Strickland to a  severe ankle sprain.  </P> <P> Jerue, a workout warrior in healthy times, even doubted whether a comeback was  possible.  </P> <P> "I never really knew if I'd make it or not, but I never thought about giving  up," he said. "I wasn't going to quit. I've just got to thank Gie(mont) again  for telling me that it can be done."  </P> <P> Giemont said Jerue's work ethic was the difference between playing again and  retirement.  </P> <P> "I keep attendance records in the off-seasons, and Mark is always right there,"  Giemont said. "As a matter of fact, if I had to break it down, Mark Jerue in  the past five years has had the greatest attendance in the off-season, of just  work, period."  </P> <P> No doubt, it has paid off.  </P> <P> "The story's not complete until I can put a few games together," Jerue  cautioned.  </P> <P> Yet, he went through Wednesday's practice with no pain. Defensive coordinator  Fritz Shurmur says Jerue has lost none of his quickness.  </P> <P> "It's miraculous that he's back and doing what he's doing, no question about  that," Shurmur said. "I think that's a tribute to him, Giemont and a couple of  guys saying the odds are long . . . but we're going to beat it. And they did."  </P> <P> Jerue was more encouraged by Wednesday's full-contact workout.  </P> <P> "I'd take today for the rest of the year if I could keep going like that," he  said.  </P> <P> How has the shock of Monday night's last-minute loss to Buffalo affected the  Rams' younger players? Was it as tough to swallow as, say, UCLA losing to USC?  </P> <P> No way, a former Bruin said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "That's a heart-breaking feeling, one of those end-of-the year feelings,"  cornerback Darryl Henley said of losing to the Trojans last season. "This loss  hurts, and it was a long plane ride, but we still got 10 games left. You almost  have to automatically rebound right away."  </P> <P> Henley said the young Rams have responded well.  </P> <P> "You just wanna kind of follow the older guys," he said. "And you usually  respond with the same mood, the same tone as they respond. And they've been  pretty good about it."  </P> <P> Tight end Pete Holohan is one who's trying to lead by example, though he admits  it hasn't been easy.  </P> <P> "It kind of leaves a sick feeling in your stomach the whole way home," Holohan  said of the loss. "You feel rotten. I'm sure it's dramatic for the young guys  in the sense that it just goes to show in this league, one minute you're ahead  and the next minute you're not, so you'd better not take anything for granted.  You'd just better go out there and play."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> To make room for Mark Jerue on the roster, the team placed rookie cornerback  Alfred Jackson on injured reserve with a groin injury. The Rams also exercised  their option on rookie linebacker Brian Smith, who has been on injured reserve  with a wrist injury. Under new rules, Smith had to be either activated, waived  or returned to practice this week. Smith, the second-round pick from Auburn,  will remain on IR and resume practicing, forcing the team to cut one member of  its developmental squad. . . . Flipper Anderson is averaging 32.8 yards per  reception, 10 more yards per catch than league runner-up Mervyn Fernandez of  the Raiders. How remarkable is the statistic? "Thirty-two yards per catch?"  Coach John Robinson said. "That's further than our net punting is." He's right.  Punter Dale Hatcher is averaging 31.4 net yards per punt. In fact, Anderson's  average is better than 10 net punting averages around the league. . . . As of  Wednesday evening, about 5,000 tickets remained for Sunday's game against New  Orleans at Anaheim Stadium. In order for the local television blackout to be  lifted, the game must sell out by 1 p.m. today. . . . More on Jerue: He's had  three operations on the left knee, two during the 1987 season. He started the  first 12 games at inside linebacker last season before the pain finally forced  him out of the lineup. . . . Further X-rays of Fred Strickland's left ankle  showed no break, though he was walking on crutches Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The government  instructed its overseas missions Friday to pay extra attention  to ensuring the safety of Korean residents and expatriates  abroad lest Pyongyang harm them in retaliation for Seoul's  decision to give protection to North Korean loggers fleeing  Siberian camps.    The Stalinist regime could harm North Korean escapees or  even  South Korean tourists in Russia to retaliate for Seoul's  decision to resettle willing loggers in the South, a Foreign  Ministry official said.    The South Korean Embassy in Moscow and other overseas  missions were instructed to protect all Koreans abroad, the  official said.</p>

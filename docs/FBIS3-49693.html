"Though we are advanced in some respects..., these  considerations are outdated," he says. "The potential economic  success of the Czech Republic itself... would not guarantee our  place in Europe and its security structures. There will be  interest in our country only if we are full-fledged partners  regarding responsibility towards Europe, i.e. how we work for  the stabilization of the Central European region and for  strengthening and expanding democracy eastward."    Dienstbier says that "Americans, NATO, the European  Community  ... have many times indicated this. The Visegrad Group -- the  Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia -- is no invention  of the West... It is the interest of the West in guaranteed  Central European security, which is identical with our  interest," he says.    "Conditions in Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary are comparable  with ours. These countries have identical integration goals and  very similar interests," Dienstbier says. In this context, he  describes the Czech Government's attitude as "arrogant and  mistaken. Do we really not need allies and friends?" he asks.    Of the "Partnership for Peace" program, Dienstbier says that  it is an "expression of NATO's unpreparedness for a liberal  transformation. However, NATO is well aware of the fact that it  cannot stay in its current form. Now it is up to us what we do  about the program. We must not allow it to become a palliative  or a 'waiting room' used by the West while it waits to see what  happens in Russia," Dienstbier says.    "The project (partnership) has advantages with which it  stands up to certain realistic criticism," he stresses and adds  that "it provides equal changes for all. None of the countries  can speak about discrimination or a new curtain falling. It is  up to each individual state when it creates the necessary  political, economic, and military prerequisites for its  integration (into international structures)," the former federal  foreign minister says.    "Nor is it possible to isolate Russia or the Ukraine. Their  incorporation into the democratic world is of key importance for  European security," he stresses, adding that "on the other hand,  however, it is impossible to give in to remnants of imperial  thinking."    Dienstbier believes that the shortest and easiest way of  joining NATO requires the Czech Republic's political and  economic stability, "our readiness to defend ourselves and be  partners in the joint defense of the democratic world. Finally,  we must prove that we are capable of being an active stabilizing  factor in Central Europe," Dienstbier says.</p>

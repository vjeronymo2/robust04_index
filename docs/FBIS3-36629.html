			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "Moscow Wants Impartial </F> Investigation"]    [Excerpts] The Russian Foreign Ministry has demanded an  impartial investigation of the facts surrounding the explosion  at the market in Sarajevo, which accounted for the lives of  around 70 people, and the publication of its results. The  Foreign Ministry statement, published Sunday, expresses anger at  the monstrous crime against civilians and also contains a call  for the culprits, whoever they might be, to be severely punished.    The Russian side's position remains unchanged, a Foreign  Ministry spokesman said -- a solution to the Bosnian problem  must be sought by peaceful, political means. The attempts to  wreck the peace settlement process that are currently being made  by gunmen on various sides could lead to disaster. Air strikes  against Bosnia, in his opinion, can only result in the sides'  taking a harder line, and every effort must be made toavoid this  "last resort." [passage omitted]    According to observers, the incident could not only provoke  a  hasty decision by NATO to strike at Bosnian Serb positions  around Sarajevo but could also greatly worsen the situation in  the city itself. Sarajevo radio is already urging Muslims to  "unsheathe their knives and deal with the Serbs and Croats  living in the city." Clearly, those who are responsible for the  explosion were hoping not least to radicalize the thinking of  the Muslim population of Sarajevo, which lately has been  increasingly blaming the current Sarajevo authorities for its  ills.</p>

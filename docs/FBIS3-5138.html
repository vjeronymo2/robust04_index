			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy today  pointed out that the U.S. revival of the Super 301 trade  provision conflicts [ogunnanun kosirago] with the Uruguay Round  spirit and expressed concern that the U.S. action may hamper  [chohae] the newly established world free trade order.    Urging the United States to exercise control in invoking the  Super 301 clause of its own volition [chauijogin supo 301  paltongul chaje], Han Yong-su, director of the ministry's Trade  Cooperation Division, said: I do not think the U.S. action will  immediately effect ROK-U.S. trade relations fundamentally  [kunbonjogin] because ROK-U.S. trade is currently fairly  [pigyojok] balanced and because the two countries are headed  towards resolving matters of mutual interest through  consultation channels.    Director Han said: If the United States takes action  regarding the ROK, we will solve problems that arise from U.S.  actions according to dispute-settlement procedures of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade  Organization.    He also said: The government will utilize various channels  to prevent incorrect or false information on the ROK from making  its way into the annual U.S. report on each country's trade  barriers. At the same time, it will support active dialogue  between ROK and U.S. businessmen through ROK-U.S. industrial  cooperation channels in nine areas which include the computer  and semiconductor sectors.</p>

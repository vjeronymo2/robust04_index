			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Sotheby's static at half year SOTHEBY'S Holdings yesterday announced a marginal improvement in pre-tax profits, from Dollars 17.7m to Dollars 18.4m (Pounds 9.6m), for the second quarter to end-June. Turnover of the auction house, which is controlled by the Detroit-based Taubman family and is quoted in London and New York, rose from Dollars 76.1m to Dollars 77.9m in the period. Earnings came out at 20 cents per share against 19 cents last time and the second quarter dividend is a same-again 15 cents. This brings pre-tax profits for the half-year to Dollars 9.1m against Dollars 9.12m from revenues up from Dollars 108.5m to Dollars 114.3m. The company said that the modest increase in sales during the first half, combined with the improvement in consignment activity, led it to believe a gradual recovery in the art auction business was under way.</p>

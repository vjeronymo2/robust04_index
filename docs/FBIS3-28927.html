			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The yen's sharp rise on  foreign exchange markets stems from Japan's current account  surplus, and Japan may have to tolerate it, a government source  said Monday [14 February].    The yen shot up by over 2 yen against the U.S. dollar in  early Tokyo interbank trading Monday in reaction to the failure  of talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President  Bill Clinton on Friday to resolve a trade dispute.    The source said on condition of anonymity, "Foreign exchange  rates reflect the balance of current account of a country.  Japan, with this much surplus, may have to bear the yen's  advance."</p>

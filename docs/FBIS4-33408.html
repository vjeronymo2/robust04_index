			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 6 Jun (AFP) -- Robert Malval, the  resigning Haitian prime minister (who is recognized by the  international community), said on Monday that "the (Haitian)  people would be more willing to welcome the interventionists  than to fight them." Malval added that in the event  international sanctions against Haiti fail, "the armed option is  being considered more all the time."    Speaking over the local private Radio Metropole, Malval  referred to a foreign military invasion, mainly a U.S. invasion,  and said that "if an army cannot count on the support of the  people, it will not be able to resist, regardless of how  powerful it may be." Malval added that Army Chief General Raoul  Cedras "is reaching the end of his forces." Malval also  predicted "very difficult days" for Haitians, and he wished the  Army would prevent this for the country.    Meanwhile on Monday, the Haitian Interior Ministry and  National Defense (not recognized by the international community)  issued a communique announcing that "any attack (from abroad)  will provoke a reply, even a suicidal reply." "The army has  received instructions "to defend Haitian territory," the  communique pointed out while protesting over "the violation of  Haitian waters by foreign warships." The communique concludes  by asking the people to remain "calm and alert in the face of  provocations."    Meanwhile, the Ministry of Information, Culture, and  Coordination announced it had "taken note" of statements made on  Friday by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, president in exile, to THE NEW  YORK TIMES in favor of a foreign military intervention after he  spoke out in favor of total embargo. The government communique  requests there be a legal proceedings case against "all citizens  who try, through their actions or words, to promote the invasion  of our country."    President Aristide clarified his statements, denying he had  asked for a military intervention in Haiti, which is prohibited  by the constitution.    Finally, a presidential communique signed by Emile  Jonassaint  (not recognized by the international community) announced the  establishment of a national crisis commission led by the economy  and finance minister "to administer the embargo and to guarantee  the rights of the people to food and work."</p>

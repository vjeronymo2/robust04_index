			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAVALIERS STAY IN DIVISION RACE BY EDGING 76ERS  </P> <P> The Detroit Pistons have not yet wrapped up the Central Division title or  secured the best overall record in the NBA.  </P> <P> The Cleveland Cavaliers, after a 92-90 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers  Tuesday night at Richfield, Ohio, are hanging on in the division race, but only  barely.  </P> <P> Larry Nance, after resting his aching legs for a week, came back strong to  score 20 points and make the key defensive play in the stretch to lead  Cleveland.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers had wasted a 13-point, third-quarter lead and the teams were  tied, 88-88, with two minutes remaining. Nance deflected a Philadelphia pass to  Ron Harper, who drove to the basket for the layup that put Cleveland in front  to stay.  </P> <P> With six games remaining, the Cavaliers trail the Pistons by 2 1/2 games.  However, two of the Cavaliers' remaining games are against the Pistons. The  first is tonight at Auburn Hills, Mich.  </P> <P> The 76ers are hoping to avoid playing the Pistons in the opening round of the  playoffs. If they had pulled this one out, they would just about have achieved  that goal. If the 76ers finish ahead of Boston and get the seventh playoff  spot, they won't play the division winner. Now, the 76ers are just 2 1/2 games  ahead of the Celtics.  </P> <P> However, the Celtics, 9-28 on the road, play four of their last seven away from  home, while the 76ers play four of their six at home.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers won because they kept the ball away from Charles Barkley, who was  magnificent. In 46 minutes, he scored 23 points, had 15 rebounds, stole the  ball twice and had five assists. He made 11 shots, but was able to get only 15  attempts.  </P> <P> "They did a great defensive job on me," Barkley said. "They were double-teaming  me, and I didn't get the shots down the stretch."  </P> <P> Milwaukee 125, New Jersey 93 -- The Bucks are bidding for fourth place in the  East, which would give them the home-court edge in the opening best-of-five  playoff series.  </P> <P> Two spurts broke the game open at Milwaukee. The Bucks went on a 20-9 run in  the last five minutes of the first half, then opened the third quarter with a  19-9 run.  </P> <P> The Nets, who battled the Celtics all the way Monday night only to lose in the  closing seconds, wore out after about 18 minutes.  </P> <P> The Bucks (47-28) must finish ahead of Atlanta (47-29) and Chicago (45-30) to  finish fourth.  </P> <P> Houston 108, Indiana 99 -- Mike Woodson, who had started all but one game this  season before this one at Houston, came off the bench to sink seven consecutive  shots in the first quarter and put the Rockets in command early.  </P> <P> Coach Don Chaney had felt that Woodson's legs were getting tired, so he gave  him two days off, then brought him in off the bench.  </P> <P> Houston forward Buck Johnson held Indiana star Chuck Person to just 10 points.  </P> <P> Golden State 114, Miami 98 -- It's hard to get up for a team as weak as Miami,  and the Warriors struggled a bit at Oakland, making 20 turnovers.  </P> <P> But Chris Mullin and Terry Teagle scored enough to win the sloppily played  game. Mullin made eight of 15 shots and wound up with 25 points. Teagle came  off the bench to score 24 points. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

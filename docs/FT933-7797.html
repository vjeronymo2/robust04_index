			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Swithland to seek costs from Hoskins SWITHLAND Estates, a private company run by Mr Adam Page, former chairman of Midsummer Leisure, is to seek 'substantial costs' from Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer. The move follows eight months of abortive negotiations on a deal to inject three of Swithland's Fatty Arbuckle theme bars into Hoskins in return for 41 per cent of the USM-quoted brewer's equity. Mr Page said yesterday that Hoskins had ended the negotiations without notice last Friday. Mr Robert Hoar, a Hoskins director, had notified him that the company had begun negotiations on a proposal from a third party. In a statement on Monday, Mr Barrie Hoar, Hoskins' chairman, said that negotiations with Swithland had been 'terminated for a variety of reasons beyond the control of the company.' However, Mr Page said: 'We do not believe there were any valid reasons for not completing the transaction. We complied with all the requirements to enable the deal to proceed - and we still believe it would be in the best interests of Hoskins' shareholders.' He claimed to have reached agreement to buy the Hoar family's 30 per cent share-holding only the day before the negotiations were ended.</p>

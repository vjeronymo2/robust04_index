			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Italian local vote may point to shape of political alliances MUNICIPAL and regional elections on Sunday, involving nearly a quarter to the Italian electorate, promise to provide the first clues to the new shape of political alliances, Robert Graham writes from Rome. The elections involve 10.5m voters asked to elect 1,230 municipal councils, six provincial administrations and one regional council. Local results in Italy have closely mirrored those of general elections. For the first time, the electorate will be voting directly for mayors, there will be only one polling day instead of the usual two. The introduction of direct elections for mayors has completely changed the nature of the municipal contests, forcing political parties to forge broad alliances to be sure of a reasonable chance of winning. The mayors must obtain a majority of the vote to win the first round but, because most contests are at least three-cornered, even the greater use of electoral alliances means that many municipalities will see a run-off on June 20. The main interest has focused on the outcome of the contests in the two big northern industrial cities of Milan and Turin. The latest opinion polls say voters are likely to protest strongly against the misuse of municipal authority which has been exposed by the recent corruption scandals. The three largest cities involved in the elections on Sunday - Catania, Milan and Turin - are being run by commissioners because the political parties cannot find stable alliances to rule. In Milan, the mayoral front-runner is Mr Nando Dallo Chiesa, candidate of The Network (La Rete), the leftist movement for clean government backed by a broad group of left-wing parties, including the two sectors of the former communist party and the Greens. A similar alliance could ensure The Network candidate wins in Turin. The Christian Democrats and Socialists look set to be hammered in the north of Italy.</p>

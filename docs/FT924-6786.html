			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Rumours lift Rinascente shares RINASCENTE, Italy's largest retailing group, has seen its shares jump more than 120 per cent since the beginning of October as a result of persistent rumours of an imminent sale of Fiat's controlling stake in the company. Milan bourse operators are convinced that Fiat is preparing to sell either to Metro, the big German retailer, or to Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest which controls Standa, the rival Italian chain. The latter has denied the existence of a deal but this has not prevented Rinascente shares rising from L3,600 to as high as L8,450 in under six weeks. Yesterday they quoted at L8,380. Fiat has made no secret it is looking at ways of raising cash and reducing non-core businesses to fund heavy capital spending over the next decade in the automotive sector. Rinascente was founded in 1917. Control was sold by Fiat to the Cabassi group in the 1960s. Fiat reacquired 51 per cent in 1984. With half-year turnover of L2,235bn (Dollars 1.6bn), Rinascente is a useful source of cash flow to Fiat. However, Rinascente requires at least L1,170bn to be invested by 1996 in new malls and hypermarkets to bring Italy closer to the European norm in modern retailing. Only 35 per cent of Italian food sales are through super/hypermarkets, less than half the level of France. Expansion has been largely financed by the sale of older properties but with property prices slipping and the market depressed, it is increasingly difficult to fund investment from such a source. Prior to speculation about a disposal by Fiat, Rinascente's ordinary shares were capitalised at L587bn, while the savings and privileged shares had a combined capitalisation of L189bn.</p>

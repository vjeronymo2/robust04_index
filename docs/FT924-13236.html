			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Glavunion notes issue blazes trail for Czechs GLAVUNION, a joint venture between a Czech glassmaker and Glaverbel of Belgium, has issued the first medium-term corporate bonds in Czechoslovakia, paving the way for the development of a new debt market in the country. The bonds, worth Kcs200m (Dollars 7.3m) and maturing in 1998, have a coupon of 13.5 per cent. They are expected to be traded on the interim secondary market. Credit Suisse First Boston in Prague, which lead-managed the issue, has placed the bonds with a selection of non-bank financial institutions and corporate investors. So far, the secondary market has only intermittently traded state bonds and debt issued by Komercni Banka and General Credit Bank, of Bratislava, two leading commercial banks in the Czech and Slovak republics. The Glavunion bond issue is also expected to be one of the first securities listed on the Prague Stock Exchange, due to open this year. The bonds will pave the way for other local corporate borrowers to raise money domestically outside the bank market. Local enterprises have been hard-pressed to find affordable funds to finance investment programmes as commercial banks are unwilling to lend money for more than one year.</p>

The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam  val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from Mashhad,  Kermanshah, Chenaran and Tarqobeh spoke as pre-agenda speakers.    Then the Majles took up its agenda. We direct the attention  of our respected readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Qodsiyeh Seyyedi 'Alavi, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>   The security the women in our country have under the shelter  of Islam is unequaled in the world.    The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Ms. Seyyed 'Alavi, deputy from the Mashhad electoral  district. During her speech she offered congratulations on the  birth anniversary of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him) and  also the birth anniversary of His Holiness 'Ali (peace be upon  him) in the lunar month of Rajab to the followers of those great  one. Continuing, she said: Now, as we are about to compile and  approve the Second Five-Year Plan in the Majles, it is  appropriate, in view of the guidance from the exalted leader,  with a proper view to the future and a study of the nation's  existing resources, that we move in such a way that the real  principles of the Islamic revolution will not be crushed under  the wheels of economics, especially by the extravagance and  dissipation of the executive officials and their programs.    Continuing, the speaker said: Explicit attention has been  given in the Constitution to women and their value and dignity.  Now that the respected government has presented the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill and the Second Five-Year  Plan to the Majles, it is the duty of the deputies, and  especially the specialist commissions, to consider the guidance  from the exalted leader. When compiling and allocating the  budget, they must keep in mind the articles in the Constitution  that pertain specifically to women and the family, especially  with regard to the law enacted by the Majles concerning women  and children without guardians. This year a suitable budget for  that must definitely be provided.    In view of the measures taken so far to achieve social  justice, reduce poverty and alleviate deprivation, the  government, and especially the judiciary, must take serious  steps to redistribute wealth and to stop parasitical behavior  and hoarding. Continuing, the deputy from Mashhad said: Another  issue is the evolution and growth of the Muslim woman since the  revolution. With regard to the claims being made in the world in  an attempt to damage the revolution, especially by the so-called  human rights organizations concerning the lack of freedom or the  failure to observe the rights of women in Iran, it must be said  that world imperialism and these organizations who work  hand-in-hand with America have not understood the issue. The  real issue is the the evolution, which has taken place since the  revolution thanks to the blood of the martyrs, the guidance from  the Imam of the nation, God's mercy be upon him, and the real  and righteous positions taken by the exalted leader in Iran's  revolutionary society, especially among Muslim women.    She discussed the high divorce and abortion figures in the  Western nations, as well as the lack of security for women in  Western societies, figures that increase every year. She added:  This summary shows the image of women in some Western nations  and their behavior and how they are dealt with. Now let these  people making false claims about human rights and this Mr.  Galindopol come and make a realistic study without dependence on  the world's empty world-devouring powers. Our respected women  have great dignity and high standing in Iran's Islamic society.    If they do not regard as a violation of human rights the  implementation of divine limits and commands, Almighty God's  commands in the Glorious Koran and the sacred religious law,  which penalize deviant individuals to prevent the growth of  social corruption, the security the women in our country have  under the shelter of Islam is unequalled in the world. If some  of our women are subject to a small amount of oppression by the  men, this has nothing to do with Islam.    She also called on the Ministry of Guidance and the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs to use the relevant cultural centers and  embassies to acquaint the world with the true Islamic  revolutionary image of the sacrificing and loyal Muslim women.    Continuing, Seyyedi 'Alavi said: Now, as the rights and  honor  of women are being trampled in many societies and her only  salvation is to turn to the orthodoxy of Islam, let us permit  the Muslim Iranian women to remain a complete and proper model  and example for the world. Let us not permit an incorrect  interpretation of Islam to be made in some of the statements  that come from the sacred Majles.    Abuses of the terms "human rights" and "women's rights" to  settle international and purely political accounts are taking  place in circumstances where the disgraced supporters of human  rights have fallen silent on the crimes committed in Bosnia and  Herzegovina, Israel, and other parts of the world. This has  brought about aversion and repulsion in every nation. It is  incumbent upon Muslim women to try to foster their own  intellectual growth and productivity and to achieve their rights  through greater understanding and awareness, and to make it  possible for themselves to participate more in society while  strengthening the position of families and family ties.    Continuing, she asked the officials in the judiciary to  implement Article 49 of the Constitution and to cut off the  leeches and economic terrorists and to punish them. She also  asked the Medical System Organization to exercise diligent  supervision over the writing of doctor and clinic prescriptions  and signs, and to aggressively prevent the writing of sometimes  false propaganda which misleads patients, using the necessary  guidelines.    In conclusion the deputy from Mashhad added: Some of the  things discussed by some of the brothers are not worthy of the  Majles, which is at the head of the government.    It is necessary in many cases to observe international and  social concerns, although we are all Muslims and we also accept  Islamic regulations and laws. However, each one is situated in  spacial and temporal circumstances. Issues related to corruption  in society and the cultural invasion cannot be studied and  reasoned about solely from the point of view of multiple spouses  and temporary marriage. In a society where many people are  unable to marry once, how can multiple spouses be the solution  to the above problems?    In conclusion, she added: If we are Muslims, let us take as  our example His Holiness Mohammad (peace be upon him), who did  not take another wife as long as Her Holiness Khadijeh was  alive, and Imam 'Ali (peace be upon him), who did not take  another spouse as long as Her Holiness Faseleh was alive, and  who truly regarded his spouse as his friend, companion and  comrade-in-arms.  <H5>  Akhtar Rokhshandeh, Deputy From Kermanshah </H5>   The best way to fight the enemy cultural invasion is to keep  the Islamic veil on our women.    The second pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Ms. Rokhshandeh, deputy from Kermanshah. During her  speech she offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of  His Holiness 'Ali (peace be upon him). She said: Using  comprehensive and future-oriented policies, one can stand up to  the cultural invasion and American imperialism. If this policy  is based as much as possible on a deep understanding of the  history of the culture of traditions and national alertness in  the country, it will be very important and much more valuable.  Preservation of the Islamic veil for Muslim women, which  bespeaks the high position of the powerful culture of the women  in our country, is the best way to fight the imperialist  cultural invasion. The culture of American imperialism is  incapable of understanding the concepts of the Islamic  revolution. It creates war in the name of peace. In the name of  knowledge it spreads ignorance and unawareness. It fights  religious activities in the name of religion. We must fight the  policies of the culture of imperialism using the weapon of  enjoining good and prohibiting evil.    Continuing, she discussed Salman Rushdie's meeting with the  American president. She said: America must realize that nothing  will be achieved in doing this other than provoking disgust in  most Muslims and affirming their determination to carry out the  order from our late Imam, may God have mercy on him, to execute  Salman Rushdie.    Continuing, the deputy from Kermanshah said: Unfortunately,  because of the imposed war the government has not invested in  the western region, especially the province of Kermanshah, which  has been ignored to a great extent. As a result, the youth of  this province are suffering from unemployment and a shortage of  welfare and educational resources. As you know, the greatest  danger to youth, who are a matter of concern for the president  of the republic, is unemployment. Therefore, government  construction and startup of factories for production and mother  industries is a necessity in order to create employment.    She called upon officials to start up the paper plant,  expedite the province gas delivery project, internationalize the  airport, and to carry out the project to study the nation's  western railroads.    She then made the following points regarding the Second  Five-Year Plan: The exalted leader's commands focus on the  creation of social justice in society. We are now faced with the  upheaval of the population increase. Since these societies must  give priority to making educational, economic, social and  political efforts in order to evolve, rapid population growth  will prevent growth of the public social and welfare scales. I  am therefore asking that this important issue in society be  dealt with. There are problems evident in the nation's  administrative systems which are causing anxiety. In the Second  Five-Year Plan it is necessary that changes be made in the  government's administrative and executive systems, and there  must be real planning and supervision combined with the proper  implementation of the laws.  <H5>  Ahmad Moradi, Deputy From Chenaran and Tarqobeh </H5>   Have the economic planners yet achieved the goals of the  economic adjustment?    The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Moradi, deputy from Chenaran and Tarqobeh. During  his speech he said: It is not logical and just for us constantly  to invite the public to fight imperialist military and cultural  assaults, while a group of godless people and merchants are  guiding and controlling the nation's economy and taking  advantage of this disorderly situation. The government must not  stand by and watch the perpetual growth in prices and the  instability of the price of foreign exchange caused by  profiteers and opportunists. The people are waiting for  revolutionary and decisive measures and the removal of these  individuals.    He added: Economic insiders and planners must give a  satisfactory answer to the question of whether or not they  anticipated this kind of situation in the framework of the  theory of economic adjustment and unification of the foreign  exchange rate, and whether or not they have yet reached the  goals of the economic adjustment. Can they claim that  unification and stabilization of the foreign exchange rate has  been achieved? On what justification have those who know about  the resources for procuring foreign exchange set up lines of  foreign exchange brokers, and used the wealth belonging to  future generations as a source of revenue? Those who have the  slightest acquaintance with the basics of economics know well  that the goal of this science is the best allocation of limited  resources and making the most of minimal of resources for the  purpose of answering to the nation's important and basic needs.  It is thus clear and obvious that oil revenues must be spent on  infrastructure investment and the nation's economic and  industrial prosperity. They must not be spent to buy various  kinds of consumer goods.    Continuing, the speaker said: One of the government's basic  problems is extremism in economic and social policy. In a  country where until recently all of what is needed for the lives  of the people and for industry was controlled and supervised by  the government, deregulation in this form means wasting several  years of experience and effort. Currently many economic and  social policies are not coordinated with each other, and this  has caused unreasonable profiteering brokerage services to come  into play in investments in the various economic sectors, and  even investment in industry has been made to stop.    In conclusion, the deputy from Chenaran and Tarqobeh said:  The new changes and developments illustrate the bitter reality  that in some cases we are still doing our economic planning  using old, experimental and mistaken policies.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   The only item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was continued consideration of the details of the  Proposed Law on Procedures for Punishing Individuals Who Engage  in Unauthorized Activities in Audiovisual Affairs, whose  articles were approved by the Majles.

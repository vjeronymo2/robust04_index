			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Observer: Neapolitan bookworms Do the people running Naples' royal palace know something we don't? They have put a good part of their library of 1.5m books under lock and key, prior to this weekend's summit of the G7, which is being held at the palace. But the subtle carpentry is apparently a little selective. Russia's Boris Yeltsin, who will turn up for dinner on Saturday and stay for Sunday's final part of the summit, is being housed in slightly less luxurious quarters than G7 members; that's only fair perhaps, since he's not a member. Glass panels have been fixed to prevent books from disappearing from the main room being used by Yeltsin's aides and those of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The books are already under lock and key in the room reserved for French President Francois Mitterrand. But while French and German officials will be free to handle the books in their adjoining offices, the same is not true for the Russian visitors. If they feel the need for some reading matter, they will have to supply their own.</p>

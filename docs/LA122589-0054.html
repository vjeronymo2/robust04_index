			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FORCES INVADE PANAMA, OUST NORIEGA REGIME  </P> <P> The Soviets pull out of Afghanistan and allow all their "satellites" to freely  choose their own form of government, be it communist or not. The United States  stages a massive military invasion of Panama, a tiny sovereign country, and  installs its chosen candidate as the new head of state. Now which is the "evil  empire?"  </P> <P> Members of the Panamanian Defense Forces resist the United States invasion of  their country, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell calls them  "thugs" and terrorists. United States armed forces invade Panama City at night,  helicopter gun ships blazing, blow up the Panamanian army headquarters, in the  process killing dozens of men, women and children living nearby, and untold  others in streets. Now who are the terrorists?  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration raised "double speak" to a new level, and the Bush  Administration has done the same.  </P> <P> CLIFFORD OLIN  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEBSTER, CAMPBELL CONSIDERED CANDIDATES TO COACH THE KINGS  </P> <P> The Kings could name a new coach as early as Wednesday, now that the Stanley  Cup finals are over and King owner Bruce McNall has returned from Europe.  </P> <P> Tom Webster, a former New York Ranger coach who has some strong support within  the Kings' organization, is being mentioned as a prime candidate along with  Detroit Red Wing assistant Colin Campbell.  </P> <P> Asked if Webster had replaced Campbell as the most likely to succeed Robbie  Ftorek, who was fired last month, McNall said that both should be considered.  </P> <P> "Somebody might have gotten the idea that Webster has an edge because I haven't  even met Campbell yet," McNall said. "I still plan to meet with Campbell.  Remember, I just got started on this. We're still in the process. No decision  has been made."  </P> <P> McNall also confirmed that he had spoken with Edmonton Oiler assistant coach  John Muckler, who said he did not want to leave Edmonton unless the job  included an opportunity of becoming a general manager.  </P> <P> Webster might have an edge over Campbell because of his head coaching  experience. But McNall said his first priority is finding a coach who has a  good rapport with the players.  </P></p>

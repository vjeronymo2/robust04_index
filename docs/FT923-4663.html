			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Club Med returns to the black CLUB Mediterranee, one of France's largest travel groups, yesterday announced its return to the black with net profits of FFr20.3m (Dollars 4.24m) in the six months to April 30. This compares with a net loss of FFr87.5m in the same period of the previous year. The company, which recently announced plans for a FFr1bn bond issue, attributed its return to profit to an improvement in demand at its European and African interests during the winter. It said demand had since stabilised and it expected its performance in the second six months of the year to be much the same as that in the latter half last year. However, it still expects to meet its target of net profits of FFr240m for the full financial year. The group, like other holiday companies, suffered severely from the disruption to international travel caused by the Gulf War during the opening months of 1991. It benefited from an improvement in demand during the same period this year, despite the sluggish economic environment. Turnover rose modestly from FFr3.4bn to FFr3.8bn, but operating profits rose more sharply, from FFr71.6m to FFr176.2m. The company received an exceptional profit of FFr36.7m, against an exceptional loss in the previous year of FFr12.6m. Club Med is in the throes of an expansion and renovation programme financed partly by the proceeds of the bond issue. It plans to renovate its villages and to build new ones, chiefly to bolster its position in the French market. Euro Disney, the Paris-based leisure group which has been clouded by controversy over attendance levels at its Euro Disneyland theme park outside Paris this spring, yesterday announced that 6m visitors had been to the park since the opening on April 12. The period since the opening should be the busiest part of Euro Disneyland's year, suggesting the group is still below its target of 11m visitors in its first year. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney's newly appointed president, said attendance to date surpassed admissions during the first five months of operations at the Disney park in Tokyo by more than 1.5m people.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Central bank action lifts bourses briefly A BEAR rally in Tokyo, concerted, but ultimately ineffective central bank support for the dollar and an early but short-lived rise on Wall Street gave bourses scope for a technical rebound yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT digested the prospects of German recession and dipped to a new 1992 low, the DAX index touching 1,510.46 before it closed 6.96 higher at 1,520.02, 1.8 per cent lower on the week. Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM3.9bn. It picked up in the post-bourse, with leaders up by between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent. Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson said that while share options expired at the official close, options on the DAX future soldiered on into the early afternoon and gave dealers the ability to respond to the support for the dollar. Carmakers - prime dollar stocks and depressed lately for that reason and this week's slump in German registration figures - came back in the afternoon. Volkswagen, which rose just DM1.50 to DM327 during the session, stood at DM332 in London a few hours later. Commerzbank said that Thursday's 6.7 per cent drop on its loans to Hafnia, the Danish insurer, was exaggerated, but its stock recovered only DM2.50 to DM223. PARIS started off firmer, encouraged by US President George Bush's speech overnight, but trading then quietened down until the afternoon when the central bank intervention and the Dow's opening rally revived interest. There was also some short-covering ahead of the close of the account on Monday. The CAC-40 index ended up 20.00 higher at 1,744.18, down 0.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr1.5bn. The rise in the index disguised underlying weakness in the market. Pechiney International dropped FFr7.20 or 4.2 per cent to FFr163 after a slip in first-half sales. Pechiney CIPs dropped FFr10.90 or 3.8 per cent to FFr271.10. Total dropped another FFr1.80 to FFr210.70 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its rating on the stock earlier this week, while Euro Disney, also the subject of negative broker comment, fell FFr2.10 to FFr73.50. UAP fell to FFr362.50 on worries about its stake in Hafnia but closed steady at FFr374. MILAN was encouraged by Tokyo's gains but leading shares finished off their highs. The Comit index rose 1.22 to 406.12, up 3.2 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at just L45bn after L59.8bn on Thursday. Banca Commerciale Italiana shares held Thursday's advance in spite of Mediobanca's denial of a press report that it was spearheading a plan on behalf of a group of investors to buy out the state's majority stake in the bank. The shares fell initially but then closed L26 higher at L2,525 in volume of 3.2m shares. Sip continued to fall on foreign selling, losing another L20 to L1,081 in volume of 2.9m shares. COPENHAGEN hit another new low, the CSE index slipping 1.49 to 288.48, 1.9 per cent down on a week which now excludes the suspended Hafnia. Another insurer, Baltica, fell another DKr15 to DKr360 in a weak financial sector. OSLO was overshadowed by the Uni Storebrand crisis, the insurer dropping another NKr2.2 to NKr13.3 before Monday's board meeting which is expected to arrange details of a rights issue to rescue the company. The all-share index dipped 0.63 to 324.34 for a fall of 7.7 per cent on the week. HELSINKI continued to focus on banking loan losses, the bank and finance house index falling another 11.1 per cent, down 69 per cent from its 1992 high. The Hex index closed 24.0 down at 610.3, 35 per cent off its 1992 high and 7 per cent lower on the week. STOCKHOLM fell for the fifth consecutive session, as the Affarsvarlden General index dropped 9.3 to 781.8, for a fall of 5.1 per cent on the week. Turnover remained low at SKr382m. Electrolux B shares fell SKr2 to SKr197 after the company said that uncertainty regarding market trends had increased in recent months. Nordbanken said that its shares will be delisted on August 27 now that Venantius has more than 90 per cent of the equity. Venantius was set up by the government to administer its holding in Nordbanken, which it was forced to take over earlier this year in order to save the bank from collapse. ZURICH saw rises in chemicals and banks as the SMI index put on 14.7 to 1,768.2, down 1.3 per cent on the week. Ciba-Geigy registered topped the active list, rising SFr4 to SFr647 after a 12 per cent rise in first-half profits. SBC bearers rose SFr7 to SFr238. MADRID managed a rise on the day and on the week with gains in the general index of 1.55 and 1.3 per cent respectively to 210.24. Heavy block trades took turnover up to an estimated Pta14bn from around Pta4-5bn recently.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1034.63  1033.50  1033.17  1034.32  1035.69  1037.60  1041.20  1039.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Day's High  1041.25    Day's Low  1031.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Aug 20       Aug 19       Aug 18       Aug 17       Aug 14      1030.83      1033.91      1035.74      1045.00      1042.13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Hong Kong monitoring programme RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON (HONG KONG) has won a contract to survey the condition of decking which carries highways above the nullahs - water courses - in the Territory. Some of the network of 31 nullahs have been decked with independently-piled reinforced concrete structures. In some instances they carry above them busy dual carriageway roads. The first phase of the contract with the Hong Kong Government's Highways Department, is worth Pounds 215,000 and began on May 1. It will identify defects and quantify testing required on the total decked area of about 133,000 sq metres. The second phase will test and establish reasons for defects and the extent and estimated cost of repairs. Special techniques such as sonar and CCTV may be used on the project.</p>

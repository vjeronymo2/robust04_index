			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- In the first leg of the  two-round Hungarian general elections, held on May 8, two seats  were won in individual constituencies and 125 from party lists  out of the 386 seats of Hungary's one-chamber parliament. The  race is to continue until May 29 to win the remaining 259  mandates, of which 174 will be distributed to individual  candidates. (Altogether, there are 176 individual constituencies  but in two of them the first round ended with final results --  bringing victory to Socialists in both seats.)    Left-over votes cast on party lists in the first round will  decide the future of 27 parliamentary seats, which are to be  allocated proportionately between the 6 parties that reached a  minimum of five percent of the votes in the first round. Five  percent is the threshhold that has to be passed by a party to  get into parliament. The allocation itself is to be carried out  only after the second round, when all results are known. As  many as 58 deputies are to be elected from national party lists,  based on the proportion of fractional ballots received by the  parties' individual candidates in the first round. The two  types of fractional votes will be added up, processed, and  distributed by the National Election Committee after the second  round.    The run-off should give conclusive results in 174 individual  constituencies where no candidates received more than half of  the valid votes in the first round. The second round will  feature candidates who received at least 15 percent of the valid  votes in the first round (if there fewer than three candidates  poll 15 percent, the three with the highest numbers of votes),  which will be won by the candidate who receives most valid  votes. (First round votes will not be added into run-off  results.) Results will be valid in a district if the turn-out  is at least 25 percent plus one voter. In case the turn-out is  lower somewhere, by-elections are expected to follow in 1995.    Of the maximum 152 seats obtainable through party lists, 125  have been allocated and 27 are to be filled after May 29.  Altogether, 259 mandates will be distributed on the basis of  the second round.    The ratio of the 125 party-list seats decided in the first  round is as follows (with the proportion of votes in brackets):    1. Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP): 53 (32.99)    2. Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ): 28 (19.74)    3. Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF): 18 (11.74)    4. Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP): 14 (8.82)    5. Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ): 7 (7.02)    6. Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP): 5 (7.03)    Although these votes will not be added in, numbers of seats  where each party was in first place give some idea of how voting  might go in the second round. The MSZP had candidates in first  place in 160 constituencies in the first round, while the SZDSZ  had 12, and the MDF and the KDNP one each.</p>

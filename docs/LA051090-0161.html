			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY;  </P> <P> JOFFREY SPENT PAYROLL TAX TO STAY IN BUSINESS;  </P> <P> MONEY: INTERNAL PROBLEMS ARE FUELED BY A GROWING DEBT TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE  SERVICE.  </P> <P> For at least the past two years, the Joffrey Ballet's chief financial officer  has periodically delayed paying payroll deduction taxes to the Internal Revenue  Service in order to ensure that the financially beleaguered dance company would  obtain desperately needed grant money from the National Endowment for the Arts,  according to minutes of a April 6 Joffrey board meeting. The total held back  amounted to at least $828,000.  </P> <P> The resulting fiscal chaos -- apparently hidden by Joffrey executives from the  55-member board of managing directors until last month -- grew so out of  control that, as recently as April 6, according to the minutes, members of the  Joffrey's finance committee were being told in a closed door meeting that the  35-year-old dance company was "two to three weeks away from being bankrupt."  </P> <P> At that same meeting, chief financial officer Lillian Piro tendered her  resignation in a two-page letter to the finance committee, made available to  The Times, only to be told that any decision to let her go would be delayed  until June "to ensure the survival of the company." By June, the Joffrey would  end its Los Angeles engagement and the new fiscal year would kick in with  expectations of new corporate contributions and government grants.  </P> <P> Piro, contacted Wednesday at the New York headquarters office of the Joffrey,  declined to comment on either the Joffrey's financial situation or her own  resignation letter.  </P> <P> Public audit statements, tax filings, Piro's resignation letter and minutes  from the April 6 meeting, all obtained by The Times, show a number of unusual  accounting practices and optimistic fund-raising goals, dating back nearly a  decade. Since 1983, the Joffrey has operated at a greater loss each year,  except for 1986, according to the dance company's annual audit statements. In  that year, the company's year-end deficit was $150,454 -- about $107,000  smaller than the deficit from 1985. Since then, however, the Joffrey has  finished each fiscal year, on June 30, with more and more red ink until last  year, when its losses were nearly $1 million.  </P> <P> Including its outstanding taxes, interest and penalties, plus several hundred  thousand dollars in existing unpaid bills, the bicoastal company may be heading  for its first $2 million year-end deficit in June.  </P> <P> In her resignation letter, Piro said she started withholding payroll tax  payments last fall in order to pay dancers, staff employees, the Joffrey's  travel agency, trucking company and shoe supplier. She did that, she said, to  keep the troupe active and to bring in revenue at the box office so that the  company would not have to close.  </P> <P> "I felt that it would be better to have the company perform to generate more  income (cash) coming in each week from our Washington, D.C., engagement, our  New York season, Orange County and Los Angeles "Nutcracker" performances," Piro  wrote.  </P> <P> Like Joffrey executive director Penelope Curry and other key executives in New  York and Los Angeles, Piro had been counting on contributions, grants,  donations and large audiences at each of the winter performances of the dance  company in order to make up for the shortfall.  </P> <P> Twice before -- once in 1988 and again last summer -- Joffrey IRS payroll tax  payments were withheld, according to minutes of the April 6 meeting, to  maintain a smooth cash flow and to meet minimum requirements for the matching  grant program of the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> For several years, the Joffrey has received annual NEA grants which require  that the nonprofit Foundation for the Joffrey Ballet, Inc. maintain a $750,000  cash reserve fund. In order to keep that fund at a level that is satisfactory  to the NEA auditors, money due the IRS was put into the account so that the  company would not lose its NEA matching grant, according to minutes of the  April 6 meeting. Last year, the Joffrey stood to lose $243,000 in NEA Challenge  III grant money. Just last month, the NEA announced a new matching grant for  the Joffrey of $245,000.  </P> <P> Contacted at his office in Washington, D.C., this week, NEA Inspector General  Leon Lilly told The Times he was unaware of the Joffrey's financial problems or  its practice of banking withholding taxes in its cash reserve fund in order to  obtain NEA grant money.  </P> <P> As early as June 1988, the Joffrey's own auditors warned the board of directors  and staff management that borrowing from the cash reserve fund might jeopardize  their NEA grants.  </P> <P> "All borrowings from the fund shall be repaid within two years of the date of  borrowing," wrote auditors for the accounting firm of Lutz and Carr. "At June  30, 1988, the Foundation was not in compliance with these terms."  </P> <P> Last June, according to the April 6 minutes, Piro told board member Edward  Weinstein that she put $220,000 in tax liability money into the cash reserve  account instead of paying the IRS. As a result, the Joffrey got its NEA grant  but also had to pay about $18,000 in penalties and interest to the IRS.  </P> <P> Again last fall, additional IRS tax payments were withheld. By year's end, the  Joffrey owed $488,295.53 to the IRS. As of April 6, the company had paid  $55,295.78, but had also incurred $37,307 in penalties and interest on the  unpaid tax bill. As a result, the Joffrey owed $470,551.75 to the government  just for its unpaid taxes from October, November and December of 1989.  </P> <P> A check for $119,705.79 to pay for overdue payroll taxes from last summer  bounced in January, triggering an IRS penalty of $35,878.16. As of last month,  the troupe had not paid $201,235.82 in taxes for the first three months of  1990.  </P> <P> If the Joffrey paid $50,000 a week until the end of June, the committee was  told on April 6, it would be able to pay off its outstanding IRS debt.  </P> <P> The fiscal problems grew worse when Curry told the finance committee about a  mystery item on the plus side of the ledger: $790,694 in "unidentified  contributions." She explained that the money had not materialized as she had  expected, in part because many Joffrey donors had adopted a "wait and see"  attitude due to the company's "internal problems".  </P> <P> Finance committee member David Holbrook, president of Marsh and McLennan, Inc.,  New York, spelled out the "internal problems" as an ongoing feud between  executive director Penelope Curry and artistic director Gerald Arpino.  </P> <P> "If Mr. Arpino and Ms. Curry cannot work together as a team, the company will  close," Holbrook said at the April 6 meeting.  </P> <P> Three weeks later, Joffrey co-chairman David Murdock spearheaded a drastic  reorganization of the largely ceremonial 55-member board of managing directors,  concentrating decision-making power in a 15-member operating committee that he  heads. On a 31-9 vote, the managing directors approved Murdock's plan, which  allowed for the immediate appointment of nine directors to the committee who,  in turn, would select the remaining six members. (One appointee, Stephanie  French, has declined to serve.) Murdock has been out of the country on business  for the past week and is unavailable for comment, according to a spokeswoman  for his Westwood-based Pacific Holding Corporation.  </P> <P> Arpino and several board members resigned in protest following the Murdock  action, launching a civil war within the troubled organization that many  Joffrey patrons fear will destroy it.  </P> <P> Shortly after resigning, Arpino forbade the Joffrey from using either his own  works or those of the late founder of the company, Robert Joffrey. As executor  of Joffrey's estate, Arpino maintains he has control over licensing  performances of his dances. In ongoing negotiations, Arpino's representatives  and the Joffrey board have come to a day-by-day interim agreement allowing for  performance of the two mens' works.  </P> <P> Curry has been critical of Arpino's spending. In October, she told the board of  directors that he had gone $150,000 over budget on the development of his  newest ballet, "TWO-A-DAY." Arpino subsequently told board member Barbara Levy  Kipper, chairman of Chicago-based Levy Circulating Company, that his own  accounting showed that he had actually come in $7,700 under budget in  developing "TWO-A-DAY."  </P> <P> Arpino's resignation could not have come at a worse time for the Los Angeles  run of the dance troupe's season. Performances began May 2 at the Music Center  with several of Arpino's ballets already established in the schedule. A  centerpiece of the annual fund raising efforts by the Los Angeles Friends of  the Joffrey is a $1,000-per-person series of special performances.  </P> <P> Last year, the series raised $480,000 and netted $244,700 after paying out  $235,300 in salaries, music, food, decorations, printing, stationery and other  overhead expenses. The Friends of the Joffrey also tried to hold a raffle until  it was advised by the Los Angeles Social Service Department that a raffle  cannot be sanctioned by the city as a recognized charitable event.  </P> <P> 1987-88 FINANCES  </P> <P> The Big Picture  </P> <P> Total Revenues: $11,675,296  </P> <P> Total Expenses: $12,191,488  </P> <P> 1988 Fund Balance: (516,192)  </P> <P> 1986-87 Deficit: (411,799)  </P> <P> Current Net Worth: (927,991)  </P> <P> Sources of Major Funding  </P> <P> Music Center Unified Fund: $991,375  </P> <P> N.Y.

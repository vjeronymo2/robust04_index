			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Companies pin hopes on year-end exchange rates TREASURY managers at UK companies were yesterday monitoring how sterling ended 1992 against the dollar, the D-Mark and other currencies. After a year of turbulence the year-end rates were watched particularly closely. Companies which draw up accounts at the end of the calendar year calculate the value of their overseas subsidiaries using the closing rate in London on December 31. In some cases overseas profits and losses will also be translated to the parent group's balance sheet using the rates for that day. Many treasury managers calculate profits and losses using the average exchange rate over the accounting year. Even in these cases, however, the year-end rate is usedas a guide to how the average will come out. Mr Derek Ross, a partner at accountancy firm Touche Ross, said the overall value of a company might change sharply because of sterling's devaluation. 'Those companies with net assets overseas will find that the value of their holdings has increased because of sterling's devaluation.' The devaluation implied in the year-end rate can also change a company's gearing ratio and borrowing capacity. The debt-to-equity ratio can also change, depending on the extent of a company's overseas holdings, and this may have an impact on existing borrowing. Mr Ross said that the recession had resulted in companies having larger borrowings than usual. The devaluation as reflected in the the end-of-year rates may have an adverse effect on gearing percentages. British business will be in the front line of a new Battle of Britain this year, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors said in a New Year message to members. 'January 1 1993 is an important turning-point for the UK economy. Symbolically, it brings the European single market into existence while in real terms it opens a new year in which we do expect recovery from recession to begin,' he said.

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lower CIS aluminium exports forecast EXPORTS OF primary aluminium to the West by the Commonwealth of Independent States are likely to fall to about 600,000 tonnes, from nearly 1m tonnes in 1991, according to Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman of Germany's VIAG industrial group. 'That's about the maximum they can move with their production and transport problems, and they have yet to face the environmental challenge,' he said during a visit to Montreal. 'We're more optimistic than Alcan Aluminium's (chairman) David Morton.' VIAG's biggest single project in North America is the USDollars 1.2bn Alouette Aluminium smelter at Sept Iles, 1,100 km (700 miles) north-east of Montreal, on the Lower St Lawrence. Its VAW subsidiary has a 20 per cent interest and is operator. The plant starts up on June 1 and is expected to reach target capacity of 215,000 tonnes in 1993. Nearly all the metal will go to Europe. Mr Pfeiffer said European demand for primary ingot will gain several percentage points this year as the metal penetrates further in the motor industry and elsewhere, helping to bring more price stability. Spot ingot now trades at about 60 cents a lb. He said Quebec wanted VAW and partners Austria Metall, Hoogovens, Kobe/Marubeni of Japan, to push ahead with Alouette Phase II, adding a further 250,000 tonnes of capacity at a cost of around USDollars 1bn. 'We will decide in the next two weeks whether to give a contract for preliminary engineering for Phase II,' he said.</p>

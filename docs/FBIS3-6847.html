			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser: "Global </F> Import of U.S. Disdain"]    [Text] The American approach to the solution of its trade  problems with Japan could destroy all the potential benefits of  the Uruguay Round. The American approach calls into question  United States commitment to multilateral trade negotiations and  emphasises its reliance on bilateral approaches in which its own  overwhelming power and influence can be exercised to the full.    In part almost unnoticed, but in the first month after the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed, the US cut  Australia's meat quotas into its domestic market and increased  subsidies on exported grain in a manner damaging to Australia's  export markets.    There have been enormous claims made for the benefits to  Australia and other countries as a result of the conclusion of  the Uruguay Round. I readily concede that the Australian  Government's efforts were as good as they could have been and  the initiative in establishing the Cairns Group was a worthy  one. The claims, however, for Australia's future benefit are  likely to be significantly overrated, for two reasons.    First, nearly every country in Europe and the US and most of  the successful Asian countries adopt aggressive industry  policies designed to maximise the competitive strength of their  own industries and to assist in the development of new  industries. Asian countries use specific tax breaks, together  with import protection and administrative devices to protect  their industries.    Such measures are not isolated. Throughout Asia, those  countries with recently established car industries provide very  significant protection, ranging up to 200 per cent. At the  other end of the industrial scale, food processing industries  are heavily protected so that they can develop free of threats  from imports.    The European and the American car markets are far more  heavily protected than is the Australian. The US has voluntary  export agreements with European and Japanese car manufacturers  which limit market share of imported cars to around 15 per cent  of the American market. In Europe, 8 per cent of the market can  be filled by exports from other countries. In Australia, where  governments have not worked to develop active industry policies,  the import penetration of motor vehicles is about 40 per cent.  Since 1988, the motor vehicle trade deficit has almost doubled  from a little over $3 billion to well over $6 billion.    There are widespread fears that Australia's current account  deficit will blow out significantly as the recovery moves  forward. The longer term trends are already ominous. A year ago  the trend monthly current account deficit stood at S1.141  billion. Now, with the recovery only just gathering pace, it  has already expanded to $1.422 billion.    These factors provide substantial arguments in favour of an  industry policy whose objective would be to strengthen  Australia's industrial base and to expand Australian jobs,  rather than foreign jobs.    We should note in particular the specific methods and  techniques the US is now threatening to use to force Japan to  buy more products made in the US. In certain specific industry  areas, the US wants Japan to specify quantitative targets for  purchases of particular products from the US.    Such a technique is of course, totally contrary to GATT. It  is absolutely outlawed under any civilised code of international  behaviour. It is sanctioned by America's own Omnibus Trade  Legislation, which provides the American legislature and  executive with every conceivable arbitrary and punitive power  against other countries.    If a country such as Australia passed equivalent  legislation,  it would be laughed at around the world. The US can pass such  legislation and place the demands that it has recently placed  upon Japan, simply because it is the most powerful country in  the world.    One should not be surprised, therefore, that the US is now  getting very close to using its arbitrary powers against Japan.  If it does, I suggest the entire benefit of the Uruguay Round  will soon disintegrate. The European Union may be more subtle  than America, but will not be far behind in using equivalent  measures against Japan.    The second reason is that both the US and Europe would then  be likely to target other successful countries in Asia. All of  Asia is watching the trade disputes between the US and Japan,  fearful of the outcome. The American approach, if continued,  will have disastrous consequences for relationships between  nations.    We often forget that the last World War in the Pacific was,  in part at least, caused because Japan had been chucked out of  market after market around the world.    Japan's continuing trade surplus does create problems. Some  part of that surplus is now currency driven because of the  appreciation of the yen. My understanding is that a number of  Japanese manufacturing companies are in fact under extreme  pressure as a result of the present value of the yen and there  is the possibility of a major collapse in some sections of  Japanese manufacturing industry as a result of that currency  appreciation.    The US actions run the risk of aborting whatever results  have  flowed from the Uruguay Round and reversing those constructive  elements. The US should take their case against Japan to GATT  and argue it through in international forums. That might give a  clearer understanding of the Japanese position than many people  now have. It should not be forgotten that many companies,  including many American companies, trade in Japan with a great  deal of success.    The GATT settlement procedure could lead to a result  acceptable both to Japan and the US. GATT could have power to  intervene in the dispute and to demand that it be settled within  GATT procedures. That it, in effect, does not have such power  demonstrates quite clearly that the great and powerful can  ignore international institutions when they believe it suits  their purpose.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Taiwan and Boeing in talks on joint regional jet project Taiwan Aerospace is in talks with Boeing over possible joint development of a 100-seat regional jet. The move follows the failure of talks last year between the aerospace company, which is 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, and British Aerospace to co-operate on a similar project. The proposed collaboration with Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, could also involve co-operation with the Chinese aircraft industry as well as Japan. The talks are the third attempt by Taiwan Aerospace, created three years ago to spearhead the country's ambitions to develop an aerospace industry, to forge an international partnership. The first proposed link was with McDonnell Douglas of the US. Mr Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said yesterday the US company was discussing the possibility of developing either a 100-seat aircraft or a small derivative of its 737 twin-engine airliner with Taiwan, China and possibly Japan. Mr Albrecht, attending a Financial Times aerospace conference on the eve of the Singapore Air Show, also confirmed that Boeing was conducting separate studies with the three Japanese aerospace companies (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries) on development of a 100-seat airliner. It was too early to say whether the Japanese companies, already long-standing partners on other Boeing programmes, would participate on a broader collaboration project with Taiwan and China. But Boeing is stepping up efforts to put into place a longer term strategy to increase its penetration of a fast growing Chinese aviation market. Mr Albrecht said he would soon visit Taiwan to discuss collaboration. Taiwan had attempted for the past year to forge a joint regional jet venture with BAe. But the two sides failed to reach agreement and negotiations were suspended three months ago. Even more ambitious partnership discussions between Taiwan Aerospace and McDonnell Douglas collapsed in 1992. McDonnell Douglas and Boeing received a boost last week with the announcement of an intended Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) commercial aircraft order from Saudi Arabia. The two US manufacturers are to send delegations to Saudi Arabia on March 20 to start negotiating details of the contract to supply about 50 aircraft to Saudia, the national airline. Mr Albrecht said Saudi Arabia had also asked the US manufacturers to propose a substantial aircraft support and maintenance package which could involve 'several hundred million of dollars more'. He confirmed that the Saudis had not yet decided what aircraft types they intended to purchase. Although Rolls-Royce, the UK aero engine manufacturer, supplied the power plants for Saudia's existing fleet of 747s, the latest order is likely to involve US-made engines because of the strong political impetus behind the Saudi deal, according to European aerospace officials.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: RULES PERMIT LOWER LOAD FACTOR FOR ATTIC  </P> <P> QUESTION: Three years ago, I acquired an English-style, 1 1/2-story all-brick,  all-plaster house, 50 years old and in excellent condition. There is a full  attic with a catwalk in the center.  </P> <P> I would like to finish the attic, but it only has 2-by-6-inch ceiling joists,  16 inches on center. I am told the joists have to be at least 2-by-8 inches, 16  inches on center, before rooms can be added.  </P> <P> First, why were houses like this built, and what's the remedy? Can I do most of  the work myself?  </P> <P> ANSWER: In house design, the size of the floor joists depends on the distance  between the joist supports (span), the on-center distance between the joists  (usually 16 inches on center), the species of wood the joists are made of and  the loading applied to the floor.  </P> <P> In residential structures, the floor loading is usually designed for a live  load of 40 pounds per square foot, with attic floors designed for loading of 20  pounds per square foot. A live load is the load that is imposed solely by  occupancy (persons, furnishings and appliances).  </P> <P> The attic's design load is less than the load for habitable rooms because the  attic is normally not used for storing heavy appliances or furniture. Hence,  ceiling joists are often smaller than the floor joists below.  </P> <P> In determining joist size for a given span, architects use tables that consider  bending stress, deflection and stiffness (in order to minimize the springiness  in the floor). Your floor joists are sufficient for a 40-pound-per-square-foot  floor, providing their unsupported span does not exceed 9 feet, 6 inches  (approximately).  </P> <P> To finish the attic properly, you would first need a building permit. Your  local municipal building department will probably require you to have plans  drawn by a registered architect or approved by a licensed professional  engineer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difference Between De-Icing Materials  </P> <P> Q: With a large variety of walkway de-icers on the market, could you tell me  the major differences between them, and which would be the safest for concrete?  </P> <P> A: According to the Portland Cement Assn., the safest de-icers for concrete are  also the most common: sodium chloride (rock salt) and calcium chloride. Both of  these de-icers rust metal, and sodium chloride damages vegetation while calcium  chloride does not.  </P> <P> The association recommends against using on concrete those de-icers that  contain ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paints Product Lasts Longer on Aluminum  </P> <P> Q: I have a home with finished aluminum soffits, fascias, gutters and window  trim. I would like to paint these a different color. Is this possible? And, if  so, will I be repainting every four years and lose out on the benefits of  aluminum trim?  </P> <P> A: Not to worry. PPG Industries has a latex paint specifically formulated for  repainting prefinished aluminum siding and trim. It's called Metal Siding  Refinish, and comes in a variety of colors to match current popular siding  colors. If the surface is prepared correctly and the paint properly applied, it  will last for about 10 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brown Spots on Deck Will Not Wash Away  </P> <P> Q: Dark brown spots are appearing in areas of my concrete deck. They don't wash  away with soap and water. What causes these spots?  </P> <P> A: The type of discoloration you describe occurs when tricalcium  alumino-ferride -- the agent that gives portland cement its gray color -- has  not reacted thoroughly with the other chemicals in concrete. To remove the dark  spots, try pouring on undiluted household vinegar. If that doesn't work, try a  solution of one part muratic acid to 30 parts water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dirty Streaks Mar Siding of House  </P> <P> Q: We have been unable to find anything that will clean the accumulation of  dirt and other particles on our aluminum siding. It seems the siding is clean  from about 4 to 5 feet down from the eaves. Above that, the siding seems to  have a rough or granular surface that will not wash off with a sponge and  laundry detergent. What is the best way to handle this problem?  </P> <P> A: Stubborn soils start at the bottom and work up. This keeps hard-to-remove  dirty streaks from running down the wall below the dirty under-eave area. After  cleaning and washing, it's important that the siding be thoroughly flushed with  water.  </P> <P> Special siding cleaners, available at your local hardware store can help.  Mildew, which appears as black spots, usually shows up in areas isolated from  rainfall. Try using a solution of one-quart Clorox, one-half cup of  non-abrasive detergent and two-thirds cup of trisodium phosphate. Rinse the  area with your garden hose after washing it.  </P></p>

Appropriate Federal and State agencies, the Smyth County government, scientific organizations, and interested parties were contacted by letter dated December 21, 1993. A legal notice was published in the Smyth County News in December 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five written comments were received. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and Dr. Terry L. Sharik, University of Utah, support reclassification of the Virginia round-leaf birch to threatened status. However, The Nature Conservancy and Mr. Omar G. Ross do not support reclassification based on the present status of the one naturally-occurring population and the young age of the established new populations. One individual supported the Service's efforts to recover the species, but did not state his position on the proposed reclassification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions regarding the status of the Virginia round-leaf birch, and its eligibility for reclassification to threatened status include: (1) Questionable viability of the existing natural stand of 11 Virginia round-leaf birches; (2) the immature status of the 20 introduced populations which have not yet reached sexual maturity, which means that reproductive capability has not yet been demonstrated; and, (3) it is unknown whether the existing stands can be self-maintaining. In response, the Service's recovery objective for this species, as outlined in the Virginia Round-Leaf Birch Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990), is to ensure viable self-sustaining populations by increasing the number of individuals in the wild. Scientists who have worked extensively with the round-leaf birch generally agree that the 20 introduced populations are highly likely to reproduce in the near future. The proven ability to propagate the plant, the variety of habitat conditions it appears to tolerate, the fact that all introduced populations and a portion of the native population are on protected Forest Service lands, the survival rate of the seedlings, and the comparative overall status of the species since the species was listed, indicate that the species is not in immediate danger of extinction. Threats to the species have been effectively diminished, and opportunities for further habitat protection and management exist. Therefore, reclassification to threatened status reflects the Service's awareness that threats continue to exist for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> though it is no longer in immediate danger of extinction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should be reclassified as a threatened species. Procedures found in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations implementing the listing provisions of the Act (50 CFR part 424) for reclassifying species on the Federal lists were followed. A species may be listed or reclassified as threatened or endangered due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Ashe) Fernald (Virginia round-leaf birch) are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of its Habitat or Range <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Virginia round-leaf birch is a pioneer species that succumbs to competition from longer-lived species. Under natural conditions, Virginia round-leaf birch habitat is threatened by factors such as drought, flooding, and competing vegetation. In this regard, by 1984 flooding and competition with later successional species had caused the death of 14 individual trees in the natural population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

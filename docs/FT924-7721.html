			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Honda Motor profits fall for first time in 25 years HONDA Motor, the Japanese automobile manufacture, yesterday unveiled its first falls in sales and profits for 25 years while rival Mazda Motor reported a 73 per cent drop to Y3bn (Dollars 24.2m) in pre-tax profits in the first six months. The figures underline the impact which depressed world car markets are having on Japanese car manufacturers. The downturn is clearly separating the Japanese car industry into two broad groups. It is taking its heaviest toll upon Nissan, which declared a first half loss and Mazda, which is carrying a heavy burden of investment in a modernised product range. In contrast Toyota and Honda have managed to moderate the impact of falling demand upon their finances, through tighter cost control. This sharp divergence in the manufacturers' financial performance has prompted some analysts to speculate that the Japanese industry, which has nine major car producers, may be consolidated if the downturn proves to be prolonged. Both Mazda and Honda warned the downturn would last well into next year. Mazda, which recently announced its was scrapping plans for a second luxury car sales channel in the US, reported net profits down by 85.4 per cent to Y621m, or Y0.57 per share. Turnover rose by 2.4 per cent to Y1,129bn from the first half of last year, largely because of the introduction of more sophisticated models has increased the average price of Mazda' product line. Factory unit sales were 6.1 per cent down at 646,676, with cars down by 1.9 per cent at 513,982 and commercial vehicle unit sales 19 per cent down at 132,694. Domestic unit sales registered a 10 per cent decline at 250,730, while exports advanced by 3.4 per cent to 395,946. Honda's pre-tax profits in the six months to September fell by 12.2 per to Y29bn, on sales of Y1,343bn, a 7.2 per cent drop on the first half of last year. After-tax profits were 7 per cent down at Y15bn or Y15.5 a share. Its motorcycle sales rose by 11.4 per cent to Y69bn in the Japanese market. Sales of four wheel vehicles fell by 8.5 per cent to Y419bn in Japan and by 14 per cent to Y582bn in overseas markets, largely because of the downturn in the US market.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Bouygues wins Nigeria deal Shell Nigeria has awarded a Dollars 158m turnkey contract to Bouygues Offshore as part of a project to rebuild its Forcados oil terminal near Warri. Forcados was built nearly 25 years ago and the terminal and surrounding infrastructure is due to be modernised at an estimated cost of Dollars 400m. The work will be carried out in phases to minimise disruption to production and export at the terminal, which handles just under half of Shell Nigeria's oil output. Shell is the operator and 30 per cent equity partner in a joint venture in which the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds 55 per cent, Elf Aquitaine 10 per cent and Agip 5 per cent.</p>

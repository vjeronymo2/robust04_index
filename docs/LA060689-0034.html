			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council on Monday authorized two studies to determine the  proposed new civic center's impact on traffic and the environment.  </P> <P> The council voted, 7 to 2, to spend $40,630 for an environmental impact  analysis and $19,370 for a traffic impact analysis. The money is in addition to  the $1.2 million already spent to purchase a parcel of property needed for the  project and $200,000 for the work of consultants and city staff, said Deputy  City Manager Maureen Stapleton.  </P> <P> Pressed for office space, the council is proposing to build a $241-million City  Hall complex in a 7-square-block area just south of San Diego City College and  west of the new 14th street police headquarters. The plan may be expanded to  include a $78-million Central Library.  </P> <P> Council members Bruce Henderson and Judy McCarty voted against approving the  studies, saying they believe there are less expensive alternatives to the plan.  </P> <P> City Manager John Lockwood's office has recommended construction of the new  City Hall as a cost-effective alternative to continuing to lease space in  downtown office buildings.  </P></p>

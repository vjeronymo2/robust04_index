			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Letter: Shades of economic development (1) Sir, Stanley Katz made a number of interesting points in his article ('East Europe should learn from Asia', April 24) about the problems inherent in eastern Europe's adopting the 'liberal' free market approach to entry into the world economy. Proposing the state-interventionist or 'corporatist' strategy of Japan and the newly-industrialised countries (NICs), Katz's solution certainly appears viable in the light of the NICs' experience from the 1950s to 1980s. However, two points are worth making. First, although there are signs that Czechoslovakia and Hungary are beginningto adopt a 'corporatist' approach (in contrast to Poland's liberal free market policies), because of a short-sighted economic focus, it is doubtful whether the OECD states and international banking institutions would offer political or economic support to countries adopting a long-term export substituting strategy (a core element in the success of NICs). The debt problem in eastern Europe in particular would need to be radically reduced for this approach to get off the ground; but witness the current political row over the 50 per cent write-off of Polish debt to western governments. This raises the second point in that any strategy adopted in eastern Europe, as Katz rightly concludes, will need public support. However, the social problems of the NICs have often been played down in the west (even in Japan last year this was manifested in urban unrest in Osaka). In particular, the often appalling conditions of female industrial workers in NICs demonstrates the social price paid for 'success' in the world economy. These problems may well be repeated in eastern Europe unless greater forms of political and industrial democracy are developed, whereby the populations achieve a genuine involvement in changes in their societies. This is not utopianism,but a political necessity. It is in the interest of neither east nor west to see social unrest pushing countries such as Poland into authoritarian solutions inrelation to free market reforms.

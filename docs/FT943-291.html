			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / US telecoms groups puzzle over the future: Accusations fly as legislation to overhaul the industry collapses Telecommunications executives and regulators alike are puzzling over what will happen to their industry now that efforts to pass the first substantial overhaul of US telecommunications law in 60 years have been declared dead for the year, write Tony Jackson and George Graham. Legislation died in Congress last week when Senator Fritz Hollings, who as chairman of the Senate commerce committee holds sway over the measure, announced he had given up trying to bring the bill to a vote. Senator Hollings blamed the 'Baby Bells,' the regional telephone companies created by the court-ordered break-up of the old AT&amp;T telephone monopoly 10 years ago, for their hostility to the bill, despite a string of concessions to their demands. Industry and stock market reaction to the collapse of the bill, likewise, accused the Bell companies of short-sightedness; anxious to protect their local monopolies, they have obstructed change and denied themselves growth opportunities in long-distance and equipment manufacture. The long-distance telephone companies such as AT&amp;T and MCI, are seen as the winners, as the Baby Bells and other regional companies now will not be allowed into the long-distance market. The Bells meanwhile hotly deny responsibility, pointing the finger at Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader, who has done his utmost to block a series of bills that might give the Clinton administration some claim of legislative accomplishment. In fact, a number of Bell chief executives were in Senator Dole's office in an attempt to persuade him to soften his demands at the moment that Senator Hollings announced his withdrawal of the bill. Even if the Senate had passed Senator Hollings's bill, it would not have been easy to reconcile it with the very different philosophy of the bills already passed by the House of Representatives - which set up a framework but leave much more of the detail to be worked out in regulatory decisions by the Federal Communications Commission. In many ways, however, the reshaping of the US telecoms industry goes on regardless of events on Capitol Hill. Industry analysts claim the whole industry's investment plans will be put on hold. The Clinton administration's grandiose vision of a national information infrastructure, or superhighway, depends heavily on private sector finance. Without the agreed regulatory framework promised by the bill, the private sector may prove reluctant to risk the money. But some of this seems exaggerated. 'The technology, the plant and the software for the digital superhighway are years away anyway,' argues Mr George Dellinger of NatWest Washington Analysis. 'This is not a particular setback to the level of investment.' This seems borne out by the recent behaviour of the companies themselves, whose investment plans seem more concerned with acquisitions and strategic alliances. As for the theory that the long-distance companies profit from the bill's collapse, it is worth recalling that the long-distance companies supported the bill while the Bells opposed it. For the long-distance operators, the bill's attraction lay in requiring the Bell companies to relax their local monopolies. Since a huge chunk of the long-distance companies' revenues are consumed in access fees to the local networks, the promise of competition and lower fees at the local level evidently outweighed the threat of competition in their own markets. The bill would have allowed the Bell companies into three key areas - long-distance telephony, equipment manufacture and cable TV. But it would have weakened their local monopolies in return: and with their cash flow in that business - by one industry estimate - equal to 42 per cent of turnover, the long-term opportunity was outweighed by the short-term cost. Instead, the regional companies are looking to the courts, in the hope of getting what they want on easier terms. In one important court case they are seeking jointly to overturn the provisions of the original AT&amp;T break-up, on the grounds that they are anti-competitive and out of date. If successful - and the case could take 18 months to be resolved - this would allow them into long-distance telephony and equipment manufacture. At the same time almost all the Bells have suits under way in local courts seeking to overturn the separate legislation which excludes telephone companies from cable TV. Meanwhile, the mobile telephone revolution continues apace. Last week's final clearance of the AT&amp;T/McCaw merger is widely seen as reinstating - under competitive conditions - the old nationwide telephone system broken up a decade ago. By using McCaw's local cellular networks, AT&amp;T can, to an extent, simply bypass the local telephone system and provide its customers with a combined local and long-distance service. All the while the battle over regional telephone monopolies goes on. On Tuesday the New York telephone company Nynex put forward a proposal to freeze its residential call rates for five years, provided it is allowed to make as much profit as it can in return. This provoked a storm of criticism from the long-distance and cable companies. The proposal, said AT&amp;T, was 'Nynex's Trojan horse strategy for strengthening monopoly control'. It was, said the Cable Television Association of New York, 'so one-sided in favour of Nynex that it would deter any investment in New York state by other companies'. The industry will undoubtedly continue to transform itself, but all sides agree it would be quicker and cleaner to try again to produce comprehensive legislation when a new Congress meets next year. That may not be easy. Some of the deals that have been struck to ease the passage of legislation this year might survive, but compromises on long-distance telephone service and cable television will have to be worked out again from scratch.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Kohl seeks 'solidarity pact' to finance German unification GERMANY'S chancellor Helmut Kohl, facing accusations of indecision and weak leadership, yesterday summoned a roundtable meeting of industry, trade unions, government and opposition, to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' to finance the growing cost of unification. He rejected calls for a 'grand coalition' with the opposition Social Democrats to tackle the country's gathering economic crisis. At the same time, his right-hand man and parliamentary leader, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, denied that he was plotting to take over from the chancellor. Mr Kohl's move amounts to a belated recognition that budget stringency cannot alone finance the massive transfers required to revive the east German economy - currently around a net DM150bn (Pounds 54bn) a year. His adoption of the roundtable formula to negotiate a consensus is also a political retreat. The proposal was first made by the five leading German economic institutes almost a year ago and was spurned by the government. The move was welcomed by the opposition SPD, which said it was ready for talks on the problems of east Germany. There was no immediate reaction from the trade unions. Mr Kohl will undoubtedly be looking for a commitment on wage restraint from the unions, increased contributions by industry to eastern investment, and further efforts to curb government spending and subsidies in the west. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said the object of the talks, against the background of 'an increasingly difficult world economic situation', would be to ensure the competitiveness of Germany as an investment location in the 1990s, and the rebuilding of the east German economy and administration. It should also finalise agreement on the financial burden-sharing between the central government, the federal states, and local authorities. Talks between officials at 'expert level' would begin in the chancellor's office next week, he said. One unanswered question last night was whether the Bundesbank would be given a seat at the table in an effort to co-ordinate monetary policy with the economic needs of the east. The call for a 'solidarity pact' from all sides of the German economy followed the chancellor's failure to persuade an emergency meeting of the three ruling coalition partners on Sunday to agree on new ways of financing the east German recovery.

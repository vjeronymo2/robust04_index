			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THE ONLY ROAR AT U.S. OPEN WILL COME FROM THE CROWD  </P> <P> At major tennis tournaments, players' whining is one form of noise pollution.  And there are times when the chair umpire has to quiet the crowd.  </P> <P> But to New York Mayor David Dinkins and Queens Borough President Claire  Shulman, the worst noise of all is the roar of jetliners over the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported that the two have persuaded the Federal Aviation  Administration to reroute planes taking off from La Guardia Airport during  tournament play Aug. 27-Sept. 9. Certain residents of Flushing won't like it,  but Dinkins and Shulman will take that chance.  </P> <P> The U.S. Tennis Assn. has said it will consider the noise problem when it  decides whether to keep the Open at the U.S. Tennis Center after its lease runs  out in 1994. In their request to the FAA, Dinkins and Claire emphasized "the  unique status of this event and its economic benefit to the city." They  estimated the latter at more than $100 million annually.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the first pitcher to win an All-Star game and a World  Series game in the same season?  </P> <P> 25-cent solution: From Wilfrid Sheed, in a Gentleman's Quarterly article  arguing for the admission of Shoeless Joe Jackson to baseball's Hall of Fame:  "Perhaps the best solution would be for the whole mishmash known as baseball to  declare a separation of powers, in which the commissioner punishes your sins  while the Hall of Fame acknowledges your achievements, the way having your face  on a stamp does."  </P> <P> Big Red machine: On the Santa Monica Freeway, Times staff writer Jerry Crowe  spotted a car decked out with University of Nebraska paraphernalia. Its bumper  sticker read: "If I owned Oklahoma and Hell, I'd live in Hell and rent out  Oklahoma."  </P> <P> Just be patient, baby: Recent headline in the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch:  "Al Davis makes eighth trip to Hall of Fame."  </P> <P> Root for the brain: Mario Johnson, Missouri's 6-foot-5, 314-pound defensive  tackle, told Doug Tucker of the AP that he'd been bullied as a kid.  </P> <P> Said Johnson: "My body matured before my brain did. That got me in trouble.  </P> <P> "Then, when I was in the fourth grade, high school kids would jump on me. I  never see those people anymore. I wish I did. It would be pay-back time."  </P> <P> Wild times seemed to follow him, even during his recruitment period.  </P> <P> At a party when he was visiting Pittsburgh, a man got shot, and police rushed  in. At a party at Colorado, a brawl broke out. "I really threw some punches,"  Johnson said.  </P> <P> Add Johnson: He finally narrowed his choices to Michigan and Colorado. But 10  minutes before he was to announce his decision at a news conference, a call  came from his older brother Lee, who was playing at Missouri.  </P> <P> Although the two had a difficult relationship at times, Mario recalled: "I  said, 'I'm going to miss the chance to play with you.' He said he really wanted  to play with me. . . . Then the emotion just burst out in me. I said, 'I love  you, and you come before any school. Where my brother is, I am going to be.' I  went out there and said Missouri is where I'm going."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Lefty Gomez of the Yankees in 1937.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, on George Steinbrenner's lawyers:  "The (Pete) Rose lawyers were better. They knew when to shut up." TED BROCK  </P></p>

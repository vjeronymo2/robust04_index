			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Problems of third country links with ERM highlighted EUROPEAN finance ministers meeting in Oporto at the weekend pointed to the difficulties inherent in having non-EC countries such as Sweden formally linking their currencies to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer, said: 'We want to extend the zone of monetary stability in the continent of Europe.' However, this would require close study of the technical and practical implicat ions. A Danish official said: 'It is not clear what joining the EMS would mean for these countries.' Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish economy minister, insisted that any agreement with third countries 'should not put at risk the motor role of the EMS in preparing for monetary union'. A report will be prepared for the next finance ministers' meeting in June. Under the EMS, currencies which come under pressure benefit automatically from multilateral action by the Community's central banks, while countries outside the EMS have to make their own arrangements. Sweden, which has applied to join the EC, wants to set bilateral parities with EMS currencies such as the D-mark, effectively putting the krona into the ERM. Norway and Finland have unilaterally linked their currencies to the Ecu, while Austria has unofficially pegged the schilling to the D-mark. Central and eastern European countries may soon be seeking similar links.</p>

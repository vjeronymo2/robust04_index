			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) Monday [9 May]  called for a Diet testimony by former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa over a loan he received from a trucking company,  resulting in a scandal that toppled him from office. The two  parties made the demand at a preparatory meeting of the House of  Representatives Budget Committee, claiming Hosokawa conceded  that remarks he made before the Diet and the documents he  presented concerning the loan included falsehood.    The LDP and the JCP also requested that three other persons,  including Hosokawa's Secretary Namio Yatsuka, be summoned to the  committee as witnesses over Hosokawa's shady fund management.    The 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed from Sagawa Kyubin  Co.,  a scandal-ridden trucking company, in 1982 created a Diet  stalemate which led to his resignation last month. Hosokawa  admitted in a press conference when he announced his resignation  that he received the interest on the loan as a political  contribution, partly revising his previous account that he had  fully repaid the loan with interest.    In connection with the fund management problem, Hosokawa's  secretary said last month that his private office had failed to  report investment profits of 29 million yen to tax authorities.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, however, hinted at a  press conference Monday [9 May] that the ruling coalition is not  enthusiastic about summoning Hosokawa before the Diet.    An executives' meeting of the upper house's budget committee  later decided to summon financial consultant Shuzo Fujiki before  the committee Wednesday as a witness in Hosokawa's alleged  involvement in the 1986 purchase of shares in telecommunications  giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.    The committee will formalize the decision in a meeting  Tuesday.    Hosokawa has denied he was personally involved in the  transaction, saying the deal was conducted by his late  father-in-aw, although he has admitted he provided collateral  for a loan from a stock investment firm to finance the purchase.    Opposition lawmakers claim Hosokawa used his position as a  regional governor to secure the loan under favorable conditions.    Fujiki has said at a press conference he arranged the loan  for Hosokawa and that it was his own deal.    The opposition camp apparently hopes Fujiki's testimony will  force the ruling coalition to allow Hosokawa himself to be  called before the committee and eventually force the former  premier to resign as a member of the Diet.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Treasury given regulatory role: City faces uncertainty over split of investment responsibilities REGULATORS and financial institutions in the City were braced for a period of uncertainty yesterday as it was confirmed that responsibility for investment regulation in the UK is to move to the Treasury from the Department of Trade and Industry. The overseeing of insurance companies is to remain with the DTI, in spite of earlier indications that this would also move to the Treasury. The division of responsibilities between the DTI and the Treasury has left many in the City uncertain about their future relationship with government, and prompted concern about the UK's ability to mount a unified front in Brussels in negotiations over the financial sector. The Association of British Insurers, the trade association of the UK's powerful insurance industry, said there would have to be a clear demarcation between the responsibilities of the two departments. It added that there was a case for having only one government department sponsoring the financial sector, rather than two. The switch to the Treasury, foreshadowed in the Conservative party manifesto ahead of last week's general election, will involve the 50-strong financial services division moving from the DTI in a matter of weeks. Responsibility for financial regulation at the Treasury will be taken on by Mr Anthony Nelson, the newly appointed economic secretary. Mrs Rachel Lomax, the Treasury's highly respected deputy chief economic adviser, will move next week to become the senior civil servant responsible for the area, which includes the Treasury's existing financial institutions and markets group. The reorganisation will allow the Treasury to speak on behalf of the UK in international discussions on financial regulation, mirroring the involvement of finance ministries in most other developed countries. It also reflects a desire to bring the supervision of financial conglomerates increasingly under one roof, the Treasury said. The division of responsibilities, though, means the DTI will retain overall responsibility for insurance companies, while the Treasury will take on responsibility for supervising their marketing operations. It will also leave the Stock Exchange reporting to the DTI for some purposes, including its responsibility for overseeing listings under European law, and the Treasury for others, such as its activities as a Recognised Investment Exchange. What happens to other activities, such as Taurus, its planned paperless trading system, remains unclear. The exchange yesterday said it had been given no indication of how the division of responsibilities would settle down. In a further division, the Treasury will have to agree an overhaul of retail investment regulation planned by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief investment regulator. But the DTI, which oversees competition policy, will have to clear these changes on competition grounds.</p>

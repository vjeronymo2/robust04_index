			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: HK TV broadcaster posts profits up 27% TELEVISION Broadcasts, Hong Kong's leading television company, announced a 27 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 163.5m (USDollars 21.08m) for the six months to June 1993, up from HKDollars 128.3m in 1992. Turnover was up only 8.5 per cent to HKDollars 871.5m, and the company said the earnings growth came from more efficient allocation of production resources and more aggressive marketing. However, international programme licensing revenues continued to be hampered by piracy from illegal Taiwanese cable TV operators. TVB is controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw and Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok, who attempted to sell a 22 per cent stake to Mr Rupert Murdoch in July, only to be thwarted by Hong Kong's television ownership restrictions. Mr Murdoch was interested in accessing TVB's library of Chinese language programmes. TVB faces competition with the launch of cable television in Hong Kong on October 31, and from Mr Murdoch, who recently bought 64 per cent of Star, the satellite broadcaster. The company plans to reap greater yields from its film library by launching its own satellite TV service next year. The directors declared an interim dividend of 15 cents a share, compared with 12.5 cents in 1992. The directors of Hong Kong department store operator Sincere Company, who awarded themselves HKDollars 115m (USDollars 14.9m) in remuneration, against net profit before extraordinary items of HKDollars 47m, yesterday agreed to repay a HKDollars 67m bonus fee. The payment had been approved by shareholders at the annual meeting, but was criticised by the financial community. Mr Walter Ma, chairman, believes the fees were fair and reasonable. However, he said that 'with a view to maintaining the good name of the company', the directors had volunteered to repay the fees. During the year the group sold its headquarters building, reaping a HKDollars 1.08bn extraordinary profit.</p>

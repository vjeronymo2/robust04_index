Indications and/or contraindications for the use of bone marrow transplantation in this patient population,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Specific patient selection criteria for the use of bone marrow transplantation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Information regarding the cost of this technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Technology Reviews are brief evaluations of health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies prepared by OHTA/AHCPR of the Public Health Service. Reviews may be conducted in lieu of a technology assessment because: the medical or scientific questions are limited and do not warrant the resources required for a full assessment; the available evidence is limited and the published medical or scientific literature is insufficient in quality or quantity for an assessment; or the time frame available precludes utilization of the full, formal assessment process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHCPR is interested in receiving information based on review and assessment of past, current, and planned research related to this technology, as well as a bibliography of published, controlled clinical trials and other well-designed clinical studies. Also requested is information related to the characteristics of the patient population most likely to benefit from the use of bone marrow transplants in the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as information on the clinical acceptability, effectiveness, and the extent of use of this technology. Information relevant to this review should be submitted in writing no later than [insert date 90 days after the date of publication] to OHTA at the address below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To enable the interested scientific community to evaluate the information included in this review, AHCPR will discuss in the review only those data and analyses for which a source(s) can be cited. Respondents are therefore encouraged to include with their submission a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the source of the data and comments provided. Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C. 299a&hyph;1(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could identify an individual or entity described in the information or could identify an entity or individual supplying the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written material should be submitted to: Thomas V. Holohan, M.D., Director, Office of Health Technology Assessment, AHCPR, 6000 Executive Boulevard, Suite 309, Rockville, MD 20852, Phone: (301) 594&hyph;4023. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Clifton R.

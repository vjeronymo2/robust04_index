			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: Travels with Fane, Wharton and Woolf - Books which would make good presents During the autumn when Bookermania is at fever-pitch some novels written on traditional lines tend to get passed over simply because they appear to be non-starters for the prize. Julian Fane's Eleanor (Constable, Pounds 14.99, 246 pages) which appeared in September is an example. It is the story of a girl born the wrong side of the blanket in 1906 to a woman in society who confines her to a foster home in South London. The two 'Auntys' who run it serve as working-class substitutes for the real mother whose visits to her natural daughter are as infrequent as they are fraught with tension and incomprehension. Her foster-mothers may tend to spoil Eleanor, but they also encourage her to develop her gift for piano-playing. This talent, combined with her striking beauty, gives her the entry into London society where she acquires a following of rich, doting admirers. Fane's novels have won plaudits from the likes of Lord David Cecil, Harold Nicolson, John Betjeman. In private life he is the Hon. Julian Fane, son of the 14th Earl of Westmorland and Hugo Vickers has identified Eleanor as being a portrait taken from life with the late Joan Drogheda contributing to the inspiration behind it, with Violet and Sidney Schiff (the writer Stephen Hudson) as among others drawn from life. Be that as it may - as one of Eleanor's counsellors might put it - this is a novel that imposes its own imaginative world upon the reader. It shuttles between the under- and the over- privileged, the sexually naive and the predatory. It contrasts the dedication required to succeed as an artist and the evanescent fame of the fashionable drawing-room. If you are looking for something to give a mother-in-law who is an incurable novel-addict, your problem may well be solved by Fane's book. It would, surely, have appealed to that chronicler of the American upper ten, Edith Wharton. Thanks to a film, due to be released over here in January, of her novel The Age of Innocence directed by Martin Scorsese with Daniel Day-Lewis, several of Wharton's novels of old New York society are currently being reissued in paperback. The final novel, left unfinished at her death, The Buccaneers, has just been published in a version completed by the American Whartonian, Marion Mainwaring (Fourth Estate (Pounds 14.99, 408 pages). Its heroines are denied entry into exclusive New York society because their fathers' money is too new. They come to London where they find plenty of well-born hostesses and suitors prepared to waive that impediment and welcome them in. The book is an example of high comic art. Another book that is having a renaissance because of the 'crossover' from an art-movie is Virginia Woolf's Orlando, a private joke that has blossomed into a money-spinner. The latest edition is in the attractive pocketable Bloomsbury Classics series, appropriately enough, at Pounds 9.95. In Orlando Virginia Woolf ranged across the centuries while in her own life we think of her as belonging to a world circumscribed by central London and Sussex. Jan Morris's ingenious contribution to the Woolf saga Travels with Virginia Woolf (The Hogarth Press Pounds 17.99, 245 pages) is a corrective to that view of her environment. Woolf went three times to Venice, for instance, one of them in 1912 on her honeymoon. 'There never was such an amusing and beautiful place', she said. Morris has strung together her reactions to France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Greece along with her journeys throughout the British Isles. When she was in France she stayed with Vanessa and Clive Bell at Cassis. 'Ever since Cassis' she tells Vanessa 'I have thought of you as a bowl of golden water which brims but never overflows'. But how did Vanessa think of sister Virginia? With the publication of Selected Letters of Vanessa Bell (Bloomsbury Pounds 25.00, 593 pages) edited by Regina Marler we can find the answer to that question and other outstanding ones. Here is a judicious selection of 600 letters out of 3,000; and none of them has appeared in print before. The last member of that circle to survive today is Frances Partridge, who in her nineties is enjoying great success with the publication of her diaries chronicling the fortunes of remnant members of the group in the 1960s. The period was a shattering one for her as it saw the deaths of both her husband Ralph and their son Burgo who had married Henrietta, daughter of David and Angelica Garnett. An earlier volume, Hanging On, covered the beginning of the decade; the new one Other People (Harper Collins Pounds 18, 297 pages) continues with the years 1963-66 when the author found the best antidote to grief was to involve herself whole-heartedly in the lives of her friends. As a diarist she is not in the Woolf class, but the book chronicles a most civilised way of life with penetrating comments on the personalities of her wide circle of friends.</p>

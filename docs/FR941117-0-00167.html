The scale of the full-size map must be 1:500,000, regardless of whether any different scale is used for the reduced map required in Exhibit II. The map must have a legend, a distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and longitude lines. The map must be clear and legible. The map must accurately show the cell sites (transmitting antenna locations), the entire CGSA, any extension of the composite service area boundary beyond the CGSA (see &sect;22.911) and the relevant portions of the cellular market boundary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Exhibit II_reduced map. This map must be a proportional reduction, to 81/2 &times; 11 inches, of the full-size map required for Exhibit I, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire cellular market by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 81/2 &times; 11 inch map of a different scale may be substituted, provided that the required features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and labeled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Exhibit III_engineering.

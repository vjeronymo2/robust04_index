			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CORETTA SCOTT KING SIDESTEPS CONTROVERSY ON CONVENTION CENTER  </P> <P> Coretta Scott King, the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., gave a lecture on  the civil rights movement to hundreds of students at the University of San  Diego Wednesday, but she sidestepped the controversy over the naming of the San  Diego Convention Center after the slain civil rights leader.  </P> <P> King, whose lecture was "Perspectives of Civil Rights," said she doesn't know  much about the issue and she tries to stay out of decisions made by local  communities with regard to honoring King.  </P> <P> "I'm not . . . informed about the specific issue. . . . Every city has its own  way" of honoring King, she told a reporter. "A lot depends upon . . . people  within the community."  </P> <P> King added that she doesn't like "getting involved with those kind of local  situations. There are so many people who always try to pull me into them.  </P> <P> "If we truly believe Dr. King made this nation a better nation, . . . citizens  of good will want to do -- in their own way -- the proper thing to recognize  that."  </P> <P> Nearly 800 students filled the Camino Hall auditorium to hear King's talk,  sponsored by the USD's Associated Students, Faculty Social Issues Committee,  and Women's Program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Gets Death Threats  </P> <P> "The average one of you (students) is 19 to 20 years of age; that means you  were not born, or being born, or just born when Martin Luther King Jr. was  assassinated almost 20 years ago," King told the students. "Unless you've had  the opportunity to learn about the civil rights movement and the history of the  African American struggle in this country, it is pretty foreign and alien to  you, particularly here in the West."  </P> <P> King, who said that, after 30 years, she still gets death threats, reminisced  about the desegregation effort in Alabama and the suffering of those committed  to nonviolent demonstration. "We kept the faith in the American dream.  Somewhere we read about this idea of democracy. . . . Somewhere, we got this  notion that all men are created equal."  </P> <P> King emphasized that changes in America's society have been made through the  "suffering and sacrifices of individuals, black and white, American people of  good will of all races."  </P> <P> Although "clearly we've come a long way since the days of the civil rights  movement," King cited injustices that still pervade our society, such as the  fact that black college graduates earn less than white high school graduates,  that racial conflicts have arisen on school campuses and the lack of blacks in  key governmental positions.  </P> <P> "We've come a long way in bringing people an awareness to what he stood for:  principles of nonviolence, human rights, an example of human dignity and  decency. He taught how to love unconditionally. That's important in a world  context. . . . We have to understand and respect and appreciate people who are  different from ourselves. That is what we really say America is all about. It  is a home for all of God's children."  </P> <P> King emphasized in her lecture that the principles of nonviolence can still  work in the 1990s, and have recently been applied in the Philippines and in the  struggle against apartheid in South Africa. "Nonviolence, when practiced . . .  really works," she said.  </P> <P> King, who noted that Wednesday was also International Women's Day, spoke on  behalf of women's rights, and encouraged women to be leaders in a "bold, new  vision" of a more peaceful world. "Women must be a moral vanguard for a more  compassionate, humanitarian world community," she said.  </P> <P> She also spoke Wednesday night on "Black-Jewish Relations: Conflict or  Healing?" at Congregation Beth El in La Jolla.  </P> <P> Councilman Wes Pratt, who attended the USD lecture, said he was not  disappointed that King refused to jump into the fray on the naming of the  convention center. "This is a local issue, and it's up to the local community  to recognize the contributions of Martin Luther King," Pratt said.  </P> <P> Pratt said he intends to move that the issue be sent back to the Port District  for a vote. "They begged the question; they should have voted it up or down,  they dragged this thing out and offended a significant amount of people with  the process."  </P></p>

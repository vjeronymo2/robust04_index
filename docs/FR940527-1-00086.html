			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The PTF would take the form of a percentage add-on to the Federal rate and would remain fixed for future periods. That is, unless a hospital had property tax costs in its most recently audited cost reporting year, it would not qualify for an adjustment. The PTF would be based on capital cost and property tax information provided on the most current audited cost report, as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Audited cost report property tax data; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Total capital cost for that year; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Property tax unit cost multiplier (Line 1 divided by Line 2); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Medicare inpatient capital cost; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Medicare inpatient property taxes (Line 3 times Line 4); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Medicare discharges; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Medicare inpatient property taxes per discharge (Line 5 divided by Line 6); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Federal capital rate (for fiscal year with most recent audited data); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Property tax factor (Line 7 divided by Line 8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach would be consistent with the philosophy of a prospective payment system. Although the initial determination of the PTF reflects a hospital's actual tax burden in a specific year, the PTF divorces payment from subsequent changes in the tax costs a hospital may experience. Because the PTF would be determined on the basis of tax costs from an audited cost reporting year and computed as a constant ratio of the Federal rate, States could not use property tax changes to capriciously increase Medicare reimbursement. Under this plan, Medicare's payment for taxes would increase with the underlying rate of increase in the Federal rate. One objection to the PTF is that over time the ratio of actual Medicare allowable property taxes to Medicare inpatient capital costs in a rate year could diverge from the ratio in the year used to set the PTF. Such a divergence would create windfall gains or losses for particular hospitals, but we know of no way to determine the magnitude of possible gains and losses to particular hospitals. The greater the magnitude of such gains and losses, the less appropriate the PTF methodology would be. We welcome information on this issue and recommendations about how to determine the magnitude of such gains and losses, while safeguarding the program from arbitrary increases in hospital taxes. A related problem is that applying a constant ratio to the Federal rate has the effect of increasing (or decreasing) the amount of the adjustment for property taxes across all hospitals by the same factor as the increase (or decrease) to the national rate. We currently have no data that show conclusively whether property taxes generally increase at the same rate as capital costs as a whole. This is difficult to determine since property tax assessment systems vary enormously from one locality to another, and changes in property taxes can reflect complicated changes in tax rates, methods of property assessment, and the tax base (that is, the percent of property value subject to tax assessment) in different localities, as well as appreciation of existing property values. We know of no definitive sources of information on this matter. We encourage submission of relevant information, observations, and suggestions. An alternative methodology could employ a hospital-specific add-on amount, as opposed to the hospital-specific ratio discussed above. Such an add-on could be determined on the basis of the base year tax costs per discharge attributable to Medicare. This alternative may be preferable if strong evidence emerges that property taxes do not tend to increase at the same rate as other capital costs. However, in that case, a tax increase index would need to be developed. We welcome comments on the merits of this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

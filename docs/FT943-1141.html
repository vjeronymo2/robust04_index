			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Architecture: The tyranny of the few - Colin Amery attacks the fashion for architectural contests Forget any idea you might have had that architecture is something that concerns people other than just architects. Just as you thought that the tyranny of the few was being seriously challenged by the thinking majority, something happens that forces you to think again. Any hope that the commonsense views of the users of buildings were beginning to have an effect on decision-makers is once again seen as an illusion. The recently-announced result of the competition to find an architect for a new Welsh Opera House in Cardiff is a temporary victory for a minority of once-fashionable arbiters of taste. The selection of the architect Zaha Hadid by, in my opinion, a misguided jury shows that the relentless promotion of once-fashionable ideas continues apace. Hadid is an archetypal member of that small group of international architects who perform, largely for each other, as a kind of travelling circus. The values they represent have little to do with local context, or practicality. For a long time they have been playing the part of a faded avant garde with an attitude that is supposed to make anyone who has different views look reactionary. The truth is that Hadid and her friends are now the reactionaries, representing the kind of absurd architectural arrogance that the public has long learned to distrust. Her work - it goes without saying that there are practically no built examples - is a late derivative of early 20th century Russian Constructivism. Her design for the Opera House in Cardiff might have been impressive as a student copy of a Constructivist painting, but as a building it has no reality. Her sources appear to be two-dimensional, and one can only hope that this Cardiff Opera House remains that way. There is only a slim chance that it will be built. It is only one among countless bidders for cash hand-outs from Britain's soon-to-be-launched national lottery. As a result, it is highly probable that Hadid's 'winning' entry will join the body of her unbuilt work. Her passing victory is itself a warning of the dangers of the fashion for architectural competitions. As it happens, the public architectural competition is probably here to stay. Already our masters in Brussels have decreed that any public project with European funding has to be the subject of a competition. There is also talk in the fetid corridors of Britain's own arts bureaucracy that lottery projects, including those to mark the millennium, will have to undergo the scrutiny of politically correct architectural juries. It will be jobs for the boys: fashionable friends of fashionable friends will dictate architectural taste and the man in the street, or the user of the building, is unlikely to get a look in. There is real danger in this fashion for architectural competitions, because the winner is inevitably determined by the composition of the jury. The chance of a disinterested jury with adequate representation from people who are not architects is very slim. It is clear that architect-led juries attempt to baffle the layman with jargon and pseudo-science. Juries are also much influenced by famous names and smooth talkers, and often do not spend much time looking at plans. There is a tendency for juries to be beguiled by the professional's conceptual approach which they hope will somehow evolve into a good building. It was inevitable that Sir Richard Rogers would win the chance to plan the revamping of the terrible South Bank, London's ugly arts centre on the Thames. It was equally inevitable that he would attempt to seduce the jury with a lot of talk about creating a 'people's palace'. We have already seen his ideas for the Thames in an exhibition at the Royal Academy when a series of what looked like oil refineries appeared to have sprouted along the river's banks. His proposal to dress up the monsters on the South Bank in a limited high-tech wardrobe looks superficial and unlikely to win that desert many more friends. One competition that particularly worries me is the one for the new Tate Gallery of contemporary art to be housed inside the shell of the old Bankside power station near London's Southwark Bridge. The names on the short-list are due to be announced today, but the Tate's director, Nicholas Serota, has almost certainly chosen his favourite. Serota is known for his severe taste and his penchant for what is internationally fashionable. He would like to see the austere Japanese architect Tadeo Ando bring his abstract concrete vision to London. The risk attached to the Bankside adventure is that the power station will become a great unapproachable catafalque for contemporary art. Unless the planning brief for the architectural competition insists upon a friendly mix of uses for Bankside power station, it will become an isolated monument full of arcane and unapproachable art in a part of London that is miles from its friends upstream at the Tate. I have no idea how the inevitable committees that will dole out the money to be generated by Britain's national lottery are to be advised about architecture. Are they happy to leave crucial decisions to the same old architectural mafia which largely promotes its close friends? Will the users be listened to? Or the man in the street? Judging from recent competition results, I believe that the time has come to realise that many winning schemes - which are often extremely expensive - are the architectural equivalent of the emperor's new clothes.</p>

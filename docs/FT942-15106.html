			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Sport: The softest section hits hard waters - Whitbread boats expected calm sailing, they got a shock, says Keith Wheatley / Sailing Punta del Este to Fort Lauderdale is supposed to be the soft section of the Whitbread race. Sunshine sailing up the coast of Brazil and across the Caribbean to Florida. Intrum Justitia's skipper Lawrie Smith even called it the 'girlie leg' in a not-so-subtle attempt to wind up the all-female crew of Heineken. What happened was a classic example of sailing's Inverse Weather Law, often expressed in the phrase: 'It's not usually like that here.' In the first week at sea a massive storm tore the mast out of race leader Tokio and sent the youth-crewed Dolphin scurrying for shelter in Rio de Janeiro with a 1.8m split in the hull. Even the powerful maxi-ketches, less susceptible to damage than the pared-down and minimal W60 sloops, found themselves fighting for survival. New Zealand Endeavour and La Poste have both suffered serious hull delamination and been forced to slow down. 'The damage is on the waterline about 10m back from the bow,' reported NZE skipper Grant Dalton. 'The exterior and interior skins are intact but the inner core has sheared and is flexing alarmingly. 'We cut up floorboards and bent them around the inside of the hull over the damaged area. Then we cut up bunks and used the piping to brace the floorboards and stop the movement. The end result is that our navigator and the cook have lost their bunks and a few floorboards are missing.' Aboard Heineken the women had to cope with the yacht rock-and-rolling amid the stench of spilt fuel. 'The bumping from these head seas has been unbelievable, as bad as Cape Horn. One of the tanks has split and we've got the bilges full of diesel,' reported skipper Dawn Riley. Tokio's mishap was heartbreaking for a crew that had built a 13-hour lead over its rivals and were working on a conservative strategy of guarding that cushion all the way back to the Southampton finish in early July. Chis Dickson, the young New Zealand skipper, acknowledged the severity of the blow when he sent this Inmarsat-fax message to his arch Kiwi rival Ross Field, skipper of Yamaha: 'To Yamaha from Tokio: All yours boys. It's up to you to beat the Euros.' Field took the patriotic injunction to heart. He seized the lead within hours with some adroit tactical sailing. As the yacht approached the north-eastern tip of the Brazilian coast it hung out to the east and then cut in close to the coast. 'At one stage we wanted to be the most easterly boat and then we switched to be the most westerly. That tactic gave us good wind angles as we came into the headland and the boys sailed well,' reported Field. 'We managed to sneak through in daylight and pick up the inshore current.' Although Yamaha was sailing in only 8m of water at one point, Tokio was actually alongside in the Brazilian port of Santos, close to Sao Paulo, trying to tidy up the 11m stump of her mast into a more effective jury-rig. Unfortunate airline schedules meant that a new mast section would take another four days to reach Brazil. Dickson decided to spend the time plugging up the coast and meet the new spar further north. 'We have tidied up the broken rig and now have an improved lash-up able to carry three times the sail area of the previous jury rig which is still not much,' said Dickson. 'But the forecast is good and we hope to make between five and 10 knots to Vitoria. 'The crew were fantastic in Santos and worked for 24-hours without sleep to get us out of the pits.' At the same time engineers and boatbuilders flown out from Britain managed to get Dolphin back to sea after 18-hours alongside in Rio. Modern racing yachts, and an increasingly large number of cruising boats, have hulls built in a 'sandwich' composition. There is an outer skin, usually only a few millimetres thick, of a hard plastic material, then a core of foam (sometimes balsa wood) then another thin inner plastic skin. When bonded together it is immensely strong. When the layers come apart, or delaminate, the hull begins to flex and can simply fall apart. Almost none of the Whitbread yachts have escaped this process. Construction specifications will certainly be revised after the race finishes. However, as the fleet slowly negotiates the windless Doldrums this weekend, with Yamaha trying to preserve her 50-mile lead through a meteorological lottery, stomachs are a bigger issue than hull technology. Because of the slow progress on leg five, the boats are running short of food. Aboard Intrum Justitia, Smith anticipates serious hunger. 'We cut down our food stores on this leg to save weight and because we didn't expect these conditions,' he said. 'We've catered for only 24 days and it's going to be very difficult to start rationing our supplies since we are already eating relatively little.'</p>

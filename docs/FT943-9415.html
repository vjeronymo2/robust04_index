			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / GKN upbeat after interim advance Profits at GKN, the automotive components and defence engineering group, rose 62 per cent to Pounds 97m in the first half of this year. The strong profits rise, from Pounds 60m in the first half of 1993, came despite a turnover increase of only 9 per cent to Pounds 1.52bn. Sir David Lees, chairman, was upbeat about prospects for the full year. 'We now expect that 1994 will turn out to be a much better year than was thought likely at the end of 1993.' Much of the improvement was due to cost-cutting and an upturn in several of GKN's businesses. The advance was even more notable when Westland, the recently acquired UK helicopter maker, was excluded. Without it, operating profits rose 29 per cent while turnover increased only 3 per cent. Margins improved in the automotive components business as manufacturing costs were cut in Germany and the UK, and the continental European car market started to recover. Sir David said the French and Spanish car markets had been lifted by government tax incentives for new car purchases. The UK and US car markets were continuing to recover, while the important German market was still depressed. The company expects western European car production to grow by 7 per cent this year. GKN is still cutting costs and spent a further Pounds 10m on redundancy and restructuring in the first half. Production of the Warrior armoured vehicle fell as a contract for the British Army neared completion. It should pick up later this year when GKN starts manufacturing the Warrior for Kuwait. Profits in the automotive and engineered products division, which includes defence, rose 29 per cent to Pounds 62m. Sir David said prospects for helicopter orders at Westland were good, with the company's Apache model a strong contender to win the Pounds 2bn competition for a new British Army attack helicopter. GKN is making provisions after its acquisition of Westland which includes a Pounds 46m write-down of stocks at Westland Aerospace and a Pounds 19m loss on revaluation of Westland properties. After strong cash inflows from the Pounds 190m settlement of Westland's legal battle with the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, the group had net cash of Pounds 75.5m at the half year, including customer advance payments. Earnings per share rose 73 per cent to 16.6p (9.6p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 8.0p. The shares closed 6p higher at 657p. Lex, Page 14; UES results, Page 16</p>

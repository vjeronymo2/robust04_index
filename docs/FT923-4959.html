			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close to an uncertain session AN IRREGULAR trading session saw the UK equity market regain the FT-SE 2,300 mark to close very firmly yesterday, although much of the impetus came from other sectors of the London financial arena. Stock index futures led the underlying blue chip stocks, and a recovery from early weakness was also encouraged by gains in government bonds and in the December contract on sterling futures, or short sterling as it is known in the City. Also, as equities moved towards the close, the pound was edging higher against the D-Mark. Dealers doubted whether the big institutions had played much part in the recovery in equities which left the FT-SE Index ahead by 14.6 at 2,313.0 at its final reading. Trading volume was swollen by a handful of individual deals, notably a bought deal of 9.6m shares in Enterprise Oil. The day's Seaq volume total of 431.6m shares implied a return to more normal business levels after the bank holiday weekend. Tuesday's Seaq total of 312.8m was worth only Pounds 589.5m in terms of retail business. The session opened nervously, with traders apprehensive regarding prospects for today's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council. Worries over the implications of sterling's weakness for domestic interest rate prospects continued to overshadow equity investors. A leading UK brokerage house expressed bearish views on the stock market and share prices were soon undermined by a disappointing start in stock index futures. The Footsie was soon down to the 2,282 area without seeing any great weight of selling. At this point the market rebounded and steady, but not strong, demand for the blue chips sent the Footsie to just above 2,314. Optimism flagged later when Wall Street made a slow start to its new session, showing a gain of only 4.32 on the Dow in early deals. The futures market came to the aid of equities again at the close, taking share prices to just under the day's best levels. Market strategists pointed to the presence of several of the leading London securities houses in the derivatives markets as an indication that technical forces had driven the rally in share prices. With the interest rate outlook still the prime factor in the market, particular attention was paid to the recovery in sterling futures, which were regarded as heavily oversold following pressure from a leading UK bank last week. Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon commented: 'September 20 (the date of the French referendum on the Maastricht proposals) is still a long way away; and DM 2.7780 is very close.' The UK stock market is likely to remain highly nervous until that date, and vulnerable to changes of mood in the interest rate futures markets. Yesterday's recovery was led by gains in the international stocks which had suffered particularly severely during the market's downturn. Domestic issues, including the store and building shares which are vulnerable to interest rate worries, found it more difficult to join in the market's upswing.</p>

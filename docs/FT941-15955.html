			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: State plans further Telmex sale The Mexican government plans to sell Dollars 520m of its stock in Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the monopoly telephone company, through a convertible bond. Nacional Financiera, the state development bank, said it would begin the paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Mexican equivalent next week. The offering is equivalent to 1.53 per cent of Telmex stock. The convertible bond offering will be managed by Merrill Lynch. In the past, Goldman Sachs has managed the government's offerings of Telmex stock. Mr Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance, said the money would go into the government's special contingency fund of reserves. He denied reports that the offering had been timed to finance spending in the troubled state of Chiapas, where there was a violent uprising last week. Mr Ortiz said the government sold the other 3 per cent of Telmex that it holds between September and December last year in the open market, for about Dollars 1bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia has joined a small number of countries  manufacturing tank laser range-finders. They are produced from  local components and using state-of-the-art scientific and  technical methods, Dr. Radovan Antanasijevic of the Zemun  Physics Institute has said.    Dr. Antanasijevic, director of the center for applied  Physics  at the Zemun Institute, told a TANJUG correspondent that the  Institute has developed and manufactured the tank laser  range-finder within less than a year, despite the shortage of  documentation and equipment.    The laser range-finder is a complex optical electronic  system, used as part of modern combat equipment for defining the  distance of the target quickly and with precision. The  probability of hitting the target at first attempt is over 70  percent, due to the application of laser and other  state-of-the-art range measuring and information processing  systems.    The range-finder produced in Yugoslavia measures distances  of  up to 10,000 meters, with an error margin of five meters.  [passage omitted]</p>

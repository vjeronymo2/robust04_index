			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES BOESKY PLEA FOR EARLY PRISON RELEASE  </P> <P> A federal judge refused to let convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky out of  prison Wednesday, saying the three-year sentence he got in Wall Street's  biggest insider trading scandal "is not unjust."  </P> <P> Boesky, who has already served a year in prison, claimed that his help led to a  record plea bargain deal by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the subsequent  indictment of its "junk bond" chief Michael Milken and others on racketeering  and securities fraud charges.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Boesky's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker to  reduce his sentence to time already served, which would allow his immediate  release.  </P> <P> But Lasker said Boesky has already been given a number of breaks and "I cannot  in good conscience conclude" that "he should be given further credit."  </P> <P> Boesky's lawyers did not immediately return telephone calls for comment on  Lasker's decision.  </P> <P> The judge noted that although Boesky admitted to participating in numerous  shady deals, he was allowed to plead guilty to just one count, which carried a  maximum five-year sentence and for which Lasker only sentenced him to three  years.  </P> <P> Lasker also noted that even without any actions by him or the parole board,  "Boesky will be released from custody less than a year from today, which is to  say, that the actual period he will have served will be slightly more than two  years. Such a sentence is not unjust in the circumstances."  </P> <P> Boesky has supplied information used for civil or criminal charges in more than  a dozen cases in the United States and Britain. In exchange, Boesky was allowed  to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to lie to the SEC.  </P></p>

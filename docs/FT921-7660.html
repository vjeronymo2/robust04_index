			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: Folly inherent in call for a managed economy Sir, The chairman of Rover Group attacks the government for its espousal of market economics (February 18) but fails to tell us what corporate mechanisms are implied in his call for a national industrial strategy. Is Mr George Simpson suggesting, for instance, another National Enterprise Board? If so, he would do well to reflect that, from over 100 investments made by the NEB, 35 had to be put into receivership or went into liquidation; 38 were sold at a loss to the taxpayer (including one which lost Pounds 34m on its own), leaving a mere 29 to be sold at a profit. Incidentally, the Labour party's proposal for something called British Technology Enterprise, to be run along similar lines to the NEB, shows that it is not only Mr Simpson who needs to re-learn the lesson of this particular corporate folly. Nor does Mr Simpson help his case by citing a so-called managed economy like Germany's. There, for example, record public borrowing, excessive state subsidies, heavily bureaucratic regulation and high corporate taxation all add to the competitive pressures facing German business leaders compared with the freer conditions applying in the seemingly reviled UK. The Rover chief's ill-advised excursion into the political arena would carry more weight if and when his company manages to get within sight of the proposed output of his north of England Nissan competitors. In the meantime, his shareholders can take little comfort from what looks conspicuously like special pleading. Colin Smith, 34 Greycoat Gardens, Greycoat Street, London SW1P 2QB</p>

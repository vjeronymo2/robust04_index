			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--MENA has learned that the  Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th  and General Amnon Shahaq, have agreed on the immediate  repatriation of 35 Palestinian deportees who belong to the Fatah  Movement. In fact, agreement has been reached on the names of  those who will return as part of confidence-building measures  between the two sides.    Sources close to the negotiations noted that final agreement  was also reached on reopening all PLO, Fatah, and other popular  organizations' offices in the occupied territories, which were  closed recently after the intifadah activities were stepped up.  These offices were officially allowed to reopen once the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed on 13  September 1993.    The same sources clarified that measures to reopen these  offices are being taken by the Israeli military ruler for all  the occupied areas.    Moreover, sources close to the negotiations' delegations  have  affirmed that negotiations on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will  resume on Sunday in Cairo.    The sources said that all necessary measures will be taken  to  speed up these negotiations so that they will end in about one  week, or ten days at the latest. These sources clarified that  there are four different committees: The Economic Committee,  which was meeting in Paris under the chairmanship of Israeli  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Ahmad Quray', alias  Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic Department, will meet in  Cairo with the rest of the committees. The other three  committees are the Security Affairs Committee chaired by Dr.  Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq; the Civil Affairs  Committee chaired by lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi and General Gadi  Zohar, deputy director of civil administration in the West Bank;  and the Autonomy Privileges Committee, which will set the final  arrangements for the transfer of Palestinian authority in Gaza  and Jericho.    The same sources clarified that concerted efforts are being  exerted to end the negotiations within the coming week so that  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin can sign the final agreement no later than 12  April 1994.    It is worth mentioning that the Palestinian and Israeli  delegations actually started discussing the agenda of the  remaining issues on implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement  late last night.</p>

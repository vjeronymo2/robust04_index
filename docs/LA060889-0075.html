			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FRANKFURT COMPANY INTRODUCES ITS STREET-STYLE BALLET TO L.A.  </P> <P> Not long ago, ballet was the torchbearer for contemporary art, but, these days,  the Anglo-American audience pays handsomely to be insulated from its own time  -- to be lulled with visions of an Imperial Russian past and to encounter  modernity, if at all, through the softening filters of neoclassicism,  neo-romanticism, neo-expressionism, neo-vaudeville.  </P> <P> Well, the ballets of William Forsythe aren't neo-anything, and that's the first  shock of seeing his Frankfurt Ballet: watching this 39-year-old American make  the ballet vocabulary speak powerfully in the present tense.  </P> <P> Abrasive, idiosyncratic, yet somehow deeply familiar, Forsythe's choreography  has graced a lot of repertories lately. But at the Wiltern Theatre -- where his  37-dancer company made its West Coast debut Tuesday, courtesy of the Dance  Gallery's new presenting network -- it isn't a novel change of pace. No, this  time it is simply all the ballet you're going to get and you'd better be  prepared to dump any highfalutin notions of nuance, hierarchy or glamour.  </P> <P> Forsythe and his house composer Tom Willems understand the rhythms and  sonorities of the moment, the information overload, sense of irony and  simmering frustrations that disconnect urban young people from any soothing  backdated art. Their work identifies strongly with those young people, maybe  most of all with their anger.  </P> <P> Beyond anything else, however, their creations harness the energy we find  stifled in our society and project it so forcefully that the codified steps and  shapes of ballet fuse with street style and pop dance in potent, liberating  experiences.  </P> <P> Created for the Paris Opera Ballet two years ago, "In the Middle, Somewhat  Elevated" finds the nine-member cast coiled up and kicking out -- but the kicks  end in positions straight from the classical lexicon, just as the mobility of  the upper torso and the loose slump-walking come from other idioms entirely.  Ballet is in the bones of this work, rock 'n' roll in its blood, so as Willems'  score dramatically thumps and wheezes along, the overlapping solos and duets  are double-edged. We see an aggressive contemporary sensibility heightened into  art, and also classical virtuosity freed from courtly manners.  </P> <P> The recent San Francisco Ballet production may be clearer in its  juxtapositions, but Elizabeth Corbett of the Frankfurt cast need yield to no  one in stamina or precision as the leggy lady in the pageboy -- the closest  thing to a ballerina role on the entire program. With its dramatic lunges on  pointe and intricate contortions, the duet between Maia Rosal and Glen Tuggle  also typifies the molten virtuosity of this showpiece, a pure statement of  Forsythe's ability to strip classicism of its cultural accretions yet keep it  full of feeling.  </P> <P> In "Same Old Story" (1987), Forsythe stages two simultaneous stage events: a  spoken minidrama at a kitchen table, center, and another of his surging dance  abstractions for a large corps. The three people at the table and the dancers  don't notice one another, us or the curtain continually falling and rising in  front of everyone. Self-absorption is a condition of existence here and we all  know why.  </P> <P> Sometimes the dancing relates to the spoken text (normally fairy tales, but on  this occasion a bizarre collection of newspaper clippings), but that could be  happenstance. In any case, Forsythe's point seems to lie beyond easy ironies in  all the big contrasts he sets up: between speech and movement, of course, but  also between naturalism and classicism, solo and corps dancing, an expansive  versus an intimate scale.  </P> <P> Distinctive voices are also central -- with small introductory dance solos  proving as sharply individual as the timbre and accents of the speakers. Once  again, colorless light from directly overhead re-creates the generalized  fluorescence of public spaces, but Willems' effects vary from subdued clicks  and heartbeats to an assaultive blare.  </P> <P> In the audaciously non-balletic "Skinny," we see Forsythe transforming his own  paranoia into a defiant life-affirming statement. This apocalyptic full-company  vehicle (a replacement for the scheduled "Questioning of Robert Scott") was  choreographed by Forsythe and associate Amanda Miller in 1986 after the  American bombing of Libya and arose from their fears of retaliation against  Americans abroad.  </P> <P> Thus we see the flicker of offstage fires and people running desperately with  pails. We hear a text relentlessly evolving from cheery platitudes to a warning  about dreams going up in smoke. We feel the panic of people at risk -- and yet.  . . .  </P> <P> These hand-clapping, arm-swinging, shadowboxing phalanxes in their loose  T-shirts, shorts and street shoes are dancing at an awesome pitch, not so much  consumed as released by the fear that inspired Forsythe and Miller. They are  fully present, completely alive, incandescent, and in the theater how can we  ever feel sorry about that?  </P></p>

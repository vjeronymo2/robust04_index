			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tamara Smirnova: "Shock-Free, But Painful. The </F> Duma Agonizes Over the Budget"]    [Text] The draft federal budget for 1994 did not reach the  State Duma until the end of March. The budget message will  first be studied in committees and commissions, after which the  Duma committees will present their findings. Parliamentary  hearings will take place 5 and 7 April, and on 13 April there  will be a discussion on the first reading at a plenary session.  The work of agreeing the budget will last for a further month  to six weeks.    How is the budget structured in general? Revenue is set at a  level of 120 trillion rubles [R], expenditure at R182 trillion,  with a planned deficit of 62 trillion.    The Russian Finance Ministry's concept is formulated thus:  No shock, but a tough credit and monetary policy and realistic  collection of revenue. The revenue side of the budget will  increase through a growth in the volume of indirect taxes,  value-added tax, and excise duties. As for the expenditure  side, there is nothing to rejoice about. Finance has been cut  for practically everything. The biggest expenditure items of  the budget are: defense -- R37 trillion; targeted support for  sectors -- R33 trillion; aid to authorities at other levels --  18 trillion; social and cultural programs -- 12.5 trillion. The  Finance Ministry has maintained the level of expenditure on  social needs at the 1993 volume.    It is planned to cover the expenditure items by means of  Central Bank credits, transactions involving securities, and  foreign sources, but mostly by means of tougher financial  discipline, first and foremost taxation discipline.    It is predicted that inflation will fall to 15 and then 10  percent per month. Consumer prices will increase fivefold, and  the decline in production will be 12 percent. These figures are  contained in a forecast of Russia's socioeconomic development  for 1994 which was discussed at a session of the Russian  Federation Government Presidium. The document has been sent to  parliament as an appendix to the draft federal budget.</p>

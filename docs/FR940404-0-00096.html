			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amended regulations are expected to help reduce inmate abuse of telephone privileges. By requiring that potential recipients of inmate telephone calls be notified that they have been placed on an inmate's telephone list (other than immediate family members or those persons who are already on the inmate's approved visitor list) and by limiting calls to numbers on the telephone list, the amended regulations help protect the public, including witnesses, victims, or other people who do not wish to have contact with the inmate, from receiving unwanted inmate telephone calls. In addition, by permitting the Associate Warden to deny placement of a number on an inmate's telephone list, the regulations provide an opportunity to prohibit telephone calls to persons that are determined to be a threat to the security and good order of the institution, or a threat to the public, before the calls occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that the Bureau removes a number from an inmate's telephone list and the inmate then uses the telephone to harass that individual (by using another inmate's PAC number, for example), the inmate can be disciplined for violating regulations, as the inmate is required to acknowledge that persons on the telephone list are agreeable to receiving the inmate's telephone calls and that the calls will be made for permissible purposes. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(1) and &sect;540.104, formerly &sect;540.103. The telephone list requirement is intended to help protect inmates as well. In a debit-billing system, there will be some incentive for one inmate (Inmate A) to use another inmate's (Inmate B's) PAC number to make telephone calls charged to Inmate B's account. However, this incentive is substantially reduced if Inmate A can only call the approved numbers on Inmate B's telephone list. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters claimed that inmates should be permitted to call more than 20 numbers. The proposed rule limited the telephone lists to 20 numbers because the Bureau believes that number is high enough to accommodate the needs of the average inmate without undermining the security justifications for the list and unduly burdening Bureau staff. This belief is supported by a recent sampling of five ITS-activated institutions, which indicates that the inmate ITS accounts, on average, listed fewer than 10 telephone numbers and that 92 percent of the inmate ITS accounts listed fewer than 20 telephone numbers. Specifically, of the approximately 10,730 inmate ITS accounts surveyed, less than 900 inmate ITS accounts listed 20 telephone numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in response to comments that some inmates desire to submit more than 20 numbers, the Bureau is amending these regulations to allow an inmate to place up to 30 numbers on the telephone list. The Bureau believes that for those inmates with such a need, the submission of up to 30 numbers may effectively be handled by staff without undermining the security reasons for maintaining a list of numbers. The final rule also provides that the Associate Warden may authorize the placement of additional numbers on the inmate's telephone list based on the inmate's individual situation, e.g., size of family. See 28 CFR 540.101(a). This change should accommodate the requests of inmates desiring to submit more than 30 numbers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the inmate commenters seeking unlimited numbers on his telephone list also requested authority to call 800 numbers and to receive pre-paid credit cards from telephone companies. Use of 800 numbers and pre-paid credit cards would undermine the correctional management objectives of the ITS listed above in the section entitled ``Purpose of the Amended Regulations''. If an inmate has a need to call an 800 number under compelling circumstances, a request should be made for a staff-assisted call, as provided in 28 CFR 540.105(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments suggested that the Bureau should permit inmates to submit updates to the list more frequently than once a quarter. The Bureau believes that the amendment to the final rule providing that inmate telephone lists may contain up to 30 numbers, rather than 20, should reduce generally the need for more than quarterly updates, as provided in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the final rule also adds the phrase ``at least'' to provide the Warden the authority to allow more frequent updates, if appropriate. In addition, if an inmate has a demonstrated need for making a call to a number that is not on the inmate's telephone list, the inmate may be permitted to make additional calls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerns were expressed about delays in processing updates to the telephone lists, once inmates have submitted their requests. The final rule will eliminate processing delays caused by the requirement in the proposed rule that the written authorization form be returned prior to placement of the telephone number on the inmate's telephone list. The final rule discontinues use of this form and ordinarily permits the immediate placement of telephone numbers on the inmate's telephone list. In addition, to avoid undue processing delays, the Bureau's implementing guidelines provide that once initial lists and updates are submitted, staff will process them ordinarily within ten working days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

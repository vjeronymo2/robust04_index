			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credit Commercial earnings rise 10.7% CREDIT Commercial de France (CCF), one of France's leading retail banking groups, increased net profits by 10.7 per cent to FFr541m (Dollars 95.4m) in the first half of this year, in spite of the sluggish state of the French banking sector. Mr Charles de Croisset, who took over as chairman of CCF earlier this year following the appointment of Mr Michel Pebereau as head of the Banque Nationale de Paris banking group, said that one of the main reasons for the growth in CCF's profits had been its efforts to 'strengthen cost control' to offset the effects of the difficult trading climate. Although other French banks, notably the loss-making Credit Lyonnais, have come under intense pressure in the past year, CCF has remained robust because of its niche position as a value-added retail bank and its relatively low exposure to the weaker areas of the economy, such as small businesses. Net banking income rose by 17.6 per cent to FFr4.62bn. Operating profits rose by 54.9 per cent to FFr1.81bn. However, CCF was forced to raise its provisions by 49.5 per cent to FFr945m. Mr de Croisset attributed the increase to 'the difficult economic environment and the impact of a deterioration in the property market.' CCF, like other French banks, has also had to take account of the extra costs it may incur as a result of the general reforms of pensions for employees in the banking industry. The group set aside FFr800m in the first half of the year to cover this.</p>

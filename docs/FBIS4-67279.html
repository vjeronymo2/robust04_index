			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan is planning to enact  a law to prevent money laundering, Justice Minister Ma Ying-Jeou  said Tuesday [17 May].    Ma made the statement while meeting with a delegation from  the G-7 Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a group of  regulators set up in 1989 by the Group of Seven industrial  countries to fight cross-border financial crime.    Many industrial countries, including the United States,  France, Britain, Australia, Italy, Holland, and Luxembourg, have  passed legislation outlawing money laundering.    Ma said the Ministry of Justice will start to draft  regulations soon in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and  the Central Bank of China to prevent laundering of criminal  money from drug and other illegal dealings.    "The legislation is needed as Taiwan is playing an  increasingly important role in global trade and financial  exchanges," Ma noted.    Under the draft regulations, Taiwan will require banks to  report suspicious transactions to government authorities.    The draft bill is expected to be completed by the end of  this  year, Ma said.    The FATF delegation, headed by John Gieve, British  undersecretary of treasury, said the Paris-based organization  initiated in the 1988 G-7 economic summit would provide  counseling services for Taiwan to pass legislation against money  laundering.    The group, composed of experts from America, Japan and  Britain, arrived in Taipei Sunday to check Taiwan's progress in  the fight against money laundering. They will depart Wednesday.</p>

The agenda  for his talks with Boris Yeltsin is known: questions of  security in Europe and the world, nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons, and settlement of regional conflicts, questions of  bilateral relations, mutual exchange of information on the  development of the countries they represent.    On learning of the visit in advance, the Ukrainian  leadership  tried to amend it, proposing that Clinton visit Ukraine. The  Washington Administration explained to the Ukrainians that  President Clinton considers it more expedient to visit the  capital of Belarus, which is unconditionally fulfilling the  international pledges it has made on the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons. And Washington sees this as a most important  principle in the creation of a system of collective security in  Europe ad in the world as a whole.    The content of what were unsuccessful talks for the  Ukrainian  leadership was made public. This resounding diplomatic slap in  the face showed who is master of the present situation. It was  made clear to Kiev officials that Washington is not merely  unhappy with Kiev's behavior, but is annoyed and does not  consider it necessary to conceal its annoyance. What is this  unusual situation all about? [passage omitted]    The world community's concern is understandable. Following  the breakup of the USSR, 130 SS-19 ICBM's, each with six  warheads, 46 modern missiles, each with 10 warheads, 564 cruise  missiles, and 30 strategic bombers with 416 warheads on board  were left on the territory of the Ukraine. That makes 1,656  warheads in all. That is greater than the French, British, and  Chinese nuclear arsenals put together. So Ukraine is the  world's third biggest nuclear power (after the United States and  Russia).    In Ukraine's current conditions of political instability  this  nuclear potential could be a threat to European security. The  public in neighboring countries knows, for example, that the  founding session of the Ukrainian National Fascist Party took  place in December in the Officers' Club in Lvov. It said that  its aim is the forcible expansion of Ukrainian borders by  conquering part of the territory of Russia, Belarus, Poland, and  the Baltic states. We know how nervous the West was when it  heard the results of the elections in Russia and of  Zhirinovskiy's party's success in them. What if the elections in  Ukraine in March follow the Russian model?...    Of course, the situation does not appear dangerous at the  moment. As is known, not a single missile in Ukraine can be  launched without Russia's consent, since the keys to the launch  codes are in Moscow. But it is also known that Ukrainian  specialists have been trying secretly for a year to decipher the  codes. What if they decipher them and start blackmaining the  West in an attempt to extort financial compensation?    The United States is obviously seriously concerned about  this  prospect, aware of the true reasons why Kiev is clinging to the  nuclear weapons. It was obviously no accident when John  Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff,  recently let drop that defense against Russia is certainly not  the reason why Kiev wants to keep the nuclear weapons on its  territory.    Is that not why Bill Clinton himself telephoned Leonid  Kravchuk on 30 November to complain about Ukrainian policy in  the sphere of its position on nuclear weapons?    Russia's position on this question is clear and it has been  repeatedly expressed by President Yeltsin and Andrey Kozyrev:  Ukraine must not join the club of nuclear powers. To all  appearances, we are at one with the leading powers of the West,  in particular the United States, on this question.    The United States and Russia are not shutting Kiev out of a  dialogue on this question. According to the information that is  available, although Clinton has refused to go to Kiev during his  Jaunuary trip, he will allow the organization of a tripartite  meeting involving the three presidents on the question of  dismantling Ukraine's nuclear missiles. So it is very possible  that Leonid Kravchuk will be invited to Moscow during the 12-15  January period.</p>

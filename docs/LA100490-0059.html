			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SHOCKED BY STATEMENT  </P> <P> Along with more than 200 others, I attended the LAFCO hearing on Sept. 12 in  support of the request of Simi Valley for a quick review of the proposed  annexation of the Jordan and Runkle ranches.  </P> <P> I was shocked to read a published remark by Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk,  2nd District, that most of us came because of the inducement of "a free ride  and a free meal."  </P> <P> Like most of the others there, I came on my own. I felt strongly enough to take  time off from work to speak out on what I consider to be one of the best  opportunities offered to the people of Ventura County in my recollection.  </P> <P> Ms. VanderKolk, being new to the area and new to politics, has yet to learn  that most of the people she has been elected to represent are not so crass as  to be bought for the price of a free bus ride or a doughnut.  </P> <P> JOSEPH NORICK  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUGE DOWNTOWN PROJECT TRIMMED  </P> <P> John G. Davies, president of San Diego's downtown redevelopment agency, said  Friday that he is "encouraged" by revisions that Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp.  made this week to its $950-million downtown development plan but that "much  remains to be done."  </P> <P> Santa Fe announced what it calls "major concessions" in cutting back the  proposed square footage and "undergrounding" most of the parking for its  proposed huge development surrounding its train depot on Kettner Boulevard near  Pacific Highway.  </P> <P> The city signed an agreement with Santa Fe in 1983 permitting a  4.2-million-square-foot hotel, office and retail complex on 17 acres around the  depot.  </P> <P> Susan Saltzer, a spokeswoman for Santa Fe, said its original proposal called  for office buildings, hotels and restaurants covering more than 4 million  square feet. The revised proposal reduces the plan to 3.8 million square feet.  </P> <P> She said the '83 proposal called for enough above-ground parking to accommodate  4,866 cars, which would have increased the square footage to more than 6  million.  </P> <P> She said the new proposal calls for 3,800 of the 4,400 parking spaces to be  "below grade," or underground. The revisions also accommodate a Centre City  Development Corp. request in Santa Fe's offering to give up right of way for an  extension of the San Diego Trolley. CCDC is in charge of downtown  redevelopment.  </P> <P> One point of contention in the new proposal is the fate of a vacant baggage  building now attached to the depot. Saltzer said Santa Fe executives feel the  baggage building should be demolished; Davies said CCDC wants it preserved,  because it is a candidate for the National Register of Historic Places, even  though it hasn't been used in years.  </P> <P> "Certainly, that would be an important loss," Davies said. "So, we're anxious  to have them revise the plan still further. The baggage building is part of the  symmetry of the building itself. Once it's gone, the building will look  truncated."  </P> <P> Davies said CCDC opposed Santa Fe's original proposal because the agency wanted  more views of the waterfront preserved and more open spaces for "urban parks"  included.  </P></p>

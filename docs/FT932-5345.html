			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Adviser fined over home-income plans DBS Financial Management, the UK's largest independent financial adviser group, has been fined Pounds 60,000 by Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers. The fine relates to the activities of Sandy Park Financial Services, an appointed representative of DBS, and its sale of home-income plans in the period 1988 to 1990. The plans were devised as a way for (mostly elderly) investors to unlock capital in their homes by remortgaging their homes and investing the proceeds in the hope of earning enough to meet mortgage payments with extra income on top. Some firms, including Sandy Park, backed the plans with single-premium investment bonds. When the value of the bonds fell and interest rates rose, investors suff-ered financial difficulties. In addition to paying the fine and costs, DBS must write to remaining home-income clients of Sandy Park and advise them to consider taking professional advice. DBS is continuing to defend legal actions instituted in connection with home-income plans. DBS terminated its relationship with Sandy Park in April 1991, and the group says it has taken firm action to strengthen any possible gaps in compliance or monitoring procedures. The announcement was unusual in that it was made by the disciplined organisation rather than by the regulator. Shares in DBS Management, DBS's parent company, are traded on the Stock Exchange under rule 535(2) and the company said it felt it was appropriate to inform shareholders. Fimbra said it would not comment until the end of the legal period in which DBS is entitled to appeal.</p>

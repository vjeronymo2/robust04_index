			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> FOR EXPORT: A DOUBLE STANDARD?;  </P> <P> HEART VALVES THE FDA BANNED AS RISKY WERE LEGALLY SOLD ABROAD. THE MEDICAL  INDUSTRY ARGUES THE U.S. SHOULDN'T IMPOSE ITS REGULATIONS ON OTHERS.  </P> <P> Every time her heart beats, Constance A. Cooper hears the tiny clicks of two  mechanical valves implanted there. Every time she hears those clicks, she fears  it will be the last.  </P> <P> "There is no moment when you don't hear those clicks, no night when you go to  bed without thinking about it," Cooper said. "You wake up every night and you  just want to hear those clicks perfectly. You just hope you're going to wake up  in the morning."  </P> <P> Cooper's fear is well-grounded: At least 246 people worldwide have died  following fractures of similar heart valves. So she filed a civil lawsuit last  year in Los Angeles against the manufacturer, Shiley Inc. of Irvine, a  subsidiary of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc.  </P> <P> The suit was settled Monday when Shiley paid Cooper an undisclosed sum. The  company had settled many lawsuits involving broken valves, but this was the  first time that Shiley has settled a suit involving a valve that had not  broken.  </P> <P> But Connie Cooper's situation is special, even in the deadly annals of the  Shiley heart valves. Her case has contributed to charges that the federal Food  and Drug Administration is doing an inadequate job of protecting the public,  and it has raised questions about whether the United States should impose its  generally strict standards on foreign customers of U.S. pharmaceutical  companies.  </P> <P> The 50-year-old Cooper is Canadian, and one of the valves in her heart was  among 4,000 implanted in foreigners after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  prohibited Shiley from selling the device in this country but allowed its  export to other countries.  </P> <P> Critics argue that the law that permitted Shiley to export its 70-degree heart  valve -- a measure of the valve's opening -- creates a double standard.  Although medical devices sold here must undergo rigorous clinical testing, even  the most critical products may be exported without tests.  </P> <P> Hearing Scheduled  </P> <P> A congressional subcommittee, chaired by the influential Rep. John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), has tentatively scheduled a hearing for February or March to explore  the FDA's regulation of Shiley's heart valves and whether tighter export rules  are warranted.  </P> <P> "It is a double standard that will, over time, come back to haunt us, as it did  with the 70-degree valve," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Ralph Nader's  Public Citizen Health Research Group in Washington.  </P> <P> The medical-device industry, which will sell an estimated $4.3-billion worth of  products abroad this year, responds that the United States should not impose  its standards on other nations.  </P> <P> "There is a recognition that all countries have their own standards by which  they regulate anything, whether it is food and drug products, airline safety or  automobile driving," said Stephen D. Terman, an attorney with the Health  Industry Manufacturers Assn., the industry trade group in Washington. "The fact  that a product is not up to the standards of one country should not deprive  another country of a product if its standards are different."  </P> <P> Shiley declined to comment on the Cooper case, but company spokesman Robert J.  Fauteux issued the following statement concerning export of the 70-degree  valve:  </P> <P> "Valves were exported to modern, industrialized countries with sophisticated  health care systems and individual regulations and customs. Shiley made every  effort and believes it successfully complied with the responsibilities imposed  upon it by each foreign country which authorized Shiley to import the 70-degree  . . . valve."  </P> <P> The congressional inquiry into export regulations and the Shiley heart valve is  one of several problems now confronting the FDA, which is responsible for  ensuring the safety of drugs, foods and cosmetics as well as medical devices.  </P> <P> In the last decade, the agency's staff has been cut from 8,000 to about 7,500  and the FDA has been beset by criticism that its regulation has broken down.  Frank E. Young resigned as the commissioner last month as a result of the  agency's troubles, symbolized by the convictions of three agency officials in  an unfolding scandal over the cozy relationship between the FDA and generic  drug makers.  </P> <P> Monitoring Faulted  </P> <P> The chief of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,  warned last month that inadequate monitoring of medical devices by the FDA is  endangering the American public.  </P> <P> "We are concerned about the large number of devices that reach the market after  only a relatively cursory review," Charles A. Bowsher told a House  subcommittee.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the FDA challenged Bowsher's contentions and said the agency  acts "promptly and aggressively" to protect the public.  </P> <P> The FDA regulates the more than 1,700 types of medical devices available in the  United States as well as those manufactured here for export. The products  include almost everything, except drugs, used by health-care professionals to  diagnose and treat illness.  </P> <P> To ensure the safety and effectiveness of devices sold in the United States,  the agency requires clinical tests and reviews of devices before they may be  sold and monitors the performance of devices once they are in general use.  </P> <P> Last month's GAO report criticized both the agency's thoroughness in testing  and its system for monitoring reports of problems with devices already on the  market in the United States. The FDA came under similar criticism in the  mid-1980s for its failure to move faster in urging the removal of Shiley's  60-degree heart valve from the U.S. market after fractures began to occur.  </P> <P> The number of deaths ultimately attributed to malfunctions of the Shiley valves  is unknown. The FDA has received reports of 181 deaths involving failures of  the far more widely distributed 60-degree valve and 65 involving the 70-degree  version.  </P> <P> But Wolfe estimates that at least 480 persons have died, and an FDA spokeswoman  acknowledged that there are gaps in the reporting of deaths involving 70-degree  valves because they have all occurred outside the United States.  </P> <P> The 60-degree valve was the predecessor to the 70-degree valve, which was never  sold in the United States. The original valve, called the Bjork-Shiley  60-degree convexo-concave valve, was developed by the Irvine company and a  pioneering Swedish heart surgeon, Viking O. Bjork, who now lives in Palm  Springs.  </P> <P> The FDA approved the 60-degree valve for sale in the United States in April,  1979, after clinical tests and a review. It also approved the valve for export,  and it became the world's most widely used mechanical valve to replace diseased  or damaged human heart valves.  </P> <P> Soon after the 60-degree valves were sold, a small fraction of them began to  break. When that happened, the heart could no longer pump blood effectively,  and the consequence was death in two out of every three cases.  </P> <P> Blame quickly focused on the welds that joined two components of the valve  together, and Bjork later wrote in a medical journal that the welding had  caused difficulties. Shiley voluntarily recalled various versions and sizes of  the 60-degree valve in 1980, 1982, 1983 and 1985.  </P> <P> Shiley told the FDA that it had corrected the problem with each recall. The FDA  also tolerated the fractures because Shiley had presented data to the agency  that maintained its valve was better than other types at preventing the  formation of blood clots, an infrequent but often fatal side effect of  mechanical heart valves.  </P> <P> According to an analysis by the FDA, the agency later determined that Shiley's  claims of correcting the fracture problem were "often unfounded" and that the  valve was no better in reducing clotting than some other types available.  </P> <P> Shiley ended production of the 60-degree valves in 1986 after 81,791 of them  had been implanted worldwide. The FDA said the valves were subject to a  "pattern of rare but persistent . . . fractures."  </P> <P> Shiley had developed the 70-degree version in 1980, as an improvement upon the  60-degree valve.  </P> <P> FDA documents show that Shiley sought approval to sell the 70-degree valve in  the United States as a variation of the 60-degree valve and a solution to the  fracture problem. The FDA rejected that request but, in 1980, gave Shiley  permission to export the 70-degree valve. Shiley shipped 5,600 to 15 countries,  and 4,000 of them are known to have been used.  </P> <P> The first 70-degree valves were produced by remilling 60-degree valves to  create a 70-degree opening, according to a study by Swedish surgeons published  this year and FDA documents.  </P> <P> Problems Developed  </P> <P> The 70-degree valve soon developed its own fracture problems. The most  failure-prone valves appeared to be a subgroup of 521 large-size 70-degree  valves that were among those created by remilling 60-degree devices.  </P> <P> The failure rate for this group is more than seven times higher than for the  60-degree valve or the later versions of the 70-degree, said the study by Bjork  and two other surgeons.  </P> <P> The study concluded that these remilled valves have "a major risk for  mechanical failure" from fractures. According to the study, a person with a  large 70-degree valve has one chance in eight of a valve fracture over a  seven-year period.  </P> <P> The rate is so high that the surgeons recommended removing the large, remilled  70-degree valves from some of those who had received them, even though one  person in 20 dies as a result of replacement surgery. The 60-degree valve's  fracture rate is lower, and doctors do not recommend its removal.  </P> <P> It was one of the high-risk remilled 70-degree valves that was implanted in  Connie Cooper during five hours of surgery on May 25, 1982, at Toronto General  Hospital. Cooper, who had had open-heart surgery twice before to replace  damaged valves, also received a 60-degree Shiley valve at the same time.  </P> <P> She knew nothing then of the standard for exports in the United States, or that  the 60-degree valve in her heart had been tested clinically but the 70-degree  valve had not.  </P> <P> "I felt very safe," Cooper recalled in an interview. "My doctor said it was the  best valve for me and I told him to do whatever he thought was best."  </P> <P> Under a 1976 law, the FDA grants an export certificate for a medical device if  no negative information about the product exists and the receiving country says  it has no objection to the device and no law against it. Few countries,  however, have the evaluation capacity and strict standards of the United  States.  </P> <P> "Some Western European countries have stricter standards than we do, and some  Third World countries will take anything," said Terman of the manufacturers  trade group.  </P> <P> Officials Confused  </P> <P> Investigators from Dingell's subcommittee found that officials in some  countries became confused about the significance of an FDA export certificate.  </P> <P> The Dutch, for instance, had no standards regulating mechanical heart valves.  So when Shiley sought Dutch approval to export the 70-degree valve to the  Netherlands in 1981, the government responded that it had no regulations for  the devices and therefore no legal objections to importing them, according to a  government letter obtained by The Times.  </P> <P> However, Dutch officials told the congressional investigators recently that  they had been surprised to learn that the Shiley 70-degree valve was not sold  in the United States. The Dutch also said that they did not learn the valve had  been recalled until 1985, two years after the FDA revoked Shiley's export  license. Even then, the information came not from the FDA but from a newspaper  article.  </P> <P> On Jan. 11, 1983, the FDA suspended Shiley's right to export the 70-degree  valves after reports of five valve fractures in Sweden and two in Australia.  Five months later, the FDA revoked Shiley's export certificate, and the company  recalled the valves that had not been implanted. By that time, 4,000 of the  devices were already in patients, including Cooper.  </P> <P> Shiley has been sued more than 200 times in connection with the heart valves.  According to Wolfe, 50 to 60 of the suits involving broken valves have been  settled for as much as $1 million. No case has gone to trial and, as part of  every settlement, Shiley insists that no one disclose the amount of money.  </P> <P> Beginning last year, recipients of valves that have not broken began to file  suits in Orange County against Shiley. The suits claimed that the recipients  lived in fear of sudden death from a valve fracture and many of those suing are  foreigners with the 70-degree valve.  </P> <P> According to lawyers who have sued Shiley, the company maintained that it would  not settle a case in which a valve had not fractured. But that position changed  with the Cooper case.  </P> <P> Cooper learned of the problems with one of her Shiley valves in March of 1988  when a doctor at Toronto General told her that the 70-degree valve in her heart  had a high failure rate. He recommended that she consider surgery to have it  removed.  </P> <P> But when Cooper explained that she had undergone heart surgery three times and  one of her natural valves also had a leak, he said she should not be a  candidate for replacement surgery because her odds of surviving another heart  operation were too slim.  </P> <P> "You think this can't possibly be true when somebody tells you you are living  with a time bomb in your heart," said Cooper. "You think, 'My God, how can I  live with this?' "  </P> <P> Her attorney, Vance C. Simonds Jr. of the Irvine firm of Capretz &amp; Kasdan,  said Cooper's emotional stress and the fact that she cannot have replacement  surgery were substantial factors in the settlement.  </P> <P> "Connie has a long history of medical problems," said Simonds. "This is the  first man-made problem. She has overcome all the others. This one she can't  overcome. It will always be with her."  </P> <P> Cooper said she thinks of the valve in her heart every day. She often dreams  that it has broken and she is dying. But she said she has one overriding fear.  </P> <P> "I have two grandchildren and I love baby-sitting for them," she said. "I just  pray to God that it doesn't happen when I'm baby-sitting the little ones."  </P></p>

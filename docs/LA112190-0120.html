			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: IF AN ANALYST SAYS 'HOLD,' HE MAY REALLY MEAN 'SELL'  </P> <P> Bad day at the hangar: Boeing Co.'s stock was slammed down $4.625 to $42.625 on  Tuesday, a 10% loss that helped drag the Dow industrials off 35.15 points to  2,530.20.  </P> <P> For Boeing, the hit came simply because Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Judith  Comeau cut her rating on the stock from "buy" to "hold," citing rising  long-term development costs for the company's planned 777 airliner.  </P> <P> Though a "hold" rating would hardly seem to merit a 10% drop in market value --  which Comeau termed an "overreaction" -- many Goldman clients obviously saw  something else in Comeau's rating change. She said "hold," but some clients saw  a "sell."  </P> <P> That scenario has been played out plenty of times lately, and it's resurrecting  an old debate on Wall Street: Why don't analysts just say what they really mean  instead of hiding a stock behind the kinder and gentler "hold" label?  </P> <P> To look at Comeau's earnings expectations for Boeing, it's fairly easy to see  why some long-term investors would opt to bail out. She believes that earnings  could fall from $5.50 a share in 1992 to $3.70 a share in 1995, as Boeing  spends billions of dollars to create the 777.  </P> <P> There are bitter arguments over those projections among Boeing analysts,  because many of them believe that Boeing has enough plane orders, and enough  control over the delivery of those planes, to avoid any decline in earnings  even through 1997, despite 777 costs. "I see a smooth progression in earnings  out to $8 a share in 1997," argues analyst Paul Nisbet at Prudential-Bache  Securities.  </P> <P> When Wall Street starts talking about 1997 in 1990, who's right and who's wrong  becomes a debate for futurists. Nonetheless, Comeau's numbers certainly could  warrant a sell rating on Boeing, given the strength of her conviction.  </P> <P> So why didn't she say sell? "It's not what I mean," she says flatly. "I clearly  am not recommending a sale."  </P> <P> The stock is a hold, Comeau says, because Boeing's 1991 and 1992 earnings power  suggest "there should be some intermediate ground" for the stock price.  </P> <P> She sees it trading up around $50 eventually, based on earnings expectations of  $5.50 a share for 1992, compared to $4.10 this year. So there's "no reason to  sell into weakness, and there was no reason to sell (Tuesday)," she says.  </P> <P> But if big investors overreacted Tuesday, it was probably because there remains  deep suspicion about analysts' stock rating changes. For as long as there have  been analysts, most of them have hated to rate a stock an outright "sell,"  preferring to keep most of their dogs in the beige "hold" area.  </P> <P> One big reason for that is obvious: No corporate executive likes to have his  operation labeled a loser. Because analysts rely on company insiders for much  of their research data, a sell rating runs the risk that the company will cut  off dialogue with the analyst.  </P> <P> Some brokerages have gone to some pretty outrageous lengths to try to paper  over the sell label. Earlier this year, Dean Witter Reynolds changed its lowest  stock rating from sell to "swap," because some of the analysts argued that it  would be less offensive to companies.  </P> <P> Other brokerages have adopted convoluted rating systems that have a dozen  shades between buy and sell -- to the point, one analyst says, "where some  firms have so many ratings, no matter what happens to the stock, they've  covered their asses." For example, if you rate a stock a "hold, with some risk"  compared to an outright sell, and it falls out of bed, you can still argue that  you warned about the risk. That's logic on Wall Street.  </P> <P> To be fair, there also are some cogent arguments against sell labels. Tom  Brock, research director at Salomon Bros. in New York, says analysts are  justifiably "gun-shy about misinterpretation of a sell. . . . The real issue is  that there's so much more to it than just a buy, sell or hold label." That's  why analysts spend reams of paper in reports justifying their reasoning.  </P> <P> R. Joseph Fuchs, research chief at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., notes that "one  of the difficult things is to differentiate between a stock rating and a  company rating." For example, an analyst may say sell just because a stock has  run up too far, too fast, and not because there's anything fundamentally wrong  with the company. But investors could construe the sell rating to mean that the  company is about to see its earnings plunge.  </P> <P> Still, most brokerage research chiefs admit that analysts ought to be far  better about saying what they really mean, despite who it hurts. That's more  important now than ever, because the truth is never worth more than during a  bear market.  </P> <P> "There's no question that every analyst on the Street ought to have more swaps  and sells than holds now," says Manny Korman, research director at Dean Witter.  </P> <P> After all, he notes, "For every portfolio manager, there are really only two  decisions -- buy and sell. If you own it in the portfolio, you really do buy it  every day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> STOCKS THEY REALLY DO HATE  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts often are reluctant to advise selling a stock, preferring  instead to soft-peddle their pessimism with a "hold" rating. But these stocks  currently have the greatest percentage of brokerage sell recommendations as  tracked by First Call, a Boston-based research-tracker. The stocks are rated on  a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 a strong buy and 5 a strong sell.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:2.22IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Avg.broker  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Tues.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Stock  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> rating  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> close  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> chng.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Southeast Banking  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4 5/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -76%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boise Cascade  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 24 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -45%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tucson Electric  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -63%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Coast Savings Financial  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3 1/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -72%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Golden Nugget  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16 5/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -39%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pan Am Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1 1/2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -43%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Russell Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20 3/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -22%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Travelers Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.00  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -64%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Hechinger  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.80  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8 1/8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -36%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Citicorp  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.75  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -56%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *year-to-date  </P> <P> Source: First Call  </P></p>

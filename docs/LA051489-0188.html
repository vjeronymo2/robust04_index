			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: PHINNEY WINS SECOND CONSECUTIVE TOUR RACE  </P> <P> Davis Phinney won his second consecutive race, and Belgium's Eric Vanderaerden  narrowed the lead of Norway's Dag Otto Lauritzen to less than a minute Saturday  during the ninth stage of the Tour de Trump bicycle race in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Phinney, of Boulder, Colo., who won the Arlington Circuit Race Friday -- the  first victory by an American -- came out of a pack with 300 meters remaining to  win the 51-mile Baltimore Criterium in 1 hour 42 minutes 35 seconds.  </P> <P> Phinney's margin of victory was announced as one inch in a photo finish. He and  Vanderaerden crossed the line on opposite sides of the street. West German  amateur Rolf Aldag was third in the same time as the winner.  </P> <P> "(Vanderaerden) really surged at the end," said Phinney, who was beaten four  times earlier in the race by the Belgian star. "I wasn't sure if I got it. Now  I am sure because I saw the photo."  </P> <P> Vanderaerden, who has won four stages and has twice finished second, trails  Lauritzen by 50 seconds entering today's final time trial stage in Atlantic  City, N.J.  </P> <P> Vanderaerden's teammate, Henk Lubberding of the Netherlands, is second, 28  seconds back.  </P></p>

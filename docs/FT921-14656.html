			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price Yesterday's unusual decision by Libya to make a voluntary cut in its oil production was the second outburst of self-sacrifice within Opec in a matter of days. As with Venezuela's similar cut, the actual volume of oil is much less significant than the suggestion that relations within Opec are not nearly as bad as the market has been assuming. After all, the traditional pattern for producers is to bump up their production ahead of Opec meetings in order to make any agreed or forced reductions from a higher base. It would perhaps be unwise to read too much into the cuts, but they have helped the oil price to rally from its embarrassing lows last week. For the main producers, including those outside Opec, that is just as well. If Brent crude prices were to stick around Dollars 18 per barrel, for example, the North Sea would barely produce sufficient cashflow to fund this year's exploration programmes, let alone the sort of safety and maintenance spending required in 1991. Yesterday's demand forecasts by the International Energy Agency thus provided some comfort. Its assumed fall in Russian consumption may not happen, but, even if it does, demand looks pretty resilient given the weak world economy and mild winter. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Opec will have to come up with much bigger production cuts when it meets next month if it is to push the oil price up much further. Until then, the market will continue to be dominated by the traders whose short-term outlook drove the price down.</p>

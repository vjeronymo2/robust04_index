			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ma.S.: "Pawlak Government Currently Proposes: </F> Defense Affairs Committee, Not a Council"]    [Excerpt] The Pawlak Cabinet established the Committee of  Defense Affairs of the Council of Ministers [KSORM] on Tuesday  [12 March]. The ministers also accepted a bill on managing  immovable property left over by the Russian Federation troops.  Tuesday was the deadline for the government to take a stand on  the demands of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union  Solidarity. The union demands, among other things, that the  budget law be amended. However, the Council of Minister first  wants to adopt a program of socioeconomic policy for 1994-97.    National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said after the  government session that the president had promised to appeal to  the Constitutional Tribunal against the already signed budget.  What he wants changed is the commitment of the National Defense  Ministry to earmark 300 billion zlotys for the purchase of Iryda  [Polish aircraft]. Minister Kolodziejczyk believes that  maintaining this paragraph of the law with such wording would be  a dangerous precedent. He also announced that he would not meet  this commitment unless Iryda satisfies Army requirements.    The issue of establishing new defense structures has already  been discussed once at a Council of Ministers' session. Toward  the end of November, the National Defense Committee [KOK]  decided that the National Defense Council [RBN] would be set up  as "the supreme state organ in the area of defense." This would  call for amending the law on general defense duty and the Small  Constitution. The Basic Law envisions the existence of the RBN,  but as an advisory organ of the president. Lech Walesa is  trying to ensure that the council decisions are binding for  everyone, including the government. For the time being, there  exists KOK, a structure that coordinates the activities of state  authorities in defense issues.    In December, when the Pawlak Cabinet had already dealt with  these issues once, it was officially announced that  "interministerial agreements still need to be reached."  Unofficially, there was speculation that the government "became  frightened" of giving all of the powers in defense issues over  to the president.    The newly established KSORM is supposed to be a collective,  internal organ of the government, with a structure similar to  the already existing committees of the Council of Ministers: the  Economic and Sociopolitical Committee. The chairman of the  committee is the prime minister. During natural calamities and  mass catastrophes, the new body is supposed to coordinate all  government activities.    Minister Kolodziejczyk evaluated the establishment of KSORM  as an opportunity to reform the Army. He added, however, that  he had supported a different order: the establishment of the RBN  first. Contrary to initial proposals, KSORM does not include  National Security Office Secretary Jerzy Milewski. [passage  omitted]</p>

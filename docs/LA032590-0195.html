			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPER WORK 'SCARE'  </P> <P> The article, "Paper Primer, A consumer's guide to the mountains of paper work .  . . " (by Eileen Heyes, March 11) on selling (or buying) a home, was written as  if by the Board of Realtors, and did your readers a disservice, especially  those who elect to sell their own homes. It was couched in scare terms,  exaggerating the facts.  </P> <P> Many who believe real estate agents' sales tactics, list with them rather than  sell them themselves because they're scared to death the process is way beyond  them, and this is simply not true.  </P> <P> Folks who can place a simple ad in the paper, keep the house clean and  presentable, show it to seemingly sincere lookers only, and work with a local  escrow company can sell their own property. The escrow handles the paper work.  </P> <P> RUSSELL T. CONNORS  </P> <P> Pismo Beach  </P></p>

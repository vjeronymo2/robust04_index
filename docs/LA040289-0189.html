			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> USC WILL HONOR ARCHITECT MASTON;  </P> <P> SCHOOL TO GIVE AWARD TO ALUMNUS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS INNOVATIVE, MODERN-STYLE  DESIGNS.  </P> <P> When Carl Maston was in his senior year at USC in 1936, he still didn't know  whether he wanted to pursue a career as a pianist or an architect.  </P> <P> Although he worked hard as an architectural student during the school year,  he'd spend his summers practicing the piano for eight hours a day and would cap  it with a public concert before heading back to school in the fall.  </P> <P> His piano instructor thought Maston had a bright future as a soloist. But  Maston chose architecture, and over the next half-century would go on to design  everything from honored homes to ice rinks.  </P> <P> The 73-year-old Angeleno, who still practices architecture on a part-time  basis, will receive the USC School of Architecture's 1989 Distinguished Alumni  Award at the Architectural Guild dinner April 12.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inauspicious Beginning  </P> <P> In announcing that Maston had won the award, Robert S. Harris, dean of the  school, said Maston is being singled out "for excellence in design and  innovative leadership in public service."  </P> <P> Maston's career started on an inauspicious note: He got his architect's license  in December, 1941, and enlisted just a few days after Pearl Harbor was bombed.  </P> <P> He served as a Marine Corps transportation officer on Oahu, and later, Midway,  but most of the fighting was over by the time he got to either island. "We  never saw action," Maston said. "We played tennis a lot and watched gooney  birds."  </P> <P> He also daydreamed about the home he'd build in Los Angeles after the war was  over.  </P> <P> After returning home, Maston found a site on Marmont Lane in West Hollywood and  built what would become known as the Maston House or Marmont House, a  late-Craftsman style home that has won several design awards.  </P> <P> Maston, however, is best known for his work in Modern architecture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Innovative Ice Rink  </P> <P> Modernism is a functional, no-frills, technology-based style born in the  pre-World War I days. Modern buildings are characterized by simple surfaces  bereft of ornamentation -- buildings such as Century Plaza Towers in Century  City and the Chemosphere House in the Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> One of Maston's most innovative structures was an ice rink at the corner of  Reseda and Ventura boulevards in the San Fernando Valley community of Tarzana.  It was built about 20 years ago, but torn down in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> The rink resembled a tortoise shell. Its 36 precast concrete pieces reinforced  each other, so the roof -- a mere 3 1/2 inches thick -- required no supporting  posts.  </P> <P> The ice rink wasn't just one of Maston's most innovative buildings: It was also  one of his personal favorites. "I couldn't go look at it when they were tearing  it down," said Maston, who usually worked alone. "It was like losing a baby."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Headquarters Hailed  </P> <P> Most of the more than 100 other buildings Maston designed -- from homes and  shopping centers to university buildings and naval housing -- have fared better  than the old ice rink.  </P> <P> The headquarters he designed in the 1960s for himself at 2811 Cahuenga Blvd. in  Hollywood is hailed as "an ideal Modern design" by "Architecture in Los  Angeles: A Compleat Guide."  </P> <P> His other creations include the Chiat House on Camino Verde, which  "Architecture in Los Angeles" calls "one of the best pieces of architecture in  South Pasadena," and more than 40 other homes, ranging from California's wine  country to Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Maston also designed the School of Environmental Design at Cal Poly Pomona and  the Creative Arts Building at California State University, San Bernardino. He  also designed apartment buildings noted for their courtyard views, as well as  shopping centers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planning Commissioner  </P> <P> He has also held numerous volunteer posts, including a five-year stint as a Los  Angeles city planning commissioner. He was president of the Southern California  chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1968, and has taught several  courses at USC.  </P> <P> Maston, who is widowed and has one daughter, still takes on some architectural  jobs, although he spends much of his free time sailing and, in the fall,  watching Trojan football games on television.  </P> <P> Several other awards will be presented at the April 12 ceremonies, including  the guild traveling fellowships. The two fellowships will allow the winners,  USC graduate students Steven Whitney and Paul Blazek, to study architecture  abroad.  </P></p>

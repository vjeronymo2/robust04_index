			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / More at stake than mere machismo: The likely effects of the engineering workers' and electricians' merger plans In a three-week tour around Britain to win support for a union merger, leaders of the AEU engineering workers and the EETPU electricians have left little doubt about the significance they attach to their mission. 'It is the biggest and most important merger in trade union history,' Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, has told numerous meetings of shop stewards and union members. 'It will change the face of British trade unionism,' implying that it will become a model for other unions to follow. Rival unions will contest Mr Jordan's claims, but there is no doubting that a merger - which has eluded previous leaders of the AEU and EEPTU for more than a century - would have a significant impact both on other unions and thousands of workplaces in the public and private sectors. If approved by the two unions' 1m members in a vote starting this week, it could be the first in a series of trade union amalgamations which could result in four or five large organisations dominating the labour movement by the end of the century. The merger would also probably take the electricians, whose union has long been considered the most right-wing in Britain, back into the Trades Union Congress after their expulsion three years ago for failing to implement rulings on inter-union disputes. More important for UK manufacturing, the AEU/EETPU would be the most likely partner for employers seeking to introduce single-union deals; the two unions have already taken the lion's share of such agreements in the UK, the most recent being that with the AEU at the proposed plant of Toyota, the car manufacturer, in Derbyshire. Employers would also welcome the deal because it would simplify collective bargaining arrangements, and help erode demarcation lines, which have held back productivity improvements for years. There are disadvantages. Some employers will have concerns about the increased negotiating power that a merger would give the most skilled members of their workforces. Most, however, believe that the risks are far outweighed by the advantages. Employers have long been frustrated by the proliferation of unions in the UK. Those setting up plants prefer to deal with only one union, or none at all. A small but growing number is seeking to simplify bargaining by setting up 'single-table' systems, through which negotiating forums with separate unions are replaced by one in which unions bargain 'with one voice'. 'This (single-table system) cuts down bargaining time and has the potential of cutting down the amount of time shop stewards are diverted from productive work and the number of full-time union officials we have to deal with,' says one personnel director at an engineering plant. 'The merger could also have that effect.' The large number of unions has also fuelled demarcation disputes between different groups of workers. 'The biggest source of friction has been between electricians and engineers, even though it is less marked than it was in the past,' says Mr Peter Ball, deputy director-general at the Engineering Employers Federation. 'This has hindered the training of the multi-skilled workers which more and more companies are seeking.' Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, says that this distinction is over: 'The separation of mechanical and electrical skills is finished. The new union would create an environment where multi-skilling could be controlled in the interests of our members and employers.' Such comments are consistent with the offer of the AEU and EEPTU leaderships to forge a 'partnership of common interest' with employers. 'We have to reassert trade unions' role of seeking better pay, working conditions and job security but we have to do it in an equal partnership with employers,' says Mr Jordan. A merger could help promote that change. But the pressure on unions to amalgamate began long before they started talking about transforming relations with employers. A union combining engineers and electricians was first mooted in 1889. Numerous merger attempts followed, the latest ending in 1989 because of the EETPU rift with the TUC and the difficulty of reconciling the two unions' different structures. In particular, the AEU was anxious to retain its tradition of electing its officials; the EETPU executive appoints all but the most senior. The differences remain and, assuming that the merger vote is positive, there will still be much argument over a new constitution, to be formulated over the next four years. What has increased the urgency of merger since 1989 is the severe effect of the recession on union membership rolls, putting pressure on finances. In the second half of 1991, AEU membership declined by 10 per cent, against 5 per cent a year in the 1980s. 'If we lose 5 per cent of our paying members each year, we lose Pounds 1.5m-worth of income and by 2000 we would have less than 300,000 paying members,' says Mr Laird. As a result of similar developments at other unions, amalgamations that a few years ago would have seemed impossible are being considered. One possibility, although still far off, is the combination of traditional rivals the Transport and General Workers Union and the GMB general union to form a 2m-strong organisation. That, together with the likely formation of a 1.5m-member organisation comprising Nalgo, Nupe and public service unions, has concentrated the minds of AEU leaders, who, as in all unions, are acutely conscious of the relative size of their organisation. With 630,00 members, the AEU is the UK's fourth largest union. Three years ago it was second only to the TGWU. 'It is much more than just machismo,' says the leader of one rival union. 'Numbers are votes and votes are influence on the Labour party and government.' Similar arguments have helped to convince EETPU sceptics. Since leaving the TUC, the EETPU has drawn in some small unions, but its potential for significant growth is limited. 'The AEU will merge with other unions if it does not amalgamate with us,' says Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general secretary elect. But if Mr Gallagher has been converted to the merger cause, he remains ambivalent about rejoining the TUC. The EETPU has long been regarded by some as the unacceptable face of trade unionism, after its role in the derecognition of print unions by News International, publisher of The Times and The Sun, and its promotion of no-strike agreements. Mr Gallagher shows no signs of regret. 'The sad thing is that we have not missed being in the TUC. British workers do need a coherent voice to represent their interests. But the question is whether it is worth Pounds 1.3m (the prospective annual TUC affiliation fees of the two unions) to be in the TUC. I am open to persuasion.' This stance and the animosity of some TUC-affiliated unions sets the scene for protracted negotiations with the TUC, prior to a vote on affiliation within a year by the two unions' members. The difficulties will arise in part because some TUC-affiliated unions will press for the EETPU to withdraw from the two single-union deals at Orion, the Japanese electronics company, and distribution group Christian Salvesen, which led to its expulsion. However, Mr Gallagher, and Mr Eric Hammond, from whom he takes over as general secretary next month, say they will not contemplate giving up either those members involved in the single-union agreements, or the members of the breakaway unions that have joined the EETPU since 1988. The unions which have lost members to the electricians - including the Fire Brigade Union and the Prison Officers Association - will be unhappy if the EETPU is not disciplined. None the less the pressures on both sides to find a solution are considerable. Unions have been able to live with the 360,000-strong EETPU outside the TUC, but their strength would be severely undermined if the AEU were also to leave. And Mr Gallagher will face strong pressure to show flexibility in the TUC talks from Mr Jordan and Mr Laird, both of whom would find life outside the TUC uncomfortable. For these reasons, the EETPU will probably be back inside the TUC next year, although there are no details yet of how this could happen. Important though that would be to other unions, the reaffiliation to the TUC matters less to employers than does its merger with the AEU. 'I could not care less whether the engineers or electricians are in the TUC,' says one employer, 'but the merger is a different matter. It is a shame they did not do it years ago. It will be a force for good and for change.'</p>

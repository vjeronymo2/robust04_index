			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Commenting on the results of the Geneva summit  between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton,  AL-THAWRAH says: The news conference held following the summit  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton demonstrated genuine  agreement on a peace that rests on Security Council resolutions  and the land-for-peace principle. There was also agreement that  true peace is that which removes all the factors of conflict,  primarily Israeli occupation and guaranteeing Arab rights.    AL-THAWRAH notes the worldwide support for the results of  the  Geneva summit and the world's appreciation for Syria's position,  which opened the doors for peace and completely paved the way  for a just and comprehensive peace.    The paper says: Israel is now facing a real test. It has to  prove practically that it is part of the peace camp by  responding to the Geneva call for establishing the peace of the  brave.    AL-THAWRAH notes the strange claims of Yitzhaq Rabin, head  of  the Israeli Government, that he does not know Syria's true  position on peace. Only a few days ago, Rabin acknowledged that  peace with Syria is very important.    The paper says: Rabin's acknowledgement of the importance of  making peace with Syria must be accompanied by action to achieve  this just and comprehensive peace. Rabin should be courageous  enough to declare accepting the principle of full and  comprehensive withdrawal, which is a condition for full peace.  Is this not what President al-Asad meant when he called for the  peace of the brave? Is this not more useful than fabrications  against Syria and attempts to hold it responsible for the  killing of Israeli soldiers at the hands of Lebanese national  resistance and on occupied Lebanese territory?    Under the headline "Occupation Is the Reason," TISHRIN says:  Israel is lying to itself when it blames others for the  continuation of resistance and ignores that it alone, by its  occupation of the south, is directly responsible for the  developments and operations in southern Lebanon.    Resistance is a natural outcome of occupation. National duty  urges the Lebanese people to join the resistance to restore  their occupied territory and uproot the occupation, because the  occupation is the reason for all the tragedies and catastrophes  that Lebanon and its people have suffered. Besides, resistance  against the occupation is guaranteed by international law and  all charters. Therefore, neither Israel nor anybody else can  call for stopping the resistance as long as occupation is  continuing.    If Israel wants to see a calm situation in the south and not  to escalate matters, then it should eliminate the reasons for  this resistance, specifically, the occupation and the policy of  suppression, terrorism, and expansion.    TISHRIN adds: Israel has to date refused to abide by the  will of international legitimacy. Therefore, Syria can, under  no circumstances, accept to act as a policeman for this  occupation. Israel should not pursue its claims and allegations  by blaming Syria for the resistance operations.    TISHRIN concludes: It is necessary now to clarify matters,  since Israel alone, by virtue of its occupation, is responsible  for the developments and tension in the south. Israel's  aggressive, expansionist policy could trigger further serious  results and have a negative impact on the situation in the  region, starting with the south.    Under the headline "National Resistance Is Continuing Until  Its Cause Is Removed," AL-BA'TH says: The military  reinforcements dispatched by Israel to southern Lebanon were  accompanied by aggressive threats that remind us of Israel's  campaign against defenseless villages late last July, which  claimed dozens of martyrs.    Amid this escalation, Rabin and others did not forget to  launch a disinformation campaign against Syria in a bid to  undermine its clear positions on the peace process and blame it  for the explosive resistance in southern Lebanon.    The paper adds: The launching of the resistance was in no  need of permission from Syria or others. The resistance was the  outcome of a direct reason which lies in the occupation of  territory. The Lebanese people, who belong to a nation that has  never surrendered to occupiers throughout its history, rose to  resist the usurper to liberate their sacred soil from the filth  of the occupation. Since the cause has not been removed, the  resistance will continue.    AL-BA'TH says Israel's twisted logic by involving Syria in  the business of the valiant national resistance to the brute  occupier is within the Rabin government's constant attempts to  circumvent the peace process and avoid implementing Resolution  425 stipulating immediate withdrawal from southern Lebanon.    AL-BA'TH concludes: If Rabin thinks that his threats and  military operations against southern Lebanon would enable him to  somehow avoid fulfilling the obligations of peace, then he is  entertaining illusions that would not stall peace efforts that  aim at achieving security and stability in the region. If he  fears the resistance operations, all he has to do is submit to  Resolution 425 as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Laos expects higher economic growth LAOS, which has been inching towards a market economy since Soviet aid dried up, expects higher economic growth and lower inflation this year, and hopes to clinch a new credit from the International Monetary Fund. Ms Pany Yathotou, State Bank governor, said in an interview with Reuters that Laos began talks in October with the IMF for an extended structural adjustment facility for 1993-95. The negotiations followed the successful review by an IMF mission of Laos' economic performance under a Dollars 29m structural adjustment facility for 1991-92. 'They were quite satisfied with our performance,' she said. Ms Yathotou forecast that inflation would fall to 7 per cent this year from last year's 10 per cent. Gross domestic product is forecast to grow by 6.5 per cent in 1992 and 7 per cent in 1993, compared with 4 per cent in 1991, according to government statistics. Mr Khamsouk Sundara, director of the international department of the state bank, said Laos was seeking about Dollars 60m for the extended facility, but the IMF was proposing only Dollars 40m. Laos has total external debt of Dollars 1.13bn, the state bank said. Of that amount, Dollars 770m is owed to bilateral lenders, and the rest to international agencies. The leading multilateral lender is the World Bank, with Dollars 175m, followed by the Asian Development Bank with Dollars 147m and the IMF with Dollars 28.5m. Of the Dollars 770m owed bilaterally, only Dollars 28.6m is in hard currency, and the remainder represents the value of goods such as oil, machinery and equipment Laos imported from the former Soviet Union. Officials said Laos' fragile economy, hobbled by drought and floods recently, will post stronger growth this year and next but will need continued foreign assistance to keep up the momentum. 'The government will continue with its open door policy to attract foreign investors in order to attain higher growth,' Khamphoui Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, told foreign reporters.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HACKER THREATS DON'T COME TRUE  </P> <P> Telephone companies reported normal operations today after bracing for a  possible disruption of service somewhere in the country by computer "hackers"  breaking into the phone network.  </P> <P> Non-specific threats had been made to invade the massive computers that control  the telephone network but not to attack physical facilities, industry sources  said.  </P> <P> The sources said the threats apparently were in connection with the sentencing,  scheduled in Atlanta this afternoon, of three members of a hackers' group  called the Legion of Doom who had broken into BellSouth Corp. computers. But by  late morning Eastern time, no problems had been reported.  </P> <P> "This has been a normal weekday, and there's been no indication of trouble  anywhere in the network," said Herb Linnen, a spokesman for American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph.  </P></p>

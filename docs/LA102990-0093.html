			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOZART CAMERATA LAUNCHES 11TH SEASON ON HIGH NOTE  </P> <P> Beginning its 11th season with a concert at St. Andrew's Presbyterian  Auditorium, the Mozart Camerata continued to shine with the same polish that  has distinguished previous appearances.  </P> <P> Music Director Ami Porat bills his ensemble as a "Classical Orchestra," and  though the selections do not always fall into that historical period, the  transparent clarity associated with that era is a hallmark of this group.  Friday night, a program of Rossini, Beethoven and Mozart emerged clean, precise  and energetic, admirably controlled despite echoey acoustics in the church.  </P> <P> Pianist Daniel Pollack joined the orchestra as the protagonist in Beethoven's  "Emperor" Concerto. Pollack is perhaps best known to the general public for his  prize-winning, pyrotechnic ghost performance (for actress Amy Irving) of  Prokofiev's Third Concerto in the movie "The Competition." He brought the same  technical mastery to serve an abundantly lyrical reading of the fifth Beethoven  concerto.  </P> <P> Beethoven offers the pianist a wealth of opportunity for virtuosic display in  this work. But Pollack emphasized beauty over bravura, even in some of the most  tempting chordal passages of the opening movement. And while the pianist drew  less contrast between lyric and tense sections than did his orchestral cohorts,  he nevertheless held appealing command.  </P> <P> There were some exciting moments of abandon in Pollack's performance --  larger-than-life chordal sections and fiery scale passages with which to close  the Rondo. Still, his caressing attention to a naturally unfolding, sweeping  line in the Poco adagio, defined by thoughtfully weighting each note, created  the most lasting impression.  </P> <P> On their part, orchestral members brought the same spirit to their well-honed  machine that characterized their reading of Rossini's Overture to "L'Inganno  Felice" and Mozart's "Linz" Symphony. Porat knows how to demand a gracefully  majestic phrase and still keep overall structure in sight. As witnessed  particularly by the symphony, he seems to encourage sympathetic listening among  his players, both individually and in sections. The piece shimmered with an  illuminating interplay of lines defined by apt control of dynamics and accent,  all unhindered by even the most vigorous of presto finales.  </P></p>

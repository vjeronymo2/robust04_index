			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (3): A few wobbles have not upset the tandem - The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is approaching the June Euro-elections in a confident mood When the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition was formed in January 1993, after the last general election, some political pundits were predicting that it would not survive two years. The 1982-87 Fine Gael-Labour coalition broke down after four years, in disagreement over economic policy and over Labour's eclipse by its larger, and conservative partner, Fine Gael. The last coalition, formed in 1989 by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, collapsed in 1992, culminating in the spectacle of the two party leaders accusing each other of being liars from the witness box of a public inquiry into the Irish beef industry (the report of which is finally expected to see the light of day in June this year). Some early ministerial turf battles aside, the latest coalition partners have displayed a surprising degree of cohesion though, and are now approaching the June Euro-elections in confident mood. They are even contemplating an unprecedented voting pact to make sure that their candidates get an easy ride to Strasbourg. The few wobbles that have occurred in public, usually when the word privatisation has been mentioned, have not yet been sufficient to throw the tandem out of control. The latest batch of economic forecasts are confidently predicting strong growth, low inflation, and rising employment levels up to the end of the decade. Even the sun has been putting in a strong appearance over the past month after one of the dreariest and wettest winters on record. A spokesman for Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said: 'There is a strong feel-good factor and the government is riding high. 'The coalition is performing well, and if anything should go wrong, we will simply batten down the hatches and ride it out.' Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour party leader is in an equally optimistic mood. 'We are well on course. Unemployment is edging down and other problem areas such as health, education and housing are effectively off the political agenda because of the progress that has been made on all these fronts,' he said. Public housing starts are well up, 17,000 people have been taken off hospital waiting lists, and additional resources are being pumped into education. If progress has not been as rapid on the jobs front as Labour would have hoped 'we have at least established our credibility with the markets in the past two budgets', said Mr Spring. With so much good news about, the opposition - flap its arms as it may  - has been unable to unnerve the complacent coalition beast. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, has still to recover from its miserable performance in the 1992 elections. Mr John Bruton, the party leader, with one eye constantly over his shoulder, wondering where the next challenge to his leadership might come from, has been unable to do more than snipe at occasional government blunders. Red faces there have been on government benches - when a promised pot of EU structural funds turned out to be only three-quarters full, when a middle-class outcry over a residential property tax sent the finance minister scurrying back to his calculator and when a whiff of sexual scandal entered the Dail (parliament) after a Labour minister was publicly reprimanded by Mr Spring for his 'poor judgement' in having chatted to a homosexual in his parked car in Dublin's Phoenix Park. But none of these issues have set coalition knees trembling. Issues that might, especially in Fianna Fail ranks, such as sorting out the now-ambiguous legal situation on abortion, and property rights in the event of divorce being introduced, are being quietly pushed on to the back burner. A bill to legalise homosexuality was passed last year, however, with barely a ripple of controversy. Causing more worries for government programme managers is Ms Mary Harney, the new leader of the Progressive Democrats (PD - the smaller of the two conservative opposition parties) and someone who has proved herself to be a tough and competent performer in the Dail. She is busily creating a higher profile for the party, and carefully targeting the right-wing vote which Fine Gael has traditionally monopolised. Sweeping tax reform, privatisation and a get-tough approach with Northern Ireland's paramilitaries are the PDs proposals for solving Ireland's problems. It is not so different from Mr Bruton's message, but somehow sounds more convincing coming from Ms Harney. According to Mr Spring, the two crucial political issues that are now facing the country are unemployment and the continuing crisis in Northern Ireland. The latter has dominated the political agenda of both Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring (who is also foreign minister) for most of the past eight months, although of the two, Mr Reynolds has grabbed most of the limelight. His joint declaration which was signed last December with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, succeeded in creating an entirely new framework for the settling of the Northern Ireland conflict, and simultaneously gave Mr Reynolds an entirely new framework for projecting his hitherto lacklustre image. His handling of the Anglo-Irish negotiations, during which he demonstrated that he could be a tenacious negotiator in handling Ireland's interests abroad, at the same time as being prepared to make honourable compromises and take imaginative and risky initiatives, has greatly boosted his reputation both at home and abroad. But there has been genuine disappointment, bordering on a sense of deception, that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has so far failed to grasp the olive branch held out to it. There is also growing frustration with the mathematics of UK parliamentary politics - the devastation of the Tories in the British local elections earlier this month, has raised fears in Dublin that Mr Major will now be even more beholden to the Ulster Unionists than ever to retain his slim Commons majority in the face of backbench revolts. Government priorities are therefore set to shift to the other key issue identified by Mr Spring - unemployment. Unfortunately, the job of making any significant inroads into the dole queues against a backdrop of rising unemployment within the EU is likely to prove as frustrating as the Northern Ireland peace process. Those same sunny economic forecasts also predict that long-term unemployment is likely to remain stubbornly high at 18 per cent until the year 2000. The coalition has at least three years to run before the next general election is due, and Mr Spring is confident that it can hold together. He of course stands to lose most if it fails. Labour's vote doubled to a record 21 per cent in 1992 as unemployment figures also reached record highs. Failure to deliver on jobs could see that vote halve again as easily as it doubled - and the 'new era' Mr Spring promised for Irish politics 18 months ago may in retrospect appear to have been a mere flash in the pan.</p>

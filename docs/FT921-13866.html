			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Rumours, rules and 'antique women' RUMOURS THAT Mark Fisher, the assiduous shadow Arts Minister, might not come into his inheritance if Labour win the Election seem wide of the mark. An attractive scenario is painted of Neil Kinnock grabbing some populist headlines by creating an ennobled Melvyn Bragg as a high profile arts supremo. The alternative theory from insiders was that he might please the women's lobby by catapulting Joyce Quinn, an obscure backbencher, into the portfolio. But the official line still is that all the shadows will take over their scheduled portfolios - at least for the first six months. Then Fisher might get promotion to the cabinet while Bragg, or perhaps Baronness (Tessa) Blackstone, also thought to be keen on the job, or Quinn (with Glenda Jackson as a possible PPS) is hauled in to pep up a labouring Government. There is little to choose between the parties' declared programmes for the arts. Labour might force local authorities to allocate a set percentage of their revenues to the arts, and is likely to raise additional money by imposing a tax on blank tapes - audio and video. But talk of enlarging the arts ministry by giving it responsibility for film and television seems doomed to disappointment in post-Election political horse trading. To a great extent the Government has already carried out much of Labour's policy - notably by slimming down the Arts Council and pushing funding decisions to the regional arts boards. The Connoisseur, the respected British art journal which turned itself into an American life style magazine, has closed down. So has The Art Journal, a more recent candidate for the collector's eye. There are reports that Herr Flick, owner of Apollo, is wearying of his vehicle. The advertising recession has badly hit the financial viability of the plethora of art and antiques magazines. Against the odds the one success is Antique, the latest edition of which appeared this week bursting with advertisments and controversy. Antique started life as Antiques Across the World, a give-away to dealers from Michael Davis, shippers of antiques. Michael Davis went out of business but the team that ran the magazine persevered, shortened the name, and now publish the only journal in the market making a reasonable profit. The secret is an odd one - humour, plus the lavish use of big names. Everyone from Harold Wilson to Spike Milligan has written for it, which, in contrast to the oh, so serious, tone of its competitors, has an undergraduate desire to shock. The current issue is typical. It is devoted to women, and, along with predictable articles on the chauvinism of London auction houses in comparison with New York, contains a virulent attack by the critic Brian Sewell on women artists. He claims that 'if all the paintings ever painted by every woman were thrown into the Atlantic the history of art would not be a jot disrupted'. So it was bravery beyond belief which drove Sewell, famous for his dislike of social occasions, to accept an invitation to address the lunch of 'antique women' yesterday, the jolly annual occasion when Women in Art and Antiques, an influential but mysterious body of around 100 women working in the art world as PRs, journalists, or dealers, let in the men. However, Sewell was let off the hook since his mother fell ill and he had to cancel at the last moment. Until recently it seemed that the Single European Market would come into being next January leaving the art world in the UK to go its old, sweet, lightly regulated, way. Countries like Italy and Greece were hardly prepared to allow the free movement abroad of what's left of their art treasures so the status quo seemed on the cards. Now dealers and auction houses are less sanguine. Brussels might be holding back on an open market but recent EC proposals in other areas could totally transform the business if they become law. It seems that the French, who destroyed Paris as an arts centre by bureaucratic controls, are jealous of the way London dominates the market and wants to cut back its pre-eminence. The new initiatives up for discussion include the standardisation of VAT on works of art across Europe; the adoption of the French practice of droite de suite, which enables artists, and their descendants, to claim a royalty when a work is sold; the introduction of passports for works of art to combat smuggling; and the return to the country of origin of works of art illegally taken, and acquired, abroad. This could cause Sotheby's and Christie's nightmares in supervision, particularly in sensitive areas like antiquities. Obviously the single market will in time affect the art world and, in all probability, the liberal British system will not become the EC norm. There will be more controls, more taxes. In a timely move Country Life has produced a report on 1992 and the Art Market in Europe which, for the first time, brings together information on continental auction houses and the export law on works of art in the Twelve. It will be a publication much fingered over by worried dealers and auction house directors in the next few months. How fares the art market in '92? There is no reason at all to think that it will be in any better shape than in 1991, at least for the next few months. Despite brave talk of an autumn recovery, most dealers are just about surviving the worst sales patch of their careers. If there is a revival imminent it might just be apparent by next weekend through the level of activity at two of the most popular specialist fairs. On Wednesday The World of Drawings and Watercolours opens at London's Park Lane Hotel, and Art 92, the London Contemporary Art Fair, is at the Business Design Centre in Islington from Thursday. The fairs share popular appeal, in their price range - you can buy something for as little as Pounds 50 - and because they both attract committed enthusiasts. The British have always loved watercolours and it remains the preferred home decoration for many traditionally-inclined collectors, whereas contemporary art is exercising an ever stronger pull over the young, inspired perhaps by the high international reputation of some British artists. From its start six years ago the Watercolour Fair touched a nerve. It has attempted, with some success, to limit the space given over to whimsical Victorian watercolours of cottages and children clutching cats in favour of 18th century watercolours - an under-appreciated and under-valued (ie cheap) collecting field; contemporary work; and drawings. With 50 dealers, and over 2,000 items on offer, this is the place to cheer yourself up with an affordable picture. London's largest Old Master dealer, Richard Green, is showing at Park Lane for the first time, with a Pounds 200,000 Turner among his offerings, while Art 92 has lured in the largest 20th century dealer, Leslie Waddington, whose stand is devoted to the work of the hare-mad Barry Flanagan. There are two distinctive features at Art 92, a Starter's Corner, aimed at new collectors, to which most of the 60 dealers taking part have contributed works priced at under Pounds 250, and a Touch Tour for blind and partially sighted art lovers.</p>

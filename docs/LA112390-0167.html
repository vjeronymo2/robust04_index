			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL EXONERATES KLEINMAN OF WRONGDOING IN SPIRA AFFAIR  </P> <P> New York Yankees executive Leonard Kleinman has been cleared by baseball of any  wrongdoing in George Steinbrenner's payment to Howard Spira, but he intends to  continue his $22-million lawsuit against Commissioner Fay Vincent.  </P> <P> In a nine-page decision signed Nov. 15, Vincent said, "I have resolved all  questions of knowledge, motive and credibility in this matter in favor of Mr.  Kleinman."  </P> <P> But the commissioner added that Kleinman's credibility was hurt by "his  surprising inability to answer some of the simplest questions in a  straightforward manner."  </P> <P> The relationship between Spira, an admitted gambler, and Steinbrenner prompted  an investigation by baseball that led to an agreement in which Steinbrenner  resigned as managing general partner of the Yankees in August.  </P> <P> Kleinman is the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the  team and was accused of assisting in the $40,000 payment to Spira, who provided  the Yankees with information about Dave Winfield.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner thought about proposing Kleinman as his successor, but Vincent  decided it would be "inappropriate" during the investigation, and Steinbrenner  instead proposed Robert E. Nederlander.  </P> <P> Dominic F. Amorosa, Kleinman's lawyer, said today that he intends to continue  the suit and plans to take public depositions from investigator John M. Dowd on  Dec. 5 and from Vincent on Dec. 12.  </P> <P> "Because of the bad-faith institution of the charges against Kleinman  initially, Kleinman lost the opportunity to become the managing general  partner," Amorosa said. "And he now seeks compensation from Vincent and Dowd  because of their action."  </P></p>

He made the remarks to the press after he met with Deng Nan,  vice chairman of the Chinese State Science and Technology  Commission at his office here today.    "As both of us, China and Malaysia, are developing  countries,  we have many areas in which we could learn from each other," Law  said.    He said cooperation can cover many fields as "China is a big  country and has a lot of scientists" and Malaysia is trying to  "draw a balance between agriculture and industry" during the  transition from the past agriculture-based economy.    He said he and Deng had "useful and interesting discussions"  which will be followed by the first joint committee meeting on  science and technology on Monday.    "We have worked out a long agenda", said Law, outlining  cooperation areas proposed by both sides.    By the Malaysian side, he said, they include computer  integrated manufacturing system, advanced materials,  micro-electronics, computers and information technology, nuclear  energy, remote sensing and meteorology.    While by the Chinese side, they cover meteorology, standards  and quality control systems, medicine, medical equipment and  pharmaceutical development, conservation, management and  exploitation of marine resources, remote sensing and geological  information.    The meeting is the follow-up of the Memorandum of  Understanding on Science and Technology Cooperation the two  governments signed in 1992.    Law said Deng expressed China's willingness to take part in  the international floating science exhibition, a Malaysian  proposal to be further discussed at the ASEAN science and  technology ministers' meeting in Manila next month.    The six-member delegation led by Deng arrived here last  night  on a week-long visit during which they will tour Malacca, Penang  and Sarawak, and some research institutions such as the  Standards and Industrial Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM).</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / EU warns on drug chemicals Drugs traffickers are still getting chemicals needed by the cocaine trade from Germany and Holland in spite of a European Union regulation controlling their export, according to senior EU officials. This emerged at a meeting in Berlin yesterday of interior ministers from 22 European states, intended to bind east and central Europe into the EU's efforts to combat drugs and organised crime. The Bonn government is understood to have pledged action to staunch any leakage of these 'precursor' chemicals, like acetone, but Mr Michael Howard, UK home secretary, just back from South America, told his colleagues that 'it is clear that precursor and essential chemicals are finding their way to South American countries'. The 22 states have agreed to operate together across frontiers not only against narcotics but against smugglers of nuclear materials, illegal immigrants and the 1.8m stolen vehicles on the EU wanted list, a large number of which have found their way into eastern Europe.</p>

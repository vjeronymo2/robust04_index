			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (12): Determined to go its own way - Colina MacDougall takes the pulse of Sichuan province 'SICHUAN is the poorest province in China', says bouncy and fast-talking Ma Lin, the vice-governor in charge of the economy. 'We're worse off even than Tibet - our yearly per capita income is only yuan 104. Tibet gets yuan 1bn a year in aid from Peking, and we're given nothing, although our population of minorities is twice that of Tibet's' His solution is more reform. Sichuan was famous as the launching pad for the successful rural reforms of the late 1970s, under its then leader, the now-disgraced former party boss, Zhao Ziyang. Vice-governor Ma, who hails from one of China's richest east-coast provinces, Jiangsu, wants a greater 'opening to the outside world' - more foreign trade and investment. Exports are already doing well. Mainly agriculture-based, they rose from around Dollars 300m in 1985 to Dollars 1.1bn in 1990. Foreign investment has made a start, despite Sichuan's inadequate rail links and limited use of its main east-west artery, the Yangtse. The provincial government still has the wrong idea about foreign investors. 'Pepsi is eager to set up a factory in Sichuan as the population is huge and it's the centre of south-western China', said Mr Wang Chongming, vice-director of the province's commission of foreign economic relations and trade. 'We've offered them a package - if they want to come, they must renovate a steel plant and build us a TV tower with a revolving restaurant'. Conditions like these seem unlikely to tempt westerners. Most of Sichaun's existing joint ventures are with Hong Kong companies who can usually make a profitable deal. A dozen or so apiece are with the US and Taiwan, and a handful with Japan. On the agenda for the future is a zinc plant, currently under discussion with Australia's BHP. Despite the poverty, emphasised by vice-governor Ma, to the casual foreign eye Sichuan seems prosperous. Markets in Chengdu, the provincial capital, are overflowing with food, flowers, pet song-birds, fluffy jumpers and hi-fis. Guanghan county, 35 kms away and the site of a new reform experiment, is bursting with smart-looking busy shoppers. On the other hand, Chongqing (wartime capital of Chiang Kaishek and now, at a population of 14m, China's largest city) and the neighbouring towns along the Yangtse are dilapidated and filthy. Sichuan has been officially ranked as fourth poorest province and may have slipped further. It has serious problems such as a huge population (now 107m) and limited arable land. Half its area is mountainous, inhabited by only 6m or 7m, mainly ethnic non-Chinese, and the remaining 101m, 80 per cent of whom live off the land, are crammed into the rest. 'Our farmers are getting poorer', says Ma. 'We must get on with reform.' Commented one westerner with business connections in Chengdu, 'Sichuan is determined to go its own way, though unlike Guangdong (where powerful Governor Ye Xuanping has ignored central government directives to cut back on reform) it hasn't openly defied Peking.' Officials are discreet, but hint at their differences with the centre. For instance, they were critical of the reflation applied to the economy last year after a massive slowdown resulting from a loan freeze. 'The new credit came too late and it didn't solve the problem', said an economist with the provincial economic commission. As in the rest of China, Sichuan's industry suffered in 1990. Adding to the burden are the hundreds of old heavy industry factories moved there under Mao Zedong's dispersal strategy of the 1960s. These are many miles from raw materials sources and markets and lose money at the best of times. The farming population has also been hit this year, ironically by the excellent harvest. In 1990, Sichuan produced an all-time high of 42.5m tonnes of grain compared with 40.8m tonnes in 1989, but in the free-market prices fell and the state commercial departments would not buy more than agreed quotas. This means financial loss for farmers who had already bought diesel and fertiliser. But this plenty has given the provincial government the opportunity to experiment with freeing grain prices, currently subsidised at huge cost to the central government. In Guanghan County, 35 kms from Chengdu with a population of half a million, from April 1 this year all grain was to be sold at market prices. This meant an end to farm quotas and ration tickets. Guanghan's wage-earners will receive a subsidy to make this more palatable: it means a price-rise to around 50 fen (Chinese cents), from around 13 fen per half-kilo. Little protest is expected - in Guanghan city in mid-March shoppers at the grain store were unconcerned. 'We'll get an idea straight away of whether it induces farmers to plant more grain or less', said Mr Zhou Jiapei, director of Guanghan's Economic Restructuring Office. 'Then in a few months we can see what the urban customers think.' This experiment might then be applied in other parts of the country. Sichuan's reform principles are reflected in one of China's most successful private businesses. The Minsheng Shipping Co. in Chongqing, which ran Yangtse and mainly coastal shipping before the communist victory in 1949, re-emerged after 1978 to resume its business. Now managed by 68-year-old Lu Guoji, son of the founder, this family business jumped from a turnover of Dollars 1.2m in 1985 to Dollars 40m in 1989. The registered capital is yuan 50m, of which employees hold yuan 2m. and the rest is in family hands. Mr Lu has put his son in charge of the Hong Kong office and a cousin (a former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences) into one of his light-industrial joint ventures. Now handling about 50 containers a month, he plans to build his own container wharf and raise the number to 3,000 a month. HIs other businesses are multiplying. He is making piles of money where the three other (state-run) shipping companies in Chongqing are losing it. It is a pity Sichuan is not free to apply Mr Lu's private enterprise principles in other areas.</p>

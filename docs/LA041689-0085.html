			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRADING SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Sullivan gives Shakespeare in L.A. Theater a "D" but mentions ony the Taper,  Old Globe, Ahmanson and L.A.T.C. Has he seen the Bard's work at any waiver  theaters recently?  </P> <P> With talented and versatile actors working in our theaters -- albeit on the  small-theater level -- we don't need a Brit to show us how to do Shakespeare.  What we do need is a critic who grades the work of all the students, not just  the big kids in the class!  </P> <P> STANLEY BENTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

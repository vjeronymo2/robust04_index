			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Continuing problems at ASME hit Billam shares Continuing problems at its Aircraft and Sheet Metal Engineers subsidiary are expected to lead to J Billam, the precision engineering company, reporting a loss for the calendar year. The shares fell 19p to 123p yesterday. After the company warned of a downturn at ASME 12 months ago the shares fell 50p to 219p and they ended 10p down at 134p in September after reorganisation costs at the offshoot contributed to lower interim pre-tax profits. The Sheffield-based company also announced that it had appointed Mr Barry Truman, as group chief executive, to help sort out ASME and then return Billam to growth. Mr Truman, has been a non-executive director for almost five years and has served in senior management positions within the industry. Mr Stephen Ingram, chairman, said the problems at ASME were irritating and frustrating. 'We have not lost any customers, but the disruption caused by the restructuring and the state of the aerospace market have left the company in losses. 'We are paying the short-term price for longer term benefits.' He added that the restructuring was almost complete and 1995 should see a return to profits. Billam's other activities were performing satisfactorily, but were not making enough to cover the ASME losses. However, the company expects to be able to hold the final dividend at 3.1p for an unchanged total of 5.3p.</p>

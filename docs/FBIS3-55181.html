The chamber's chairman, Anatoliy Vengerov, granted  ITAR-TASS an interview in which he said the new chamber was  designed to reinforce the information rights guaranteed in  article 29 of the Russian constitution, and assist the president  in protecting the freedom of the press.    Vengerov was the chairman of the Information Court of  Arbitration, which was formed to handle disputes arising from  the recent electoral campaign and gave rise to the new chamber.  He is sure that his experience in that post can become the  basis for the judicial chamber's work. The new chamber, just  like its "predecessor," will not be included in the federal  court system and will use moral and legal methods to carry out  its resolutions.    The main task of the judicial chamber is to assist the  president in implementing the constitutional guarantees of  rights and freedoms. Besides that, the chamber will deal with  the truthfulness and objectivity of information and ensure that  the principle of pluralism is followed.    The chamber will have wide powers concerning disputes over  the amount of radio and TV coverage given to the parliamentary  factions in the Federal Assembly. A completely new aspect has  also been attached to the chamber's functions, the defence of  the "moral interests" of children and youth in (or perhaps from)  the mass media.    In addition, the former press and information ministry's job  of issuing warnings to mass media which break the law "On the  Mass Media" has been transferred to the judicial chamber for  information disputes.    The chamber's personnel has been appointed. It includes four  members of the former arbitration court besides the chairman:  Igor Yeremin (deputy chairman), Aleksandr Kopeika, Viktor  Monakhov and Mariana Panyarskaya. Igor Ivanov, the chairman of  the Central Electoral Commission, and Yuriy Feofanov, editor-in-  chief of the ZAKON (Law) journal, have also become members of  the judicial chamber.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Coskun Kirca: "Clinton, the Greeks, and the </F> Turks"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The UN secretary general has  changed the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. For example,  according to the original CBM's, the Greek Cypriots would have  been able to enter and leave Maras [Varosha] through a road  passing through and under the control of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. After the change, the road will be  under the control of the United Nations. This proposal is  unacceptable both the TRNC and to Turkey, because it upsets the  balance of equal interest in the package by removing entry and  exit from Maras from the control of the TRNC. It is obvious  that Turkey is not going to trust Mr. Butrus-Ghali in such a  vital matter. [passage omitted]    Another change involves the use of Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport  by Greek Cypriot planes. Originally, that airport was to be  used only by the TRNC as an advantage to counter the handing  over of Maras to the United Nations. By changing that clause,  Mr. Butrus-Ghali will enable the Greek Cypriots to fly  everywhere using Lefkosa Airport because they have air  transportation agreements with numerous states. On the other  hand, TRNC planes will be able to fly only to places the United  Nations will allow them to. It is very doubtful that such  permission will be given or that serious efforts will be made to  give such permission.    Under another change, the United Nations and not the TRNC  will collect the customs taxes in the terminal to be opened on  the Turkish Cypriot side of Lefkosa Airport. This change can  only serve to push the TRNC toward not considering itself a  "state."    Finally, while the UN secretary general first proposed that  the measures concerning Maras and Lefkosa Airport be implemented  simultaneously, he now says that the measures regarding Maras be  implemented immediately. Since it will take a year to repair  Lefkosa Airport, this means the Greek Cypriots will start to  benefit from the package a year earlier. It is impossible to  accept such inequality.    Apparently, Mr. Clinton wants us to make Denktas agree to  these proposals!    The same Mr. Clinton apparently also wants the Greek  Orthodox  Patriarchate in Istanbul to have the means to fulfill its true  function! What is the true function of the Patriarchate  according to Mr. Clinton? It is not very clear. If there is a  legal truth that Mr. Clinton should learn by heart it is that  under the Lausanne Treaty, Turkey clearly undertook to enable  the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to fulfill its religious duties.  Even without that particular clause of the Treaty, secular  Turkey would have granted all the religious liberties and the  liberty of conscience to that institution. Turkey does not have  to and will not grant it anything more than that.    Turkey is certainly not afraid to allow repairs to the  broken  down wall of the Patriarchate. Nor is it afraid to allow the  reopening of the Heybeliada Clerical School. Will a few  thousand Greeks revert Istanbul's conquest? Nor is Turkey  intimidated by the merely protocol-affecting results of the fact  that the Patriarchate is known as the theoretical "first among  equals" -- even though it has no de facto power over the other  Greek Orthodox churches. The patriarch's "ecumenical," that is,  universal, aspect is thus merely religious and not valid in any  other field.    Turkey is not afraid of any of those things and it does not  oppose the fulfillment of the Patriarchate's religious  obligations. However, if Turkey gives up defending the balance  of interest and rights set up by the Lausanne Treaty, that would  mean giving up its own identity in the international field.  While the rights of the Turkish minority are violated in  Western Thrace in every field, and mainly in the religious  field, it is inconceivable for Turkey to allow the wall of the  Patriarchate to be repaired, let alone to let the Heybeliada  Clerical School to reopen. If it did that, Turkey would be  betraying its brothers in Western Thrace and denying its own  identity.    Mr. Clinton must be reminded of these things. Turkey cannot  accept having Mr. Clinton stand before it like a Greek lawyer  who ignores the Greek cruelty in Western Thrace. Furthermore, it  is in the high interests of his own country for Mr. Clinton to  give up this foolishness.    The prime minister did the right thing when she agreed to  sign a standby agreement with the IMF. Such an agreement will  be an economic confidence-increasing measures both in Turkey and  abroad. However, if Mr. Clinton thinks that Turkey's current  difficulties make it absolutely dependent on the United States  and on IMF, and that this situation can enable the United States  to demand humiliating and unfair concessions from Turkey in any  field, he is very wrong.    The measures Turkey must take to end its economic crisis are  the same as those the IMF will recommend. Anyway, after Turkey  takes these measures, private international banks will consider  aiding Turkey a profitable business. Given that situation,  Turkey does not have to make concessions either to Mr. Clinton  or to the Greeks for whom he seems to be acting like a lawyer.    The person who must come to his senses is Mr. Clinton  himself. In recent years, certain people occupying very high  positions but unable to fulfill their promises to the United  States created the impression in that country that Turkey can  agree to anything, even to be turned into a federation. This  impression is wrong. Turkey would not sell its identity.  Turkey would not make undignified, unequal concessions. Nobody  could do that on Turkey's behalf, because the crushing majority  of the Turkish parliament and even more crushing majority of the  Turkish nation would take that person down.    Mr. Clinton should realize the following: One of the reasons  for the ascent of the Prosperity Party is because Turkish  diplomacy has forgotten its traditions and accepted mishandling  by the West. Let Mr. Clinton come to his senses. The dogmatic  policy conducted nowadays by the West can unexpectedly discard  Turkey from the Western world. Then -- foremost in the Middle  East -- the balances which will be disrupted will not be of the  kind that can be repaired by the United States. First the  Poised Hammer will be removed from Turkey.    Like Bernard Lewis said, Turkey is not a country to be  mishandled.    Our advice to the government is for it to be aware of these  realities. The concessions of today, made at the expense of  equality, will not end concessions but rather open the way for  more concession requests. It is imperative that Turkey prevent  the desires of the West from turning into covetousness.  Otherwise, the conditions that Turkey will face will make  staying in the Western world impossible.    This nation -- in spite of the economic crisis -- is not  crushed nor destroyed, although millions of families in Turkey  watch on TRT- 2 every Tuesday night -- with tears in their eyes  -- the broken-down people of Anatolia enduring the "national  proposals lovingly." Mr. Clinton serves us in one respect only:  Reminding us the necessity to return to our dignity and essence.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "`Technical Error' Costs Russians </F> in Latvia Dear"]    [Text] Riga -- President Guntis Ulmanis considers a  meeting with Boris Yeltsin impossible in the near future.  Russia has not rescinded in the form demanded by Latvia the  presidential directive on the creation of a military base on  Latvian territory.    The two presidents were to have met 20 April. The meeting  could have brought Latvia and Russia closer together and  smoothed over some political problems. In mid-March agreements  on the troop withdrawal from Latvia, social guarantees for  military pensioners, and the status of the radar station at  Skrunda were initialed.    The ruling coalition has had difficulty in getting the  documents ratified in the Saeima, fending off virulent  opposition from the national radical opposition, which considers  the agreements a "betrayal" and a "threat to our independence."  Now even the agreements' supporters are claiming that there can  be no question of ratifying them in their previous form. The  agreement on Russian military pensioners is under threat. An  accord had previously been reached to the effect that Russian  military pensioners transferred to the reserve before 1992 could  stay in Latvia. There are currently around 21,000 of them in  the republic, and more than one-half are over 60.    Patriots are calling for changes to the composition of the  delegation to the talks with Russia and for those talks to be  conducted in a tougher and more demanding way. Radicals are  calling in several publications for violent action against the  "occupiers" and "colonialists" and for the overthrow of the  current authorities.</p>

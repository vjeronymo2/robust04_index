			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Air Canada on the way back to black Air Canada, having settled its two-year dispute with rival Canadian International over ticket reservation systems, is 'on the way back to profitability in 1994,' says Mr Hollis Harris, chairman, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. An improving North American airline market, new international and regional routes and more gains in productivity should make the turnround possible, he said in a preliminary report for 1993. The airline posted losses for the three previous years. Operating results in 1993 showed a profit of CDollars 77m (USDollars 57m) against a loss of CDollars 145m in 1992. But after special items totalling CDollars 263m, there was a final net loss of CDollars 326m, or CDollars 4.23 a share, against a loss of CDollars 454m, or CDollars 6.13. The special items included a CDollars 80m provision for its remaining investment in GPA, CDollars 31m for its investment in the Gemini reservation system and CDollars 76m for further staff cuts.</p>

According to Shevardnadze, one of the main problems is  financing. True this issue was practically decided during Eduard  Shevardnadze's meeting with the U.S. congressmen and the  President in Washington. It is precisely the United States that  will take upon itself the main part of the financing of the  international peace-keeping forces.    After ending his visit to the United States, Eduard  Shevardnadze set off for Canada.</p>

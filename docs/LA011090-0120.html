			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIXON LIBRARY UNVEILS PLANS FOR 'FACE-TO-FACE' DIALOGUE  </P> <P> Designers of a video-image exhibit of Richard M. Nixon at his planned  presidential library say guests will be able to step forward and ask the former  president a question or two.  </P> <P> They hope that those who do will feel as if they have actually talked to the  former president. With the latest in computer wizardry and more than 400 video  clips, the questioner will touch a screen and trigger an answer that appears  from the former president's lips.  </P> <P> "It's as if by some form of fortune, you actually met the president," designer  Alex Cranstoun said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Nixon's 77th birthday, officials at the Richard M. Nixon Library  and Birthplace that is under construction here unveiled new architectural  drawings and described for the first time their plans to develop  Disneyland-style, high-tech exhibits with the latest in so-called "interactive  multimedia."  </P> <P> Cranstoun said that "The Room of World Leaders" should appear as a "cocktail  party after a major summit meeting" in which visitors can touch a video screen  and hear comments from the participants about Nixon.  </P> <P> Images of the Vietnam War, he said, will be displayed in an exhibit that  duplicates the living room of a 1960s "middle-American home" where the war  unfolded on television.  </P> <P> There will also be a room dedicated to the Watergate scandal that toppled  Nixon's presidency. It will contain elements from all sides of the issue,  including a machine that will play excerpts from the famous White House tapes,  said Hugh Hewitt, director of the library foundation.  </P> <P> The events of the scandal will be displayed in chronological order, starting  with the break-in at the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel and  ending with a large photograph of Nixon waving from the steps of a helicopter  as he left the White House following his resignation.  </P> <P> "We understand the greatest court of public opinion will focus on this room,  and therefore there is the need for full and fair treatment," said Hewitt.  </P> <P> Cranstoun, who worked on both the Johnson and Carter presidential libraries as  well as the 1992 World Fair planned in Spain, said Nixon wanted the library to  include a section on Watergate. He said Nixon has not put any restrictions on  what it should contain.  </P> <P> The library will also include a research area for scholars that will contain  original documents from before and after Nixon's presidency. However, unlike  other presidential libraries that maintain records from the presidential  administration, the documents from Nixon's presidency were turned over to the  National Archives and Records Administration by an act of Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Privately Funded  </P> <P> Nixon's $20-million library is being completely funded by private contributors  more than 15 years after his resignation.  </P> <P> The Ronald Reagan presidential library in Ventura County is expected to cost at  least $40 million in private funds when it opens in February, 1991. However,  taxpayers will foot the $1.5-million cost of maintaining the Reagan library.  </P> <P> The Nixon library is scheduled to open July 20 at a ceremony that the former  president, who now lives in New Jersey, is expected to attend.  </P> <P> In addition to the construction of the library, the project is also renovating,  for $400,000, the Yorba Linda home in which Nixon was born.  </P> <P> The Nixon library tour will begin with a 16-minute movie that is entitled -- at  least for now -- "Comeback." The movie will track Nixon's career from his  congressional race in 1942 through the present.  </P> <P> The largest exhibit space in the library will be dedicated to foreign affairs  and Nixon's meetings with world leaders. In one room, the life-size images of  10 foreign leaders will appear "to be engaged in casual conversation,"  Cranstoun said.  </P> <P> The leaders will include Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill, Anwar Sadat,  Golda Meir, Zhou En-lai, Mao Zedong, Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. A  computer "touchscreen" will display profile information about each leader and  comments they made about Nixon.  </P> <P> Like the other eight presidential libraries in existence, Nixon's will display  many of the gifts he received from celebrities and world leaders. The  collection includes a vessel with the first oil drawn from a well in Saudi  Arabia, a set of guns from Elvis Presley and the original copy of Irving  Berlin's "God Bless America."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visitors Are Excited  </P> <P> The entourage of people attending Tuesday's press tour included a few old  friends of the former president, as well as Yorba Linda City Council members  celebrating Nixon's birthday for the first time as a legal city holiday.  </P> <P> "This is going to be a marvelous facility," Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, who  first proposed the holiday last summer, said during the tour. "Look at the  quality that is going into the construction. You don't see anything cheap going  into this facility."  </P> <P> Mayor Gene Wisner, who delivered welcoming remarks to the media, said he was  surprised at how much larger the library building was than he had imagined.  </P> <P> "And it's built to last 1,000 years," Wisner said.  </P> <P> For Roland E. Bigonger, a Yorba Linda councilman, the library tour was a unique  opportunity. Bigonger had been chairman of the original six-member committee  that was formed in 1968 to preserve Nixon's birthplace.  </P> <P> Until the Nixon foundation was formed a few years ago, the committee raised its  own funds to keep up the place, and its members even took it upon themselves to  pick weeds at the old property. Now, as part of the library project, the Nixon  foundation is spending about $400,000 to shore up the wood-frame house for  public viewing.  </P> <P> "This means the completion of a dream," Bigonger said.  </P> <P> Although library designers acknowledged that the public's greatest interest no  doubt would be in the Watergate exhibits, a longtime Nixon friend, Don  Bendetti, 61, of Laguna Beach, said the former president distinguished himself  in foreign policy affairs.  </P> <P> "He ended the Vietnam War and he opened relations with China," said Bendetti, a  developer who has helped oversee the library's construction. "This library will  accentuate the good deeds and the good things he did in his Administration."  </P> <P> Another Nixon friend, Jack Drown, 70, a retired magazine distributor from  Rolling Hills, said, "I think (the library) has been a long time in coming, but  it's going to happen and we're all excited."  </P></p>

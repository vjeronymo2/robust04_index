			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> JUNE VOTE SET ON SCHOOL TAX  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills Unified School District board decided this week to call for a  parcel tax election in June, 1990.  </P> <P> The tax on all parcels of land in the city must be approved by two-thirds of  the voters.  </P> <P> The district decided not to seek an April 10 vote, coinciding with the City  Council election, because voters would be less willing to tax themselves on the  date property taxes are due and shortly before the April 15 income tax  deadline, spokeswoman Hali Wickner said. A June 5 vote, coinciding with the  state primary election, will give the district more time to plan for the tax,  she said.  </P> <P> The parcel tax is a key element in the settlement the district's teachers  reached after their strike last month. If the tax passes, the teachers will get  a 3% salary increase in 1990-91 and will not have to teach longer hours.  </P></p>

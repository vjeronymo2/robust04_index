			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOATS SAIL NEAR CUBA IN CASTRO PROTEST  </P> <P> Thirty-four pleasure boats carrying veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion and  other Cuban exiles sailed close to Cuba on Sunday in a floating anti-Castro  protest commemorating the anniversary of the island's independence.  </P> <P> Cuban patrol boats were waiting, but there were no confrontations, a Coast  Guard spokesman said.  </P> <P> Boats ranging in size from 16-footers to oceangoing cruisers sailed from Key  West across the Straits of Florida toward the Cuban coast 90 miles away. The  boats, following a Coast Guard recommendation, stayed at least 20 miles from  shore. Participants held a religious ceremony in memory of Cubans who have lost  their lives opposing Fidel Castro's government or trying to leave the island.  </P> <P> "At least the people in Cuba will know we have not forgotten," said Alexis  Rodriguez, a coordinator of the protest.  </P></p>

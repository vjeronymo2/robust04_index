			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Arts: Fresh view of old Franck - Opera The Belgian composer Cesar Franck wrote four operas, the first and last left unfinished. Not many people know that; and among those who do, it rarely crosses their minds. Franck's operas seem to be not just dead, but extinct. Yet all but the most grudging music-lovers will agree that his violin sonata and the Symphonic Variations - not to mention the other chamber music, the symphonic poems, the evergreen Prelude, Chorale &amp; Fugue for piano and the D minor symphony our parents loved - prove him a considerable master. Why has his sole full-scale opera Hulda, composed during the same 'high period' in his early 60s as most of those, been denied serious attention? University College Opera remembered it on Tuesday, thanks to their inquiring director David Drummond. (Last performances tonight and tomorrow, at the Bloomsbury Theatre.) Not only remembered, in French, but restored - in a recension which claims to give us the uncut original, minus a dispensable ballet-sequence. At its posthumous premiere, dimly received, Hulda suffered brusque amputations throughout, and only that version has been published. Drummond has delved successfully to reinstate the lost parts. On the face of it, it had always seemed plausible that Hulda might be dead in the water. The play that Franck's librettist Grandmoujin adapted (by Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Norway's leading playwright until Ibsen) is a Viking tale of violent love and gory murder: not natural territory for the church-organist composer's decorous muse. It was easy to believe the judgments of New Grove Opera: 'almost wholly lacking in genuine drama'. Live experience of the integral opera suggests something different. Yes, the influence of Wagner on the score reminds us that the Master would have pressed the murderous junctures harder, instead of letting them develop within a calm, formally deliberate view. But no, that isn't a simple weakness - not when the structure of each act (five of them) is built so cogently to accommodate them within a cooller Gallic idiom. Smoothly, of course - Franck was an ultra-smooth constructor; but within his chosen guidelines, quite pungent enough. The old cuts in every act, as Drummond details them in the programme-book, denied each of them its 'symphonic' beginning, its middle and/or its end. In his sympathetic hands, the UCL account made us hear how much Franck's carefully rounded-off forms matter. Climactic passages which might seem tame, if detached from their contexts, struck home in their proper places. True, the mostly amateur band had its lapses in pitch and balance and the UCL choristers sometimes sounded relieved just to find themselves still on the beat. The mostly young-pro soloists, however, strove to greater effect. As Hulda, wrenched by the Aslak tribe from a family whom they have slaughtered, Adele Paxton grew steadily towards tragic stature. Her faithless Aslak lover Eiolf had the lusty tenor (and portly frame) of the Australian Julian Gavin, in a russet suit that did him no favours. Her original captor was the baritone Tom McVeigh, toughly virile until his early demise. As her might-have-been Aslak in-laws, Helen Lawrence and Deryck Hamon discovered satisfying character in their roles. All that was enough to make one appreciate how good and compelling Franck's score might seem in a full-blooded production that respected his period-constraints. Malcolm Hunter's plain staging, in Munch-inspired designs by Michael Spencer, goes a fair way towards that. If it stops short of gearing the action rigorously to the music, it goes far enough to show that Hulda is not a mere museum piece, but a vital period-exhibit. Well worth catching.

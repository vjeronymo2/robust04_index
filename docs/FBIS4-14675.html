			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marat Zubko report: "Former KGB Colonel Believes Ames </F> Betrayed Him"]    [Text] Helsinki -- Oleg Gordiyevskiy, former KGB station  chief in London, who spent many years working for British  intelligence, stated on Finnish television that he was most  likely betrayed by Ames, the high-ranking CIA officer. The same  Ames whom FBI agents recently arrested for spying for Moscow.    "I myself was blown in 1985," Gordiyevskiy said in an  hour-long Finnish television broadcast. "And all these years I  have been trying to find out who exactly was to blame for this  happening. When the scandal of Ames' arrest broke I realized  that he was obviously the one...."    How exactly could Ames have known about the former KGB  colonel's double game if, according to Gordiyevskiy, British  intelligence did not give his name to the Americans? He said  that the most important information he passed on to the British  was sent from London to Washington, but in a "depersonalized  form." Nevertheless, based on knowledge of these reports Ames  evidently came to the conclusion that the information was coming  from a person who at that time was working in London and who was  previously in Scandinavia. Thus the KGB determined the source  which was leaking important information.    This supposition, Gordiyevskiy believes, is confirmed by the  following fact. It has now been learned that the Soviet side  transferred the first major reward to Ames' bank account 18 May  1985, while Gordiyevskiy, the KGB station chief in London, was  recalled to Moscow 17 May. In the USSR it became clear to him  that he had been exposed, but he managed to escape abroad.    The former KGB colonel recounted that, as it turns out, he  was acquainted with Ames. After his flight from Moscow he  traveled to the United States several times and met with leading  CIA officers there. Gordiyevskiy now recalls that Ames was  present at these conversations, during which Ames smiled at him.  It is clear that the Soviet Union knew everything that was told  to the Americans.    A large part of the interview was devoted to the Soviet  special services' work against Finland. The KGB colonel  reported that the main agent network was recruited immediately  after the war. At that time the country "was on its knees," so  it was not so very difficult to incline people toward  cooperation.    Agents were recruited from various strata of society. Even  from among church officials. Not to carry out intelligence work  but to make, for example, a copy from the church register needed  by a Soviet Karelian illegal agent concerning his "birth in  Finland."    Gordiyevskiy disclosed that the KGB's strongest positions  were in the Finnish Center Party, which formed the country's  government many times. The station later penetrated the ranks  of the Social Democrats and even of the Conservatives.    The KGB station chief in Finland, Gordiyevskiy stated, used  to receive encrypted messages from Moscow containing the main  points of comments which were to be put into the mouths of  eminent Finnish politicians. For instance, he met with former  Finnish President Urho Kekkonen and spoke to him in roughly the  following terms: It is desired that during your visit to  such-and-such a country you could say the following for the sake  of world peace....    "For your convenience we have even composed the text," the  station chief would smile and take a sheet out of his pocket  with the main points typed in Finnish.    The former colonel believes that Finland is now being used  in  work against the Baltic countries. Gordiyevskiy said that  Moscow believes that Western intelligence services are actively  using these states to spy on Russian territory. On the other  hand, Russia wants to know everything about the intentions of  the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian Governments.    At the end of the broadcast the double agent was asked  whether the death sentence pronounced on him back in the years  when the USSR existed had been quashed, and whether he had  received an amnesty from the State Duma, which released Rutskoy,  Khasbulatov, Makashov, and others from custody.    "No, it has not been quashed," Gordiyevskiy said. "But I do  not want any amnesty from this Red-and-Brown Duma. The death  sentence is my reward and my banner...."</p>

Minister Josef Zieleniec stressed that the strategic  interest  of the Czech Republic is to see Poland within the Western  European structures alongside with the Czech Republic itself and  other countries of the region.    Director of the Information Department in the Foreign  Ministry Wladyslaw Klaczynski said that Polish-Czech  consultations on building a European security structure would  start in the near future.</p>

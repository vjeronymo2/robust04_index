			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Deportees set to return ALMOST half the 396 Palestinians deported by Israel to south Lebanon expect to return tomorrow after nearly nine months in exile, Reuter reports from Marj az-Zohour, Lebanon. Mr Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, deportee leader, stated at their tent camp in no-man's land yesterday that the first batch, said by Israel to number 187 men, would return tomorrow. The deportees expect the International Red Cross to supply them today with a list of those allowed to return, but most have already heard whether they are included. Israel says the remaining 209 exiles will be allowed back by the end of the year.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Cannons, 34344 Street of the Green Lantern, Dana Point. Open Monday through  Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 p.m.,  Sundays from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (714) 496-6146. Perched on sandstone bluffs  high above Dana Point Harbor and Capistrano Bay, Cannons restaurant is known  for its spectacular view. In the bar -- choose either the tiled, outside patio  or an inside lounge with lots of windows -- drinks are a bit pricey, but on a  clear day a visit here is more like a field trip than a pub crawl.

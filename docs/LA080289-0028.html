			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AGASSI BREEZES; NOAH STRUGGLES AND TALKS RETIREMENT  </P> <P> Defending champion Andre Agassi defeated Glenn Michibata of Canada, 6-2, 6-2,  and Yannick Noah survived a match point before downing Jeremy Bates of Britain,  4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2, in the opening round of the Volvo International tennis  tournament Tuesday at Stratton Mountain, Vt.  </P> <P> After his match, Noah said he may retire after the U.S. Open in September. Noah  was ranked as high as No. 3 in the world in 1986, but has been plagued by  injuries since then and fallen to 25th.  </P> <P> "I'd love to play some semifinals and finals, but struggling in the first round  isn't much fun," said Noah, who hasn't won a title this year.  </P> <P> When he does stop playing, Noah said he plans to sail around the world for  several years and then return to school.  </P> <P> "I don't know exactly what I'm going to learn, but I'm definitely going to go  back and spend some time learning more about philosophy or some religions," he  said.  </P> <P> Noah rallied after falling behind 4-2 in the second-set tiebreaker.  </P> <P> "I had just had it, and then came back and won," he said. "In a tiebreaker  anything can happen and I was happy I won it."  </P> <P> Agassi, 19, spent more time talking about his reputation than his victory over  Michibata. Agassi, of Las Vegas, has failed to win a tournament this year after  capturing six titles last year, and his flamboyant style has been criticized.  </P> <P> Agassi said reporters have taken his comments out of context and made him look  like "I'm some sort of egotistical maniac."  </P> <P> "It really made you question whether it was really worth it," he said.  </P> <P> Bettina Bunge, once ranked sixth in the world, returned to singles play for the  first time since 1987 and defeated No. 5-seeded Lori McNeil, 6-2, 6-0, in the  $200,000 Great American Bank tournament at San Diego.  </P> <P> Bunge outplayed McNeil in making her comeback from the knee and foot injuries  that sidelined her for more than a year.  </P> <P> While McNeil became the third seeded player to fall in the opening round, No.  2-seeded Zina Garrison prevailed over Jenny Byrne, 6-1, 7-5, in another first  round match.  </P> <P> In a second-round match, top-ranked Steffi Graf defeated Betsy Nagelsen, 6-1,  6-1, in 43 minutes.  </P> <P> Bunge, who had her top ranking in 1983, returned to doubles competition in  March before trying singles against McNeil, who is ranked 24th.  </P> <P> "This is certainly a nice surprise, but one match isn't enough to tell you 'yes  or no,' " said Bunge, who lives in Monaco. "It is a period of tests. It would  be naive to say otherwise."  </P> <P> Defending champion Kent Carlsson of Sweden overcame a second-set lapse to  defeat Diego Perez of Uruguay, 7-5, 1-6, 6-2, and move into the second round of  the $350,000 Austrian Open tennis tournament at Kitzbuhel, Austria.  </P></p>

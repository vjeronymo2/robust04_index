			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / State of the Art: The verbiage of creativity that is. . .mad, bad and dangerous to use - Fine Art, on whose authority is it great? / Patricia Morison explains why connoisseurship became a dirty word ART Appreciation at my junior school meant staring at black-and-white slides of Great Works such as Constable's 'Hay Wain' or (more daringly) the 'Rokeby Venus'. 'Appreciating' art was then seen as was a social accomplishment like being able to sing in tune, only less useful. It would enable one to tackleart galleries and exhibitions; without it, one would simply not 'understand'. Modern children have been freed from that kind of aesthetic handbagging because of the pervasive influence something called the New Art History. So what is the New Art History, and how does it affect the ordinary art lover? In 1973 TJ Clark published two celebrated books on Courbet, and 19th-century French realist painting. Clark, a marxist art-historian at Leeds, challenged the kind of certainties which, five years earlier, had shaped Lord Clark's (no relation) Civilisation. Lord Clark set the popular image of the art-historian as someone with an 'eye' who practiced what in the business is known as connoisseurship. Beavering away in print-rooms and archives, the art-historian defined artists' oeuvre. Through iconography, he (sic) unlocked the meaning of difficult pictures. Above all, he defined the hierarchy of greater and lesser artists, greater and lesser periods of artistic achievement. He never considered trash or kitsch. In the 1960s, other academic disciplines were invaded by marxism, feminism, structuralism and psychoanalysis. But art history kept its purity into the 1970s because of the kind of people it had traditionally attracted. Courtauld Institute graduates studying the Old Masters needed to be pleasing house-guests for English dukes and Italian contessas. Left-wing ideology hardly fitted the picture. However, at the new universities and at art-schools, there was less investment in the status quo particularly when the field of study was 19th and 20th-century art which was more accessible and carried more ideological baggage - namely, defining the impact of modernism. Connoisseurship became a dirty word. So did the contemporary art market, where connoisseurship bolsters price-tags. A marxist-oriented approach to art rejects the notion of artistic genius as vague, elitist tosh. The notion that there is an immutable canon of Great Art appears equally fatuous. On whose authority is it great? What intellectual basis is there for 'privileging' Rembrandt over his pupils? High art is merely an aspect of 'the politics of culture'. A left-wing approach looks instead at the production and the function of 'cultural artefacts' within society. It asks questions about the relationship between 'high culture' (what the elite consumes) and 'popular culture' (medieval woodblocks, Charles 'n' Di T-shirts, china ducks). Far from all these questions were new, and there have always been art-historians interested in the relationship between artists and society. However, the shift was to look at society first, the art-work second. Studying patronage, who commissioned or bought art, offered a lifeline for graduates worried about how to position themselves in the bitter New v. Old conflict. It substituted the notion of taste, which is relative, for the outlawed concept of quality. Francis Haskell's fascinating research into of the vicissitudes of artists' reputations, 'knocking down and putting up' as he used to say in his Oxford lectures, has also been highly influential. What they now teach on art-history degree courses may seem fairly irrelevant. However, if you read rather than merely leaf through art-books it is worth pointing out that books taking a NAH perspective tend to be far more stimulating than old-fashioned monographs on individual artists. However, more and more exhibitions bear the signs of NAH thinking. Perhaps you saw Monet's 'Poplars' at the hugely popular Royal Academy show. The catalogue devoted pages not to saying why these are beautiful, but to the claim that Monet's choice of subject was intended to position his wares within a discourse which included Anglo-French cultural rivalry, anti-Japanese sentiment, the poplar as a signifier of liberty, and the matchstick industry. The millions who saw Monet would doubtless have little idea that the show was shaped by the NAH orthodoxy unless they bought the catalogue. So, ironically, the anti-elitist interpretation remains shut away in catalogues. However, this year's admirable Manet exhibition at the National Gallery was a middle-of-the road exercise in NAH 'contextualisation'. It focussed on an artist's reaction to contemporary events and exhibited masterpieces adjacent to (but not in the same room as) visiting-cards and photographs. "Masterpiece' is a dynamite word; so is 'genius', 'creativity', and my (ironic) assumption that the art historian is a 'he'. Much of the ferocity behind the deconstruction of the canon comes from feminist art historians protesting that art, and even more art history, are male constructs. The 19th-century hierarchy excluded 'Old Mistresses' even though feminist scholars have shown that previously women were accepted as artists - competent, even good, but not geniuses. Within our 'patriarchal, phallocentric society', genius is defined as male. Incontrovertibly, gender influences taste, and a gender-based reading of paintings is often extremely interesting. However, feminist rhetoric is guaranteed to upset (male) exhibition sponsors, so it will be a while before a major UK gallery explores these questions. Most museums and art-galleries are innately conservative because they collect or exhibit 'the best'. Reactionary forces also tend to include art-critics whose art-historical education predates or is hostile to, the NAH, and who feel they cannot abnegate the role of pronouncing 'I find this beautiful, therefore it is.' Here you may detect a classic feature of the post-modernist intellectual; self-reflexive analysis. How does class, gender, race etc affect how you or I write about or 'read' art? In the wee small hours, art historians sometimes lament that years of 'reading' works of art as texts have suppressed their enjoyment in the thing itself. Be that as it may, the not-so-new art history does increasingly shape exhibitions and museums. Badly done, it comes across as bossy and jargon-ridden. And yet, my feeling is that 20 years of interpreting art as social history has made it for the public a more provocative, exciting, and non-elitist affair than Lord Clark could ever have imagined.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARTMAN, DROSSIN FIND CONDITIONS MORE DIFFICULT THAN COMPETITION  </P> <P> An unseasonably warm November day bothered many runners in the Southern Section  cross-country preliminaries Saturday, although the favored teams and  individuals managed to prevail.  </P> <P> Dave Hartman of Canyon and Agoura's Deena Drossin, contenders for the Division  I boys' and girls' titles, won their heats by considerable margins but both  said their wins did not come easily.  </P> <P> Hartman timed 15 minutes 24 seconds over the challenging, three-mile Mt. San  Antonio College course, finishing 24 seconds ahead of Dana Hills' Dan  Niednagel. Drossin clocked 17:54 in winning her heat by almost a minute over  teammate Tiffany York.  </P> <P> "It was not comfortable," Drossin said of her win. "It was the heat. I couldn't  have gone any faster than that."  </P> <P> Hartman, who ran 14:51 in the Mt. SAC Invitational on Oct. 20, said he ran  primarily for the win and will face Arroyo Grande's Louie Quintana in the  final, Nov. 17 at Mt. SAC. Quintana's time of 14:47 was the fastest of the day.  </P> <P> The heat was especially tough on Fillmore's Maribella Aparicio. Last year's 1-A  Division champion collapsed about 100 yards from the finish while running in  sixth place. She later recovered.  </P> <P> As expected, the Hart boys' and Agoura girls' teams, ranked second and first in  the state, easily won their heats.  </P> <P> Hart placed five runners among the top seven finishers to win its heat with 25  points, well ahead of Dana Hills (72) and Canyon (96).  </P> <P> Billy Dixon led the Indians with a third-place finish in 15:57 and sophomore  Keith Grossman was fourth in 16:05.  </P></p>

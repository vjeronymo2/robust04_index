			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Report examines ways to reduce settlement risk A WORKING group set up by the central banks of the Group of 10 leading industrial nations and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has published a report* examining ways to reduce risk and increase efficiency in the settlement of cross-border and multiple-currency transactions. The settlement of such transactions raises significant systemic risk concerns, owing to the huge daily volumes involved. For example, the BIS estimates that global foreign exchange market activity amounted to Dollars 880bn per day in April 1992. The lack of simultaneous delivery of currencies and the interdependence of payment system participants throughout the world also present considerable risks, the report says. A fundamental concept highlighted in the report is multi-currency delivery-versus-payment (DVP) which ensures that the final transfer in one currency only occurs if a final transfer of the other currency or currencies also takes place. When transfers are made using a DVP mechanism, 'Herstatt risk' - that is, the loss of the principal value of one or more payments in a sequence - does not arise, though other risks may still be present. The term 'Herstatt risk' derives from an episode in 1974 when a German bank of that name was closed at the end of the German banking day but before the end of the banking day in North America. As a result, the D-Mark leg of some of Herstatt's foreign exchange contracts had been settled before the closure of the bank but the dollar legs of those contracts had not yet been fully paid. The report also notes that serious liquidity problems could arise in the absence of a multi-currency DVP settlement process. For instance, a fear of incurring a principal risk might lead some market participants to refuse to honour their obligations in earlier-settling currencies out of concern that a 'suspect' counterparty would not be able to settle its associated obligations in later-settling currencies. *Central bank payment and settlement services with respect to cross-border and multi-currency transactions, published by the Bank for International Settlements, Basle, Switzerland.</p>

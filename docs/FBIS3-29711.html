			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will lead a  100-member delegation, including about 40 businessmen, on an  official visit to Vietnam next month, Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri announced yesterday. The visit, from March 16 to 19, is  at the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who visited  Thailand last year. It was intended to follow up on previous  agreements with Hanoi and to boost Thai-Vietnamese economic  cooperation. Chuan will be the first head of government to visit  Vietnam in the wake of the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo on  Feb 3.    The premier will meet Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and pay a  courtesy call on the Vietnamese Communist Party  Secretary-General Do Muoi. Government officials will have a  plenary meeting with their Vietnamese counterparts. Chuan also  plans to visit the southern commercial city of Ho Chi Minh,  Prasong said.    Matters expected to be raised by the visitors include  fisheries cooperation and Vietnamese objections to the diversion  of water from the Mekong River during the dry season, the  central issue which has precluded a framework agreement on the  development of the river between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and  Vietnam. [passage omitted]    Prasong said he expected memorandum of understanding (MOU)  to  be signed for an industrial development. Informed sources said  the agreement will be between Thailand's Bangprakong Industry  Park and Vietnam's State Committee for Co-operation and  Investment, to develop industrial estates at Bien Hoa in Dong  Nai province east of Ho Chi Minh City. The company was still  negotiating over the size of the development and the price of  the land, the source said.    Chuan's visit will be followed up by Deputy Foreign Minister  Surin Phitsuwan, who is to attend the third meeting of the  Thai-Vietnamese Joint Commission in the second half of the year.    Prasong, speaking at the opening of a seminar on trade and  investment prospects in Vietnam, urged closer cooperation  between the government and the private sector to reinforce the  capability of Thai business to compete in Vietnam and other  Indochinese markets.    He said the setting up of the Joint Commission, agreements  on  investment protection and promotion, and cooperation between the  Board of Investment and Hanoi's State Committee on Co-operation  and Investment has resulted in increased bilateral trade and  investment.    Trade with Vietnam has risen from Bt 3.98 billion in 1992 to  Bt4.18 billion in the first 10 months of last year. Up to the  end of January, Thai investment in Vietnam was worth U.S.  $141.96 million spread over 31 projects--ranking 12th among  foreign investors.    In 1992, the government gave more than Bt 15 million in  assistance to Vietnam for education, agricultural development  and vocational training. Planned technical assistance to  Vietnam from 1993 to 1995 totals Bt150 million.    Prasong said to attract investment Vietnam needs to urgently  accelerate tax reform and improve state management of  expenditure, education, the legal infrastructure, the banking  system and liberalize the labour market. [passage omitted]    Thai businessmen in Vietnam yesterday urged Chuan to push  for  government-to-government agreement on an Indochinese Fund to  give Thai businesses a competitive edge. Other suggestions  included accelerating efforts to develop a transportation  network though sea and land routes linking Thailand and Vietnam  through Cambodia, to accelerate trade and tourism.</p>

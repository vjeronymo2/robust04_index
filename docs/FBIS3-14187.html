This center, he said, should be supported by the  rest of the Arab states in order to influence the position of  the United States, which sees itself as a peace partner.    Speaking to SAWT AL-SHA'B yesterday before his departure  from  Amman to Tunis, Abu-Sharif said the Security Council resolution  that condemned the Hebron massacre was general. However, he  said, employing it appropriately according to a detailed plan  may create more pressure for the evacuation of settlers from the  occupied territories. He stressed that in the aftermath of the  mosque massacre, the Oslo and Cairo agreements should be  reconsidered and some points on the transitional and final  stages should be discussed.    He admitted that the Palestinian and Arab campaign of  protest  against the massacre did not rise to the level of the event,  adding that despite its tragic nature, this massacre was a  chance for the Palestinians and Arabs to intensively pressure  the United States into forcing Israel to implement the  resolutions of international legitimacy.</p>

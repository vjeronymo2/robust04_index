			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Budapest Bank: Increase in Interest </F> Rates; Increase in Imports Expected"]    [Text] The great question this year will be the development  of the balance of trade and the balance of payments, we learned  at the Budapest Bank's 3 March briefing on macroeconomic  prognoses. According to department head Peter Bihari, both the  increase in consumer activity and the acceleration in demand for  investment will primarily increase the import of products. The  growth of exports will not be able to keep pace with imports,  and thus the trade deficit could be in excess of $3 billion.    The expected budget deficit of 300-350 billion forints will  have a similar effect. Such a deficit will be impossible to  finance on the domestic financial market; according to  indications the population's inclination to save is also waning.  Thus, in any case, one will have to seek credit from foreign  markets, or perhaps the next government will use up a portion of  the foreign currency reserves.    Incidentally, it was also said at the briefing that as of 2  March Budapest Bank increased interest payments on every  short-term and long-term savings account. The increase is  between 2 and 3 percent, depending on the term of the account;  thus, for savings accounts with a term of 1-6 months, it will  pay 16-19 percent instead of the previous 14-16.5 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 13 Jun (MENA)--Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, the  lawyer representing the two Libyans suspected of blowing up a  Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, has stated that the confession  made by the Palestinian Yusuf Sha'ban to Lebanese investigators  today claiming that he blew up the plane, gives a new twist to  his clients' case and confirms his conviction that they are  innocent.    In a statement to MENA in Tripoli this evening, al-Ghuwayl  said he was trying to contact other lawyers connected with the  case to make the necessary arrangements to contact the Lebanese  judiciary and obtain the details of Sha'ban's confession. He  noted that he would then rearrange the documents of the two  Libyan suspects' case.    Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl added that any negative reactions to the  confessions made by Yusuf Sha'ban prove that there is a prior  design against his clients. He said that in his capacity as  coordinator of the defense team representing the Lockerbie  suspects, he will contact Counselor Philip Khayrallah, director  of the Lebanese Criminal Department.    Referring to news agency reports saying that in his  confessions, Yusuf Sha'ban asserted that he possesses complete  information, al-Ghuwayl said his two clients have a legitimate  right to learn the contents of Sha'ban's confessions with the  aim of revealing the truth.    Al-Ghuwayl added that he will ask the Lebanese judiciary to  give him the opportunity to follow up Sha'ban's interrogation.  He pointed out that this can be done with the help of Lebanese  and Arab legal experts, representatives of the Arab Lawyers  Association, and representatives of the UN Human Rights  Commission.    He announced that he will inform the Lebanese Government of  the name of the lawyer who will carry out the necessary legal  measures on his behalf.</p>

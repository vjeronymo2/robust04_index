			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Vatikiotis in Kuala Lumpur] </F>   [Text] In a short story titled Piem published last  December, Malaysian writer Shahnon Ahmad parodied the national  political scene as a long play in which there were many roles,  but none of any significance except for the central figure of  Piem. "There were those," Shahnon wrote, "who criticised the  play for being a one-man show -- meaning that the drama was  acted by only one person -- even though there were many other  parts." Using direct and sometimes coarse language, the story  ends with the demise of "Piem" at the hands of the other actors,  who finally realise that they, rather than "Piem," have the most  important role in the drama.    It isn't hard to detect the object of Shahnon's parody;  Malaysia's premier, Datuk Sri Mahathir Mohamad, is popularly  known as "PM," short for prime minister. But for Mahathir, the  story could not have been published at a more sensitive time.  In February, Abdul Ahmad, the editor of DEWAN SASTERA magazine  which carried the story, was moved to another position at  Mahathir's request.    The story has raised eyebrows in political circles because  Mahathir's style of leadership is increasingly being compared to  that of his new deputy, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, at times less  than favourably. After four months in the job, Anwar's  energetic style and high profile have generated another focus of  attention on a political stage long-dominated by Mahathir, and  some observers wonder how much longer the 47-year-old former  student activist will be content as Mahathir's understudy.    The conventional view has it that Anwar is Mahathir's  creation and chosen heir. "Make no mistake, Mahathir wants  Anwar to succeed him. That's why he is giving him everything,"  said a former newspaper editor who is close to the prime  minister. But Mahathir has also hinted that he is in no hurry  to step down.    For many Malaysians there is a contradiction between Anwar's  position as heir apparent and Mahathir's stated intention of  retaining the premiership for an unspecified period,  particularly in a political culture which stresses total loyalty  to strong leadership. Some are convinced that Anwar's  conspicuous visibility and contrasting approach on some issues  foreshadows a power struggle. "It's not part of our culture...  Anwar should know his place and be patient," commented local  writer Karim Raslan.    Anwar has certainly not steered away from the limelight  since  his promotion last December. In January and February, he made a  series of visits to Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore that  diplomats described as conspicuously successful. After the  Jakarta visit, Indonesian diplomats detected an improvement in  bilateral ties. A senior Singaporean official said that since  Anwar's visit to the island republic, "I have received requests  for Anwar to speak in Singapore almost every day."    At home, Anwar managed a campaign to bring down the  opposition state government in Sabah. A cabinet source told the  REVIEW that Mahathir hadn't expected the ruling National Front  coalition to win more than 13 seats in February's state  election; Anwar brought home 23 seats, just two short of a  majority.    A job well done; perhaps too well done. "Mahathir doesn't  appear to be in the centre of things, it's all Anwar," commented  Rustam Sani of the Institute of Strategic and International  Studies. Mahathir denies any backstage bickering. "I don't  think there are any problems. The problems are imagined by  other people, it is wishful thinking on the part of those who  want to see problems," he told journalists in the first week of  April.    Such denials are not likely to dampen speculation of a  brewing rift. Mahathir also claimed he was on the best of terms  with his former Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Musa Hitam before  quarrelling with him in the mid-1980s. Musa assumed a high  political profile and was popular on the ground. The sense of  power and popularity, he once admitted in an interview, went to  his head. Anwar has often said he won't make the same mistake.    But the danger signals are there. As well as maintaining a  high profile, Anwar is also seen by some analysts as putting a  small but perceptible distance between himself and Mahathir on  certain policy issues. Mahathir's refusal to attend the meeting  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) caucus last  November signalled his unhappiness with moves towards  formalising Apec as an institution. Yet in March, Anwar seemed  to send a different signal by attending a meeting of Apec  finance ministers in Hawaii where he was one of two Asian  representatives to hold a bilateral meeting with United States  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.    "Anwar could not have gone without the prime minister's  blessing," suggests Datuk Abdullah Ahmad, a former minister,  adding that "maybe he gave it reluctantly." Those who know  Anwar say he is less inclined to quarrel with the West that  Mahathir, preferring a softer approach. Western governments  have not been slow to exploit this characteristic. While  Mahathir was lambasting the West at the United Nations General  Assembly last year, Anwar was given red-carpet treatment in  Washington by congressmen and administration officials.    In a more glaring departure from the shadow of his  political master, Anwar was quick to distance himself from an  official ban on the award-winning U.S. film Schindler's  List. The film, which portrays the suffering of Jews  during World War II, was initially banned by the National Censor  Board, which answers to Mahathir as home minister. But Anwar  unequivocally supported lifting the ban, which he later  announced after a cabinet decision taken in Mahathir's absence  at the end of March.    No one considers that Anwar acted without referring to  Mahathir, who initially leaned towards supporting the ban.  But--despite the fact that subsequent demands by censors that  scenes of sex and violence be cut mean the film will not be  screened in Malaysia--observers said the effect of Anwar's  decision to lift the initial ban was to send conflicting signals  on a matter of policy. Anwar supporters attest to a difference  of approach between the two leaders, but they insist it is part  of a constructive partnership. According to Khalid Jaffar,  Anwar's press secretary: "They do differ, but they also confer  a lot. At least Anwar does not disagree with Mahathir behind  his back."    But while Mahathir himself may not be uncomfortable with  Anwar's assertive style, the rest of the political hierarchy is  unused to dealing with a plurality of opinion at the top. "They  don't like disagreement, it's unsettling and bad for business,"  suggested one political analyst.    But what if the source of friction does not stem from the  top? Some observers consider that the large body of supporters  Anwar attracted in the run-up to his election as deputy  president of the ruling United Malays National Organisation  (Umno) last year--a run initially opposed by Mahathir--is  putting pressure on him to speed up the succession process.  They are seen as eager to hasten the day Anwar takes over so  that they can accelerate their own political careers. They  favour holding the next general election sooner rather than  later, expecting the new cabinet to reflect Anwar's strength in  Umno.    Some of Anwar's aides also blame the business community for  fuelling rumours of a split. They blame this on the intense  competition for contracts stemming from the prospective  privatisation of government holdings. "Some businessmen who  were accustomed to favours before Anwar became finance minister  are deliberately spreading rumours that he has fallen out with  Mahathir," said an Anwar aide.    Those who feel left out of Anwar's circle may regard their  interests best served by encouraging Mahathir to feel upstaged  by his deputy, but they could be mistaken to assume that Anwar  can be swept aside the same way Musa was. Anwar's support in  Umno is strong, having won over most of the party hierarchy in  his bid for the deputy presidency of Umno.    For Mahathir this means that Anwar could mount a challenge  to  his Umno presidency at the next party elections scheduled for  1996. For some observers, the balance of power is beginning to  look precarious even within Umno.    Every influential politician has his followers, but some  observers regard the attention Anwar has attracted as  symptomatic of changes in Umno. Factionalism is not new to the  party, argues political analyst Abdul Razak Baginda, but the  shift towards more corporate involvement in the party has raised  the stakes. "That's not part of our tradition," he says, "and  the competition is more intense."</p>

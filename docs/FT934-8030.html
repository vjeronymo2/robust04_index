			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: GM chief outlines plans for return to net profits MR JOHN SMITH, General Motors' chief executive and president, outlined plans yesterday to return the carmaker's troubled North American operations to an after-tax profit in 1994. Increased sales in the US, which would take the group's market share back to 33 - 34 per cent from around 31 per cent now, and further cost-cutting would both contribute to the turnround, he said. The projections came as GM's share price jumped on the news, released after the stock market closed on Monday, that it would use Dollars 5.7bn worth of shares to reduce the underfunding of its pension plan. The company's share price rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 53 3/8 before easing back later to Dollars 52 3/4 . Speaking after a meeting with financial analysts, Mr Smith said GM was on course to meet its target this year of breaking even before interest, taxes and health care expenses for retired workers. Contributing to the turnround this year have been a Dollars 2bn cut in the cost of materials and a 12 per cent reduction in the time spent assembling each vehicle to 24 - 25 hours. Also, 1993 US sales are expected to reach 14.1 vehicles, up 7 per cent from last year. In its last quarter, GM's North American operations made a net loss of Dollars 1.12bn, after plant closure costs and other items which resulted in a net charge of Dollars 289m. The company is planning a 5 per cent increase in vehicle sales in the US in 1994, to 14.8m. Even if this sales target is not met, Mr Smith said GM should make the planned returned to net profitability in North America. He added: 'No excuses.' Mr Gerald Knetchtel, head of North American operations, said that next year's targets are not based on plans for further significant job cuts. The sale of various units and normal attrition would push staff levels down to around 245,000 next year, he said.</p>

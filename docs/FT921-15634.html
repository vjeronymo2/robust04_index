			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kewill shares tumble on news of problems at German side THE SHARE price of Kewill Systems fell 30 per cent yesterday after declining sales at the recently acquired German subsidiaries forced the management to issue a warning. Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman of the Surrey-based computing services group, said the problems would cut at least Pounds 1m from pre-tax profits this year. The share price, which started the day at a 12 month high of 318p, closed at 225p, a fall of 93p. The group, which specialises in software for manufacturing industries, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.69m in the first half of the year on sales of Pounds 21.5m; and Mr Overstall had thought both would hold up in the second half despite market conditions which are affecting profitability at virtually every computing services company. Analysts are now looking for profits for the year of Pounds 2m- Pounds 3m, depending on the extent to which the German losses are taken above the line. The problem lies principally with Weigang MCS, a Stuttgart-based manufacturing systems software supplier, for which Kewill paid Pounds 400,000 cash last May. Kewill already owns the profitable HAN Dataport group in Austria and the acquisition of Weigang was seen as a way of speeding penetration of the European market. Substantial rationalisation was required, however, and Weigang's staff numbers were cut by 40 per cent, covered by a 'fair value adjustment' made at the time of purchase. Mr Overstall said that sales of the company's manufacturing software have since slipped because of a combination of poor marketing and slower market conditions in Germany. He said the fair value adjustment would not cover Weigang's losses; reorganisation at Kewill's German computer-aided design activities would also take longer than planned. Mr Overstall and Mr Richard Broad, financial director, are making weekly visits to Germany. They intend to rebuild sales while cutting costs to match market expectations. Analysts said the German problems were disappointing but they retained confidence in Kewill's management which had produced respectable profits through the worst of the recession. If the recession receded, minimum profits for 1992-93 could be Pounds 3.5m.</p>

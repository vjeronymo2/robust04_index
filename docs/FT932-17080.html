			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: Paying the price of congestion - Electronic road charging may be operating in London by the end of the decade Could London become the first city in Europe to charge drivers for using its streets on a pay-as-you-go basis? The prospect loomed a little closer this week when John MacGregor, Britain's transport secretary, unveiled the results of a long-awaited study into the technological options for introducing electronic road pricing to the capital. Although at pains to emphasise that no firm decisions on road pricing had yet been taken, MacGregor seemed happy to acknowledge that it could be in operation in the capital by the end of the decade. 'We have to consider new ways of preventing road congestion in London from getting worse as car ownership grows,' MacGregor said. At present, there is no city in the world operating a fully fledged system of road pricing to control congestion. Singapore has come closest to it; people driving into the central area at peak periods are required to buy and display a licence that is physically checked on entry. A system like that would clearly be impractical in a city as large as London because of the number of entry points involved and the very large number of vehicles crossing them each day. So the Department of Transport has commissioned the University of Newcastle upon Tyne to investigate electronic alternatives. According to Peter Hills, the university's professor of transport engineering, the technology of automatic revenue collection from vehicles is moving fast. So far, however, it has been applied mainly to the collection of tolls on motorways and bridges. The first-generation technology - the most widespread currently in use - comprises read-only tags. These are simple electronic cards containing an identification code that can be read by a roadside device. Charges are clocked up against owners and are either debited from a pre-paid account or collected later by sending a bill. This system is simple, cheap and reliable. However, it is doubtful whether it would be suitable for city use: vehicles would have to pass the reading device slowly and in single file and enforcing payment could prove troublesome. Some people would object that the system could enable vehicle movements to be traced. The second-generation devices, known as read-and-write tags, differ in providing an element of two-way communication: they can receive information from the roadside reader and store it. This means card holders can extract a log of recent transactions and check how much money is left in their accounts, which might enhance acceptability: but otherwise, it would suffer all the disadvantages of the first-generation systems if applied to a city road pricing scheme. The third-generation devices are in a different league altogether. Here, the intelligence is transferred from the roadside equipment to the in-car device. Vehicles would be fitted with meters which would be activated by microwave signals emitted by roadside beacons once they entered the charging zone. The meter would deduct payments from a rechargeable smart card inserted into the device by the driver at the beginning of the journey. Drivers penetrating the charging zone without a functioning meter (or a temporary substitute for visitors) would have their licence plates photographed by roadside cameras and face punishment at a later date. Advantages of this sort of system include its ability to operate at high vehicle speeds (up to 70mph) and in multi-lane traffic. It also assures anonymity for users, as long as they obey the rules. More significantly still, the system has many applications beyond road pricing. For example, the roadside beacons could be used to transmit traffic information to the in-car meters, and the smart cards could be used to pay for travel on public transport. The principle disadvantage of third-generation systems is that none has yet been developed to the point where it is ready to be put into use. But this could quickly change. As part of an EC project under the Drive-II programme examining how information technology can help solve transport problems, trials of charging systems are already planned or under way in five European cities, including Cambridge in the UK. One of the chief objectives of this programme is to evolve common standards for third-generation, road-pricing technology, so avoiding a proliferation of incompatible systems. It would, after all, be nonsensical if motorists had to fit their vehicles with a different communication system to suit every conurbation they envisaged driving in. To some, electronic road charging may still have an air of science fiction about it. But the technology exists: all that remains now, according to Hills, is for the private sector to come forward and develop it into a marketable state. Given the multi-billion dollar market awaiting the company that successfully does so, that may not be as great a hurdle as it appears.</p>

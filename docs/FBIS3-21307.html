Secretary General of the Democratic Confederation of Labor  Noubir Lamaoui [name as transliterated], indicated, in a letter  of which Al-SHARQ AL-AWSAT obtained a fax copy, the need for a  quick start negotiations between the government and the unions  to study labor and worker issues, to put an end to the dismissal  of workers and the closure of mines and companies, and the  return of all workers dismissed for their union activity,  increasing wages, and raising the minimum wage.    In his letter, Lamaoui criticized the brief and superficial  meetings between the government and the unions, indicating that  these meetings had done little to address workers' problems.

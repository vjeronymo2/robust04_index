			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Secret Maxwell trusts are real 'last will', says MP ROBERT MAXWELL'S last will and testament was yesterday described as 'a death mask designed to deceive'. If accepted at face value, it would have 'Maxwell laughing all the way down the Mount of Olives', said Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP. Mr Field believes the real 'will' behind the public document, which was published in full in the Financial Times yesterday, is a series of confidential Swiss trusts set up in 1984. Mr Field, chairman of the House of Commons select committee on social security which investigated missing Maxwell pension fund money, supplied the FT with a copy of the will. The person who gave the MP details of the trusts  -some of which are believed to be for the benefit of family members - behind the Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation also gave him a copy of the will. The trust for Mr Kevin Maxwell, former chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation, is called Oratio, Mr Field believes. Apart from Oratio, the trusts include Nessi, Junqo, Akim, Alandra, Markant, Baccano, Corry, Iban and Looping. Mr Field's main priority is to try to find as many surviving assets as possible and he hopes publication of the names of the trusts will help in the search. A variety of assets is also believed to be held in Swico Anstalt, a Liechtenstein-based trust. It holds blocks of shares in three private Maxwell holding companies: Pounds 500m stock in Robert Maxwell Group, about Pounds 150m in Headington group and about Pounds 100m preference shares in Headington Investments. The debts of the private companies are so great the shares will be worthless. But it also holds all of PH(US) Inc, a company that has moved funds around the world from other parts of the Maxwell empire. It is also believed to be the holding company for the California computer games company Sphere, which continues to trade. In the will, Maxwell left a total of Pounds 2m to family and friends. Any bequests seem certain to be challenged by creditors as soon as it has passed through probate. Last night Maxwell's former personal assistant at Mirror Group Newspapers, Miss Jean Baddeley, said she was waiving any claim to the Pounds 100,000 he had left her. Mr Field said yesterday that if he is chairman when a new social security select committee is set up he will ask Dr Werner Rechsteiner, a Swiss lawyer who worked for Robert Maxwell, to give evidence. He believes Dr Rechsteiner might be able to clarify the intentions of Robert Maxwell over the trusts. Meanwhile National Westminster bank said yesterday it was planning to return shares worth Pounds 33m to the Maxwell pension funds. The bank holds the shares in an Israeli company, Teva Pharmaceuticals, as collateral against Dollars 27.3m loans to Maxwell. On June 10 it applied to the High Court to decide whether the shares belonged to the pension funds or to the Maxwell private companies. Though the case has not yet come to court, NatWest said last night that talks between itself and the Maxwell private companies, the pension funds, and the administrators had gone well. It expects to be free to release the funds soon. While NatWest has relinquished its claim to the Teva shares, ownership between the Maxwell pension funds and one of the private Maxwell com-panies is still in dispute. Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, is due to argue its case for ownership in the high court on July 6, against Arthur Andersen, administrators to the private Maxwell empire, which claims shares may belong to Robert Maxwell Group. However, Andersen is believed to be at the point of waiving its claim. Page 6 Maxwell saga enters new phase Page 8 Editorial Comment</p>

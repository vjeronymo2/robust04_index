			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUESTION OF COLOR;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DA DRAWS VERY FINE LINE IN PARKING LOT ASSAULT CASE  </P> <P> Being a person of color can be a health hazard in American society. That point  has come dramatically home to Southern California in recent weeks as the  investigation into the horrible attack on a 15-year-old Orange County girl in a  parking lot plodded to a conclusion.  </P> <P> Tuesday, the district attorney filed assault and weapons charges, but what has  anybody learned?  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff's Department and district attorney certainly cannot  be accused of having rushed to judgment.  </P> <P> It took the outrage of the region's entire civil rights community before  sheriff's investigators reversed themselves and acknowledged a racial dimension  in forwarding their recommendation to the district attorney. This, despite the  fact that a number of witnesses said the attack was fueled by the racial  insults by whites against blacks.  </P> <P> But in issuing its complaints Tuesday on both sides of the fight, the district  attorney's office decided to leave out any of the hate-crime charges from the  sheriff's investigation. It reasoned that racial hatred was not the cause for  the fight, even though racial epithets were uttered during the course of it.  </P> <P> The district attorney has the difficult responsibility of presenting a provable  case, but to say that race was a component of a fight but not the cause draws a  very fine line. Amber Jefferson's family -- her white mother and black father  -- and civil rights activists have questioned the assertion of law-enforcement  officials all along that the race question was so complex.  </P> <P> Their argument that blacks have to meet a special standard of justice may not  be put to rest by the district attorney's reasoning. And images of Amber's  face, ripped open by a piece of glass, may linger long in the public's mind.  </P> <P> These kinds of incidents may well reoccur as the region becomes increasingly  multicultural. And to conduct such investigations credibly, all area  law-enforcement agencies must send unequivocal signals that they intend to root  out bigotry.  </P></p>

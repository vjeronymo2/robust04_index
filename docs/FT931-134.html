			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Croda shows 40% advance CRODA International, the specialty chemicals and coatings group, yesterday reported a rebound in pre-tax profits from the depressed 1991 levels, propelled by record results from its chemicals side. Pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent last year to Pounds 29.8m against Pounds 21.3m previously. Turnover grew by just 3 per cent to Pounds 362.9m (Pounds 352.5m). Earnings per share also rose by 40 per cent, to 15.3p (10.9p), and the company, which cut its final dividend in 1991 from 6.9p to 4.75p, increased it again to 5p making a total for the year of 7.75p (7.5p). Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, said 'a significant recovery' had been achieved, helped by the strong performance of the chemicals operation. This contributed more than 82 per cent of the group's Pounds 37.5m trading profits and produced a record result with an increase in sales of 8.7 per cent to Pounds 240.1m, an improvement in trading margin to 12.8 per cent and a trading profit increase of 40 per cent to Pounds 30.9m. Mr Valentine suggested the advance reflected significant investments in new chemicals plants and strengthening of group sales efforts in various parts of the world. In contrast, trading profits from the coatings sector were slightly lower at Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.2m) on flat turnover of Pounds 84.1m (Pounds 85.7m). The results reflected the continuing fiercely competitive conditions in the industrial paint and printing ink markets, which have also been reduced in size by recession in the UK and Australia. Cosmetics and toiletries were badly affected by weak European consumer demand. Trading profits fell to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 1.4m) on turnover of Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 45.9m). Geographically the US operations had 'an excellent year', while the Far East was buoyant with a particularly strong advance in Singapore and a good result from Japan. Australasia was patchy but improving, with good recovery prospects in New Zealand offset by a mixed performance in Australia. In continental Europe almost all of the group's operations were affected by the worsening recession, while in the UK, in spite of continuing weak demand in the domestic market, profitability increased sharply reflecting both good export business and the effects of earlier cost cutting measures. Despite the Pounds 7.6m cost of three small acquisitions, partly offest by the Pounds 4.6m proceeds of the sale of the Manley Ratcliffe honey business, together with Pounds 17m in capital expenditure last year, the group's end year gearing declined from 38.5 per cent to 34.3 per cent.</p>

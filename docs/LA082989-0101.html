			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER AND FILM / MARK CHALON SMITH: IMPRESARIO DISILLUSIONED BY POOR  PATRONAGE AT THEATER FOR NEW PLAYS, PLANS CLOSURE  </P> <P> Jeffrey Ault knew it would be risky opening a theater in Orange County devoted  to new plays by mostly local writers. But even now, with the tiny house  expected to close by the end of the year, Ault is surprised by the outcome.  </P> <P> The 22-year-old Cal State Fullerton drama student envisioned Illusion's New  View Theatre, a 39-seat playhouse in one corner of a Fullerton mini-mall, as  filling a void in the local stage scene. South Coast Repertory does the major  work, the Grove Shakespeare Festival handles the Bard and Alternative Repertory  Theatre in Santa Ana revives rarely seen pieces. But none of these troupes  consistently provides area playwrights with a forum.  </P> <P> "I really thought it would go because there is no other outlet in O.C. I  thought it would be something they'd welcome," Ault said. "I was very wrong."  </P> <P> After about 15 months of meager attendance, the $12,000 in seed money long gone  and his lease with the mall landlord in jeopardy, Ault said Illusion's will  permanently close by year's end. At least one more show will be staged: Tom  Rooney's romantic comedy "How To," opening Friday and continuing until Oct. 7.  </P> <P> The theater's latest offering of two one-acts has been drawing only 10 to 12  people a night, about half the number of people Ault would need to break even.  As with earlier productions, there was a general pattern of decent sales in the  first week or two, followed by a steady decline.  </P> <P> Why hasn't Orange County supported him? Ault isn't sure, but he points to the  region's conservatism and its interest in art with a traditional focus as major  obstacles.  </P> <P> "You'd think people would want to see fresh plays, like they can in Los  Angeles, but I guess they're just not ready for this kind of thing."  </P> <P> That's true, to a certain extent. With the exception of SCR (and occasionally  the Grove), Orange County is a land of revivals, where what is proven flies and  what is unproven often dies.  </P> <P> Most community theaters flourish by offering playbills heavy with veteran hits.  Many local stage fans want a guarantee on their tickets, and new works can't  carry that promise. It's unfortunate that patrons aren't asking for more  adventurous fare, that they aren't setting the trend toward challenges.  </P> <P> But if Ault misread the local audience, he also was naive in assuming that  people would come simply because he took chances. Most of Illusion's offerings  were experimental, quirky and often provocative, but most were also vague and  messy in theme and content. Good writers and good plays are rare.  </P> <P> Still, even with the problems in play choices, the ideal Ault embraced is not  only brave but justified. Within that framework, something powerful may have  emerged. Without such an arena, that possibility is removed.  </P> <P> In one sense, Ault hasn't given up on Orange County. Although he has no plans  to open another theater, he does hope to stage some productions, possibly in  Irvine. Besides that, he will work as a free-lance set designer both here and  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ault insists that, even in hindsight, he would not have done anything  differently.  </P> <P> Not even, say, toss in a Neil Simon comedy to plump up the receipts?  </P> <P> "Well, we thought about doing a revival but quickly abandoned the idea. We had  an artistic direction, and we wanted to stick to it. If you start compromising,  you just start having problems in the long run. Even though we're closing, I'm  glad we stuck by that."  </P> <P> AND NOW, THE GOOD NEWS: Alternative Repertory Theatre, the 61-seat playhouse in  an industrial mall in Santa Ana, announced that it has enough money to embark  on a new four-play season, beginning Sept. 29 with Aristophanes' anti-war  comedy "Lysistrata."  </P> <P> Producer Kathleen Bryson said a recent fund-raiser brought in about $4,000, 113  season subscriptions have already been sold, both of which will allow the  theater to remain open for at least one more year. Bryson noted that the  theater eventually expects to have more than 300 subscribers and will pursue  nonprofit tax status as another way to trim costs.  </P> <P> "I think we have finally turned the corner," she said. "We had this wonderful  parking lot sale where we sold stuff from plastic flowers for a nickel to a VCR  for $100. That really helped, and with the public's support, I think we're  going to do all right."  </P> <P> The theater still depends on walk-up ticket sales for each production, which  costs about $6,000, but the $4,000 is "a nice cushion to have," she said. She  added that ticket purchases have been rising as the playhouse becomes better  known in Orange County and in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Bryson said she never seriously considered closing ART. "When things were  blackest, we took a long hard look at our future and decided this was something  we had to do. Orange County needs a place to see the types of plays we want to  produce."  </P> <P> As with Illusion's, stage reviewers haven't always been charmed by its  productions, but there has been consistent respect for what the theater is  trying to achieve.  </P> <P> Under the tentative schedule, "Lysistrata" will be followed with Beckett's  "Waiting for Godot," then the West Coast premiere of Lorna C. Hill's "Yalla  Bitch." A festival featuring segments of various plays will be the last  offering.  </P> <P> TITLES BESTOWED: South Coast Repertory has named its first three associate  artists, a new title given to playwrights, directors and designers with a  continuing relationship with the Costa Mesa company. The associate artists join  the existing categories for actors of founding artists and resident artists,  according to SCR directors David Emmes and Martin Benson. The three are David  Chambers, a director; Michael Devine, a designer, and Craig Lucas, a  playwright. Although the new title carries no formal commitment, Emmes said, it  does signify "a mutual respect and intention to continue working together  whenever possible."  </P></p>

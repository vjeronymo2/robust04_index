			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Concern over Channel 5 plans: New TV service may be available to only 50% of population A decision on readvertising the licence to run a new Channel 5 was yesterday postponed until September by the Independent Television Commission amid concern that the government may have damaged the venture's financial viability. The delay came as the National Heritage Department unveiled compromise proposals allowing the channel to go ahead using existing technology, but with its audience reduced from levels envisaged earlier. The limiting of the channel's coverage keeps open the possibility of the eventual launch of up to 12 new digital channels. Four of these would be national, with the others allowing for regional variations. Digital technology increases the number of channels that can be transmitted and lets viewers receive programmes on much wider screens. All the proposals are for channels using over-the-air transmissions, rather than satellite or cable. Yesterday's move is the government response to the ITC's announcement in February that it wanted to readvertise a Channel 5 licence. The commission turned down the only bid for the licence 18 months ago, mainly because of a lack of shareholder commitment to the consortium involved. The channel could be a combination of a national schedule of evening programmes, supplemented by local city television for several hours a day. The ITC said yesterday it was concerned that one of the two frequencies originally approved for Channel 5 would no longer be available. This would reduce coverage from the original 74 per cent of the population to about 50 per cent. 'This can only make the prospects for successfully launching Channel 5 more difficult than they would otherwise have been,' said the commission. The commission said it would consider, with a view to deciding in September, whether the latest plans 'do form the basis on which the ITC can proceed to readvertise the licence and, if so, when and on what terms'. The original Channel 5 plan envisaged using two spare frequencies - channels 35 and 37 - to give the 74 per cent coverage. The new plan reserves channel 35 for the launch of four digital national television services. This means some areas of the country, such as Manchester and the north-east coast, would be unable to receive the new Channel 5 service unless new frequencies, subject to international permission, are found. The government said that up to 53 per cent coverage was guaranteed for Channel 5. This could rise to above 60 per cent if the use of extra frequencies was approved by neighbouring countries. Under the government plans, the four present television channels, plus Channel 5, would automatically be given a digital channel. This would allow 'simulcasting' - the simultaneous transmission of programmes on both digital and existing technology. Mr David Glencross, ITC chief executive, said the government had given no indication of the timing of the legislation needed to introduce digital television or of the introduction of digital services.</p>

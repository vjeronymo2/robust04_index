			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The  Litomysl summit confirmed the existence of European ideas, and  the seven Central European presidents who participated wish that  the notions of pluralism, tolerance and solidarity will  contribute to the architecture of the new Europe, Slovene  President Milan Kucan told CTK today.    "If it turned out, however, that the idea of a united Europe  could become unreal and illusory, and all my conversation  partners had these fears, then we would of course have to think  of forming something that represents Central Europe in the  political sense, that is more intense and even institutionalized  cooperation," he said. He added that he hoped this would not be  necessary and that the idea of a united Europe would remain a  reality.    Kucan said his invitation to the summit, which began on  Friday [15 April] and ended this afternoon, implied great  recognition of Slovenia and positive appraisal of the fact that  the country's reforms allow it to cooperate with other Central  European countries in their striving for integration.    Kucan was joined by the presidents of Slovakia, Germany,  Austria, Hungary and Poland and Czech President Vaclav Havel,  who initiated and hosted the event.</p>

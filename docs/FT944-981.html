			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Prudential to put a further Dollars 365m into broking unit Prudential Insurance, the US financial services group, said it would inject a further Dollars 365m of new capital into Prudential Securities, its broking and investment banking arm, writes Richard Waters. The capital infusion is to strengthen the subsidiary's reserves to meet claims from investors who lost money on risky limited partnerships bought from the broker during the 1980s. It will also cover one-off charges as the company shrinks its mortgage-backed bond business and Japanese operations. Coming soon after the arrival of new chairman and chief executive Mr Arthur Ryan, formerly president of Chase Manhattan, the capital injection prompted speculation that Prudential was dressing up the unit for sale or flotation. Prudential Securities earlier this year reached agreement with regulators to pay Dollars 660m into a fund to compensate limited partnership investors, and may eventually have to contribute more.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / People: British Printing Industries Federation Colin Stanley, director general of the British Printing Industries Federation, is leaving in September after more than six years with the federation. Stanley, 57, says he believes there is a right length of time to spend in such a post. It is a source of satisfaction, he says, that he will be handing over to his successor a growing federation in good financial order and with its strategic objectives very clearly set. 'However, I believe that it will benefit the BPIF, and its member companies, to have the refreshment that a new director general will bring.' The federation will shortly be seeking his successor.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Extract from Lamont letter The following is an extract from a letter marked 'confidential'. It was written by Mr Norman Lamont while he was minister of state for defence procurement to Timothy Renton, minister of state at the Foreign Office, on February 23 1986. '. . . We need to be able to answer any criticism that the participation of this wholly-owned government organisation is improving the Iraqi capability to attack shipping in the Gulf . . . 'The remaining IMS responsibilities in this contract are supervisory and relate to the construction of the building and the installation of the safety and general monitoring equipment which has already been delivered . . . all this equipment is directed exclusively to the physical safety of those who conduct the tests and the weapons . . . 'The discreet test equipment for the weapons will be supplied and installed (after IMS has left the site) by French contractors . . . 'These contractors are already engaged in the testing of the missiles . . . Therefore the nature of the IMS work involved and the fact that the missiles are already being monitored and tested in temporary facilities convincingly demonstrates that the IMS work cannot be interpreted as a real enhancement of Iraqi war effort . . .'</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Aloofness of US causes irritation US aloofness in Rio is already getting on people's nerves. All the major delegations are installed in the Rio Centro conference centre, but the US has insisted on maintaining its headquarters at the Sheraton Hotel 20 km away. This not only means staff are isolated from events, but the whole press corps has to uproot itself from the centre to the Sheraton for the daily midday briefing. US representation at the centre does not even constitute a proper delegation. It consists of an office of the US Information Service whose staff are full of smiles but short on the service their name purports to provide. Arriving in Brazil, the land of 1,500 per cent annual inflation, has been a heady experience for delegates from more price stable economies. Merely changing Dollars 250 yields over half a million cruzeiros at this week's exchange rate. But anyone who feels a sudden onset of riches is quickly disabused. A Coca Cola costs a princely 3,000 cruzeiros at the Centro bar, and a local beer 4,000. A taxi ride in Rio costs anything between 5,000 and 10,000 cruzeiros. It costs many millions to make a down payment on a mobile phone rental. The massive sums involved in the most trivial transactions mean people have to carry sheaves of bank notes with dizzying numbers of noughts. When you are in a hurry it is easy to confuse 10,000 with 100,000, and the sharper operators in Rio have latched on to that fact. But lest taxi drivers feel tempted to overcharge, the government has posted special officials at hotel entrances to check that arriving guests pay no more than their due. Merely during the period of the summit, Brazilian prices will rise by nearly 20 per cent, a sobering thought for the eco-minded. Brazil's less than subtle security arrangements for the Earth Summit, which involve tanks on street corners, nearly claimed a costly casualty. On the first day of operations a Japanese delegation was waiting in the conference centre to sign a Dollars 300m loan for Brazil's National Development Bank - the first Eximbank lending to Brazil for seven years. Brazilians are not known for their punctuality but as the minutes ticked on the Japanese started looking at their watches and muttering. Finally the word came back - Mr Eduardo Modiano, the bank's president, had come by helicopter to shorten the one hour journey by road. But the military would not let him land and in fact had their guns trained on the helicopter. So stringent are the security arrangements that those used to Rio's high crime rate are staggered to find that the biggest danger at present is not being robbed, but being given things. More than 2,000 non-governmental organisations are present in Rio, all eager to make their views known. It is impossible to walk the streets without being burdened with handouts denouncing pollution by multinationals, advertising women's vigils on the beach, or advertising Esperanto lessons. Even the most cunning delegate cannot avoid ending each day with a rucksack full.</p>

The document called "On Offsetting Mutual Debts" says it is  necessary to eliminate overdue debts of enterprises and  organisations, to create conditions for a free flow of goods and  stop production slump.    The document promises a "principally new approach" to the  offset of debts and instructs the government and the National  Bank to "work out a mechanism of its implementation which would  not allow a rise of infltaion and a fall of the national  currency".    The government was instructed to offset debts with reserve  money and foreign loans.    The offset will allow to determine those who are truly  bankrupt and begin implementing the law on bankruptcy, according  to the document.</p>

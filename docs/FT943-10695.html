			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Blast hits giant PNG gold mine Ten people were missing and feared dead after an explosion yesterday at the giant Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, reports Reuter from Sydney. The mine operator, Placer Pacific, said the blast was in the above-ground explosive storage area of the mine and the missing workers were employees of Dyno Wesfarmers, an Australian-Norwegian company that is contracted to run the mine's explosives operations. All operations at the mine, one of the biggest gold producers in the world, were halted pending an investigation into the cause of the blast and damage assessment. The first explosion was reported to have been followed by a second blast when a tank of chemicals caught fire, triggering shock-waves that caused some structural damage to an accommodation block, a truck servicing bay area and another on-site building. Up to 200 non-essential staff were being evacuated from the mine back to their villages or to Port Moresby. Porgera had a total workforce of 1,800 in June this year, of which 350 were expatriates. The mine, which began production in 1990, is owned equally by Placer, Highlands Gold, Renison Goldfields Consolidated and the PNG government. In 1993 it produced 1.16m troy ounces of gold.</p>

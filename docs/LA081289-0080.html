			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> IKEBANA: AN ART BUILT ON NATURE;  </P> <P> TEACHERS WILL DEMONSTRATE JAPANESE FLOWER ARRANGING  </P> <P> Etsuko Matsumoto doesn't look for perfection when she walks into her Monterey  Park garden looking for blooms and plants to use in flower arrangements.  </P> <P> If the edges of a green leaf are beginning to brown or the leaf has holes from  a few hungry bugs, that leaf suits her -- and the Ohara School of Ikebana she  represents -- just fine.  </P> <P> A natural look, one that depicts a setting from nature, is an ideal to be  pursued at Ohara, one of five major schools represented at the ikebana  exhibition today and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Union Church, 401 East  3rd St., Los Angeles, as part of Nisei Week festivities.  </P> <P> The exhibit by 25 members of the Ikebana Teachers Guild (Kado Kyoju Kai), from  the Ikenobo, Ohara, Misho, Shofu and Sogetsu schools, ranges from traditional  formal to present-day modern styles and includes works from several feet in  height to smaller, table-sized arrangements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ideas in the Garden  </P> <P> But up until a day before any major show, Matsumoto usually has no idea what  she or her Ohara colleagues eventually will create.  </P> <P> "Before I do an arrangement, I'll think about what I want to do," she said in  Japanese. "I'll have an idea, then I'll take a walk in the garden to see what's  available."  </P> <P> At this time of year, two favorite and available blooms are her miniature white  daisies with yellow centers less than an inch in diameter, and what Matsumoto  calls ho-o-zuki, or Chinese lantern plants, with orange, bulb-like blossoms  about 3 inches in circumference around a small, black kernel of a seed (used as  analgesic in some Asian cultures).  </P> <P> Both blooming plants were grown from 2-foot-long root cuttings purchased from  San Gabriel Valley nurseries, but the Matsumoto garden also includes rarer  specimens from Japan, some grown from seeds, others from cuttings. About 180  varieties thrive in a flat and sloping area in the yama-michi or mountain-view  style.  </P> <P> It's the greenery that Matsumoto depends on most heavily in the Ohara style.  She began her garden because, while it's fairly easy to find and purchase a few  blooms at the local florist for her arrangements, she said, very few florists  can supply, for example, suitable dieffenbachia, tree ivy or the gnarled  branches of pine.  </P> <P> "Whenever I have root cuttings or a new plant, I start it first where I think  it will look good and secondly where I think it will grow well," Matsumoto  said. "Then my husband will come along and see it and say, 'No, not there! It  will never grow there!' and he'll move it, often to a shadier spot. I don't  know. He's the gardener. So far we've been lucky."  </P> <P> Tsuyoshi (Bill) Matsumoto is a professional gardener who received his training  after arriving in the United States in 1956. At the time, only one exponent of  the Ohara School was teaching in Los Angeles, and Mrs. Matsumoto had been  studying the Ohara style for nine years, having switched from the Ikenobo style  in 1947.  </P> <P> Today, there are 96 students and four teachers in Ohara School's L.A. chapter,  and Matsumoto is only one of seven ikkyu -- grand masters -- in the country,  achieving the highest of five rankings in the school in 1986. Each year, grand  masters are tested in their art.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Always More to Learn  </P> <P> Despite her honor, Matsumoto said there's more to study and learn, including  the modern free-style techniques, and many other plants she would like to bring  from Japan.  </P> <P> "The water plants do not do well," she said, pointing to a small cluster of  hydrophilics in a koi pond. "Today you can see many different types of  flowering plants and greenery in Japan that you can't find here."  </P> <P> Various schools of ikebana claim that once students begin to grow materials for  their own arrangements, their perception of the art form changes because,  presumably, they see the growth process in their own back yards.  </P> <P> "To see how a branch and a flower reaches toward the sun, how it angles in its  growth, changes how we perceive flowers," Matsumoto said. In Ohara  arrangements, one almost never picks flowers in full bloom for arrangements,  choosing instead buds and semi-open flowers symbolizing the future rather than  those depicting the present and past.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Advance Discussion  </P> <P> Other ikebana students and Kado Kyoju Kai teachers who will have displays this  weekend may visit Matsumoto's garden to get plants for their arrangements, but  true to form, no one discusses in advance what they plan to create.  </P> <P> "Everyone has a different idea, so there's no duplication in our arrangements,"  Matsumoto said.  </P> <P> Kado Kyoju Kai was originally formed in 1938 by seven ikebana teachers as the  North America Japanese Flower Arrangement Teachers' Guild (Hokubei Kado Kyoju  Kai) in Los Angeles. At the time, it was unprecedented for instructors of so  many schools to form a group to promote the art. In Japan, where cooperative  societies exist today, such a move was considered taboo 50 years ago; each  school had worked separately and exclusively as tradition had dictated for  centuries.  </P> <P> During World War II, founding members kept the art alive while living in  internment camps, using whatever materials were at hand -- sheets of tin and  salad bowls became containers and vases, weeds and desert sagebrush were used  for greenery and nails pounded into squares of wood became the kenzan, or  "frog" holders. Arrangements were displayed in barracks, classrooms and eating  areas.  </P> <P> In 1952, the group officially changed its name to Kado Kyoju Kai and has since  remained active, trying to introduce ikebana to the American culture through  demonstrations and exhibitions.  </P> <P> All seven original founding members have died, but among visitors expected to  attend this weekend's exhibit is 98-year-old Katsuma Mukaeda of Van Nuys, a  retired attorney who has advised the organization since 1935. It was at  Mukaeda's urging that the ikebana society formed in the 1930s.  </P> <P> As president of the Japanese American Chamber of Commerce, Mukaeda said: "To  talk is not enough. Unless we appreciate the art and culture of each nation,  there can never be peace and understanding."  </P></p>

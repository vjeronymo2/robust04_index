			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Food and Drink: A hearty start to the day - Great British Eating / Nicholas Lander enjoys a filling and traditional breakfast An American businessman asked a London taxi driver to take him to Charterhouse Street in the City. Trying to engage his fare in conversation, the cabbie asked how long the man was staying. 'Not long,' came the reply 'in fact I have just come for breakfast at the Fox &amp; Anchor.' For the past 100 years the Fox &amp; Anchor has enjoyed a thriving breakfast trade because of its proximity to early-opening Smithfield meat market. With a market trading licence, which allows it to sell alcohol outside normal licensing hours, the pub has been able to serve pints of beer alongside breakfasts big enough to satisfy the beefiest meat porter. Smithfield's decline has led to a change in demand. Instead of serving breakfast at 4am the Fox &amp; Anchor now opens at 7am to serve breakfast and lunch to those who carry nothing heavier than a briefcase and word processor. It still serves pints of beer, of course. As we breakfasted, five young City slickers were meeting in the pub's back room for their 'power breakfast' and a pint of Guinness. It seems ironic that demand for the great British breakfast - bacon, sausage, black pudding, mushrooms, tomatoes and eggs any way you like them - should prosper because we have now imported the breakfast meeting. Ironic and slightly comical because nothing could be more difficult than eating such food - trying to ensure that the fried egg does not drip down your shirt front - while discussing the finer points of a complicated contract. Although it is now much easier to buy top quality ingredients for the great British breakfast (see the accompanying panel), and not suffer watery bacon or fatty sausage, the meal itself is no less difficult to prepare. Nothing can be cooked in advance - and no ingredient should be cooked for long. Getting the timing of these items right is difficult - particularly if you like your toast hot. Ask any father who, on Mother's Day, has offered to take over in the kitchen. I was consoled, therefore, when I turned to the gurus of the great British breakfast, Francis Coulson and Brian Sack, of Sharrow Bay Hotel in Cumbria, to hear that, even after 40 years of preparing and supervising breakfast, the meal is not as simple as it looks. What makes Sharrow Bay's breakfasts memorable - and two years ago it was voted the best in the Francophile Relais &amp; Chateaux group - is a combination of the best ingredients and attention to detail. Coulson's initial advice was not strictly for the amateur cook: preparing the breakfast at Sharrow Bay is not deemed a job for trainee chefs. There is always a head chef at the stove, a commis to assist and a third on either toast and marmalade duty  -the kitchen makes 1,500lbs of jam and marmalade a year. Apart from natural pride in the quality of Cumberland sausage and local black pudding, Coulson also insists on local grilled bacon, or Danish half back, croutons fried in bacon fat and a fried apple ring as an essential accompaniment to bacon and sausage. But cooking all these ingredients to perfection is, according to Coulson, only a part of the challenge in serving breakfast. Gauging the mood of your customers is almost as difficult. There are those who want to be greeted warmly, engaged in conversation about the weather and plans for the day and those who want to be merely shown to a table and left alone until the third cup of black coffee. Separating the chatty from the grumpy is a sensitive task for the waiting staff. Today, the great British breakfast may have become something of an anachronism for several reasons including health ones. But, if it is cooked well and served promptly, it can still be a great meal, the ideal preparation for a strenuous day out - and excellent value too. My breakfast at the Fox &amp; Anchor - bacon, tomatoes, egg, black pudding, sausages, fried bread (only spoilt by some distinctly unBritish baked beans) cost Pounds 6.50 and was so filling that I happily skipped lunch.

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Rabin denies supplying high-tech arms to China MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday rejected as 'total nonsense' reports that Israel had sold billions of dollars of arms to China, and that some of these transfers included unauthorised American technology. 'All these stories about billions of dollars in arms business are total nonsense,' Mr Rabin told reporters after meeting Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng. The Israeli leader's denials of improper transfers follow written testimony to US Congress by Mr James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, in which he said that China and Israel 'appear to be moving toward formalising and broadening their military, technical co-operation.' Mr Woolsey was speaking in advance of the publication of a CIA report that alleges China has been acquiring advanced military technology from Israel since the late 1970s. Israel's arms sales to China could amount to 'several billion dollars,' the CIA report stated. Apart from vigorously denying that Israel's arms trade to China amounted to billions, Mr Rabin was also adamant that his country had not violated US laws in the transfer of technology. 'We are not so stupid to endanger Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.96bn) in grant aid we get for military and civilian purposes (from the US),' he told a press conference in the Great Hall of the People. But the CIA assessment casts doubt on how scrupulous Israel has been over the transfer of sophisticated technology to China. 'Building on a long history of close defence industrial relations - including work on China's next generation of fighter, air-to-air missiles, and tank programmes - and the establishment of diplomatic relations in January, 1992, China and Israel appear to be moving toward formalising and broadening their military technical co-operation,' Mr Woolsey said. The CIA chief added: 'We believe the Chinese seek from Israel advanced military technology that US and western firms are unwilling to provide.' Allegations about an extensive Israeli-Chinese arms connection have been around for years. According to a Rand Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon in 1991, Israel has helped China to develop a surface-to-air missile, an intermediate-range missile, an air-to-air missile, advanced armour technology for its tanks, and an airborne early warning system, among other items. Mr Rabin, the first Israeli prime minister to visit China, said he hoped Beijing would use its close ties in the Arab world to advance the peace process. He leaves for Israel today at the end of a five-day visit in which he has been accorded special treatment by the Chinese.</p>

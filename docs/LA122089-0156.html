			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUEZ SHIPPING RESUMES AS TUGS REFLOAT GROUNDED OIL TANKER  </P> <P> Shipping resumed in the Suez Canal today after tugs refloated a grounded oil  tanker that had blocked the waterway for more than 19 hours.  </P> <P> The accident meant both the world's major shipping canals were closed for  several hours today. After the U.S. intervention in Panama early today, the  Panama Canal Commission ordered the waterway closed until Thursday.  </P> <P> The Liberian-registered Lauberhorn ran aground Tuesday shortly after entering  the waterway connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, coming to rest  across a narrow curve.  </P> <P> The Greek owners, Base Shipping Service Network, said the 128,000-ton tanker  ran aground because of poor visibility.  </P> <P> A Suez Canal Authority official said shipping resumed in the canal late this  afternoon. One convoy of 10 ships was already heading south through the canal.  </P> <P> Twenty-four ships were waiting at the southern entrance to the canal near the  port of Suez, he said.  </P> <P> The tanker, its load lightened by the removal of 6,000 tons of oil, was  refloated in the afternoon as the tide began to rise.  </P> <P> Shipping company officials added that 1,500 tons of oil had leaked from the  ship and that one of its holds had cracked. There was no sign of oil slicks on  the canal.  </P> <P> The Suez Canal Authority is asking for $5 million in initial damages, it said.  Egypt earned $1.3 billion from transit tolls from the canal in 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Southern News rises to Pounds 11.4m A gain of Pounds 3.5m on the sale of a stake in rival Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers helped Southern Newspapers to lift annual profits by more than half. Pre-tax profits for the year ended July 2 rose from Pounds 7.51m to Pounds 11.4. The figure included Pounds 789,000 (Pounds 868,000) from other operations, mainly related to a Bournemouth industrial estate, and exceptional costs of Pounds 1.22m related to a plant closure. Operating profits from the main businesses of newspaper publishing and contract printing rose from Pounds 5.93m to Pounds 8.24m. Total turnover improved from Pounds 71m to Pounds 76.9m, including Pounds 1m from acquisitions. Mr James Sexton, chief executive, said yesterday that he was pleased with the performance. The group remains ungeared, and is planning to fund from its own resources Pounds 25m of capital expenditure over the next two years on relocating its printing operations in Southampton and purchasing a new web offset colour press. Capital expenditure for 1993-94 was Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5m), and the group ended the year with Pounds 5.8m cash (Pounds 4.3m). The newspaper division, which publishes three daily and 30 weekly newspapers in southern England, reported advertising revenues ahead by 9.4 per cent, with the most significant increase coming in employment advertising. National advertising taken through the London office rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 6m. Overall circulation levels were ahead by a little more than 2 per cent, but the dailies in Bournemouth and Southampton showed a small decline. Magazine printing, including Exchange &amp; Mart, contributed Pounds 23m to total turnover. The group, which has concentrated all its magazine printing in Upton, near Poole, said volumes had increased dramatically, but margins remained tight. Earnings per share were 39.27p, up from a previous 22.73p. Excluding exceptionals, the latest earnings figure is 29.19p. A proposed final dividend of 10p makes the total for the year 13.5p (11.8p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Head of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi  affirmed in an interview with London MBC Television this evening  that the U.S. Administration is putting intense pressure on the  PLO to force it to return to the negotiating table. He  described the Russian initiative to hold a new international  conference as worthy of consideration.    Qaddumi said the PLO made many concessions to the U.S.  Administration after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to  encourage the United States to approve a draft resolution  condemning Israel. But Clinton's administration rejected the  draft, threatening to veto it. We asked Qaddumi first about the  PLO reaction to the U.S. lack of neutrality:    [Begin recording] [Qaddumi] We were surprised to see the  United States postponing this draft resolution. Mr. Dennis Ross  contacted us to say that it was necessary to hold negotiations  with Peres or one of the brothers and that if we agreed to these  negotiations they would approve the draft resolution. We  refused. Mr. Ross contacted us again to threaten that the United  States would veto the resolution. We said: If, as a major  state responsible for peace and security in the region, you want  to tamper with peace then this is your own business, but we  cannot drop Jerusalem from that draft. Therefore, Jerusalem  will stay. We have to see practical measures, not only a  decision to approve this draft; we have to see action taken to  reassure our people that some measures have been taken, either  by the United Nations or the conference sponsors.    [Qabalan] What is your reaction to the Russian suggestion to  hold an international conference similar to the Madrid summit,  and what are the prospects for success?    [Qaddumi] In fact, I believe that the Russian suggestion is  worthy of consideration. There must be an international  conference to assess what was achieved in the past; to determine  who disturbs the climate of peace, who commits acts that violate  the stipulations of the agreement completely, who obstructs this  agreement, who fails to show commitment to the agreement, who  deports and kills the citizens, who spoils everything, and who  is the cause of all that tension. It is Israel. Who is backing  Israel? It is the United States of America.    It is necessary to make an international assessment of this  march so that we can determine who is responsible for  obstructing this peaceful march. It is Israel, with U.S.  backing.

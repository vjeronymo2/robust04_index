			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Break with model habit will improve forecasting results Sir, The interchange between Professors David Currie and Tim Congdon in your letters columns (July 8 and 2 respectively) about forecasting records points to an important conclusion. There are many nuances within the body of orthodox macroeconomics which are the subject of legitimate disagreement. Both the particular discussion between David Currie and Tim Congdon and the more general flurries of argument between the Seven Wise Men who advise the Treasury illustrate this point. But whatever approach is used, whatever the particular emphasis given to this or that point of theory, the forecasting record of the models is poor. David Currie makes the point very clearly when he writes: 'Differences between individual predictions are typically small compared with forecasting mistakes.' The poor short-term forecasting record of these models has persisted since their inception in the UK some two decades ago. Similar problems exist with similar models in other countries. On any normal scientific criterion, the conclusion would be drawn that conventional macro-economics, whether Keynesian or monetarist, does not offer an adequate description of the behaviour of developed economies. It is difficult, both psychologically and intellectually, to set aside a conventional paradigm. But as a former macro-modeller myself, I have come to the view that it is possible. And it is also necessary, for until economists are prepared to do this and to investigate alternative methodologies, their ability to understand the world will not improve.

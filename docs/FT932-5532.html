			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: No way to respond to capital idea Sir, The laconic dismissal by David James at the Royal Albert Hall meeting of Lloyd's Names of the ability of the Society of Lloyd's to raise capital on the international capital markets is typical of the closed mind and closed-door response to the idea ('Lloyd's urges Names to settle grievances through negotiation', May 26). What this well-known company doctor cursorily dispatches with the short dictum that the bond idea is 'non-viable' is similarly dealt with in single words such as 'unrealistic', 'impractical' and 'undesirable' within the business plan. This lack of explanation is not acceptable. Yet without hint of irony Names learn that there are queues of institutions and blue-chip companies (which Names were told so impressed Mr James), which are nevertheless clamouring to invest in Lloyd's because future profits will be so great. Both assumptions cannot be right. Peter R Pennington-Legh, chairman, Chapter Group, Collegiate House, 9 St Thomas Street, London SE1 9RY</p>

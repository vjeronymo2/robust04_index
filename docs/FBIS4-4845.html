			<p>BFN     [Text] Hakodate, Hokkaido, April 4 KYODO -- Regular flight  service began Monday [4 April] between Hakodate on Japan's  northernmost main island of Hokkaido and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in  Russia's Far Eastern island of Sakhalin.    Aeroflot Antonov An-24 twin-turboprop planes, with capacity  to seat 32, will fly round-trip on Mondays and Thursdays,  officials said. It is the first time in the postwar era that  the two countries operate regular flights between Hokkaido and  Sakhalin, they said.    The first flight arrived in Hakodate at 3:50 P.M. [0550 GMT]  Monday with 30 members of a Sakhalin mission, including Igor  Farhutdinov, mayor of the Russian city.    Hakodate Mayor Ryuichi Kidoura welcomed the mission, saying,  "Hakodate and Russia have a history of friendship for over 200  years. The opening of regular flights is the beginning of a new  history."    The fare is 48,200 yen for a one-way trip and 94,000 yen for  a round-trip.    After the welcoming ceremony, the plane left for Sakhalin  with Hakodate city officials on board. Hakodate, a major port  city in Hokkaido, will dispatch an official mission to  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in May, the officials said.</p>

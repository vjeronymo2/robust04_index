			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Profits at Italian energy group plunge to L126bn AGIP, the Italian upstream oil and gas group controlled by the Eni state holding company, suffered a steep fall in profits to L126bn (Dollars 82.6m) last year from L1,188bn in 1991. The drop at the company, due to be partially privatised by the end of this year, will come as a blow to plans to float Agip's shares and reflects the heavy additional burden of Agip's stake in the loss-making EniChem chemicals operation. Agip gave no indication of how deeply it had been affected by EniChem's losses, which more than doubled to L1,560bn last year. Agip owns 49.6 per cent of Sci, a holding company owned with other Eni group operations, which in turn controls almost 60 per cent of EniChem. Among other factors accounting for its profits fall were higher interest charges and exchange rate factors. Overall, Agip had to set aside L2,622bn in amortisation and L933bn for taxation.</p>

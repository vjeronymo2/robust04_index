			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions in public sector urged to be flexible UNIONS organising in the public sector should be prepared to be flexible about traditional bargaining structures to allow better delivery of services, a senior TUC official said yesterday, writes John Gapper. In a study of how unions can help to improve standards in public services, Mr Bill Callaghan, TUC assistant general secretary, said unions needed to take 'a bold and innovative stance' and allow devolution of power. Mr Callaghan was writing in a policy paper published by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a left-wing research group, and the TUC. The paper said unions should accept that competitive tendering could be good for services. The local government union Nalgo yesterday dropped its High Court action challenging the validity of 54 dismissal notices issued by the London Borough of Haringey in February. Meeting Needs in the 1990s. By Bill Callaghan, Anna Coote, Geoffrey Hulme and John Stewart. IPPR, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA. Pounds 7.50</p>

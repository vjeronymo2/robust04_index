"Around the end of the year," the economic  development "did not show a unified picture; however, the basic  economic trend seems to go generally upward," Rexrodt's ministry  now notes.    The economists in Bonn are more worried about the situation  in the west German industry. "Orders received and production  once again declined there during the fourth quarter, following  an upswing that was observed during the third quarter." All in  all, the adjusted GDP, as a comprehensive expression of the  overall economic performance, "may have declined a bit" during  the last quarter of 1993. As a positive element, the ministry  notes "improved" business expectations in the processing  industry.    On 21 January, the ministry said: "The slow climb out of the  deep valley of the economic development had already begun in the  old laender last year. During the second and third quarter, the  GDP increased slightly and probably stayed at the achieved level  also during the last quarter of 1993."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Commerce Ministry is considering whether to  accept the offer from the Iraqi government which proposed to buy  an additional 500,000 tonnes of Thai rice, but the payment will  be made only after the country's frozen assets are released from  the United Nations.    Mr. Pridiyathon Thewakun, President of the Exim  [Export-Import] Bank, said that he was assigned by the Commerce  Ministry to consider the business risks from selling Thai rice  to Iraq. One of the factors subject to consideration is the  amount of the Iraqi assets being frozen by the international  organization so far, and how many lending countries are planning  to snatch the money after the assets are released.    A source from the Commerce Ministry said that if the deal is  approved, Thailand might be able to sell as much as 1.5 million  tonnes of Thai rice during the period, considering that, Iraq  aside, Thailand has received the offers from Iran to exchange  500,000 tonnes of 100 percent white rice for crude oil.  Indonesia and the Philippines also proposed to buy an equal  volume of 300,000 tonnes of rice, while Japan has delivered the  latest rice order covering 200,000 tonnes.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPEAU WORRIES HURT RALPHS' BONDS  </P> <P> Concerns that Ralphs Grocery Co. will be drawn into the financial morass of its  bankrupt sister companies in the Campeau Corp. drove down the junk bonds of the  supermarket chain on Friday.  </P> <P> The $400 million in bonds, issued in 1988 when Ralphs became an independent  subsidiary of Campeau, fell $5 to close at $81 (per $100 in face value). The  bonds, down from as high as $97 last week, have traded at more than $105 in  recent months.  </P> <P> Company officials, however, dismissed the possibility that the 143-store Ralphs  chain would be hurt by the problems of Campeau's Federated Department Stores  and Allied Stores divisions. The Federated and Allied units, which together  make up the second-biggest department store organization in the United States,  filed Monday for court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy case.  </P> <P> Alan Reed, Ralphs' chief financial officer, called the decline in the company's  bonds "an emotional response" to the department store companies' bankruptcy  filings.  </P> <P> "The bankruptcy has no effect on us," Reed said. "It's business as usual."  </P> <P> Investors, however, apparently have been worried about a few matters. Some  concern has stemmed from fear that Ralphs might be required to pay the deferred  taxes of Federated Stores, the U.S. retailing arm of Campeau.  </P> <P> Reed said that under a tax-sharing agreement between Ralphs and Federated  Stores, the supermarket chain would not be responsible for the parent company's  deferred taxes. He added that even if the agreement was voided, the parent  company should have enough assets to cover the tax bill.  </P> <P> Other concerns are related to speculation that Ohio real estate developer  Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., an Ohio shopping mall developer, would foreclose on a  $480-million loan to Campeau that is secured by Ralphs. DeBartolo has signed a  so-called standstill agreement promising not to take action against Campeau  until at least May.  </P> <P> Ralphs officials said even after the agreement lapses, DeBartolo is unlikely to  try to take over the supermarket chain. They said that such a move could  trigger a deferred gains tax bill of more than $200 million.  </P> <P> Barbara Wedelstaedt, a bond analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, added that  DeBartolo probably does not want to get directly involved in the supermarket  business. She said that he would be more likely to swap the debt he is owed for  stock in Ralphs, leaving the current management intact.  </P> <P> Another worry raised has been the possibility of investors filing a fraudulent  conveyance suit against Ralphs, claiming that the chain's assets were  improperly transferred when it was set up as an independent subsidiary. Ralphs  officials, however, said the company has a strong defense against such a suit  and that investors were likely to raise the prospect of legal action strictly  as a bargaining maneuver in bankruptcy negotiations.  </P></p>

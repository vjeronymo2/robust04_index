			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / La Generale hopes to raise BFr36bn: Group plans to wipe out short-term debt SOCIETE Generale de Belgique plans to wipe out virtually all its short-term debt through divestitures and a capital injection, the company said yesterday. At the same time it announced a 39.4 per cent fall in net group profit for 1990. The dividend is unchanged on 1989 at a net BFr84 a share. La Generale, Belgium's largest holding company, said it hoped to raise BFr36bn (Dollars 1.05bn) by year-end, and reduce the BFr30.3bn net short-term debt of the parent company and wholly-owned financial subsidiaries by at least BFr25bn. It plans to raise BFr25bn by selling off parts of its portfolio, and BFr11bn from its two main shareholders, Compagnie de Suez, the French financial conglomerate which owns 61 per cent, and its insurance company AG, which holds 14 per cent as head of the Generale consortium. They will fully pay up the 18m shares issued in 1988 when Suez arrived to stave off a hostile bid by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian financier. Mr Etienne Davignon, SGB chairman, emphasised however that 'the jewels of La Generale are not going to be sold . . . this will not be a lottery.' He specifically ruled out CBR, its cement business, Tractebel, its electricity supplier, Generale de Banque, the banking arm, and AG. The planned divestiture comes after net group profits fell to BFr12.2bn last year, against BFr20.1 in 1989, and 'an even worse' first quarter this year. Worst hit was the group's non-ferrous metals business, where earnings fell to BFr2.5bn from BFr9.6bn in 1989, depressed by a weak dollar and a precipitous fall in metals prices. Higher financial costs from the parent company's increased debt ratios, and the cost of disposing of most of FN, the stricken Belgian arms maker, were the two other main reasons for what a group spokesman called 'a lousy year.' Mr Gerard Mestrallet, sent in by Suez to take over from Mr Herve de Carmoy as managing director earlier this year, said FN losses plus the cost of redundancies had cost La Generale BFr5.6bn. The holding company made significant disposals last year which bolstered its profits, including stakes in two Belgian insurance companies, a French construction group, and in Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications company. It reported extraordinary profits of BFr5.9bn. The remnant of consolidated current earnings of BFr6.3bn, does not cover the dividend payments of BFr6.8bn, raising questions among brokers about the adequacy of its portfolio. 'That is exactly what we're going to work on by clearing the debt,' a spokesman for the company said.</p>

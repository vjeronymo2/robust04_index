			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Georgiy Shmelev and Aleksandr </F> Yakovlev]    [Text] Prague February 19 TASS -- Russia is on the best of  terms with all the member states of the Visegrad group, Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who came to Prague for a  working visit, told ITAR-TASS. President Boris Yeltsin is  continuously maintaining personal contacts with the leadership  of those countries, with which Moscow has contractual relations  and with which agreements have been signed on a top level.    The Visegrad group is of much interest for Russia, Kozyrev  continued. "We have tremendous respect for those countries and  are building relations with them on the principles of equality."  In his opinion, speculations on some "new Brezhnev doctrines"  and the allegedly inequitable relations between Russia and those  countries are absolutely groundless. According to Kozyrev, the  time has come to "check watches" with all the countries of the  Visegrad group early this year in order "to advance jointly, in  harmony, towards complete mutual understanding."    "We are going to discuss in Prague some international  problems, primarily the situation in Bosnia, and to analyse  matters dealing with bilateral contacts in a broader context. I  believe we have traditionally durable relations and good  prospects for the future," Kozyrev said. In his opinion, it is  necessary to discuss in a frank, calm and unbiased way how we  should build our relations in the future and develop partnership.    We should discuss problems of building a new greater Europe.  There are no ready formulae for it. According to Kozyrev, the  participation in the Partnership for Peace programme is one of  the ways and the joining of NATO is another. All countries,  including Czechia, are resolving this problem by themselves. We  are interested in finding most effective, balanced solutions  concerning ways of developing partnership. But we should not  regard NATO as the only way. We have the Visegrad group, we  have other CSCE institutions, he continued. In the opinion of  the Russian foreign minister, we should not contrast all those  ways with each other, but on the contrary, to use them all.    "We are not linking our actions in the settlement of the  Bosnian conflict with the NATO ultimatum. Actually we believe  it does not have much to do with us. What is really important  today is that it should not be an obstacle, that the 'war  parties,' -- the Serb, Croatian and Muslim extremists interested  in the escalation of hostilities -- should not take advantage of  it.    The most important thing is that no one should try to  disrupt  with the help of provocations the positive process that has been  started thanks to the initiative of President Boris Yeltsin.  The initiative of the Russian side was approved by the  president three weeks ago. It is aimed, in the first place, at  creating security zones, primarily around Sarajevo. "Now this  initiative has been given a clear and vivid shape," Kozyrev said.    In his opinion, there is a possibility today to get back  from  unilateral steps to joint actions of the whole of the world  community. The Russian president is maintaining direct contacts  with leaders of many countries, especially with Chancellor  Helmut Kohl (they had a telephone conversation on Friday).  Contacts are also being maintained on the level of foreign  ministers with the "European union three," the United States,  Britain and France. Kozyrev believes that the G7 countries  should be invited to take part in that process.    "The problem today is to take advantage of the  opportunities,  created by the initiative of the Russian president and a  positive response to it of the Serb side, and not to allow  various provocations to disrupt the process. We should  strengthen it with the help of far-reaching agreements both on  Sarajevo and on Bosnia in general," Kozyrev stressed.</p>

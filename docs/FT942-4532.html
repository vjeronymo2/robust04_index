			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Observer: Nummer ein To mark today's Bank of England central banking symposium, Observer offers 10 things you always wanted to know about one of the world's most secretive clubs. There are 170 members of the species; Sweden's Riksbank is the oldest; there are over half a million central bankers of whom 100,000 work for the People's Bank of China; the Solomon Islands has the smallest central bank; over half of all central banks are under 40 years old; Britain is the only country where the governor traditionally gets a life peerage; state-owned central banks perform less well than those partly owned by the private sector; the Bundesbank, Bank of France and Bank of Italy each cost almost as much to run as the US Federal Reserve System; the Bank of England is much cheaper to run and increased its pre-tax profits to Pounds 120m last year; but its record of keeping a check on inflation is less impressive. Central Banking magazine, source of most of the above stats, calculates that Britain comes 55th out of 110 countries surveyed and is wedged between Barbados and the Central African Republic. No surprise which is number one - the Bundesbank.</p>

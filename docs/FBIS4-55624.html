			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sophia Coudenhove: "Seven Presidents Strive for </F> Unity"]    [Text] Litomysl, east Bohemia--Their mission was to  redefine Central Europe. Their powers were practically nil. But  the seven presidents meeting in the provincial town of Litomysl  may have achieved more than anyone could have expected.    The meeting brought Austria, Germany and Slovenia into the  Central European fold, a step toward regional integration that  went beyond the traditional--and unpopular--Visegrad Four  countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.    Former Czech Premier Petr Pithart said that this strengthens  the Central European case for European unity by demonstrating  the countries' ability to cooperate. He said the meeting was an  important signal to Western Europe that the countries are ready  to work with each other and with the West.    "Of course," Pithart said, "it matters to Europe whether a  lone rider shows up or whether it's a group that is prepared to  solve even those problems that seem unsolvable."    In a 90-minute televised debate, the presidents discussed  regional cooperation, alluding to Russia, the Balkans and  integration to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the  European Union. Most of the debate, however, was devoted to  mutual declarations of friendship, cooperation and goodwill.    While Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and others have  criticized Visegrad on the grounds that it classifies a group of  countries as a whole rather than recognizing their individuality  and differing rates of progress, the Litomysl meeting showed the  Visegrad Four's ability to work together without forcing them  into a single category.    Though concrete results were insubstantial, supporters of  the  meeting said this did not matter because the presidents' aims  were broad and long-term.    "From experience, I know how important and underrated  personal meetings are," said Pithart. "The more meetings there  are, the better relations can be and the more problems can be  avoided in the future. Obviously, that applies even if people  aren't affected straightaway."    The predominance of ceremony and symbolism, however, did not  keep the presidents away from more topical issues. For  instance, Slovenian President Milan Kucan said that Western  Europe had made critical errors in not understanding that the  Yugoslav Federation was bound to fall apart.    Additionally, all the leaders vehemently rejected Russian  attempts to exert influence over Central Europe, even through  the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace. "Russia does not  want to be a partner and does not understand what partnership  is," said Polish President Lech Walesa, the most outspoken of  the group.    Richard von Weizsacker said that while the West wanted to  cooperate with--rather than provoke--Russia, it would not do so  on terms dictated by Moscow. Czech President Vaclav Havel  stressed the importance of categorically rejecting any claim  that "Russia has a special right to advise us on what we may and  may not do."    The televised debate was moderated by French political  scientist and historian Jacques Rupnik, who accidentally  overlooked Slovak President Michal Kovac in the first round of  questions.    Klaus, who along with Czech parliamentary Chairman Milan  Uhde, declined an invitation to dine with the presidents April  15--an invitation they had previously accepted--said that the  meeting broke down barriers between East and West and rectified  the impression often given by the media that there is little  understanding among some of the countries involved.    On a local level, the meeting was perhaps the biggest event  to hit the 10,000-inhabitant town of Litomysl since the birth of  its favorite son, composer Bedrich Smetana. Portraits and  biographies of the presidents hung in store windows--Havel's was  in a bookshop, Kovac's at a travel agency--and thousands of  supporters clamored to see them.    "It's a huge honor that this is happening in our town," said  Jan Schejbal, who works at the Zlata hvezda hotel, where Havel  spent the second night of his stay. "Seeing top-level politics  before our eyes makes us feel that we're a part of them, too. It  brings us up to a higher level, and it makes us forget our own  problems."    The presidents of the seven countries are to meet again in  Hungary next year and in Poland in 1996.</p>

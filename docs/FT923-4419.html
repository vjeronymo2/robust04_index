			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: Bogged down Problems are piling up for Tony Ryan, the embattled founder of GPA - the world's largest aircraft-leasing group. Not only has he had to snatch back the controls from chief executive Maurice Foley, but his sons' airline - Ryanair - has hit yet another pocket of turbulence. For once Ryanair's problem is not too few passengers, but too many. It seems that one of its promotional fares - the Flying Start travel voucher scheme - has been too successful. Under a joint promotion with Bord na Mona, owners of Ireland's peat bogs, Ryanair's passengers were urged to collect tabs from their bales of peat briquettes which they could redeem against Ryanair travel vouchers. Since a heavy user could get through as many as five bales of peat a week(costing around Pounds 1.40 apiece) and each bale offered a Pounds 1 voucher which could be used to pay for up to 55 per cent of the cost of a non-discounted Ryanair fare, the scheme seemed almost too good to be true. Certainly this was the view of many would-be Ryanair passengers who have exchanged 3m of their peat tabs for travel vouchers. When Ryanair tried to curb the promotion, Bord na Mona took it to court and there the matter resides. One problem for Ryanair is that the promotion seems to have been backed by a verbal agreement, and some of the executives involved have moved on.</p>

Open daily 4 p.m. to  midnight; weekends till 2 a.m. (714) 631-6602.  </P> <P> This is the sort of place you want to take three or four friends, scarf up some  excellent nachos and drink some very reasonably priced and  generous-on-the-good-stuff margaritas. The place is a dump, but a nice dump. A  homey dump. M. FLAGG  </P></p>

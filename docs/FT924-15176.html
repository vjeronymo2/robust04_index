			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Asset switch creates consternation - Andrew Jack on reaction to Trafalgar House's accounting practices THE ACCOUNTING policies adopted in the 1991 accounts by Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group, helped trigger a double-pronged attack from the UK's standards setters earlier this year. The company's decision to switch a series of properties from current to fixed assets and then write them down caused considerable controversy and concern among commentators. The tangible fixed assets notes in the accounts show Pounds 155.4m reclassified from current assets, offset by a Pounds 68m write-down or 'deficit on valuation'. The fixed assets investment note shows a write-down of Pounds 34.7m from the 'revaluation of property associates'. Both assets were previously treated as development properties, a type of current asset which has to be shown at the lower of cost or net realisable value under the requirements of the 1985 Companies Act. That would have required write-downs totalling Pounds 102.7m in the profit and loss account, reducing pre-tax profits from the stated Pounds 122.4m to Pounds 19.7m, and a corresponding reduction in assets. Instead, the adjustments have all been made on the balance sheet, changing a revaluation reserve of Pounds 84m in the previous year to a deficit of Pounds 18.7m. 'The treatment adopted gave rise to some interest,' said Mr Chris Nunn, a technical partner with accountants Arthur Andersen. 'Nobody could say it was wrong, but there was certainly some difference of views.' On one hand, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the recently-created watchdog of accounting standards, launched an investigation into the specific circumstances surrounding Trafalgar's decision. On the other, the Urgent Issues Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), which drafts new standards, began work on an opinion which would scrutinise existing guidelines and rule on future practice. It did not mention the company by name, but Trafalgar House is widely accepted to have been the trigger for action. There was a need for clarification, because the Companies Act did not specify how transfers between fixed and current assets should be treated. The ASB has its own process of devising new standards and putting them out to consultation before they are adopted into the canon of acceptable accounting practices. But it delegates to the task force matters of pressing concern on which it wants to act more swiftly. Ironically, the task force has already taken action on the subject, issuing its fifth piece of guidance or 'abstract' in July, which will not allow Trafalgar's approach to be repeated. It comes into force for year ends on or after December 23 this year. It states that any transfer from current to fixed assets must be made at the lower of cost and net realisable value. If there has been a diminution in value, that should be charged to the profit and loss account, reflecting the loss while it was a current asset. Meanwhile, the review panel is continuing to negotiate with Trafalgar House. While the company has made a statement suggesting that it will not repeat the treatment in the future, discussions are continuing on whether it will be required to restate its 1991 accounts. It is issuing a circular to shareholders today which is expected to contain some clarification. One extreme would be for the review panel to force Trafalgar to go to the expense of re-issuing its 1991 accounts to all shareholders, amended to reflect the changes. The panel is more likely to accept a reworking of the 1991 figures in the next annual report.</p>

This output, obtained using silicon elements measuring six  by  four cm at low temperatures and under low-light conditions, is  the "highest output ever obtained anywhere in the world using  silicon batteries without using special optical concentration  devices to increase the quantity of sunlight being converted  into electricity." This technical breakthrough was made by an  industrial team led by DASA [German Aerospace], with CISE  [Center for Data, Studies, and Experimentation] (Milan, Italy)  as subcontractor.    The photocells currently in use in all space activities  provide an output of 10 to 20 percent in low-earth orbit and  behave abnormally in deep space conditions. In general, they  are not designed to function at temperatures as low as those  encountered in that environment.    In these difficult conditions, space probes have to draw on  energy sources other than their solar panels, whose electricity  output becomes too weak. Hitherto, probes launched into deep  space have used thermonuclear generators such as the RIG  [Radio-Isotope Thermoelectric Generator]. However, RIG  technology is not available in Europe; for this reason ESA has  been working hard to produce an energy source based on very high  output photocells. Just under a year ago, the agency had already  achieved an output of 23 percent with gallium arsenide (GaAs)  elements.</p>

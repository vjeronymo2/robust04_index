			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Bonds: Finland's Dollars 1.5bn FRN claimed to be too aggressively priced The Republic of Finland's newly-launched Dollars 1.5bn floating rate issue broke syndicate yesterday morning and was the main focus of attention in the international bond market, with rival syndicates claiming the deal had been mispriced and poorly received by the market. Floating-rate notes have been very much the flavour of the first quarter of 1994, providing borrowers with a more cost-effective means of raising funds at a time of considerable bond markets uncertainty . But some syndicate officials claim there is now too much floating-rate paper 'sloshing around'. Borrowers launched the equivalent of Dollars 34.1bn in FRNs in the first quarter, predominantly in dollars, according to figures compiled by Euromoney, and syndicates say a considerable proportion of the paper is still unplaced. Goldman Sachs, lead manager for the Finland Dollars 1.5bn deal, said it had bought back over Dollars 400m of bonds from other syndicates after the deal broke yesterday morning. The bonds have a coupon of three-month Libid, and at the issue price of 99.68 yield five basis points below three-month Libor. Goldman Sachs said the bonds had been bought back at 99.58 or above, trading within fees. But other syndicates, which claimed the deal was too aggressively priced, said the bonds traded outside fees initially before recovering. 'The pricing was wrong and the deal was launched into an overloaded market - Goldman is just buying league table position,' said one specialist. New issues launched yesterday came in an assortment of currencies, with a large convertible bond issue from Thermo Electron and a couple of Eurosterling deals, from Tate &amp; Lyle International Finance and Northern Rock Building Society. Thermo Electron, the US technology company, launched a Dollars 300m convertible bond issue, increasing the size by Dollars 100m. The seven-year bonds have a 5 per cent coupon and a conversion premium of 14.9 per cent. Lehman Brothers, the book-runner, said about half the issue was sold in the US, and the rest in Europe, with strong demand out of Switzerland, the UK and France. Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, launched a Pounds 100m, five-year deal with an 8 per cent coupon. The bonds were priced to yield 80 basis points over the five-year gilt: while Tate &amp; Lyle does not have a formal credit rating, one of the joint lead managers said the yield spread reflected the company's 'perceived rating of around the A1 or Aa3 area' as well as taking into account the 'volatile market conditions'. The paper is expected to be sold mainly to domestic institutions. Northern Rock Building Society raised Pounds 100m in the sterling sector with a four-year FRN. Sterling specialists said the deal went well, and the price edged up from 99.81 at launch to 99.82 by late afternoon.</p>

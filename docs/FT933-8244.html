			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Observer: Stunted When the British government seems intent on privatising anything that moves, why has it farmed out all the wounded casualties from Sarajevo to public sector hospitals? Given the pressure on resources in the National Health Service and the shortage of beds, it would make sense for the authorities to tap the offers of beds in private hospitals. If the private hospitals are prepared to treat the wounded for free, whereas the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab for the use of NHS hospitals, there would be a net saving to the public purse. If the reason is that the authorities feel more comfortable using NHS hospitals that they know, why did the Overseas Development Agency turn down the offer of an RAF VC-10 aeroplane and hire a Russian Tu-154 air ambulance? To date, the only party which comes out well from the affair is the Saudi Arabian royal family, who helped pay for the evacuations.</p>

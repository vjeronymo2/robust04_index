			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Market Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of options on the Growth and Value Indexes, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  First, as described above, the Indexes are broad-based and each is presently comprised of at least 190 stocks with no one stock dominating either Index. Second, as noted above, the stocks contained in the Indexes have large capitalizations and are actively traded. Third, the proposed position and exercise limits, coupled with the requirement that positions in both Indexes be aggregated, will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Fourth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because the Index options will be issued and guaranteed by the OCC just like any other standardized option traded in the United States. Fifth, existing CBOE stock index options rules and surveillance procedures will apply to options on the Growth and Value Indexes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') have the necessary systems capacity to support those new series of index options that would result from the introduction of options and LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes. See letter from Charles J. Henry, President and Chief Operating Officer, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated January 4, 1993 and memorandum from Joe Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, CBOE, dated January 4, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring options on the Growth and Value Indexes (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is reasonable and consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing expiring index options for exercise settlement purposes based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on the securities underlying options on the Indexes. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Specifically, Amendment No. 1 maintains the proposed options position limits on the Indexes but requires that positions in options on the Indexes (including Index LEAPS) be aggregated for purposes of position and exercise limits. As stated above, the Commission believes that these position and exercise limits have the effect of minimizing the potential for market manipulation and other adverse impacts on the market for the securities underlying the Indexes as a result of the trading of options on the Indexes. Amendment No. 1 also clarifies that strike intervals of $2.50 will only be used for strike prices of less than $200 for full-value options and Index LEAPS on the Indexes. This amendment merely conforms the proposal to existing CBOE rules. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See CBOE Rule 24.9, Interpretation and Policy .01(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1.

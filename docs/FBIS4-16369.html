			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksey Berezhkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- A Russian air defence  official denied on Thursday an ABC report revealing the details  of a plane incident in the Russian Far East which, according to  the company, has caused a row in Washington.    "The American light plane Cessna-550 was flying along the  MK-56- H3 route from Dutch Harbour (Aleutian Islands) to  Petropavlovsk Kamchatka on April 13," said Leonid Shirobokov,  spokesman for the Russian air defence troops.    "The flight had been officially announced and we were aware  of it. Before crossing the Russian state border at 3:58 a.m.  Moscow time [2358 GMT] the pilot failed to report. In order to  find out the identity of the plane an air defence fighter was  ordered to take off and approach the Cessna. After that the  American plane reported," he said.    Asked to comment on the ABC report that the Cessna was  forced  to land, but after refueling was allowed to continue the flight,  Shirobokov replied that "no one landed anyone. After having  established the identity of the plane our fighter returned to  the base, while the Cessna which had communicated with Russian  air controllers was allowed to continue the flight and made a  safe landing in Petropavlovsk Kamchatka."</p>

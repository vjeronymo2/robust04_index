			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hala Boncompagni] </F>   [Text] Beirut, May 13 (AFP)--Economic growth slowed during  the first quarter of 1994 amid a drop in exports as private and  public investments stagnated in productivity sectors, a private  bank report said.    Agriculture and industrial exports dropped by 33.2 percent  and the number of construction permits issued by the authorities  fell by 15 percent compared with the average quarterly figures  of 1993, Bank Audi said in the report.    Activity at Beirut airport fell 20 percent and there was a  19.8 percent drop in the number of passengers, it added.    The lack of credit offers and high interest rates on the  Lebanese pound were seen as the main reasons for fewer real  investments, the report said.    Central Bank governor Riyad Salamah meanwhile blamed the  slow-down on security fears and a wave of political turbulence  that has gripped Lebanon since a church bombing in February  killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54 others.    The government has since arrested dozens of former Christian  militiamen, disbanded the Lebanese Forces Christian party and  placed its chief Samir Ja'ja' behind bars as part of an  investigation into a 1990 political murder.    It has also banned private news and television broadcasts  until new legislation to regulate the media is drafted and  approved by parliament, and reactivated the death penalty in  measures to crackdown on security.    The Bank Audi report was released before billionaire Prime  Minister Rafiq al-Hariri decided on Sunday to freeze his  political functions in protest over opposition for a government  reshuffle.    Al-Hariri's decision has plunged Lebanon into one of its  worst post-war political crises at a time when it is seeking  investments to rebuild the infrastructure wrecked by the  1975-1990 civil war.    Lebanon's Central Bank has sold 115 million dollars from its  reserves since Monday to bolster the Lebanese pound, which came  under pressure following al-Hariri's decision.    Economic experts meanwhile predicted that real investments  will be kept on hold until the outcome of Arab-Israeli peace  talks.    "Investors are waiting to see the outline of Lebanon's  economic role after Arab-Israeli peace is achieved," one expert  said, noting that Beirut's fate depended on the decisions of  Israel and Syria which deploy troops in Lebanon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It will be impossible to ensure a ceasefire and  return of refugees without the introduction of CIS peacekeeping  forces to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. This was  stated by Russian presidential envoy, Deputy Russian Foreign  Minister Boris Pastukhov in an interview with INTERFAX today.    Pastukhov suggested that the talks between Georgian and  Abkhazian representatives, which finished in Moscow on 14 May  had been "absolutely necessary." The talks showed that the  parties were "moving towards a dialogue and their permanent  contacts were of great importance," he added.    Pastukhov highly praised the Georgian-Abkhazian documents  signed in Moscow. They include the agreement on ceasefire,  separation of the troops, deployment of the CIS peacekeeping  contingency between the conflicting parties and the  establishment of a joint coordinating commission on energy  supply, transport communications, etc. The commission will have  its permanent seat in Sochi from 1 June. "The most valuable  thing about this commission is that the parties will always be  looking into the faces of each other and openly discussing what  worries them," Pastukhov underlined.    Commenting on the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces on  the Inguri River, he emphasized that details of the operation  must still be worked on. "The CIS heads of state will express  their opinion on the operation. Thereafter, the plan will be  discussed with the conflicting parties. We take as our basis an  initial number of about 3,000 people for the peacekeeping  forces," Pastukhov said.    He stressed that the issue on CIS peacekeepers had been  worked on during numerous consultations with the UN and the  CSCE. "We hope that the peacekeeping operation itself will be  carried out with the active participation of international  observers in the conflict zone. It will probably be reasonable  to widen their mandate and to increase their number," Pastukhov  suggested.    He said the Russian party was quietly optimistic on  implementation of the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia.  "Earlier, we had also had rather strong decisions which  unfortunately were never carried out. It is necessary to say  less and to do more," Pastukhov accentuated.    He announced that Georgian and Abkhazian representatives  would meet in Geneva on 13 June in order to work out solutions  with which everyone would be satisfied.</p>

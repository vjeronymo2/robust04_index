			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RACE TRACK CORRECTS GOOF AND PAYS ON 2 'WINNERS'  </P> <P> A longshot at Philadelphia Park overcame the toughest odds of all Friday. He  won the race a half-hour after it was run.  </P> <P> Snaps Lewin, at odds of 42-1, and Shinto Magic, at 8-1, ran to a photo finish  in the sixth race. Shinto Magic was posted as the winner, with Snaps Lewin in  second.  </P> <P> Thirty minutes later, track officials realized they had made a mistake and gave  the victory to Snaps Lewin.  </P> <P> There was quite a turnaround in payoffs. Shinto Magic paid $18.60 as the posted  winner. Snaps Lewin's payoff was $86.20.  </P> <P> Because of the confusion, the track immediately agreed to honor tickets showing  either order of finish.  </P> <P> "They made a decision to rectify their mistake, and, whatever the consequences,  they'll pay for it," said Ed Murano, publicity director for the track.  </P> <P> The consequences are sure to be very expensive. Although Murano said figures on  the total payout and number of win tickets won't be available for some time,  the mistake figured to cost the track thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> Shinto Magic paid $7.80 to place and $7.40 to show on both the original and the  corrected posting. Snaps Lewin paid $26 to place on both tickets. On the  original posting, the show payoff was $12; on the corrected one, $12.20.  </P></p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Southern cents and comfort: Alabama has overcome its image problems to win the first Mercedes plant outside Germany Until two days ago, when those nice German folk from Mercedes-Benz showered town with a Dollars 300m jackpot, the tiny Alabama community of Vance (pop: 250) had but one tenuous claim to fame: a colourful experiment in municipal thrift. Back in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was in the White House, running up larger and larger federal budget deficits, the town council found that it, too, was facing a fiscal crisis. To avoid deficit financing, this scattering of bungalows, Baptist churches and trailer homes, hidden in thick, rolling woodlands, laid off its handful of municipal workers and got volunteers to do these jobs. The mayor and council became garbage collectors. Word of its example spread far and wide - even beyond the Alabama state line. 'People think we're a bunch of country hicks,' says Mr Larry Simmons, a council member, as he stands in Vance's one-roomed town hall (or WN ALL, as its thrifty, dilapidated sign proclaims). 'Well, maybe we haven't got much book sense, but we sure have common sense.' On Thursday it got a lot more besides when Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury vehicle manufacturer, surprised America by announcing that Vance was to be the site of its first car plant outside Germany, a Dollars 300m factory which will employ 1,500 and start producing a 'sports utility' vehicle (akin to a Range Rover) in early 1997. It is a huge coup for Vance and for the small, slow-paced city of Tuscaloosa, some 17 miles west, which is dominated by the University of Alabama and takes its exotic name from a local Indian chief killed by 16th-century Spanish explorers. Those with too much beer inside them, and a penchant for a good argument, might make so bold as to call the event more momentous than last year's victory in the national college football championship by the university team, the Alabama Crimson Tide. But the decision by Mercedes is, above all, an immense economic and psychological boost for Alabama, a state which still suffers from a boorish 'Redneck' image and has lagged behind surrounding states (apart from dirt-poor Mississippi), in attracting the high-profile investment which has transformed the 'Old' American south - the states of the civil war confederacy - over the past 20 years. The so-called 'new south' - where gleaming, high-rise, industrial cities and comfortable retirement communities for Yankee expatriates sit alongside large swathes of rural poverty - can best be observed by a drive up the south-east's main artery, Interstate 85, from Atlanta, Georgia, to Durham, North Carolina. 'The boom belt' is how BusinessWeek magazine recently described the high-way. Foreign companies, particularly German ones, have been pouring investment into Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, attracted by low wages, rabid anti-unionism, good communications, skilled workers, beautiful surroundings and lavish financial incentives from state governments. Last year BMW decided to site its first US factory in South Car-olina. Until now, Alabama has largely missed out - even though its largest city, Birmingham, which lies about 50 miles north-east of Tuscaloosa, jostled with Atlanta for the title of the south's economic capital until the 1960s. Atlanta won, partly because of its more entrepreneurial spirit. It is a city of brash extrovert boosters compared with Birmingham, which is more conservative and introverted, less cosmopolitan. But investors were also scared off by Alabama's hardline attitude to the most important political issue facing the south in the 1950s and 1960s: the black civil rights movement. While Atlanta pursued a relatively liberal approach to the colour bar, Birmingham and the town of Selma became shorthand for brutal police suppression, and Mr George Wallace, the state's governor, a symbol of right-wing racism. Some 30 years on, this negative image still lingers. The recent hit movie, My Cousin Vinnie, a comedy about a sharp New York lawyer who triumphs in an Alabama murder trial, caricatures the state's citizens as dull-witted, slow-moving, insular, racist and corrupt. Like any caricature, it contains a smattering of truth. Alabama's reputation for probity was hardly bolstered by the removal from office of its governor, Mr Guy Hunt, last April after he was convicted of stealing money. And the state's high school system has one of the highest drop-out rates in the nation. However, Birmingham, which has had a black mayor since 1979, has transformed itself from a grimy steel town into a high-tech medical centre (the actress Jane Fonda came there for treatment last year) and the way in which the state chased the Mercedes deal - in competition with more than 30 others - attests to a new entrepreneurial vigour. A crucial element in its success was the fact that the search for a Mercedes site, which began last April, coincided with the appointment of a new governor, Mr Jim Folsom, who replaced the disgraced Mr Hunt. Mr Folsom, the son of a celebrated Alabama governor in the 1940s and 1950s, was anxious to make a splash and, with an eye on the Mercedes deal, appointed as head of the Alabama Development Office Mr Billy Joe Camp, a tough, energetic veteran of state government with a quintessentially southern-sounding name. 'When Billy Joe does something, he goes out and does it,' says an admiring aide. Mr Camp spearheaded the lengthy negotiations with Mercedes, while Governor Folsom provided the political muscle which allowed Alabama to offer Mercedes an extremely generous set of incentives, worth more than Dollars 250m, to settle in the state. However, Mr Andreas Renschler, the young Mercedes executive who led the site search (and who thought of Alabama as 'sleepy' before he first visited it), says the state's incentives were no greater than those proffered by the two others on his short-list, North and South Carolina. Nor were incentives the decisive factor favouring Tuscaloosa/Vance: 'This is not a short-term thing. We want to be building cars here for the next 20 years.' What may have clinched it for Alabama is what the Mercedes team says is a 'gut feeling' this is the right location. That, in turn, seems due in no small measure to the sheer zeal with which Messrs Folsom and Camp, desperate for Alabama not to lose again, pursued the Germans. Whatever the reason, stars are falling on Alabama this weekend - in the three-pointed form of the Mercedes logo, that ultimate symbol of quality. It really does beat football.</p>

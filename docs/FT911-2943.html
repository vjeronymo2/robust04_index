			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Observer: Policy gap It would be difficult for the Labour Party to lose its reputation for being 'never knowingly underlaunched.' The volume of glossy manifestos and slick press conferences has intensified even though media-relations guru Peter Mandelson has departed from headquarters in London's Walworth Road. But the promotional machine is running a bit ragged. The reason is that the general public still can't obtain the new policy document Opportunity Britain - younger sibling of Meet the Challenge and Looking to the Future - 10 days after it was launched. Walworth Road officers are on the defensive, but admit it is an embarrassment. 'We had enough copies to give out to the press at the launch,' they say. Unfortunately, it turns out, in their zeal for publicity they handed the media every single copy there was. However, the text is back with the printers and fresh supplies are expected any day now. Labour hardliners will be relieved to hear that the printers who produced the copperplate invitations to Labour's Pounds 500-a-head dinner at the Hyde Park hotel are not implicated in the delay.</p>

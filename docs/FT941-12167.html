			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Technology: Slippery slope for user support - An extra cost faced by purchasers of PC software Personal computer software is increasingly cheaper to buy, but the real cost of using it is rising. Several leading PC software publishers have begun to charge for 'premium' support services for their products, on top of the 'free' support included in the purchase price of a software licence. Lotus Development, for example, is now offering fee-based support for Lotus 1-2-3 and Ami Pro - after pioneering the approach on its enterprise-wide Lotus Notes communications system. Microsoft, too, now charges for extra support on its Microsoft Office products having established a precedent with charges on support for its Windows NT and MS-Dos operating systems. The worry for users is that this is possibly the top of a very slippery slope and that they may find themselves having to pay for all software support. Two recent trends are fuelling this fear: the drastic drop in PC software prices and the increasing complexity of the programs. Both are linked to the popularity of software 'suite' bundles, in which several applications are bundled together at a lower price than the sum of the individual applications. While software is getting cheaper, it is also more unwieldy. And that means that support, as well as user training, is likely to become a much more important part of a company's information technology costs. Deployment of that support is a problem which all users must tackle. Perhaps aware that annual support contracts like those in the mainframe and minicomputer sectors might make PC users rebel, PC software makers have been clever in the way they have introduced fee-based support for applications. In the US, Lotus, for example, offers users a choice of support packages. They may dial into a '900' toll telephone number at the rate of Dollars 2 (Pounds 1.30) per minute (the first minute is free) for 24-hour support on its flagship Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. Alternatively, Lotus users can pay a Dollars 129 annual support contract for applications or Dollars 295 per year per user for Lotus Notes support. Lotus still offers basic free technical support for most of its products for the first 90 days after purchase - as well as a dial-in bulletin board and a 'forum' area on the CompuServe online information service. Microsoft offers a similar range of support services in the US - along with a more varied range of options for developers and corporations. But according to Tony Ettlinger, Microsoft UK director of product support services, these are not designed to be profit centres. Ettlinger says they are merely designed to cover most of the costs of providing services that users - particularly those in large corporations - are demanding. 'There is no way we are making a move to provide product support at a profit,' he says. 'In the case of Windows NT, we decided on something we thought would be a fair and reasonable charge for support.' Microsoft has also been encouraging third parties to provide support for its new Windows NT operating system. Traditional minicomputer makers such as Digital Equipment, NCR and Hewlett-Packard have all started fee-based NT support services in the past six months, with the backing of Microsoft. Microsoft's rationale for this move is that it does not want to have to create the kind of support infrastructure that a minicomputer-level operating system such as NT demands, although it does want one to exist. By involving third parties experienced in providing this kind of support, it hopes to get the best of both worlds: a solid base of support for users and strong backing for NT by minicomputer vendors, both at little cost to Microsoft. But if price-slashing and bundling continues at current rates, software companies may have to change the policy of not seeing support as a profit centre. It may become the only place left to make money in the PC industry.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD AND BLACK AMERICANS  </P> <P> I am amused, and somewhat bemused too, at one Benjamin Stein's plea for more  roles for blacks in the movies. As a black man myself, I think Stein asks too  much.  </P> <P> For example: I'm not a big TV fan, but it does seem to me that there are more  black shows on the air than there are white. In every movie, blacks have  leading roles, very often where they would not be found in everyday life.  </P> <P> About 10 years ago, several black movies were made, and apparently they lost  money. As a black, I am not interested in paying to see other people who are my  color: I need more motivation than that. I think we blacks now have more than  our fair share on film and that it's time to give that plea a rest.  </P> <P> GABRIEL FURLONG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Boudewijn van Spilbeek, VTM foreign </F> affairs journalist, by announcer Danny Verstraeten--live]    [Text] [Verstraeten] Boudewijn Van Spilbeek has joined us,  welcome, Boudewijn. Boudewijn, how concrete are these  evacuation plans at this moment?    [Van Spilbeek] Well, Danny, maybe it is worth mentioning  first that for such emergency situations in Zaire, Rwandi, and  Burundi, there are always evacuation plans readily at hand,  which can be implemented within a very short period of time, 24  hours or so. However, the situation now is that the 3d  Paratroopers Battalion from Tielen and also the 1st Paratroopers  Battalion from Diest have been called up and they are ready to  depart right away.    [Verstraeten] It is an international action?    [Van Spilbeek] Yes, because the French, who have Foreign  Legion paratroopers in the Central African Republic, which is  not far from Rwanda, are ready to intervene if necessary. And  we learned from a very reliable source that concrete measures  are under way for the French, Belgian, and possible U.S. forces  to implement an evacuation.    [Verstraeten] How will tasks be divided? Who is going to do  what?    [Van Spilbeek] The Belgians would send the 1st or the 3d, or  maybe both, Paratroopers Batallion. The 1st Para knows the  situation well because these men returned only a few weeks ago  from Rwanda, where they had stayed for four months. The French  would also help in this operation. And the Americans would  probably provide large transportation planes, and maybe even  troops.    [Verstraeten] Do the Belgians already have aircraft in the  area?    [Van Spilbeek] Yes. There is already one Sabena aircraft in  Bujumbura in Burundi. Furthermore, this evening, there will be  the regular Bujumbura-Kigali flight, and there is already one  C-130 in Nairobi and, in addition, there is also one C-130 at  the airport of Kigali itself.    [Verstraeten] Yes, but this airport, and this may constitute  one of the practical problems, what is the situation at Kigali  airport?    [Van Spilbeek] Yes, this is a key problem. Rwanda is located  in the middle of Africa, so an evacuation has to proceed from  the airport. A company of Belgian blue helmets was there to  guard the airport, but it was armed with very light weapons only  and lost the airport to the the Rwandan Army. This means that  the airport is currently unsafe. Moreover, the Rwandan Army has  proved that it is quite capable of downing aircraft since, two  days ago, it downed its own president.    [Verstraeten] So what are the solutions, what can they do?    [Van Spilbeek] There are two possibilities: Either they  could be diverted to another airport, but this would imply  several hours by truck or jeep to get to Kigali, and this could  increase danger for the people in the capital; or, the second  possibility could be, as was done in 1978 in Kolwezi in the  Zaire Shaba province, just to drop the men. After all, they are  paratroopers.    [Verstraeten] They are now waiting for the go-ahead by the  ministers?    [Van Spilbeek] Yes, indeed. Such an operation requires quite  some coordination, with Paris and with Washington. Obviously,  the Council of Ministers has to be informed about everything and  agree with it. So, the decision will problably be made this  afternoon at 0300 hours [0100 GMT]    [Verstraeten] Thank you, Boudewijn.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOBBY LYLE CONCENTRATES ON TRADITIONAL AT BILTMORE  </P> <P> As if to dispel any doubts about his ability to play straight-ahead jazz,  pianist Bobby Lyle concentrated on the traditional during his opening set  Tuesday evening at the Biltmore's Grand Avenue Bar.  </P> <P> A facile young pianist whose credits include stints with Sly and the Family  Stone, Esther Phillips, Al Jarreau and Bette Midler, Lyle showed that while his  wallet benefits from R&amp;B, his heart belongs to jazz.  </P> <P> Working with a group featuring saxophonist Kirk Whalum, Lyle opened his  five-tune set with "Nova," an original composition by the pianist that had  drummer Mike Baker and bassist Keven Brandon setting a hot swing pace. Though  their volume at times obscured Lyle's efforts, the pianist nonetheless managed  to show his considerable abilities in a jazz mode.  </P> <P> A better mode still was John Coltrane's "Giant Steps," this time in 3/4 time.  Though Whalum's tenor saxophone solos were choppily phrased, his tone was pure  and his melodic statements provided an interesting contrast to the tune's  rhythmic foundation. Lyle played with deft precision, with a brief,  unaccompanied solo offering respite from the frenetic din of drummer Baker.  </P> <P> Billy Strayhorn's "Lush Life" was Lyle's tour de force. With technical agility  and a deep understanding of, and sensitivity to, the tune, the pianist offered  a solid reading of the piece. Only occasionally did he reveal a tendency for  overstatement with ornate flourishes that could have been more effective with a  more economical approach.  </P> <P> But overstatement was replaced with overkill on the two R&amp;B-based  inclusions. With a relentlessly pounding beat and the traditional twang-thump  of the electric bass, both "Night Breeze" and "Tropical," each composed by  Lyle, were lesser musical efforts than those of his jazz inclusions. Though the  acoustic piano added pleasant timbral quality, the riff-based tunes were  unworthy vehicles for the assembled talent. A. JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

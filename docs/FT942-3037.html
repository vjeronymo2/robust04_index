			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Burndene Burndene Investments, the caravans and mobile homes group which also has interests in hosiery and property development, announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.82m in the half year to April 2, with a decline shown in all divisions. Turnover improved to Pounds 29m (Pounds 27.7m) but operating profits fell to Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.87m) while net interest charges rose to Pounds 217,235 (Pounds 153,449). The caravan division had offered discounts to trade purchasers in the first half which had reduced profits, Mr David Caldow, chairman, said, but a further increase in sales was anticipated in the second six months which would bring compensatory profits. Earnings per share declined to 1.15p (1.45p). The interim dividend, however, is stepped up to 0.75p (0.5p).</p>

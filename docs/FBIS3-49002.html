"Japan, which is now  a major power, has to cooperate with European countries, with  the United States, Canada and the other governments which are  already deeply involved in restoring peace here in  ex-Yugoslavia," Akashi said during a press conference.    "If Europeans are in Asia, why shouldn't Asians be in  Europe," he said refering to UN peacekeeping troops deployed in  Cambodia.    Akashi, 62, in his new assignment becomes the special UN  representative in the former Yugoslavia and head of the UN  Protection Force deployed in the region. He replaces Thorvald  Stoltenberg who will retain his position as co-chairman of the  Geneva peace talks on the Bosnian conflict. Akashi previously  headed the UN force deployed in Cambodia.    Akashi later announced that a team of Japanese Government  experts would soon arrive in former Yugoslavia to study how  Tokyo could "extend its cooperation in order to help restore  peace" to the region. He also said he was planning to  reorganize some sections of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection  Forces], introducing elements which he had personally selected.  He said he saw his role as helping to reestablish confidence  between the three warring factions.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Changing colours - Victoria Griffith examines the fickle purchasing patterns of green consumers The environmentally conscious consumer faces a mind-boggling array of choices just pushing a trolley down the aisle of a supermarket. Forced to make a decision between non-phosphate and normal detergent, recycled or ordinary toilet paper and an array of other goods, an ecologically-minded shopper may wonder whether the 'green' product is worth the extra money, and if it poses a tangible environmental benefit. Retailers and manufacturers are often as confused as their customers. Anxious to capitalise on growing ecological awareness, they are uncertain about the best way to present 'green' goods to buyers. Despite the confusion, some trends are emerging. Companies ignore the surge in environmental awareness at their peril, researchers say. Market studies by consulting groups such as EJF Associates and Environmental Research Associates indicate that younger generations, the consumers of the future, are more environmentally conscious than other segments of the population. 'In our survey of adult consumers, 18- and 19-year-olds were far more willing to spend money on ecological products than other segments of the population,' says Anthony Casali, president of the Environmental Research Associates. 'This, in addition to the growing awareness of older generations, means that the market for green goods will explode over the next few years.' Even high-priced items such as cars and computers are being hit by ecological fever. The Environmental Protection Agency will soon start to hand out 'green' labels for computers using less electricity, and BMW, the German car-maker, has been running advertisements based on its CFC-free car air conditioners. The new environmental awareness does not mean, though, that companies can charge whatever they like for green products. 'We tested purchasing patterns for a whole range of environmentally sensitive goods, and found that consumers were willing to pay more for only 6 per cent of the items,' says Casali. 'Of those 6 per cent, most were detergents and soaps.' Given shoppers' willingness to pay higher prices for green detergents, it is perhaps surprising that manufacturers in this category have been among the most innovative in finding ways to slice costs. US detergent manufacturers are beginning to offer consumers cheaper refill packages, which do not contain the plastic spoons and other goodies supplied with many products. The ecological argument is that the refills eliminate solid waste by reducing unnecessary packaging. They also save consumers money, and this probably accounts for their wide appeal. The office products chain Staples has found out first hand how unwilling many shoppers are to pay more for recycled goods. 'Sales of our recycled products have declined in proportion to overall sales,' says David Graham, head of paper buying for the store. He blames the decline on the high prices of recycled paper. 'Manufacturers have been charging us more for recycled paper goods, and we've been forced to pass that on to the consumer. Clearly, shoppers are still very price sensitive when it comes to buying green products.' There is always the exception to the rule, though. Ecological boutiques, for instance, still command high mark-ups on environmental products, although market researchers point out that the segment of the population frequenting these stores is small. 'The people who buy at these stores tend to be highly motivated green shoppers,' says Casali. 'They also tend to be more externally motivated than people buying green products at the supermarket. They may truly be concerned about the environment, but they are also buying into the image of the store. Carrying around a shopping bag from boutiques like The Nature Shop and the Body Shop makes a statement.' Edward Flesch, principal of marketing consultants EFG Associates, believes the long-term trend will be away from the boutiques and towards the mainstreaming of ecological goods. 'The large retail stores will not allow this business to be taken away from them,' says Flesch. The boutiques, not surprisingly, disagree. 'When consumers buy products at the Body Shop, they know they're advocating an entire environmental philosophy,' says Robert Triefus, group spokesman. While boutique marketing may work for certain stores, larger retailers say they will stick to an integrated approach in promoting their own green goods. 'We tried separating products out into an 'ecological' section, to create a green boutique within the main store,' says Graham. 'But that was very unsuccessful. Buyers seem to prefer to see the products on the shelves with the regular items.' However green products are marketed, consultants urge their clients to ensure that the goods actually provide the environmental benefit promised. Retailers and manufacturers are concerned about a possible consumer backlash as companies climb on the ecological bandwagon indiscriminately. One New York furniture store, for instance, recently touted sofas covered with unbleached muslin as ecologically sensitive. Since natural dyes can be used with no harmful impact on the environment, some activists questioned the green credentials of the product. More serious, perhaps, are findings that US paper products labeled as recycled may contain mill waste, rather than post-consumer waste and therefore be no more green than other paper products. 'We are very concerned about a possible consumer backlash if companies are not more responsible,' says Edward Tuescher, environmental director at Smith &amp; Hawken, an ecologically oriented retailer of gardening products. US retailers are calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for green labelling to help address this problem. A few countries, such as Canada, already have environmental labelling laws in effect. Although companies may not have sorted out all the problems involved in environmental marketing, it seems the trend toward green retailing is here to stay. As time goes on, stores are likely to become increasingly aware about the presentation and pricing of ecological goods. Confusing as it may be, it is not only ecologically responsible, but extremely lucrative.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F> and Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- Reports in British mass media  about continued work on the development of biological weapons in  Russia are to say the least surprising. Grigoriy Karasin,  director of Foreign Ministry information and press department,  stated this at today's briefing at the Foreign Ministry press  center.    He said that in September 1992 the governments of three  countries (Russia, the United States, and the UK) adopted a  joint statement envisaging a complex of measures to allay the  parties' concern over abidance by the 1972 convention banning  biological weapons. As part of the implementation of these  accords, U.S. and British experts have visited four nonmilitary  biological facilities in Russia. The experts' conclusions by no  means correspond with the claims made in the British press,  Grigoriy Karasin noted.    It is regrettable that "information" of this kind is  appearing at a time when Russia, the United States, and the UK,  who are the depositories of the convention banning biological  weapons, are making joint efforts to call a special convention  on possible verification measures as early as this year,  Grigoriy Karasin noted.</p>

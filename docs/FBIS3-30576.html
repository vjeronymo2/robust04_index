Intensive mortar, cannon and tank fire was opened on the region  of Smiljcici, Kasici (west of Benkovac) and on the villages in  the Novigrad hinterland. The attacks wounded one Serb soldier,  and inflicted considerable material damage on civilian targets,  thus forcing the Serb troops to respond.    The Croatian forces also staged provocative attacks on the  Skradin hinterland, the Drnis front and the area of Plasko in  Lika while, in the other parts of the front, the warring sides  observed the ceasefire. The Croatians launched offensive  actions despite the Christmas ceasefire, which was agreed late  last year and extended on two occasions. It remains in force  until February 28. The republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) was  proclaimed a U.N. protected area (UNPA) and, under the Vance  plan, 14,000 U.N. peacekeepers were sent there in early 1992.  The plan called for an end to the fighting between Croatian  army and the local Serbs. R.S.K. was proclaimed by the local  Serbs in territories where they are in the majority in response  to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav  federation.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amgen warning hits biotech shares BIOTECHNOLOGY stocks staggered under a second blow in three days after Amgen, a benchmark biotechnology company, warned late Wednesday that its first-quarter earnings would fall as much as 15 per cent below analysts' expectations. The news sent biotech shares tumbling across the board. Amgen plunged Dollars 9 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 37, Chiron lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 3/4 after dropping to Dollars 45 earlier in the day, US Healthcare dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43, and Synergen, which triggered a sell-off in the sector on Monday, lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 . Xoma edged Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 8 1/4 while Centocorp held steady at Dollars 6 1/4 . The lack of movement was a reflection of the heavy losses already suffered by the stock rather than a vote of renewed confidence in the company. Centocorp traded as high as Dollars 60 1/4 last year, while Xoma has fallen from a high of Dollars 25 1/4 . Amgen blamed its disappointing forecast on unexpectedly slow sales of its Neupogen cancer drug. Although sales of Neupogen have risen about 30 per cent in the year, the company and Wall Street had expected a stronger performance. The news came on the heels of Monday's report by Synergen, a Colorado-based drug developer, that research data on its Antril sepsis drug did not match earlier trials. Biotechnology stocks, like other healthcare issues, have suffered from investor concern that the Clinton administration's healthcare policy will lead to lower drug prices. Two biotechnology initial public offerings were also postponed yesterday in what was speculated to be a reaction to worries about healthcare policy, and although a softening new-issues market. was also cited. But the sagas of Synergen, Amgen, Centocorp and Xoma underscore an inherent vulner ability in the biotechnology sector, where investors speculate on the future earning per formance of products which are either in development or only recently approved for marketing. Synergen, whose stock plummeted Dollars 28 5/8 - or 68 per cent - on Monday, was believed to have the most promising treat ment for septicaemia, an often-lethal blood infection which afflicts about 1m Americans and Europeans each year. Earlier studies of Antril had shown it reduced death by 40 per cent to 60 per cent. However, the company's latest study, involving a much larger number of patients, indicated that a high dose of the drug reduced mortality by only 15 per cent. Synergen is not the first biotech company to stumble in its search for a treatment for sepsis. Both Centocorp and Xoma faltered after their once-promising drugs proved less effective than initial studies had indicated. Neither Centocorp nor Xoma have received marketing approval for their sepsis drugs. In the case of Amgen, the company already has two effective drugs on the market. But Amgen's future success as a drugs company depends largely on broadening its product line and the funding for future research will, to a large degree, depend on the sales of Neupogen.</p>

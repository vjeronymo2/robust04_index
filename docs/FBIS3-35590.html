Alarm Over Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine  Growing"]    [Text] As a result of persistent efforts by Russian, U.S.,  and Ukrainian politicians and diplomats, a trilateral agreement  was concluded 14 January this year and the Moscow Declaration on  Implementing the START I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol was  signed. It appears that the future of nuclear missile weapons  in Ukraine, which has caused so much concern in the world, had  been settled in such a way as to suit everyone's interests,  primarily Kiev's. The Russian side declared its willingness to  proceed to practical implementation of the agreements that had  been reached. There was every reason to assume that the  Ukrainian Ministry of Defense thought likewise, which was  evidenced by the Ukrainian military's proposal to hold talks in  order to coordinate a plan for shipping nuclear weapons  [boyepripasy] to Russian territory.    However, literally 10 days later, the Ukrainian defense  minister issued an order on transporting the weapons to their  "S" installations. And at a Ministry of Defense Collegium  session 21 January, the commander of the 43d Missile Army and  the commander of the 46th Division were forced to swear an oath  of allegiance to Ukraine.    This unilateral step constituted a gross violation of all  the  understandings that had been reached earlier, including the  Agreement on the Status of Strategic Nuclear Forces signed by  the heads of the CIS in February 1992.    If the troops of the 43d Missile Army start taking an oath  of  allegiance to Ukraine, Ukraine's objective of gaining full  control over the nuclear forces located on its territory will be  all but realized. In conditions in which Ukraine proclaims the  principle of nonuse of nuclear weapons from its territory, the  fact that the command of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces  retains combat control is a formality.    Were these steps by the Ukrainian side unexpected? A  chronology of the events of the past two years rules this out.    -- Back on 5 April 1992 the Ukrainian president issued an  edict subordinating all military formations located on Ukrainian  territory, including strategic nuclear forces, to the Ukrainian  Ministry of Defense. Despite the CIS countries' agreement that  they would include them in unified strategic forces under a  unified command. This edict gave instructions to organize  administrative control of the Ukrainian Strategic Nuclear Forces.    -- Three weeks later the defense minister issued his own  edict announcing the organization of administrative control of  strategic forces. The Administrative Control Center was set up.    -- During 1992 troops at Air Force missile supply technical  bases and "S" installations were made to swear an oath of  allegiance to Ukraine. In practice this led to a decline in  their combat readiness, because a large number of officers  refused to take the oath. A group was formed of the remaining  specialists which was practically incapable of working with  nuclear weapons. This was the conclusion drawn by the Ukrainian  side itself.    -- In summer 1992, under a directive from the Ukrainian  Armed Forces General Staff, "S" installations, which were  formerly under the exclusive command of the Russian Ministry of  Defense Main Directorate, were amalgamated with the 43d Missile  Army and subordinated to its commander with instructions to make  them ready for combat use. It should be noted that this is not  the function of the Army and Strategic Missile Forces, and they  do not have the resources to administer "S" installations.    Politicians and servicemen alike looked for a way out of the  situation that had developed. Everyone realized that nuclear  security is no joking matter, and neither are missiles. On 3  September 1993 agreements were concluded in Yalta, including  agreements on recycling nuclear weapons and warranty inspection  (the latter was to have come into force immediately, from the  moment of signing), but a note from the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry stated that it refused to implement these important  agreements. Their ratification was linked to a resolution of the  tactical nuclear weapons issue.    As a consequence of the note issued by the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry, instructions were given to suspend the freedom of  movement of weapons and technology with a view to carrying out  maintenance and technical servicing of ICBM groupings as a  whole. Troops of the 43d Missile Army were barred from executing  directives issued by the Strategic Missile Forces Main Command  without the consent of the Ukrainian Administrative Control  Center, otherwise criminal proceedings could be instituted.  This threatening order, incidentally, contradicted the  Ukrainian president's edict on preserving the functions of  operational control exercised by the Strategic Missile Forces  command. The principal danger of interference in operational  control is that personal responsibility for nuclear missile  weapons has been destroyed.    ...On 19 November 1993 the Ukrainian Supreme Council  ratified  the START I Treaty with the stipulation that, together with the  Lisbon Protocol to the treaty which Ukraine had signed, it is  becoming impossible to implement the treaty. Ukraine thus  directly proclaimed itself the owner of its nuclear weapons.    And now the servicemen of the 43d Army are being asked to  swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine.    What does this last step mean? The Strategic Missile Forces  High Command believes that, with the adoption of the Ukrainian  oath, the Strategic Missile Forces will completely forfeit the  potential to operationally administer the 43d Army. Ukraine is  left alone with its nuclear weapons. Whereas missile troops in  Russia and Ukraine used to be united by a single oath and used  to ensure the proper level of combat alert status and  maintenance of missile weapons despite all the hardships and  difficulties, and whereas they used to resolve nuclear security  questions jointly, now all this has been ruled out. Ukraine is  in the most danger.    Many experienced specialists could quit owing to their  unwillingness to take the oath. Quite recently KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  reported that one-third of officers have already expressed a  desire to serve in Russia. Current forecasts show that this  number is growing. Specialists stress that if officer strength  level in missile units were to fall to 60 percent, they will  become unfit for combat.    This raises the fear that the system of combat alert status  and maintenance of hardware and weapons will be disrupted. The  situation that has developed will not only prevent us from  implementing the agreement with Ukraine on further removal of  missile regiments from combat alert status, but will also hamper  efforts to ensure that missiles are kept in safe state. Today a  number of missiles on alert status are irreparable. It is  impossible to repair them, the maintenance details do not even  have enough fuel to travel to the launch site.    But something else is more frightening still: All guarantees  of nuclear security are being discarded. Stanislav Voronin,  chief designer of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, who visited  the Pervomaysk division recently, noted that owing to political  ambitions, an unwillingness to accept assistance, and an  inability to cope with problems on their own, "gross violations  of the most elementary rules and norms for dealing with nuclear  weapons are evident." What amounts to the removal of  specialists on the basis of the Ukrainian oath could, not to put  too fine a point on it, lead to a disaster even worse than  Chernobyl. Approximately 500 nuclear weapons are stockpiled in  storage facilities, which is six to eight times above the norm.    ...Overnight Ukraine has destroyed everything that was  achieved recently in Moscow. The requirement that missile  troops have to swear an oath of allegiance is destroying the 43d  Army. Once again there is alarm about the future of nuclear  missile weapons in Ukraine.</p>

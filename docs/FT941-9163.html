			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Arts: Highest level of entertainment - Max Loppert enjoys the Covent Garden premiere of Massenet's 'Cherubin' In more than one sense, the score of Massenet's Cherubin is made of light music. The tunes, the dances, the pot-pourri introductions to each of the three acts, all state immediately their adherence to the musical category that (for instance) Thomas Beecham used to explore with such light-fingered elegance: dessert fare, quickly absorbed and digested, put together with a degree of economy that guarantees its lingering effect on the palate. But Cherubin is light in other ways as well. Light in texture: scored in dew and gossamer (the impression that the bass-line instruments are being allowed the night off is a constant, captivating illusion), and carried on in rhythms whose flexibility and dramatic responsiveness are a direct function of Massenet's word-setting gifts. And light in the radiance of vocal sound that fills each unfolding sequence: again, this seems, but is not, a three-act divertimento for high voices. In all this lies, for me, the irresistible quality of Massenet's 27th opera (1905), of which the Royal Opera has just given the belated British premiere. It sets limits of unpretentious entertainment and then, with a skill as effortless as it is self-concealing, surpasses them. The notion of a Marriage of Figaro operatic pendant in which Cherubino is the principal character (nothing to do with the third of Beaumarchais's 'Almaviva' plays, La Mere coupable: Massenet's librettists adapted Francis de Croisset's 1901 comedy) is itself a civilised conceit. The opera's Mozartian touches - the Count and Countess as minor characters, a wry reference to Don Giovanni to counteract the happy-ever-after final curtain - are deftly, not insistently made. The purpose, rather, is to reflect in the most delicate of operatic glasses the dizzier moments of youthful romantic emotion. Because the opera moves so fast and its substance appears so undemanding, it is only afterwards that one realises it has said something rather interesting about the human condition - about the maddening, delightful unpredictability of the human heart. By now it must be clear that I think Cherubin a worthwhile addition to the Royal Opera repertory: a season containing Massenet's 'sung play' (according to his own labelling) at the one end and Birtwistle's Gawain at the other is admirably wide-ranging indeed] By and large the new production is a success, more than perhaps might have been predicted, given its difficult birth pangs: the dispute with the original conductor, Rozhdestvensky, meant that Mario Bernardi - former Sadler's Wells chief and a very welcome returnee to London opera - had probably little more than a week to chime his interpretation in with that of the producers. He has done so very well: the last word in fizz may be lacking in the playing, but the pacing is excellently trim. The cast is firmly supported, and its star, the American Susan Graham, encouraged to shine. In the title role Miss Graham's mint-fresh high mezzo (which revives memories of the young Yvonne Minton) gives pleasure of the most rewarding kind: the use of the voice is subtle, not showy, and Massenet's principal-boy conception takes on the richness I suspect it has by no means always displayed. Angela Gheorghiu's Nina is full of dusky fragrance, sometimes a touch sharp in pitch. The showpiece soprano role, the dancer L'Ensoleillad, finds Maria Bayo bright-toned but mostly rather impersonal in her inflections. Robert Lloyd's Philosopher - idealised parent-figure, wise and humane - is wonderfully sympathetic. Minor roles are tidily assigned, with generally a higher standard of French delivery than usual in this house: Ryland Davies, another welcome house returnee, stands out as the Duke. Tim Albery (producer) and Anthony McDonald (designer) have found a palatably modern-accented approach to Massenet which for many people will increase the evening's attractions. The manner is at once quirky and pretty-pretty, with heavy reliance on storybook colours and patterns, and infusions of dance beyond the basic needs of the plot; the comic scenes are turned into lightly mechanised farce. For my taste the show is over-designed to the point of archness, and correspondingly too often short on simplicity. The addition of actors playing Susanna and Figaro, who simultaneously translate the many patches of French spoken dialogue, is a Bad Idea, even if one sees how and why it came about. In the end, the freshness of the principals, the unassuming mastery of the conductor and the beauty of the work itself come through with room to spare. In repertory until March 1; sponsored by KPMG Peat Marwick and the Jean Sainsbury Fund</p>

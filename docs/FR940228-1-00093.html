			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to clarify what is meant by a capable individual who is responsible for administering the Title IV, HEA programs. It is important for each institution that is currently participating or seeking to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs to demonstrate that it has staff who are capable of administering the programs properly. While obviously a number of factors should be considered in determining what constitutes ``capable,'' the Secretary believes that one factor that should be addressed in regulations is whether a financial aid administrator has been certified by his or her State to have that capability. This factor would apply in a State that requires financial aid administrators to be certified. The Secretary also proposes to consider whether an individual has successfully completed Title IV, HEA program training that the Secretary has provided or approved. The Secretary is aware that some professional organizations provide high caliber training in various aspects of the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs and wishes to allow for acceptance of that outside training to meet this requirement in the future. The Secretary welcomes comments on what elements and safeguards should be present in an acceptable training program for financial aid administrators. While adequate experience and training are major considerations in evaluating compliance with this standard, the Secretary welcomes suggestions regarding any other appropriate factors that the Department of Education should take into account in determining an individual's capability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to clarify the factors that are considered in determining whether a financial aid office is adequately staffed. The Secretary proposes to specify that in looking at the amount of funds administered by the institution, the Secretary would also consider the number of students who receive any student financial assistance at the institution as it has a direct bearing on whether an office is adequately staffed. The Secretary also proposes to add consideration of the degree of office automation in the financial aid office. While the Secretary has always considered the extent to which financial aid processing is automated in assessing the adequacy of financial aid offices, the Secretary believes it is helpful to acknowledge specifically in the regulations the bearing the degree of office automation has on the staffing levels of financial aid offices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, discussions were held regarding the possible development of specific staffing levels, such as ratios of financial aid staff to the number of financial aid recipients at an institution, for determining the adequacy of the financial aid office of an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time, an institution that undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, and an institution that has exhibited administrative difficulty with other standards in this section. The Secretary believes that it is not necessary to prescribe specific staffing levels for participating institutions that have not experienced administrative problems. However, the Secretary agreed to solicit comments on the need for an additional method to assess staffing levels of other institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time has neither the experience in dealing with large numbers of financial aid recipients nor a record of administering those programs that can be evaluated. During discussions at the negotiated rulemaking session, it was suggested that it might be necessary to prescribe a specific number of staff for the institution's financial aid office that could serve as a guide for determining whether the institution can handle the volume of financial aid applications and funds it expects to receive. This standard would be required until the Secretary is able to judge the institution's actual administration of the programs. Similarly, there is no assurance that an institution that changes ownership will operate with the same staff and procedures and at the same level of funding as was the case under the previous ownership. Thus, that institution's former track record could not be relied upon to predict its continued administrative capability and there might be a need to be able to evaluate the adequacy of current or anticipated staffing levels using specific numbers or ratios, just as the Department would evaluate those of a new participating institution. Finally, if an institution has documented problems or indicators of trouble in administering the Title IV, HEA programs, these problems could well be caused by inadequate staffing levels in the institution's financial aid office. Requirements for financial aid staff to be maintained at specific levels might need to be imposed upon the institution. To address the problems and administer the Title IV, HEA programs correctly, it is logical to expect an institution to meet minimum staffing levels that might be adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

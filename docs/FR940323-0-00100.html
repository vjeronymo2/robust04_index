			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OPM is studying Runzheimer's recommendation and issues relating to Federal, State, and local income taxes and plans to include the results of this study in its report to Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters seemed to have confused the annual living cost surveys with the special Federal Employee Housing and Living Patterns Survey, which OPM conducted in the winter of 1992/1993. The commenters said they could not see how Runzheimer had incorporated the results of the employee survey in calculating living cost indices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As OPM stated in the preface to the employee survey, the purpose of the survey was to collect information that would be used to improve the COLA model. The preface made it clear that the results of the survey would not be used directly to set COLA rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM is now in the process of analyzing the results of the employee survey. It is expected that these analyses will allow OPM to identify the subdivisions and communities in which Federal employees live, the types of housing expenses they incur, the kinds of stores they frequent, their transportation needs, and so on. OPM plans to use this information in the design of future COLA surveys to reflect more closely Federal employee living costs. The information will also aid OPM as it studies the COLA methodology and prepares its report to Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the Goods and Services Component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter from Hawaii said that Federal employees on Oahu did not make many catalog purchases. In contrast, an employee from Maui stated that she made many catalog purchases. Likewise, a St. Croix resident wrote that Virgin Island employees made frequent catalog purchases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM asked Runzheimer to include a limited number of catalog items in the survey because catalogs are a common source of retail goods and are used by many persons in all areas, including the Washington, DC, area. Of course, all catalog prices surveyed included shipping costs and any applicable local sales and excise taxes. Catalog pricing also allows better comparisons of items that would otherwise be difficult to compare. For example, some furniture items were priced in catalogs because finding comparable styles, brands, and models in earlier surveys proved difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the employee survey, OPM asked Federal employees about their purchasing patterns including whether they typically purchased various types of items by catalog. OPM plans to use this information in designing future surveys and in its report to Congress on possible changes in the COLA methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter believed that catalog pricing understated price differences between the allowance area and the Washington, DC, area. The commenter said that in the DC area consumers could buy an item locally if catalog prices were relatively high but that in the allowance areas consumers frequently did not have that choice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the items that Runzheimer priced by catalog are not sold locally unless the catalog retailer also has a local retail outlet and that outlet carries the same item. If the item is sold locally by the retailer, it is usually sold at a price comparable to the catalog price, unless the item is on sale in either the catalog or in the retail store. Since Runzheimer does not survey sale prices, the use of catalog pricing probably does not cause bias.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter questioned whether representative types of stores were surveyed in the allowance areas. He believed that stores frequented in the allowance areas could be significantly different from those frequented in the Washington, DC, area. He also stated that there was only one ``warehouse-type'' grocery store on Oahu and that, because this outlet was less accessible than others, it was inappropriate to include it in the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer surveyed prices at the largest, most popular stores in each area. These stores included major grocery stores, department stores, discount stores, and specialty stores. OPM believes that this process is objective and leads to an equitable comparison of typical prices between areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Runzheimer selects outlets that are apt to be frequented by residents of the living communities in which housing is surveyed. At times, a balance between the types of outlets and their proximity to certain living communities is difficult to achieve. During the 1992 survey on Oahu, the grocery store in question was included in the survey. Subsequently, it was determined that this store was probably located outside the area normally frequented by residents of the living communities covered by the survey. Therefore, for the 1993 survey a different outlet was selected to replace the one in question. Since there were no other ``warehouse-type'' outlets on Oahu, the new outlet was a conventional, large supermarket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the employee survey, OPM asked Federal employees where they lived, where they shopped, what they purchased, and so on. The survey included specific questions on the kinds of stores employees frequented. OPM plans to use the results of the employee survey to review outlet selection and make changes as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter criticized Runzheimer for not considering the cost of college and university education in the living cost surveys. The commenter stated that due to limited post-high school educational opportunities in the allowance areas, Federal employees must send their children to out-of-area schools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer noted in the report that post-high school educational opportunities vary significantly among the allowance areas. Most of the allowance areas, however, have colleges or universities in the major population areas, and many of these institutions offer a wide range of degree programs. Nevertheless, Federal employees may send their children to out-of-area schools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Supreme Court to review high punitive awards - Legal Briefs The US Supreme Court has accepted another products liability case for review, giving it a further opportunity to set constitutional limits to excessive punitive damages awards. US products liability lawyers were disappointed last year when in the TXO case the justices upheld the constitutional basis of a punitive damages award 526 times the amount of the compensation awarded. Since the TXO case, state courts have had to rely on other grounds for curbing excessive punitive awards which, in most products liability and tort cases, are still exceeding compensatory damages by multiples of 10 or more. In March, however, the Supreme Court accepted for review the Oberg case from the Oregon Supreme Court, concerning a products liability award against the maker of an all-terrain vehicle. The jury awarded the plaintiff Dollars 900,000 in compensatory damages and Dollars 5m in punitive damages. The Oregon constitution, in preserving the right to trial by jury, appears to prevent any court from interfering with jury verdicts. The defendants, Honda Motor Co, argue this, in effect, prevents any court from reviewing a jury damages award and therefore violates federal due process. Lawyers hope the Supreme Court will use the case to set out constitutional limits to punitive damages awards.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Recipe for revival: Nicholas Lander on signs of hope for UK restaurants Tomorrow Sir Terence Conran, the designer, opens the Butler's Wharf Chop-house, his sixth London restaurant. It is his fourth on the site, near Tower Bridge, owned by the failed Butler's Wharf property company - making Ernst &amp; Young, the receiver, Sir Terence's landlord. This juxtaposition of busy restaurants, unpaid bills and receivers is all too common. There is hardly a food wholesaler or wine merchant in the UK who has not had this year's profits severely dented by overdue payments from, or the liquidation of, one or more restaurant customers. In the past 12 months there have been 235 receiverships in the country's hotel and catering industry. According to Val Brown, 49 years in the wine trade and chairman of Heyman Brothers, the wine merchants, the last two years have been 'the bloodiest on record'. Yet many restaurants today are full and have almost forgotten that, nine months ago, gloom and doom were the only items on the menu. Last week's Fifth Restaurant Show in London, which attracted a record 6,000 chefs and 190 exhibitors, even had a panel discussion confidently entitled 'Planning for the next recession'. Such a rapid transformation from empty restaurants to busy has surprised many chefs. When Martin Lam opened Ransome's Dock in Battersea, south London, a year ago, his sights were low: 'My hope was merely to survive, to break even during 1993. But when the 12 shareholders who financed my restaurant under a Business Expansion Scheme met last week for our first anniversary dinner, it was to celebrate a small profit.' This type of establishment - family-run, seating 40-50 customers, and open six and a half days a week - has been the most successful in adapting to today's economy. Restaurants are now expected to provide good value lunches, even for corporate clients, and more sophisticated dinners - potentially more profitable, but not too expensive - for those living nearby. Restaurant overheads today are too high to allow for any empty tables. So many restaurants have been able to adapt so quickly - although many outside city centres are still struggling - because of the restaurant industry's structure. Although the headlines and column inches are invariably grabbed by London's Kensington Place, the Ivy and Planet Hollywood (which has created 350 jobs and will achieve a turnover in excess of Pounds 15m in its first year, serving more than 3,000 customers a day), most restaurants are small businesses. They are not the 'mom and pop' affairs of yesteryear, but professional businesses run by husbands and wives or, more successfully perhaps, by two or three partners who share the burden of a business open 18 hours a day, seven days a week, and then go their respective ways home. Since January, several different developments have allowed restaurateurs to feel optimistic, and enabled many restaurants to open. The first was the spate of newspaper-led restaurant promotions, initiated by the FT's Lunch for a Fiver, which filled restaurants during the normally quiet first quarter of the year. This taught restaurant owners a lesson in arithmetic - lower prices mixed with higher volume can be a recipe for success. Having survived the first quarter, restaurateurs had an unexpected bonus - a wet spring and summer. When the sun shines, restaurant bookings slump, but this year barbecues and picnics did not seem to be inviting alternatives. According to Judy Markwick, of Markwick's restaurant in Bristol: 'Every month has been better than the previous one since January, and the summer was wonderful. We have learnt the importance of price, too. Our two-course menu is down from Pounds 14.50 to Pounds 10.50 this year but overall turnover is up 30-40 per cent.' The continuing fall in the property market has also helped, by restricting rises in every restaurant's major fixed cost, the rent. It has also prompted landlords to offer rent-free periods of six to nine months, allowing several restaurants, such as the Big Night Out in north London, to open on sites considered previously uneconomic. One potential restaurant site in the City, 10,000 sq ft on the ground floor of a new development near Liverpool Street, was recently offered with the first year rent free. This development, together with the government's legislation splitting the brewing industry from its tied houses, has given the opportunity to many chefs, formerly employed in restaurants or hotels, to open their own restaurants in what were once public houses. The quality of the food now being served at the Eagle, the Gloucester and the French Dining Room in London, for example, may set a trend for good, unpretentious food at reasonable prices. The fact that Christmas bookings are already running at a much higher level than last year adds to the sense of optimism. But before December, the best trading month of the year, there is an obstacle to be negotiated: the November Budget. Rises in valued-added tax and indirect taxes would immediately lead to higher restaurant bills. Many UK restaurateurs have survived the recession by cutting costs and reducing prices - bringing them more in line with those elsewhere in Europe and the US. A sprinkling of economic pragmatism should also enable them to cope with whatever the Budget brings.</p>

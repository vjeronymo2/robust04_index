			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Rong (2621 2837)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 19 Feb (XINHUA) -- Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju  emphasized: As the suburbs of a large metropolis, Shanghai's  rural areas have three major tasks of development -- namely,  stepping up the building of the "green vegetable project,"  accelerating their urbanization, and speeding up the reforms of  their various structures and systems.    He made these remarks at a recent rural Shanghai work  meeting.    Huang Ju said that in Shanghai's urban agricultural  development, it is particularly important to pay attention to  the "vegetable basket project" with emphasis being placed on  growing green vegetables. According to him, the new project has  the following major contents: While ensuring 150,000 mu of  year-round vegetable crops, an additional investment of 250  million yuan shall be made to increase the area of greenhouse  cultivation to 25,000 mu in three years and to bring the area of  landscaping garden cultivation [as received] up to 15 to 20  percent of the total area of vegetable crops. The planned  year-round vegetable and nonstaple food bases shall remain  unchanged for 10 to 15 years. Huang Ju emphasized the need to  seek new operational mechanisms for vegetable and nonstaple food  production and marketing. He said that with the new mechanisms,  the state-run food market should play the major role of  stabilizing market prices while organizing and encouraging  peasants to participate in commodity circulation.    More and more importance is being attached to the  urbanization of Shanghai's rural areas. Huang Ju told the  meeting that Shanghai's suburban areas will be turned into  "second-class cities" step by step over the next two or three  years. He said: This concept means that the urbanization of  Shanghai's rural areas will be greatly accelerated. An  important precondition for the urbanization is to do a good,  high-standard job of regional planning. The "second-class  cities" should be accompanied by a number of urban centers, each  with a population of 200,000 or so. In terms of planning, the  urban centers should meet the standards of modern cities, and  their building plans should include industrial-district  construction, infrastructure construction, and the development  of tertiary industry.    In conclusion, Huang Ju said that Shanghai's suburban areas  should make efforts to further deepen reforms and strive to make  new breakthroughs this year. He pointed out several tasks: to  actively carry out experiments on modern enterprises, to strive  to establish 1,000 new cooperative shareholding companies this  year, and to have 100 townships and towns complete inventories  of their collective assets; to actively explore a new production  and marketing system and to build a number of high-standard  district markets for agricultural products; and to carry out an  experimental reform of the agricultural land-use system and to  separate ownership from the right to sign contracts and the  right to manage.</p>

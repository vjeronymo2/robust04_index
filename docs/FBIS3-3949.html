The region has opened 5,453 evening literacy schools and  more  than 120,000 people have passed literacy tests.    According to a survey conducted by the regional government  recently, the number of illiterates has dropped to 44.43 percent  from 95 percent before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951.    In Shannan Prefecture, about 9,000 illiterates have attended  evening literacy schools over the past five years and 85 percent  of the young people have learned how to read and write.    Despite the efforts, the illiteracy rate in Tibet is still  on  the high side as compared with other parts of the country.    Greater efforts are needed to raise the general educational  level of the farmers and herdsmen, who account for 80 percent of  the total population of the region, an official from the  regional government said.</p>

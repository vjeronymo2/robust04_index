			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by fall in ADRs A POOR performance in the US for Glaxo on Tuesday ensured that the shares would follow suit in London yesterday. The pharmaceuticals group was further affected by bearish news on the pricing of drugs in Europe. Glaxo fell 21 to 658p, its lowest level since last August, on heavy turnover of 5.6m. Shares dealt in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) had fallen by a dollar in New York to Dollars 25 1/8 . The ADRs tested an eight-month low following a recent profits downgrading, and a dealer said the percentage of Glaxo stock held in ADR form had now dropped below 27 per cent. Later, marketmakers focused on news that German health care reforms would force companies such as Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, which dipped 11 to 882p, to reduce drug prices. The second stage of a price referencing process went into effect yesterday in Germany, and the move will affect the H2-antagonists class of drugs which include Glaxo's headline product Zantac and SmithKline's Tagamet. However, the probability of a price-cutting drive was acknowledged some time ago by most pharmaceuticals analysts. Granada sparkles Sparkling interim results from Granada Group sent the shares ahead 13 to 257p, making it the best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday. The leisure group's 49 per cent rise in profits, to Pounds 57.2m, was attributed to extensive cost-cutting rather than a genuine upturn in business. Analysts predicted more savings in the second half and promptly upgraded their forecasts to a range from Pounds 112m to Pounds 118m for this year, and Pounds 135m to Pounds 140m for 1993. Hoare Govett, the company's broker, moved from its undervalued stance to buy, although County NatWest advised clients to take profits. Pressure on Forte continued as rumours of a rights issue circulated but were firmly denied by the hotel group. Behind the market talk was the continued uncertainty surrounding Forte's prolonged proposed disposal of its catering division, including Gardner Merchant, to Compass Group and ARA Holdings, of the US. Sources close to the talks say the complex negotiations are proceeding, but the Pounds 550m sale price originally mentioned is now looking increasingly optimistic. Whispers in the market also suggest some of Gardner Merchant's largest customers are unhappy with the proposed buyers taking over their contracts, with one said to have cancelled its agreement. However, traders point to other considerations, namely the continued weakness in the UK hotel market. The shares, down to 187p at one stage, finished a net 6 off at 193p, the lowest closing level since December 1987. The market registered its pleasure with GEC's preliminary figures by hoisting the shares to 240p; they finally settled at 233p for a net gain of 8. Turnover expanded to 16m. Mr James Ross, electronics specialist at Hoare Govett, described GEC as 'undervalued' and said he saw plenty of scope for outperformance by the shares. The expiry of the June petroleum products contract on the International Petroleum Exchange saw crude oil prices under heavy pressure and triggered another slide in oil shares. The biggest casualty was Lasmo, which dropped 13 to 167p, its lowest since December 1987. The stock had been chased higher on stories that a bid was in the offing. Big turnover in BP saw 23m shares changing hands, much of which was said to have followed a switch recommendation, apparently by one of the influential London investment houses, out of Shell, 5 1/2 down at 499 1/2 p. BP moved up 5 1/2 to 209p. The exceptional defensive qualities of the utilities areas of the market were said to have attracted the attentions of at least one of the UK's biggest institutions and led to sharp gains among the stocks. Worries about the debt refinancing of Isosceles, which owns the Gateway supermarkets group, led to another bout of selling pressure in Standard Chartered and SG Warburg. Rumours that Isosceles had encountered refinancing problems have been circulating in the stock market for at least two weeks and triggered a sharp decline in Warburg and Standard Chartered shares in the middle of last week. Fears of dividend cuts and the slide in the UK equity market and its damaging effect on the composite insurers' solvency margins brought pressure to bear on the sector. Sun Alliance lost 14 to 275p and Royal, a prime dividend cut candidate, according to dealers, declined 6 tp 222p. Dealing began in British Biotechnology, the first biotechnology company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The shares opened at 425p and closed 25 up at 450p. Electrical goods manufacturer Kenwood made a more than satisfactory stock market debut. The shares, offered at 285p, traded at a 5p premium during early dealing and eventually settled at a 2p premium, in spite of the heavy sell-off in the equity market. Aegis, the holding company for the world's largest group of media buying and planning specialists, fell 10 to 79p as agency broker James Capel lowered its profits forecasts for the group. Capel cut its 1992 estimate by Pounds 20m, to Pounds 29m, and the 1993 figure by Pounds 14m, to Pounds 46m. The broker said a greater than expected exceptional charge and a 'dire performance in France' had prompted the review. Marketing group WPP held firm at 50p after announcing that it had agreed to swap some 25 per cent of the debt provided by its banking syndicate for new convertible preferred shares. SG Warburg upgraded its recommendation on the ordinary and convertible shares to a buy. A view that worries about the effect of Germany's withdrawal from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project had been overdone helped British Aerospace, one of the main UK contractors on the project. The shares bounced 4 to 249p on light turnover of 1.5m. An analyst said: 'The news on EFA was already discounted in the price.' The fall in BM Group continued unabated. The shares lost 28 to 85p on turnover of 5.6m as financial worries continued to dog the company. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (36).

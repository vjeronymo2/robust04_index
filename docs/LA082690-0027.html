			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> 2 MEASURES PROVIDE AMMUNITION IN U.S. CAMPAIGN AGAINST ILLITERACY  </P> <P> It's time to go back to school.  </P> <P> The latest report by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee says 23  million Americans are illiterate. Another 45 million adults read with only  minimal comprehension. Jonathan Kozol, author of "Illiterate America,"  estimates that the United States ranks 49th among the 158 nations in the United  Nations in literacy level. And it's getting worse:  </P> <P> * New York Telephone Co. had to give an entry-level exam to 60,000 people to  hire just 3,000 because 84% failed the test.  </P> <P> * Chemical Bank in New York interviews 40 applicants to find one who can be  trained successfully as a teller.  </P> <P> * Chrysler Corp. had to incorporate graphics on its assembly line because so  many workers could not read the words bad hood fit on the button they were  supposed to push when they detected an ill-fitting body part.  </P> <P> "If you can't read, write and do basic math, you just cannot be a truly  productive American. It's just that simple," said Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio), who  is the primary sponsor of the "literacy for all Americans act."  </P> <P> Sawyer made the statement standing behind a low wall of books representing the  465,000 pages of technical data that an automobile mechanic must be able to  read to diagnose and repair cars. "This wall between good people and good jobs  must come down," Sawyer said.  </P> <P> A worker who lacks basic skills to keep up with change in the increasingly  complex work environment -- who can't read basic instruction manuals or safety  instructions -- drops farther and farther behind. And low-level opportunities  are disappearing.  </P> <P> "American jobs are placing greater demands on employees," said the Senate Labor  Committee report. "The average American worker today must have skills at the  ninth-grade through the 12th-grade levels, not the fourth-grade level typical  after World War II. And the standards keep rising. The growth occupations have  increasingly shifted to the service and retail sectors, which require  high-level problem solving, communication, reading, writing and math skills."  </P> <P> Without a federal initiative on literacy, these workers will be more vulnerable  to a shift or advance in the marketplace, be confined to dead-end jobs or  always be in danger of dislocation.  </P> <P> President Bush and the nation's governors have embraced a new national policy  calling for every American to be literate by the year 2000. To that end, two  major literacy bills are on the verge of final congressional approval this  fall.  </P> <P> Sawyer's bill is part of the omnibus "equity and excellence in education act"  (H.R. 5115) sponsored by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). The House  approved it overwhelmingly.  </P> <P> Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) sponsored the Senate counterpart, the National  Literacy Act of 1990 (S. 1310), which passed unanimously. The bills'  differences will be ironed out in a conference committee this fall.  </P> <P> The main federal program to fight illiteracy today is the Adult Education Act,  which is funded at $160 million, less than 1% of the Department of Education's  budget. Sawyer's bill calls for an additional $250 million, Simon's for an  additional $230 million.  </P> <P> The purpose of both bills is to provide federal leadership and focus for an  issue dominated by fragmented state and local efforts. It would create the  federal infrastructure to coordinate and strengthen efforts at all levels. And  it would provide incentives for the private sector to become more involved.  </P> <P> The bills would create a national center for literacy to write national  educational goals, develop better teaching methods and tools and train  teachers.  </P> <P> But while Simon's bill focuses more on the unemployed person who can't read,  Sawyer's bill concentrates on the functionally illiterate employed worker. His  bill would establish a National Workplace Literacy Assistance Collaborative to  help small and medium-sized businesses and labor organizations implement  special programs through a system of grants.  </P> <P> "It's tremendously important to upgrade the skills of today's work force," said  Harold W. McGraw, president of the Business Council for Effective Literacy,  "not only in terms of our own profitability and ability to compete  internationally, but also in terms of giving workers new opportunities. There  are less and less low-level jobs out there today."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bill Would Let U.S. Firms Recruit Aliens  </P> <P> New employment-based immigration laws could open doors to the U.S. job market  for foreign recruits while providing money to educate and retrain American  workers.  </P> <P> Jobs are going begging in the current economy, said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison  (D-Conn.), primary sponsor of the "family unity and employment opportunity  immigration act" (H.R. 4300).  </P> <P> Instead of the quota system used under current law, Morrison proposes awarding  visas to people overseas with relatives already in the United States. This  system would allow employers to recruit workers from abroad.  </P> <P> Morrison proposes a head tax, of sorts. After attempting to find workers in  this country, companies would be allowed to recruit immigrants -- for a fee.  Companies with 200 or more employees would pay $1,000 per worker; companies  with 50 to 200 employees would pay $500. There would be no fee for companies  with fewer than 50 employees or for nonprofit organizations.  </P> <P> The money would go to the American Workers' Educational Trust Fund, which the  secretary of Labor could use to provide education grants to states.  </P> <P> "By balancing the benefits to employers who recruit immigrants to fill jobs  with raising revenues to educate and train American workers for the jobs of the  future, we will have built a system of employer-based immigration where  everybody wins -- the immigrant, the employer and the American worker,"  Morrison said.  </P> <P> The bill, which has passed the House Judiciary Committee, is expected to come  to the floor for a vote when Congress returns from summer recess. The Bush  Administration favors similar, although narrower, legislation passed by the  Senate last year.  </P></p>

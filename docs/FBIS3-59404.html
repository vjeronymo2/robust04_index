This was not easy;  great sacrifices were made. However, supported by the world's  great centers of power, the Muslims have rejected even this  proposal. They, in fact, want all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They  hope to achieve this by retaining the union, which would then be  abandoned by the Serbs and the Croats," Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, said  yesterday.    Krajisnik pointed out that, "by retaining the union, the  Muslims hope to acquire Neum and an exit to the sea. They also  maintain that Sarajevo cannot be divided into two cities, and  they demand new territorial concessions in eastern and western  Bosnia."    ``The Muslims are making all these demands hoping they will  get to keep all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We cannot make any  further territorial concessions, but the Muslims persist with  their demands so that the Serbs will be blamed again for the  failure of negotiations. For this reason, on 15 January we will  have to make the Muslims aware that this leadership is taking  them to destruction. In the meantime, prior to 15 January we  will have a session of the assembly of the republic of Srpska  where we will ask for the establishment of a new platform for  future negotiations.    ``This will conclude the third round of our struggle for  freedom; in the pending fourth round, we will have to make the  international community aware of what the Serbs want. And if  this does not produce any results, we will have to take our own  course,'' said Krajisnik, adding that "the Muslims are  prolonging the war with the intention of first purging central  Bosnia of Croats, and then, in the spring, turning against the  Serbs. This is why they want to open the airport in Tuzla, in  order to get arms through."</p>

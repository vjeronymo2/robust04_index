			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Becirovic: "Private Operators Are Ruining the </F> Dinar"]    [Text] Podgorica, 5 Apr -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo  Djukanovic today invited bankers to Podgorica for a discussion  of what is happening to the money supply, saying that disturbing  problems have been arising in recent days after the favorable  results in the first stage of stabilizing the monetary system.  According to Djukanovic, these problems require urgent measures.  He mentioned scalping, of which he said that the "participant  banks" are not the only ones. Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister  Krunoslav Vukcevic asked the bankers to present their view of  how the currency exchange business operates. He presented  figures to the effect that by 4 April Montenegrin banks had  purchased 13.2 million German marks [DM]. When the sale of  foreign exchange is taken into account, there was a positive  result of about DM12 million. In view of the fact that the  result for the entire country is DM300 million, the share of  Montenegrin banking is not really at an enviable level in that  amount. He also pointed to the phenomenon of scalping. Petar  Vujovic, director of the Montenegrin branch of the National  Bank, mentioned other figures, saying that the purchases of  foreign exchange in Montenegro amounted to about DM26 million,  but that banks in Montenegro headquartered in Serbia are not  turning over their entire purchases to the Montenegrin branch of  the National Bank of Yugoslavia.    "When we asked the Beobanka office about the purchases of  foreign exchange, they told us that headquarters gave out the  figures. Later they told us that they were not prohibited from  giving out figures, but they could not provide them," Vujovic  said.    Radmila Kalezic, Jugobanka manager in Podgorica, stated  categorically that her bank was not engaging in scalping. She  said that the purchasing of foreign exchange had been good up  until 10 days ago, but since that time things had changed, and  her bank had a deficit of DM397,000 in sales and purchases of  foreign exchange.    "The tellers noticed that the same people are coming to buy  foreign exchange again and again in the course of the day. Those  who earlier purchased it on the street have now moved to the  banks. It seems that private operators are not promptly turning  in their cash receipts for the day," Kalezic said, calling for  the government to monitor strictly the cash flow of private  firms.    Milorad Lakovic, director of Pljevaljska Bank, was also  categorical about the private operators. He said that the  dealers are working for the private operators and that the black  market is already beginning to operate, and Cetkovic, the  director of Jugobanka in Herceg-Novi, presented the figure that  until a few days ago the ratio in the purchase and sale of  foreign exchange was 4:1 to the advantage of the bank, but now  that ratio is even. He said that the private sector is probably  engaged in purchasing from farmers, so that the movement of the  money is not being monitored, and certain new people are coming  to bank windows and doing so several times a day. The bankers in  Kotor say that a check should be run on how people with a  monthly salary of no more than 100 dinars can come several times  a day and present 100 dinars to buy marks. When bank personnel  notice this and offer another currency instead of marks, these  people call for the assistance of the financial police, and the  officials must then pay them.    It is obvious that scalping and the dealers are slowly  becoming reality once again.</p>

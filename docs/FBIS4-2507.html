			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Shen Taifu, president  of the former Beijing-based Changcheng (Great Wall) Machinery  and Electronics Scientific and Technological Industry Company,  was executed this morning on charges of corruption and bribery  worth more than three million yuan.    The death sentence was passed by the Intermediate People's  Court of Beijing, upheld by the city's higher court at the final  hearing of the case, and confirmed by the Supreme People's Court.    Shen, 39, was also deprived of his political rights for  life.    Li Xiaoshi, a former vice-minister of the State Scientific  and Technological Commission, who was implicated in the case,  was jailed for 20 years, with his political rights revoked for  four years.    According to an announcement by the supreme court, Shen's  accomplice and wife Sun Jihong, 40, was sentenced to 15 years'  imprisonment. She was vice-president and head of the accounting  department of Changcheng, which was ordered closed in the second  half of last year.    On March 2, 1993, Shen Taifu and Sun Jihong withdrew one  million yuan in cash from the company's fund-raising department,  then deposited it into Sun's personal bank account.    On February 21 and 22, 1993, Shen filled in two receipts for  one million yuan each, allegedly to pay for patent commissions.    With one of the receipts he drew one million yuan in cash  from the Shenzhen Taifu Company, and then asked You Chengshun,  the head of this subsidiary company of Changcheng's, to use the  other receipt to reimburse the same amount of cash.    In March of the same year, Shen managed to persuade others  to  pass a decision before the Changcheng board of directors  exclusively for his own benefit -- for every transaction he  concluded, he would be entitled to a 10 percent patent  commission.    To cover up the trick, Shen had the decision affixed with  the  date "January 4, 1993" -- about two months before its adoption.    To facilitate the illegal fund-raising by Changcheng and its  subsidiaries from 1989 to March 1993, Shen gave out bribes  amounting to 255,791.9 yuan, in cash or in kind, to Li Xiaoshi  as well as to 11 other state functionaries.    The eleven have all been prosecuted for receiving bribes or  for negligence of duty. Some of these people -- a government  official at the deputy bureau director level, four reporters,  three bank clerks and three retired accountants -- will be dealt  with in cases connected with Shen's illegal fund raising.    On March 4, 1994, the Intermediate Court of Beijing  sentenced  Shen Taifu to death and all his personal property was  confiscated. Sun Jihong was sentenced to 15 years in jail and  deprived of her political rights for three years.    At the final or second hearing later, the Higher Court of  Beijing upheld the intermediate court's sentences and rejected  their appeals.    On April 8, 1994, the supreme court confirmed the validity  of  Shen's death sentence. Acting on an order issued by the  president of the supreme court, the Intermediate Court of  Beijing carried out the death sentence today.    Li Xiaoshi, 53, was found guilty of receiving 52,690 yuan in  bribes and pocketing 20,000 yuan in public money while serving  as vice-minister of the commission.    On March 4, 1994, the Intermediate Court of Beijing  sentenced  him to 20 years' imprisonment with his political rights revoked  for four years and part of his personal property confiscated.    Li also pleaded not guilty. However, the Beijing higher  court rejected his appeal and upheld the sentence.    At a press conference this afternoon, Liu Jiachen,  vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, accused Shen Taifu  of pocketing three million yuan in funds he had raised,  allegedly to develop machinery and electronics technology.    The vice-president advised state functionaries, especially  those with power, to learn proper lessons from the cases of Shen  Taifu and Li Xiaoshi.</p>

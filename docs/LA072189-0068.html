			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEREK BROWN FAILS SAT, WILL BE INELIGIBLE AT NEBRASKA IN FALL  </P> <P> Servite High School tailback Derek Brown, the Orange County's single-season  rushing leader, said Thursday he will attend the University of Nebraska this  fall but will sit out his freshman year after failing to meet academic  standards under Proposition 48.  </P> <P> Brown said he didn't score the required 700 points on his Scholastic Aptitude  Test. He said he didn't remember what his score was.  </P> <P> Under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, Brown will lose one year of  eligibility. The NCAA requires incoming freshman to have a 2.0 grade-point  average and score at least 700 on the SAT or 15 on the American College Test.  </P> <P> "I guess I'll just study," said Brown, who's practicing with the South team for  the July 29 Shrine All-Star game in the Rose Bowl. "It's OK. I was a little  disappointed at first, but it came out for the good. This way I can study and  get a good jump on my grades. I'll still work out and get ready for next year."  </P> <P> Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said Brown will remain on scholarship.  </P> <P> "The test scores are a matter of the player's," he said. "That's a private  matter and I can't comment on it. But he has signed a letter of intent with us,  and it's our intent (to keep him) with the scholarship.  </P> <P> "We've had two Prop. 48s in the last three years. That's not very many. If we  do have a Prop. 48, we go ahead and put him on scholarship."  </P> <P> Brown said he will leave for Lincoln, Neb., on Aug. 15 to enroll in classes.  Nebraska freshmen start football practice Aug. 11 and the varsity Aug. 17.  </P> <P> Brown said he was looking forward to his freshman season because he said  Nebraska coaches told him he might get a chance to play on the varsity as a  freshman, a rarity at the school.  </P> <P> "It would have been nice to play as a freshman," he said. "But it's no big  deal. This has worked out better."  </P> <P> Brown was one of the top high school football players in Southern California  last season, rushing for 2,301 yards in 13 games. He scored 30 touchdowns and  averaged 8.5 yards per carry.  </P> <P> He finished his three-year career with 4,663 yards rushing, second on the  county's all-time list to Valencia's Ray Pallares (5,398 yards).  </P> <P> Brown considered sitting out the Orange County All-Star game in June to go to  Nebraska to work and train. He changed his mind after attending a banquet for  the all-star players, then rushed for 121 yards in 27 carries and returned a  kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown in the game.  </P> <P> Osborne said Brown was among the best high school running backs Nebraska  recruiters saw this year.  </P> <P> "Derek's a great player," Osborne said. "We rated him high nationally. But it's  hard to compare him to someone like a (Mike) Rozier or a (Roger) Craig because  he hasn't played one down of college football yet."  </P> <P> And he'll have to wait another year to do so.  </P></p>

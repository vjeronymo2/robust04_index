			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World wheat forecast cut by 8m tonnes The International Wheat Council has reduced its estimates for 1994-95 world wheat production and, to a lesser extent, consumption. In its latest Grain Market Report the London-based IWC blames reduced crop expectations for Russia, Canada, Pakistan, Turkey and Australia for the 8m-tonne cut, compared with its projection a month ago, in the production figure. This is now put at 536m tonnes, 23m below the 1993-94 total. Its consumption estimate has been cut by 3m to 554m tonnes. As a result of persistent hot, dry weather in July Russia is now expected to produce 37m tonnes, 1m less than indicated in the July report. The Candian forecast, down 800,000 tonnes from last month at 23.8m, is now 4m tonnes below the 1993-94 outturn. The IWC attributes this to a drop in spring sowings as growers switched to more profitable crops like canola (oilseed rape) and soyabeans. With drought conditions persisting in the eastern states of Australia another 2m tonnes has been trimmed from that countries estimate, taking it to 12m tonnes, 33 per cent below last season's output. Senator Bob Collins, Australia's primary industry minster, is still more pessimistic, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. He told the federal parliament yesterday that the country's national wheat harvest was likely to be little more than 11m tonnes in 1994-95 as a result of the severe drought conditions in parts of Queensland and New South Wales. The minister said that the most recent updates suggested that the NSW crop would be about 20 per cent of the previous year's production - 'about a million tonnes instead of 5m last year'. In 1993-94 Australia produced almost 18m tonnes of wheat and this formed the country's seventh largest export category. The only encouraging feature that Senator Collins could point to was some helpful late rains in Western Australia, one of the major wheat-growing states. 'It looks as if there'll be a reasonable crop from WA,' he said. The drought conditions are relatively recent in NSW, but have persisted for four years in Queensland, causing major problems for the farm sector.</p>

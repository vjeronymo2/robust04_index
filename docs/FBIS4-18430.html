			<p>BFN     [Text] The respective presidents of the Greek and Cypriot  Parliaments, Apostolos Kaklamanis and Alexis Galanos, met in  Athens today and discussed close cooperation and better  coordination between the two institutions to promote national  issues. During the meeting there was a mutual briefing  regarding the difficulties in support for national issues in  international organizations.    Kaklamanis stated that besides the issue of Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM], the Cyprus issue  is also at a critical phase as a result of the talks on  confidence-building measures. The president of the Greek  Chamber of Deputies repeated the commitment repeatedly expressed  by the government and prime minister to togetherness,  solidarity, and common direction between he two countries.    Alexix Galanos, the Cypriot House of Representatives  president, referred to the hypocritical practice of using  different measures and putting different weight on the issues of  Skopje and Cyprus. Although Turkey invaded and occupies the  north of the island, today it appears as a peaceloving nation.  The president of the Cypriot House of Representatives stressed  that besides the unified defense space, Greece and Cyprus should  formulate a unified diplomatic area to promote national issues,  which are undivided. At 1500 [1200 GMT] this afternoon, Galanos  also met Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos.    After meeting Galanos, Pangalos said they discussed topics  regarding Cyprus, developments around the Cyprus issue, and the  Cypriot Parliament's participation in the Parliamentary Assembly  of the Council of Europe.    Asked to comment on developments in Istanbul, Pangalos said:  We have a series of developments that concern us and we have  the statement of the new mayor. I hope calm will prevail and  that someone will prove to those who use such methods that they  should choose between a return to the past and a move to the  future. Turkey cannot possibly seek a position in the family of  European nations and, at the same time, remember the  achievements of the captors [reference to the Ottoman Empire].  I believe that Hellenism, the civilized world, and the great  community of Orthodox nations, Pangalos concluded, are  determined to protect the Orthodox Partriarchate, which is an  international organization with particular importance for the  world community as a whole.</p>

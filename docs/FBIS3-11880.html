The main objective is to  agree on a position for the Summit of the Americas, due to be  held in December in Miami (United States). According to  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, the Rio Group foreign  ministers should agree on common topics about commerce in the  hemisphere, good management practices, the preservation of  democracy, and social and environmental matters. The decision  was announced on 22 March after the Rio Group countries' foreign  ministers met for two days in Brasilia.    Amorim and Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano  took advantage of the meeting to sign an agreement for  reciprocal protection and promotion of investments. Under the  terms of the document, the two countries will permit the mutual  free transfer of remittances. The agreement, however, includes  reservations on six topics -- which were raised by Brazil -- to  encourage Brazilian investment and restrict Chilean investment.    The foreign ministers also began the preparatory work for  the  Rio Group summit, scheduled for September in Rio de Janeiro.  Celso Amorim said the Latin American diplomats also will seek a  common position for a meeting with the European Union scheduled  for 22 and 23 April in Sao Paulo. According to Amorim, Latin  American countries will make joint exchange proposals to Russia,  China, Japan, and other Asian countries.</p>

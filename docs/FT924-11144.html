			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Canadian No vote projected on reforms CANADA'S package of constitutional reforms appeared early today to be heading for a decisive defeat in several key provinces as votes in yesterday's referendum were counted. Soon after polls closed it was projected that a clear majority of voters in Quebec had rejected the agreement, aimed mainly at defusing the French-speaking province's moves to break away from the confederation. The Yes forces also appeared to be facing an unexpected defeat in the central province of Ontario, which is home to about a third of Canada's population and which was assumed to be solidly in favour of the so-called Charlottetown Accord. The No side led by 52 per cent to 48 per cent in the province about an hour after polls closed. The referendum is not binding, but defeat in either Quebec or Ontario would be the death knell for the accord, which was signed in August by the leaders of all 10 provinces and is supported by Canada's three leading political parties. Mr Frank McKenna, premier of the eastern province of New Brunswick, said the reform package had been 'mortally wounded' by the Quebec result. Opponents of the agreement were critical of a provision which guaranteed Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons, in perpetuity. The campaign in Quebec against the agreement was led by separatists arguing it failed to meet the province's demands for wider powers. The agreement also provided for greater representation for western and Atlantic provinces and the transfer of some powers from the federal government to the provinces. Supporters of the agreement had predicted that a rejection would lead to years of economic and political uncertainty and, possibly, the eventual break-up of the country.</p>

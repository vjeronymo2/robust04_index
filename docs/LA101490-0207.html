			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INJURED PLAYER LEADS FURIOUS FULLERTON RALLY;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: ROBINSON RETURNS TO PACE COMEBACK AFTER BEING CARRIED OFF THE FIELD  ON A STRETCHER. FUMBLES COST EL CAMINO.  </P> <P> Eric Robinson got off a stretcher to lead a thrilling comeback Saturday as  Fullerton College defeated El Camino, 31-24, in a Mission Conference game in  front of about 4,000 at Fullerton District Stadium.  </P> <P> Robinson, a sophomore quarterback, was carried from the field with 10 minutes  left. At that point El Camino appeared to have things well in hand and led,  24-9.  </P> <P> But Robinson sprinted back onto the field with six minutes left to help start  an impressive three-touchdown rally.  </P> <P> He had hurt his ankle, but after it was retaped by trainer Bill Chambers, he  appeared healthy. Chambers said Robinson also complained of a sore back and  dizziness when taken from the field, but he looked fine when he scored the  game-winner with 29 seconds left on a 17-yard option play.  </P> <P> "The weak side was open so I just took it," Robinson said " . . . I wasn't sure  we could come back to win. I was thinking a tie."  </P> <P> The winning drive was set up when Hornet Ward Van Pelt intercepted El Camino  quarterback Rod Harvey at the Fullerton 23 with 2:19 left.  </P> <P> The Hornets then drove 77 yards in five plays without a pass. One key play was  Coy Collins' 22-yard gain on a reverse. On the next play, Johnny Mountain went  31 yards on a delay to give Fullerton a first down at the El Camino 17.  </P> <P> Robinson scored on the next play and Eric Lange's extra point gave Fullerton a  31-24 lead.  </P> <P> The victory keeps Fullerton (5-0, 4-0) the only undefeated team in the 16-team  conference.  </P> <P> The comeback started when Brian Williams scored on a three-yard run with 5:36  left to play to cut the lead to 24-16 after Lange kicked the extra point.  </P> <P> El Camino then helped the Fullerton cause when Harvey fumbled on third down at  the Warrior seven. Toby Howell recovered.  </P> <P> Williams scored on the next play with 4:23 left and Fullerton lined up to go  for two points and the tie. Robinson rolled in with ease and the score was  tied, 24-24, with 4:23 left.  </P> <P> El Camino then started on a drive it never figured to have to make to win. The  Warriors (4-2, 2-2) got as far as the Fullerton 28 before Van Pelt's  interception.  </P> <P> Fullerton, which leads the conference in rushing with 290 yards per game, had  330. Mountain had with 123 yards in nine carries.  </P> <P> El Camino quarterback Harvey was 26 of 52 for 387 yards and two first-half  touchdowns. But his two turnovers in the second half allowed Fullerton, the  second-ranked team in the J.C. Grid-Wire national poll, to remain undefeated.  </P></p>

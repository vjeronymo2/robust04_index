			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo expects to go ahead with Mali gold mine Anglo American Corporation of South Africa's two-year search for suitable gold projects in West Africa has paid off and the group expects to give the go-ahead in October to a USDollars 210m mine in Mali. The Sadiola project in the far west of the country, near the border with Senegal, is likely to come into operation in 1997 and produce between 10 and 12 tonnes of gold a year, according to Mr Neville Keys, project director of Anglo's new mining business division. Anglo has been widening its search for African gold as nearly every metre of prospective land in South Africa has been explored and drilled by domestic companies unable to move freely abroad because of exchange controls. Modern exploration techniques have merely proved that the old prospectors left very little to be discovered. In West Africa, Anglo is also exploring for gold in Burkina Faso, Guinea and Senegal, where there has been relatively little mining activity in the past  -Mali has only one other gold mine, the Syana, operated by BHP of Australia. Mr Keys said the Adiola, an open pit mine, would have a life of at least 14 years but he believed there was much more gold to be discovered there. Final stages of the financial arrangements were being put together but it was expected that Anglo would have 38 per cent of the project and operate the mine. The private Canadian company that discovered the deposit, Ima Gold, would also have 38 per cent, the government of Mali 18 per cent and the International Finance Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, 6 per cent. There is an interesting difference of opinion about the gold market's prospects between Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division, and Mr Jim Buys, the group's senior economic consultant. While both agree that the present gold price is well supported by physical demand and cannot be expected to go much lower, Mr Buys suggests the price is unlikely to rise much in real terms unless there is another burst of speculative interest of the kind seen last May and June, when the market was given a boost by the well publicised activities of financiers Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George Soros. He believes there will be no surge in world inflation to give gold a lift because governments are giving top priority to keeping inflation down. Mr Buys argues that if the gold price stays at about Dollars 380 a troy ounce in real terms for the next 10 years, South Africa's annual gold production of about 610 tonnes can be expected to fall by 20 per cent. Mr Sunter, however, is much more optimistic. He says Anglo's gold division hopes to see a gradual rise in the gold price to take it to Dollars 450 an ounce in real terms by the end of the century. He describes this as 'a realistic wish'. Also, South African gold producers showed great resilience in 1991 and 1992 when many mines seemed to be facing closure because of low gold prices but survived by cutting costs. He would not be surprised to see South Africa's gold output remain stable in the 580 to 600 tonnes a year range for many years to come. On the question of the relatively poor stock market ratings of South African gold companies compared to rivals in North America, Mr Sunter says he expects that other South African producers will follow the lead recently set by Gencor, which gave an estimate of its 'life of mine recoverable gold' so that this could be compared with the reserve figures quoted by North American groups. Mr Sunter says Anglo will probably give a range of reserve estimates based on various Rand gold prices.</p>

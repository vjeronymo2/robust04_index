			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation It is hard to see why Rank merits a premium rating. The stock has strongly outperformed the market over the past year. One reason was a widely-held belief that the leisure group would benefit disproportionately from the economic recovery. Another was a belief that Rank would make a handsome profit from selling its 49 per cent investment in Rank Xerox to Xerox. Yesterday's interim results provide little support for the first argument. Operating profits from the businesses Rank manages itself were only 9 per cent up on the same period of last year. Margins barely advanced. That hardly looks like profits making a strong cyclical recovery. Moreover, the longer-term outlook for these managed businesses is not especially rosy. The video duplication side, a star performer in these results, will gradually decline as video-tapes are overtaken by compact discs and electronic delivery of videos. The bingo business, where profits were flat in the half, appears to be suffering against the competition. Similarly, the holiday operations are stuck in a low-growth market, as Britons are increasingly travelling abroad for their holidays. It is true that Rank Xerox was a bright spark, increasing its profit contribution before restructuring costs by 38 per cent. But a quick sale to Xerox does not look likely. For a start, the US photocopier giant does not have enough cash. Even if it did, much of the profit from a sale would be gobbled up in capital gains tax.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Pride and disbelief in Ueda city: Hata's home town prays and parades for its famous son The two warriors, one in scarlet the other in black, began the incantation. Kneeling with ankles splayed, the prayers were to summon a power from the universe capable of making one man overcome his fears and 1,000 men. Yesterday's invocations were more than pertinent. They were uttered for Mr Tsutomu Hata outside his headquarters in his home base of Ueda, moments after he was elected Japan's prime minister. Ueda, which lies at the foot of the Japanese Alps, yesterday prayed its local hero would be able to cope with the machinations of the capital's treacherous faction politics. Mr Hata, elected nine times over 25 years, is hugely popular but some fear he is not tough enough. 'He may be just too generous and the danger is he just might not last that long,' said Mrs Suigetsu Imai. Ueda is anxious to bask in Mr Hata's glory for as long as possible. He is the most famous man to come from the city. Not that he has much competition. Ueda, ignored by almost all travel guides, has only once previously troubled the footnotes of history. During the sixteenth century one of its lords, Yukimura Sanada, twice beat forces of the celebrated Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, before he was defeated and killed. 'This is the most important day in Ueda city's history,' said Mr Hideji Ohara, director of planning at Organ Needles, a sewing machine manufacturer. Mr Kenzo Hori, chairman of the chamber of industry and commerce, proclaimed: 'We have not had a prime minister from Ueda city in 2,500 years, and we probably won't have another for another 2,500 years. Mr Hata's achievement is a once in 5,000 years triumph.' Ueda celebrated his triumph in style. The city hall organised the first lantern parade since the Sino-Japanese war of the 1930s. More than 5,000 red and white lanterns were distributed, to be carried along streets festooned with flags and posters of Mr Hata. Bands played Sousa marches to compete with loud-speaker systems broadcasting Wagnerian fanfares. Overhead, fireworks lit the sky and below, on the streets, drums were beaten, free sake poured, and the crowd orchestrated into celebratory shouts of 'banzai'. In spite of Ueda's pride at Mr Hata's achievement, there was also disbelief. Mr Takeshi Murata, a 59-year old shoe retailer, explained: 'I was in the same grade as Hata at primary and secondary school, and right after the war as kids we used to fence together on the streets, pretending to be samurai. Never in the world would I have guessed he would become prime minister. He didn't even seem that talented.' Many in the crowd were also concerned whether Mr Hata would be able to deal with the pressing problems of the day: tax reform, North Korea and the trade surplus with the US. Mr Yoshiki Sunohara, a local cosmetics retailer, was convinced Mr Hata would surprise the Tokyo-based politicians. 'He's a new kind of prime minister,' he said. 'Despite his appearance he's really stubborn and has a strong will and that's reflected in his politics. This aspect of his behaviour just hasn't been appreciated by the media in Tokyo.' Mr Hata's main strengths are his direct style and apparent honesty. Mr Kenichiro Hata, the prime minister's cousin and first secretary, explained: 'During the 25 years Tsutomu has been in politics he's developed a style of explaining politics in terms that ordinary people can understand. He's been through hardship, failed exams and even been a bus conductor, so unlike his predecessor he can understand the concerns of the common people. With their support he can succeed.' Although local businessmen yesterday queued outside his headquarters to sign the congratulatory visitors' book and sip sake ladled from a specially cracked cask made of Japanese cypress, none admitted expecting special advantages following Mr Hata's election. The huge kettles of tea, King Edward panatellas, and rice, tainted pink by cherries, would last one day and then be gone, said one. But in spite of his reputation, Mr Hata faces a difficult task persuading Japan that politicians can be honest. Even some locals remain unconvinced. Ms Sayuri Tobo, a secondary school student, said: 'In general, politicians are not honest. And I think he is the same as the others. Something will be revealed about him one day.' Faced with a public disillusioned by politics and the convoluted challenges of Diet politics, Mr Hata can only benefit from further invocations to strengthen his resolve and overcome his fellow parliamentarians.</p>

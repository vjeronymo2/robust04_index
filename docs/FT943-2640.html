			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (15): Buy it for love not for money - Investing in art / Antony Thorncroft warns against expecting a cash return from paintings, and cites the Pre-Raphaelites and Impressionists in evidence Anyone who buys pictures as an investment, rather than because they love them as works of art, is unwise. It is easy to say that now - when prices for paintings by many of the acknowledged modern masters, Van Gogh, Renoir, Cezanne and more - have fallen by around 40 per cent in the past four years. But it has always been so. Apart from acknowledged masterpieces, which are now mainly locked away in museums, changes in taste make investing in art a perilous business. The example of the Pre-Raphaelites, which sold very expensively in the late 19th century and for virtually nothing 50 years later, is a warning for all. Five years ago, the permanent status of the Impressionists seemed unassailable; now the trade is not so sure. Every painting carries its own individual price, but an important work by Renoir that might have been estimated by Sotheby's or Christie's at Pounds 10m in 1989 would now be fortunate to carry a Pounds 6m reserve. A great painting by Van Gogh (one, a portrait of his physician, Dr Gachet, made Dollars 82.5m, a record for any work of art, in 1990) would probably carry an estimate of around Pounds 15m. A Cezanne still life might be marked down from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4m - that is, if such paintings were offered in the saleroom. The global recession of the early 1990s, and in particular the problems in Japan, brought the market for the best Impressionist and modern art to a shuddering halt. The last auctions at the peak, in New York in the summer of 1990, brought in totals of Dollars 250m-plus. By 1994, Sotheby's and Christie's were happy with auctions totalling Dollars 50m. The frantic Japanese buying has completely disappeared, and American and continental collectors are also more selective. Dealers have almost entirely vanished from the scene at the top price levels. Worst of all, unless forced to sell by the three great Ds - death, divorce and debt - few owners of important paintings are anxious to expose them to the current weak demand in the auction room. Instead, pictures are traded privately, although there are relatively few deals being clinched. Many specialists do not expect the prices of the top Impressionists and Moderns to return to the levels of 1989 before the end of the century. The leading auction houses brought the volatility upon themselves by encouraging new buyers to view art as an investment. They offered the new rich, such as the Australian Alan Bond, loans to help them buy pictures. He acquired Van Gogh's 'Irises' for Dollars 53.9m, but failed to maintain the debt payments on it. Fortunately for all concerned the Getty Museum, at Malibu, California, stepped in and bought the painting. The auction houses are now more cautious, and loans are a thing of the past. The market is slowly growing in confidence, but the main buyers are museums and knowledgeable collectors. For example, the top price in the saleroom during the 1993-94 season was the Dollars 13.75m paid at Sotheby's New York in November for a 'difficult' painting, one of Matisse's 'cut-outs', an adventurous form of art that he experimented with during his last years. Of course, a weak market means that prices are low, with sought-after artists trading at the price levels of around a decade ago. There are bargains available. Experts were surprised that one of Braque's late 'Atelier' paintings, of around 1950, failed to sell at Christies' in June, despite a low estimate of around Pounds 3m. In 1992, in the depth of the recession, a painting from the same series made Pounds 4.3m. It could be an opportunity was missed, but only someone well versed in 20th century art history would have been attracted by the sombre, brown, painting. There are, of course, many sectors to the picture market. Old Masters have a revered history, having been collected for almost 500 years. Their condition, subject matter and scarcity make them unpopular with most new-rich collectors, and the finest examples are in museums. The chance of buying an oil by Raphael, Leonardo or Giorgione are nil. However, paintings by some energetic artists, like Canelleto, the Brueghels and Rubens, appear frequently, and the patina of history should enable them to hold their value. Dutch 17th century art, especially still-lifes, have always been popular with north European buyers, and the best examples would probably prove a sound investment. Anyone acquiring art, mainly out of interest, partly for decoration, but with the hope of a reasonable return, should always buy the best examples available by the established names, in sectors where there is wide international interest. Dutch Old Masters fall into this category. In the main, the British (and a few Americans) buy paintings by British artists, which limits the possibilities of price expansion. Americans buy American; Latin Americans, Latin Americans; and so on. As a nation grows richer, so the prices of its best artists rise. American 19th century art, and the post-War New York abstract expressionists, have done well in recent years, with many artists breaking the Dollars 1m. barrier; and some, like Pollock, Jasper Johns, and de Kooning, topping Dollars 10m; although today their prices have almost halved. Latin American painters like Botero have also shot ahead. In the past two years, it is 20th century Chinese paintings, sought by the collectors in the increasingly affluent mainland and Hong Kong Chinese, that have set the market alight. But westerners would find it difficult to appreciate this oriental approach to art. The most sensible advice remains to buy what you like, but to try to like the best.

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TRUMP SHUTTLE' NAME ALREADY USED, FIRM SAYS  </P> <P> Donald J. Trump may have purchased Eastern Airlines' shuttle, but a Washington  company says it has the legal rights to the name "Trump Shuttle" and is  prepared to fight him in court for it.  </P> <P> A federal bankruptcy court last week approved the sale of Eastern's shuttle  service between New York, Washington and Boston to Trump for $365 million, and  Trump said he hoped to begin flights early next month as the Trump Shuttle.  </P> <P> But the International Trading &amp; Finance Corp. of Washington says it has  filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for rights to the name Trump  Shuttle for its division that provides transportation and storage for artwork  and other items sent to or from the United States.  </P> <P> ITFC President Michael Fracassi said the name comes from the company's slogan,  "Play your trump card -- use the Trump Shuttle."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Frivolous'  </P> <P> "My attorneys feel we have every right to use that name," Fracassi said in an  interview. "We're prepared to do battle with him (Trump)."  </P> <P> "We think this is frivolous," Bruce Nobles, president of Donald Trump's Trump  Shuttle, said in response to ITFC's claim. He said the Trump Shuttle was  incorporated last October by the Trump Organization.  </P> <P> Fracassi's attorneys wrote Nobles on May 26 stating that the use of the name  Trump Shuttle would infringe on ITFC's rights and would cause customer  confusion. ITFC has listed the Trump Shuttle in the Washington telephone  directory with its number and registered the name in New York State as its  service mark.  </P> <P> Nobles said he could not comment on the letter because he had not received it.  </P></p>

Global unemployment involves many structural problems, he  stressed at a regular news conference after a morning cabinet  meeting, but he acknowledged Japan is likely to be under fire at  the Detroit meeting for its stubborn current account surplus.    The ministerial meeting of seven industrialized powers is a  place for broad debate on dealing with unemployment, Fujii said.    He repeated that Japan is trying to boost domestic demand,  which would help curb the imbalance, expressing hope for "large  effects" from last month's 15 trillion yen economic stimulus  package. He also repeated that Japan is crafting measures to  further open its markets, promote new business and restructure  industry.    Asked if Japan could explain its views adequately without  the  finance minister present, Fujii said he thinks Labor Minister  Chikara Sakaguchi is "clearly" explaining the Japanese position  in Detroit.    Fujii said there are no bilateral meetings officially  scheduled at a meeting later this week of finance ministers from  members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, but that  he favors such exchanges.    Asked if he wants to meet separately with his U.S.  counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, Fujii said only that he favors  bilateral meetings with "several people."</p>

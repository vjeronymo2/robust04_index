			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips despite indicators THE DOLLAR ended weaker against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday after failing to draw strong support from favourable US economic figures, writes James Blitz. Figures for housing starts and industrial production both showed higher gains than expected. The May housing starts data revealed an 11 per cent rise to 1.23m units when around 1.17m had been expected. Industrial production rose 0.6 per cent in May against forecasts of a 0.5 per cent gain. After an early best level in Europe of DM1.5702, the dollar slipped to finish at DM1.5670, compared with a previous close of DM1.5710. It further declined in New York trading to end at DM1.5638. Although the figures showed that a steady but slow recovery was under way, traders were not able to shrug off underlying fears that the Federal Reserve might ease short-term rates again. An analyst in London commented: 'What the market wants is a definitive signal of where rates are heading and the data were far from that.' Others await today's 'beige book' report, summing up the views of the regional Fed presidents, before taking a new view on the currency. The dollar was not helped by the D-Mark's continued strong tone. The Bundesbank yesterday reiterated its determination to keep interest rates high as long as there is no indication that inflation has been brought under control. The central bank also revised its figure for April money supply growth upwards. On top of this, the German currency is certain to remain strong in the run-up to tomorrow's referendum in Ireland on the Maastricht Treaty. The D-Mark ended higher against sterling at DM2.9150 from a previous close of DM2.9180. The pound also slipped back to bottom of the European Monetary System grid. The German unit made fresh headway against the Italian lira, finishing at L757.1 from a previous L756.7. However, the D-Mark was unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.367. The yen closed stronger against both the dollar and the D-Mark following news that Japan's GNP rose to a real annualised 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year after a revised 0.3 per cent contraction in the last quarter of 1991. However, economists said the figure did not signal a real recovery yet. An analyst at a German bank said: 'The official spin being put on these numbers is that things look pretty good. But these numbers do not reveal the reality of the situation, which is that the (Japanese) economy is sliding into recession.' The market took a more bullish view of the data. The yen ended at Y126.6 to the dollar from Y126.7. In New York the dollar eased to Y126.45.</p>

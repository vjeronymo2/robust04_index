			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFRICAN NATIONALIST TAMBO SAID TO HAVE STROKE  </P> <P> Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress, has had a stroke and  has been flown to Britain for treatment, sources close to the movement said  Saturday.  </P> <P> The sources said the 71-year-old ANC leader had a stroke Wednesday in Lusaka  and was flown to Britain on Friday in a jet belonging to a British  multinational company. ANC spokesmen were not immediately available to give  details of Tambo's condition or where he was being treated.  </P> <P> Tambo was absent Thursday from a summit meeting in Lusaka of the presidents of  six southern African black countries and the leaders of the ANC, the main black  guerrilla group fighting the white government in South Africa.  </P> <P> ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo represented the movement at the meeting. Asked  to explain Tambo's absence, ANC spokesmen said then that he was on a holiday  and having a short rest.  </P> <P> As the leader of the ANC, Tambo is widely seen as a moderate, although he  firmly advocates armed struggle as part of the group's overall campaign to  eliminate apartheid.  </P> <P> In London, a spokesman for a British multinational company, Lonrho, confirmed  that a company jet flew Tambo, accompanied by a doctor and a nurse, to London.  </P> <P> "Our company jet was in Lusaka on another business mission and was coming back  to Europe. With a little rerouting, we were able to be of assistance to Oliver  Tambo," the spokesman said.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (5): A shadow of past glories - The tragic history of the Czech lands THE dissolution of Czechoslovakia, following the collapse of the Soviet Empire, essentially returns the map of central Europe to what it was before the defeat of the Czech nobility at the battle of White Mountain just outside Prague in 1620. From then until the collapse of the Habsburg Empire in 1918 the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia and the southern part of Silesia became part of the dynastic arrangements of western Europe. Its geographical location, rich iron, coal and other mineral resources combined with high skill levels to make the Czech lands the most industrially productive part of the Habsburg Empire and home to a rich culture formed from a fertile mixture of three strong influences - Germanic, Jewish and Czech. Slovakia, by contrast, rather like Italy as defined by Metternich, remained 'a geographical expression' dominated culturally and politically by Hungary for the best part of a millennium. It remained largely rural with the Slav-speaking Slovaks living mainly in country areas. Slovakia also had some exposure to Germanic Europe through the proximity of Bratislava to Vienna and Bratislava and Kosice in the east were centres of thriving Jewish as well as Hungarian communities. But to the north and east Slovakia is bounded by Slav Poland and Ukraine, while in the south 600,000 ethnic Hungarians still live in what used to be Hungary until the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. These cultural and historical differences were swept aside in the pan-slavic euphoria, fuelled by the romanticism of emigre Czech and Slovak communities in America, which led to the creation of a federal Czechoslovak state in 1919. But this union effectively brought the Czech lands into closer contact with the east than at any time in their history while giving Slovakia an equally new window on the west. For 20 years the Czechs helped finance the development of Slovakia, a bitter-sweet experience for many Slovaks who complained of a Czech superiority complex in their regard. When Hitler forcibly incorporated the Czech lands into the Reich he exterminated the Jewish community and imposed a clerical-fascist dictatorship on the nominally independent Slovak state which was shorn of its ethnic Hungarian areas. These reverted to Germany's wartime ally, Hungary for the duration. Physically both parts of reconstituted Czechoslovakia were spared much of the physical damage which war wreaked on most of the region. But 'liberation' by the Red Army in 1945 was followed by the communist coup d'etat of February 1948. After that the entire country was cut off from the west and re-orientated towards the east. The Nazi's extermination of the Jews was followed by communist persecution of ideological opponents of all kinds. Three waves of emigration in 1938, 1948 and again in 1968 after the Soviet invasion all impoverished the culture of Czechoslovakia and facilitated the deliberate destruction by the Stalinist regime of bourgeois democratic ways and the middle class which embodied them. The expulsion of 3m ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland after 1945 added to the tale of human misery which followed the failure of the western powers, led by Britain and France, to stand up to Hitler at Munich in 1938. Thanks to this tragic history the Czech lands have regained their sovereignty as a shadow of their former wealth and sophistication. But they are surrounded by the physical reminders of past glories, not only in the renaissance and baroque splendours of Prague and other cities and towns, but also in the art-deco buildings and high quality workers housing of the inter-war republic. At that time Czechoslovakia was highly integrated into the wider European economy with 30 per cent foreign participation in its industry and commerce. The last three years have seen a remarkable shift in trade back to these old markets in the west and a growing influx of foreign capital and the accompanying injection of technology, skills and managerial know-how. The assumption in Prague is that divorce from Slovakia will leave the Czech lands freer to pursue their goal of returning to their historic position in the mainstream of Europe as soon as possible.</p>

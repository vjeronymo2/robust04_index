Section 110(m) then requires that EPA ``*&blank;*&blank;* establish criteria for exercising (this) authority *&blank;*&blank;* to ensure that *&blank;*&blank;* such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible for such deficiency.'' The EPA believes this language strictly limits the required development of criteria to those necessary to determine if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. There is no requirement that the criteria must guide EPA's further decision of which area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' for the imposition of sanctions. At this time, EPA does not have experience with imposing these sanctions and, therefore, does not want to constrain the Agency in the exercise of this discretion. The variety of circumstances would make it difficult to develop criteria that would be applicable in every instance. As to the comments of the City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT that EPA needs to establish criteria for when it will impose sanctions under section 110(m), EPA does not believe that such criteria are mandated. The public will have an opportunity to comment on EPA's determination of the area on which it will impose sanctions and the timing of sanctions during each specific section 110(m) rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Selection and Design of Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this category, the commenters focused their particular concerns on the sanction criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OCTA suggests that the rule clarify that all five criteria are to be met, not merely used, by EPA to determine if a subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. The OCTA suggests the following language: ``Criteria. The EPA will use the following five criteria, all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA agrees with this comment but determined that language other than that suggested would be clearer. Therefore, EPA has revised &sect;52.30(d)(1) to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this action, EPA will consider a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five of the following criteria are met.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The New York DOT comments that the necessity for all five criteria to be met is overly strict and biased toward imposition of sanctions statewide, and it may be difficult to establish that all five have been met. Therefore, the New York DOT suggests that only a majority (three out of five) be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA believes all five criteria are needed to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible. The EPA sees no compelling reason to weaken this requirement. In addition, the failure to determine that one or more areas are principally responsible does not presuppose the imposition of statewide sanctions; the EPA must determine that the area sanctioned is the reasonable and appropriate area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The U.S. DOT requests clarification of what State actions are necessary to provide adequate legal authority under the proposed Criterion 1. Criterion 1 states that the State must provide adequate legal authority to a political subdivision to perform the required activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA does not believe that there is a single distinct definition of the term ``legal authority.'' What constitutes adequate legal authority may vary from State to State. This should be handled on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The New York DOT comments that under the proposed Criterion 2 [&sect;52.30(c)(2)], there must be a very clear agreement in the SIP or some other document as to which functions are to be performed by which agencies. For example, functions traditionally performed by local agencies may not be performed that way under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

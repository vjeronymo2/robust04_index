			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Trade deficit presages tough year for Indonesia THE Indonesian government posted a Rupiah 1,500bn (Pounds 426m) surplus in the state budget for the financial year which ended on Tuesday, Mr Johannes Sumarlin, finance minister, said. Bankers and donor economists warn, however, that an Dollars 83m (Pounds 48m) trade deficit in January indicates a tough year ahead for the economy. The 1991-92 budget figures, which are preliminary, put government revenue at Rp52,000bn, marginally above the Rp50,500bn target. Total government expenditure, the minister said, amounted to Rp50,490bn. Mr Sumarlin, speaking after the monthly cabinet meeting on the economy, said that income tax revenue of Rp9,600bn was 19.4 per cent higher than forecast, while revenue from value added tax was also above target. Import duty and export tax revenue was below target, partly because of a reduction in import tariffs, the minister said. Foreign aid flows for the fiscal year amounted to Rp10,400bn while oil and gas sector revenue of Rp15,000bn was as forecast, with oil production averaging 1.56m barrels a day. Mr Sumarlin noted, however, that figures for January showed a 37 per cent year-on-year decline in oil and gas receipts, whilst in the same month Indonesia recorded an overall trade deficit, with imports of Dollars 2.2bn and exports of Dollars 2.12bn. Although the January trade deficit was small, Indonesia needs to maintain a substantial trade surplus if it is to counter invisible outflows (such as interest payments on debt) estimated by bankers in Jakarta at more than Dollars 6bn last year. Despite the government's budget surplus, Indonesia had a current account deficit in 1991 of about Dollars 4.5bn. January's trade deficit was 'very unhealthy', according to one banker, and evidence that the economic downturn in western economies was hitting Indonesia's export-oriented industries. Economists at donor agencies warn of a tough financial year ahead, despite maintaining a forecast of 5.8 per cent real economic growth. They express concern at Indonesia's external debt which has increased from Dollars 65bn a year ago to Dollars 75bn. Of this, Dollars 50bn is in public debt, and Dollars 25bn in private debt, which has grown most rapidly in recent years. They note, however, that there is no public short-term debt, and the government remains committed to its debt obligations. The rise is also partly offset by an increase in Indonesia's foreign reserves from Dollars 6.3bn in March 1990 to Dollars 10bn last November. The government has acted to restrict further overseas borrowing by rescheduling many capital intensive projects. A further growth in exports is needed if the public debt service ratio, estimated by donor agencies at 31 per cent of export earnings and described by a senior economist as 'very high', is to be alleviated. The January trade deficit bolsters recent complaints by industrialists that Indonesia is losing its competitive edge in export markets. They blame the government's tight monetary policy, designed to limit domestic credit. The banks' prime lending rate is currently 25 per cent a year, and industrialists say the high cost of funds has left an increasing number of companies operating at a loss.  ----------------------------------------- INDONESIAN TRADE BALANCE (DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------                  Jan 92   Dec 91   Jan 91  ----------------------------------------- Exports         2,124.2  2,610.9  2,489.0 Oil/gas exports   728.4    780.9  1,101.0 Imports         2,206.8  2,377.9  1,845.0 Trade balance     -82.6    233.0    644.0  ----------------------------------------- Source: Reuter  -----------------------------------------</p>

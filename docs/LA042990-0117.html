			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIME DATA OFFERS HOPE FOR SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A STATE SURVEY SHOWS FEWER CASES OF DRUG-RELATED INCIDENTS AND  WEAPONS POSSESSION IN THREE WESTSIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAST YEAR.  </P> <P> Parents of children who attend school in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver  City may be able to breathe a little easier.  </P> <P> Drug use and weapons possession generally are on the decline in the Beverly  Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City school districts, according to a recent  crime survey released by the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> In the Culver City Unified School District, weapons-possession incidents  dropped nearly 60% in 1988-89 from the previous school year, according to the  report. In 1988-89, 11 guns, knives and other weapons were found in the  4,500-student district, compared to 26 the year before and 22 in 1985-86.  </P> <P> Fifteen weapons were reported among the 9,300 students in the Santa  Monica-Malibu Unified School District, compared to 24 in 1987-88.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills, with a student population of 4,700, had seven weapons-possession  incidents, two more than the previous year.  </P> <P> But in the Los Angeles Unified School District, reports of guns on or near  campuses rose by 8% to 274 in 1988-89, and over the last four years by a  whopping 271%, up from 75 in 1985-86. Reports of other weapons dipped 1% from  last year, but have jumped by 122% over the last four years.  </P> <P> School officials say they are unsure why Los Angeles and the smaller districts  are experiencing opposite trends in weapons incidents.  </P> <P> Drug use appears to be waning in schools statewide, officials said. Los Angeles  campuses had a 20% decline in 1988-89 from the previous year. Beverly Hills  schools reported four incidents in which drugs were involved, down from 15 the  year before. The Culver City and Santa Monica districts each had about an 80%  drop, to fewer than 10 cases.  </P> <P> "I wish I could tell you we did something specifically," said Nardy Samuels,  principal of Santa Monica High School, where drug use fell from 32 incidents to  five. "I think it's a trend nationwide, not just here." Or, he said, "kids are  either real slick in not getting caught, or they leave their drugs at home."  </P> <P> The crime figures, ordered by the state Legislature in 1984, are reported to  the state by individual school districts. The accuracy of the statistics has  been questioned by some education and law enforcement officials, who point to  discrepancies among schools in discipline and enforcement. Santa Monica High  School reported an increase in assaults, from 60 in 1987-'88 to 81 the next  year. But, Samuels said, that increase could have been due in part to the  turnover of four administrators during that period. "Maybe the system of  reporting was different," said Samuels, who became principal in the 1988-89  school year. Reported assaults in Culver City fell 16%, to 77 cases in the  1988-89 year. Beverly Hills had 26 assaults, four more than the previous year.  Assault is defined as everything from spontaneous shoving matches to  premeditated attacks.  </P> <P> In compiling the figures for all the categories, the districts only count cases  that lead to student suspensions.  </P> <P> "Duty cleaning up the yard or the cafeteria" or some other kind of punishment  would not show up, said Nancy Wolf, director of special pupil services for the  Beverly Hills district.  </P> <P> "Sometimes suspension is not the answer," but talking to the students is, says  Terry Pearson, director of pupil services for the Santa Monica-Malibu schools.  </P> <P> The state statistics may also be misleadingly low, Samuels said, because  law-breaking students are not always caught. The high school reported to the  state only four incidents of vandalism -- which Samuels said was graffiti --  but the school walls show otherwise.  </P> <P> "We have graffiti artists, mostly in the bathrooms, mostly the boys'. . . . But  we don't catch them," he said.  </P> <P> Likewise, two thefts and no burglaries were reported at the school, but Samuels  said in fact there had been more.  </P> <P> "Things happen very quickly, are not reported, identified, recognized. Kids try  to (hide), especially when they know someone's coming," he said. And, he said,  students don't like to snitch on their friends.  </P> <P> Statistics seem to indicate that each of the three Westside school districts  had a trademark crime in 1988-'89. Culver City reported 240 instances of  vandalism, a 50% increase from the year before, involving 76 students and  costing the district $22,333. Santa Monica-Malibu had eight cases of arson,  seven of which were fires set in garbage cans at the high school, Samuels said.  </P> <P> The state survey lists 21 sex offenses on Beverly Hills campuses, but Wolf said  that number was incorrect, blaming the discrepancy on a computer error. She  said there were actually four cases: three obscene telephone calls or indecent  exposures, and one instance in which a man approached a student sitting on the  school lawn, touched her shoe, and asked her to get into his car.  </P> <P> Incidents of campus crime overall dropped one-third in the Santa Monica-Malibu  district between 1988-89 and the prior year. It rose 3% in Culver City and 13%  in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> School crime in Los Angeles was down 16%, but statewide, it increased 5%.  </P></p>

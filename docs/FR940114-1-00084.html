			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the sentiment expressed at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional meetings and by the negotiators that conditions at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school immediately preceding its closing may cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterioration in the educational program that would cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student to withdraw. A student who withdraws under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances should be deemed to have been unable to complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her educational program because of the school's closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of considering the borrower eligible for loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge, and to balance the interests of the borrower and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> False Certification by a School of a Student's Eligibility To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Borrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants in the regional meetings and the negotiators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered a wide variety of different actions by the school or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower that they believed should be considered a false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of eligibility to borrow; these included virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every express or implied representation in any way related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL Program made by the student to the school, or by the school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the lender, guarantor, accrediting agency, state authority, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary. The Secretary has not adopted these views in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations, because the language of the statute itself  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its legislative history shows that the intended scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to discharge loan obligations is considerably narrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than these commenters suggest. The statute authorizes discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only if the school made a false ``certification of the student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility,'' a term used only in the FFEL Program regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where it refers, only to those representations made by the school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the loan application itself regarding the status of the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant (or the student for whom a parent wishes to obtain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PLUS loan) as an eligible student, 34 CFR 682.603; 682.201; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 668.7, and not to other written representations that relate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrower's request for a loan, the school's participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FFEL Program, or the quality of the school <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, or placement services. The legislative history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further explains that this provision was intended to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief where the student was ``left without the skills needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain employment'' because of the false certification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility. H. R. Rep. No. 447, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. 52 (1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of the relief proposed by the Secretary here is guided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by these two principles: that the false certification be that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the school on the loan application regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower's eligibility, and that the falsity of the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be directly related to the failure to provide necessary skills  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some negotiators urged that grounds for cancellation should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include such falsifications as forgery of the borrower's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signature on the loan application or on the loan disbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check. However, these representations are not part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of the ``certification of the student's eligibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrow.'' Moreover, as a practical matter, a borrower victimized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a forged loan application can be injured only if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower's endorsement is then forged on the loan disbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check, or the check is negotiated without the borrower's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endorsement at all. In either case, the borrower is generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not liable because such a loan is generally not legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable. Therefore, not only does forgery not constitute a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falsification in the loan ``certification'' process, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower who is the victim of a forgery and did not receive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeds of the loan already has a complete defense to repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the loan, and needs no cancellation relief under this new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other negotiation participants suggested that erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school representations on a loan application regarding such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matters as the borrower's (or student's) income, resources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family contribution, or recommended loan amount should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to constitute grounds for cancellation under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. This kind of error could result in the borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving a loan in a larger amount than he or she qualifies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive. However, that student may nevertheless receive quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training at the school, and this kind of error or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misrepresentation does not directly or invariably cause the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower to be ``left without the skills needed to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment.'' In addition, errors or misstatements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower's financial need frequently result in the borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving a loan either that only marginally exceeds the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which he or she actually qualified, or that qualified only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reinsurance but not for interest subsidies. Section 437(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directs the discharge of the ``borrower's liability on the loan''_language that does not suggest that a partial discharge was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplated or intended; discharging the borrower from financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation for the entire loan in such circumstances where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misstatement of financial need affects only part of the loan, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only the borrower's right to interest subsidies on all or part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that loan, is a remedy completely out of proportion to any injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suffered by the borrower as a result of the erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification of his or her financial need. For these reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary concludes that erroneous representations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower's financial need are not the kind of false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications for which section 437 was intended to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Work report of the Shandong Provincial CPC Discipline </F> Inspection Commission given to the Sixth Shandong Provincial CPC  Congress on 23 November]    [Excerpts] The following report on the work of the Shandong  Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission carried out in  the past five years is now given to the sixth provincial party  congress for its discussion.  <H5>  Major Work in the Past Five Years </H5>   Under the correct leadership of the provincial party  committee and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the  provincial discipline inspection commission and discipline  inspection commissions at all levels took Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress as  guidance, comprehensively implemented the party's basic line,  persistently regarded economic construction as the central task,  continued the explorations on new ways of doing discipline  inspection work to meet the needs of the new situation of reform  and opening up, strived to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the  party Constitution, conscientiously performed discipline  inspection functions, completed a great amount of work for  safeguarding party discipline, punishing corruption, improving  party style, and building a clean government, and made positive  contributions to the smooth progress of Shandong's economic  construction, reform, and opening up.    1. We made unremitting efforts in improving party style and  building a clean government and remain resolute in serving the  basic line.    It has always been the guiding thought for discipline  inspection organs to improve party style, build a clean  government, and ensure implementation of the party's basic line  with the focus firmly placed on economic construction, the  central task. In the past few years, discipline inspection  commissions at all levels persistently emancipated the mind,  sought truth from facts, and coordinated discipline inspection  work closely with reform, opening up, economic development, and  the endeavor of safeguarding stability and unity in line with  the requirements of the provincial party committee and the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission. To counter the  conspicuous contradictions in inner-party life and economic  activities, we studied and adopted preventive measures from the  perspective of safeguarding party regulations and party laws and  improving party style, conscientiously solved budding problems  and tendencies, strived to ensure social and political  stability, and provided a good environment for developing the  economy and establishing the socialist market economy system.    Proceeding from maintaining close party-populace ties and  boosting the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for reform and  construction, we made efforts to promote party style and build a  clean government. While concentrating efforts on economic  construction, the fifth provincial party committee regarded the  endeavor to punish corruption and advocate honesty as a major  task. In early 1989, it held an on-the-spot meeting in Changle  on "persisting in the party's purpose and maintaining honesty in  administration," which was participated in by city, prefectural,  and county major responsible persons. The meeting summarized  and disseminated the experiences in making administrative work  public and promoting honesty in party and government organs and  put forward new requirements for the province on improving party  style and building a clean government. Discipline inspection  commissions at all levels made active efforts to help party  committees in promoting honesty and diligence in administration,  establishing systems for maintaining honesty, and strengthening  the supervision by the masses. They popularized such systems as  "making work procedures and work results public for the scrutiny  of the masses" and "appraising governments' functional  departments," thus gradually systematizing the endeavors to  improve party style and build a clean government.    We strictly enforced the party's political discipline to  safeguard social stability. In 1989 when there was a political  storm in the country and the international situation was  abruptly changing, discipline inspection commissions at all  levels and the vast number of discipline inspection cadres took  a firm and clear-cut stand and resolutely implemented the  instructions of the central authorities and the provincial party  committee, displaying their firm party spirit and organizational  discipline. The provincial discipline inspection commission  issued a timely circular to state party discipline. Discipline  inspection commissions at all levels also put forward demands  and coordinated with pertinent departments to conduct  examinations. They played an important role in defending party  discipline, consolidating, and developing the stable and united  political situation, and ensuring unity of party organizations  and party-member cadres with the party Central Committee.  [passage omitted]    2. We made particular efforts to investigate and handle  discipline breaches and strictly enforced party discipline.    Adhering to the principle of managing the party strictly,  discipline inspection commissions at all levels "made particular  efforts to investigate and handle discipline breaches within the  party and comprehensively perform the discipline inspection  function." Starting with discipline enforcement and handling of  cases to achieve breakthroughs in opposing corruption, we  particularly investigated and handled serious violation of  political discipline, such economic cases as embezzlement and  bribery, abuse of power for selfish gains, bureaucracy, cases on  dereliction of duty, smuggling, sale of smuggled goods, and  violation of socialist morality and eliminated a number of  corrupt elements. In the past five years, we investigated and  handled 92,105 discipline breaches within the party and punished  77,112 party members, of whom 12,891 were expelled from the  party, 21,453 were placed on probation, and 2.156 were dismissed  from party posts. Among the punished party members, 445 were  cadres at the county and section level, and 24 were cadres at  the departmental and bureau level. By investigating and  handling these cases, we strictly enforced party discipline,  educated party-member cadres, and purified party organizations.  [passage omitted]    3. We launched special improvement endeavor to correct  unhealthy trends.    Based on reality and by doing practical work, we followed  party leadership and coordinated with pertinent departments to  tackle and correct the unhealthy trends that seriously affected  economic construction, reform, and opening up that interfered  with the implementation of party principles and policies and of  which the masses were most dissatisfied with. We carried out  this work by concentrating efforts on tackling one or two  unhealthy trends at a time. In the past five years, we dealt  with the party and government cadres who violated laws and  discipline in housing construction, recovered more than 20  million illicit funds, meted out economic sanctions on 13,000  persons, and punished 258 persons according to disciplinary  actions. We made conscientious efforts to correct the unhealthy  trends in some trades. Focusing on 11 trades, such as public  security, industry and commerce, and public health, we conducted  education to straighten out problems. We investigated and  handled 2,050 cases on abuse of power for selfish gains; put an  end to some unwarranted pooling of funds, wanton requisition of  donations, and exaction of fees to reduce the financial burden  totaling 780 million yuan on enterprises and peasants;  straightened out rural chaotic financial management, clarified  360 million yuan of debts receivable and debts payable, and  returned 130 million yuan; examined and collected 169 million  yuan of public funds owed by 115,000 staff members and workers;  and corrected the mistake of 46 departments that violated  regulations to provide clothes to their staff members and  workers. We also examined and straightened out the use of  personnel, financial, and material resources of enterprises  without compensation, use of public funds for the education of  one's children, and lavish wining and dining with public  expenses. Based on their own characteristics, discipline  inspection commissions at all levels also persistently  coordinated the effort to check unhealthy trends with that to  straighten out discipline and coordinated ideological education  with improvement of systems to continuously consolidate and  expand the achievements in checking unhealthy trends.    4. We strengthened supervision and inspection to ensure the  smooth implementation of government orders.    Focusing on ensuring reform and opening up and facilitating  the establishment of the socialist market economy system,  discipline inspection commissions at all levels strengthened  supervision and inspection of the implementation of the party's  line, principles, and policies, state laws and regulations, and  major reform measures, and strived to solve the problems that  "orders and prohibitions were not carried out." [passage  omitted]    In view of the problems discovered during the supervision  and  inspection, we held several theoretical symposiums to formulate  policy standards to meet actual needs. In the past few years,  the provincial discipline inspection commission formulated 10  policies to support and protect reform, five requirements to  improve party style and build a clean government, 14 opinions to  promote enforcement of the "regulations," and 10 regulations to  maintain the honesty of party and government organs. All of  them were approved and transmitted by the provincial party  committee and government in a timely manner, which not only  helped standardize the activities of party-member cadres but  also provided a policy base for the supervision and inspection  and for strict enforcement of discipline.    5. We successfully conducted education on party style and  party discipline based on reality.    In line with the requirement put forward by the provincial  discipline inspection commission for "paying attention to both  handling of cases and education," discipline inspection  commissions at all levels conscientiously implemented the  principle of "putting education and prevention first" and  adopted effective measures to intensify the education on party  style and party discipline to address the problems in party  member's thinking about reform, opening up, and development of  the socialist market economy. They coordinated with pertinent  departments to launch one large education activity every year.  They conducted the education for party members throughout the  province to "study party Constitution and correct party style,"  "study party regulations and laws," "oppose corruption and  prevent degeneration," and "study party Constitution, stress  dedication, and be qualified party members." More than 90 of  the party members received the education. [passage omitted]    6. We improved the contingent of discipline inspection  workers with the spirit of reform.    Party committees and discipline inspection commissions at  all  levels attached great importance to improving the contingent of  discipline inspection workers. They organized the vast number  of discipline inspection cadres to conscientiously study Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the market economy, and modern scientific and  technological knowledge. On-the-job study and special training  enabled the cadres to continuously improve their political  quality and professional competence. Meanwhile, in line with  the "four requirements" on cadres, we selected a number of  cadres in the prime of life who have both political integrity  and ability to replenish the leading bodies of discipline  inspection commissions. In line with the requirements of the  party Central Committee and the provincial party committee, we  changed the sections of discipline inspection organs into  offices and provided cadres according to regulations. We  conducted exchange of discipline inspection cadres in a planned  manner to invigorate the contingent. We established and  improved the discipline inspection organizations in enterprises,  institutions, towns, and townships. We launched provincewide  activities to "learn from, emulate, and surpass the advanced and  vie to be loyal guards of the party" to promote the  self-improvement of the discipline inspection contingent. The  vast number of discipline inspection cadres adhered to  principles, advanced despite difficulties, remained honest in  performing duties, worked hard, displayed good morality and  brand-new mental outlook, and created a large number of advanced  examples. Fifteen persons of the province were named as  national outstanding discipline inspection cadres, and two  discipline inspection commissions (group) were named as national  advanced discipline inspection organizations. The provincial  discipline inspection commission commended 48 advanced  discipline inspection organizations and 250 outstanding  discipline inspection cadres.    In line with the decision of the party Central Committee and  the State Council on merging the offices of discipline  inspection and supervision organs, the provincial discipline  inspection and supervision organs began to do so in March this  year and completed this work in three months. This work  represented a major reform of the supervision system of the  party and government. It helped strengthen the discipline  inspection and supervision functions under unified party  leadership, helped the government strengthen leadership over  supervision work, helped avoid overlapping of work, and helped  streamline organs and personnel. All discipline inspection  organs carried out this work in a steady and discreet manner,  thus achieving unity and pooling efforts. Working in the same  office, discipline inspection organs and supervision organs  became one organ which performed two functions. In this way,  they raised work quality and efficiency and strengthened both  the discipline inspection and the supervision functions.    Thanks to the concerted efforts of party organizations at  all  levels and the vast number of party members in the province,  notable results were achieved in the party's discipline  inspection work and in improving party style and building a  clean government in the past five years. Most party members and  cadres were honest in performing duties, and the main aspects of  party style were good. However, we should also remain  clear-headed to note the large number of negative and corrupt  phenomena and the very arduous tasks to oppose corruption. Some  party organizations and leading cadres with party membership  lacked an understanding of the necessity and urgency of the  anticorruption struggle and failed to properly handle the  relationship between the endeavor of opposing corruption and  advocating honesty and the endeavor of economic development,  reform, and opening up. Discipline enforcement was not strict  enough in some areas. Some leading cadres with party membership  had a weak sense of organization and discipline and failed to  act as an example. On the part of the provincial discipline  inspection commission, its concepts, work methods, and  leadership style were incompatible with the needs of the new  situation and new tasks; and it failed to work in a creative  manner and provide effective guidance and assistance to  lower-level discipline inspection commissions. We should solve  these problems when carrying out in the future. [passage  omitted]</p>

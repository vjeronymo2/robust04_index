			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Turkey to accelerate privatisation plans TURKEY is to speed up its privatisation programme with an ambitious target to raise revenues to TL25,000bn (Pounds 1.86bn) in 1993, more than five times the sum realised in 1992, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's ambitious sales target was unveiled together with a radical shake-up of the agency handling the sale of state assets to the public. The government is relying on the privatisation programme to close the public sector deficit, which in 1992 was 12 per cent of GNP. In 1992 Turkey's Public Participation Administration earned TL4,300bn through the sale of six cement companies and minority stakes in a number of smaller, privately managed enterprises. However, it has not addressed the problem of the main loss-making state corporations, which are unlikely to receive such a positive response from buyers.</p>

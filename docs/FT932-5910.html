			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Contrary positions on energy expectations Sir, The announcement by the World Bank at the Financial Times' Asian Electricity conference ('Asia energy needs double', May 25) that it expects Asia's energy consumption to double during this decade - with Dollars 500bn being spent on new power generating capacity - coincides with your 'Power Generation Equipment' supplement of May 25. That supplement predicted a positive orgy for the power plant construction industry, forecasting vast increases in construction around the world. To quote at random: 'Power capacity additions in Asia are running at triple the rate seen in the 1970s. China and Hong Kong will be adding 12-15 GW of new power capacity every year for the rest of this decade - the equivalent of Switzerland's entire installed power capacity.' It is now precisely one year since the leaders of 150 nations gathered in Rio for the Earth Summit. Each leader solemnly signed a commitment to seek to stabilise the earth's climate, by ensuring a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from energy consumption. Many of those leaders came from precisely the same countries where such enormous growth in energy demand is now being forecast so blithely. It is not entirely clear to me how it is possible to endorse both positions. Perhaps someone at the World Bank might care to try?

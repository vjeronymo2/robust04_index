			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As a RIA correspondent was told at the CIS  headquarters, the meeting of CIS ministers of internal affairs  which was due to tackle questions of creating a single  coordinating body to combat organized crime has been put off  from 1 to 16 February and it will take place not in Minsk, but  in Ashgabat. One of the reasons for the transfer is the absence  of a minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Belarus,  who was removed from his post by decision of the Supreme Soviet  on 25 January because of the Lithuanian incident.</p>

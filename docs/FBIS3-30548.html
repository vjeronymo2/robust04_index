			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- The Serb side has strong  reasons for doubting the objectivity and veracity of the  official report on the latest civilian deaths caused by a mortar  exlosion at a crowded Sarajevo market on Saturday, the Bosnian  Serb Army commander, Major General Manojlo Milovanovic, told  TANJUG on Sunday [6 February]. This comes after the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) had `unfoundedly and  unsubstantiatedly blamed the Serb side, without coming up with  any material evidence,' for Friday's mortar attack which killed  nine people in a food queue in Sarajevo's Dobrinja suburb, Gen.  Milovanovic said.    In order to prevent similar moves, the Serb side on Saturday  proposed that a joint committee, made up of military experts of  the UNPROFOR, the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, visits the scene of  the attack together with the military commanders of the Bosnian  Serbs, Muslims and the UNPROFOR. The Muslims immediately  refused to allow its experts to go to the scene of the explosion  as did UNPROFOR chief-of-staff for Bosnia, General Angus Ramsey,  although he had first accepted this proposal, Gen. Milovanovic  said.    According to him, all this gives much reason to the Serb  side  to doubt the objectivity and truthfullness of the report on the  blast at the Sarajevo market which killed 66 people and wounded  close to 200. Gen. Milovanovic recalled that at the eve of all  previous major peace talks, the Muslims had orchestrated even  the killings of civilians in order to blame the Serbs for  everything and cause the internationalization of the war.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Cost of support for E Germany badly misjudged says president GERMANY'S President Richard von Weizsacker warned last night that the cost and duration of support for east Germany had been seriously underestimated. He warned west Germans against deceiving themselves that genuine unification of the country could be achieved without sacrifices. It was wrong to insist that a recovery in the east should only be financed if it meant no decline in western living standards. President von Weizsacker's speech, at the annual Leipzig spring fair, is his most open criticism to date of the insistent optimism of his former colleague, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the German coalition government. He has leapt into the heart of the sensitive political debate on the costs of unification, and poured cold water on Mr Kohl's repeated insistence that recovery in the east could come within three years. 'All too many people have underestimated the severity and duration of the transformation process, as they have the extent and duration of the necessary financial transfers from west to east. 'It was self-deception to believe that the economic and social unification could be paid for from the increase in economic growth, and that it would not demand significant sacrifices from the people in the west.'</p>

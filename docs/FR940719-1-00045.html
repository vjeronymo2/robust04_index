			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;75.360(b)(3) would require a preshift examination to be made for sections capable of producing coal by energizing equipment on the section. MSHA estimates that this would affect some mines and take up to an additional hour per examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (f) would require that a record of the results of each preshift examination, including a record of hazardous conditions and their locations found by the examiner during each examination and of the results and locations of air and methane measurements, be made in a book provided for that purpose on the surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record would be made by either the certified person who made the examination or by a person designated by the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the record is made by someone other than the examiner, the examiner would be required to verify the record by initials and date. A record would also be made by a certified person of the action taken to correct hazardous conditions found during the preshift examination. The records would be countersigned by the mine foreman, and by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. MSHA estimates that it would take about 2 minutes for the mine superintendent to countersign the records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total estimated recordkeeping burden and the extended examination time for all affected mines would be 60,987 hours of which large mines would incur 56,015 hours and small mines would incur 4,972 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;75.362(a)(1) would expand the on-shift examination to include sections where anyone is assigned to work during the shift, such as those sections where maintenance work is performed. In addition, proposed paragraph (a)(2) would add a new requirement for on-shift examinations to be conducted to assure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters specified in mine ventilation plans. MSHA estimates that these provisions will expand on-shift examinations by up to 45 minutes. MSHA estimates that the total burden hours related to expanding the on-shift examination would be 111,434, of which small mines would incur 18,007 hours and large mines would incur 93,427 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;75.363 would require that any hazardous conditions discovered be posted, corrected immediately, and recorded. Proposed paragraph (a) would require a conspicuous danger sign to be posted at any area where hazardous conditions are found. The hazardous condition would have to be corrected immediately and only persons designated by the operator to correct or evaluate the condition would be allowed to enter a posted area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b) would require that a record including a description and location of the hazardous condition and the corrective action taken be kept in a book maintained on the surface at the mine. The record would be made by the completion of the shift on which the hazardous condition is found. This record would not be required for shifts when no hazardous conditions are found or for hazardous conditions found during the preshift or weekly examinations because these examinations have separate recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (c) would require that the record be made by either the certified person or by a person designated by the operator. If the record is made by a person designated by the operator, the certified person would be required to verify the record by initials and date by or at the end of the shift for which the examination was made. The record would be countersigned by the mine foreman and by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (d) would require that the record be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year and be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the existing rule, the recordkeeping requirement for on-shift examinations was included in paragraph (g) of &sect;75.362 and the requirement for retention was in paragraph (h). Under the proposal, paragraphs (g) and (h) are removed from &sect;75.362 and transferred to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;75.363. As the requirement would remain the same, there would be no change in the paperwork burden associated with the recordkeeping for on-shift examinations. However, this recordkeeping requirement would be new for hazardous conditions found during supplemental examinations and at times when an on-shift examination would not be required. This recordkeeping requirement would also be new for hazardous conditions found during the examination following a main mine fan stoppage of 15 minutes or longer (75.313).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA estimates that a record of hazardous conditions found during supplemental examinations would be made about 24 times a year at each large mine and about 4 times a year at each small mine. MSHA further estimates that it would take about 5 minutes to complete a record and an additional 7 minutes for the certified person to initial and the mine foreman and mine superintendent to countersign the record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines would be 4,092 hours, of which large mines would incur 3,514 hours and small mines would incur 578 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, MSHA estimates that a record of hazardous conditions found during an examination following a main mine fan stoppage of 15 minutes or longer would be made about 100 times a year at large mines and 100 times a year at small mines. MSHA further estimates that it would take about 5 minutes to complete a record and an additional 4 minutes for the mine foreman and mine superintendent to countersign the record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines would be 28 hours, of which large mines would incur 14 hours and small mines would incur 14 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;75.364(b) would require an examination for hazardous conditions and for noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition to be made weekly by a certified person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

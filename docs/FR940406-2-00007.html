			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Assure that Adequate Risk is Borne by the Commercial Insurance Industry <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendments to the Act in 1990 directed FCIC to assure that adequate risk is borne by the commercial insurance companies reinsured by FCIC, consistent with their ability to bear risk and the availability of commercial reinsurance. For the 1992 reinsurance year (a 12 month period that began on July 1, 1991 and ended on June 30, 1992), FCIC substantially modified its Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with the commercial insurers which participate in the program. Both the amount and the probability of losses on the part of the commercial insurers were increased in this agreement. Additional incremental changes in the amount of potential gains and losses were made for both the 1993 and 1994 SRA's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GAO suggests in a report entitled Crop Insurance Program Has Not Fostered Significant Risk Sharing by Insurance Companies (GAO/RCED 92&hyph;25, January 13, 1992) that the changes in the 1992 SRA are not significant enough in the area of risk bearing by the commercial insurance companies. Still, the 1992 SRA fundamentally changed the manner in which gains and losses are calculated, a subtle but effective measure to increase risk. The amount of potential loss increased, but the change in the formula increased the chances that the company would lose in years of poor experience. As a comparison, the commercial industry lost approximately $8 million in 1988 when the crop insurance program sustained a loss ratio of 2.45 primarily due to drought in the Midwest. If that experience is restated to the larger 1993 premium amounts, the loss still would have amounted to only about $10&hyph;$15 million. Results from the 1993 crop year are not yet complete, but current estimates indicate that commercial insurers will sustain losses of $80&hyph;$85 million although the loss ratio will be less than in 1988. The difference is caused by the SRA changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some will argue that industry-wide losses of $80&hyph;$85 million are not significant compared to overall program losses that may be near $900 million in 1993. Two factors bear on this issue: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The ability of the insurance companies to earn reserves under the SRA, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The effect of losses upon an insurance company's operations in future years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commercial industry can bear a greater share of the losses only if there is corresponding opportunity to achieve comparable earnings in favorable years. Over the long term, the industry must achieve a satisfactory rate of return on invested capital, or it would make economic sense for participants to invest in other endeavors. The SRA must allow adequate opportunity to earn this satisfactory rate of return. It also must permit accumulation of reserves to pay losses in years that disasters strike. Under the present SRA and the conditions of actuarial soundness of the program, there is no opportunity to accumulate the reserves needed to bear a large portion of a $900 million loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Losses directly impact the capital structure of the companies. An insurance company leverages its capital (the term ``surplus'' is used by the industry) to support the volume of business that it writes. As a general rule, an insurance company is permitted by regulators to bear the risk associated with $2 to $3 of premium per $1 of surplus. The ratio of premiums to surplus may be lower for risky lines of insurance such as multiple peril crop insurance. Thus, whenever an insurance company loses a portion of its capital, its ability to accept premiums in future years is reduced by a greater amount, which in turn reduces its ability to earn profits and reserves. These factors must be considered when the ability of the industry to bear risk is evaluated, as is mandated by the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As appropriate, given the factors discussed above, FCIC will evaluate (1) the need to increase risk sharing with the commercial insurance industry as the program achieves greater actuarial soundness, (2) reducing cessions to the assigned risk fund by requiring the industry to share in losses for loss ratios that exceed 5.00, (3) changing the stop loss provisions of the SRA, and (4) recruiting additional commercial insurers to participate in the crop insurance business. These changes will be made incrementally beginning with the 1995 SRA that takes effect on July 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Improve Loss Adjustment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any actuarial and underwriting system can be affected by errors in adjustment of losses. These errors include both overpayment and underpayment of claims. Underpayment would not seem to be a factor influencing actuarial soundness, but failure to pay a loss when due will cause insured persons to question the value of the insurance and potentially reduce participation. The insurance experience also will not accurately depict the nature of the risk insured, leading to inaccuracies in future premium rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some problems in loss adjustment are directly related to deficiencies in underwriting. For example, if the crop insurance policy is not clear on a particular point, the loss adjuster may find it necessary to make a determination in favor of the insured person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCIC will undertake the following initiatives to assure high quality of loss adjustment determinations so that results are fair to insured persons and taxpayers: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

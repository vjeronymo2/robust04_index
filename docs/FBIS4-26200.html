			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State To Issue Price Guide To Curb </F> Inflation]    [Text] The government will provide price-range guidelines  to curb inflation and crack down on illegal profiteering by  businesses charging exorbitant rates for their goods or services.    The guidelines will be interpreted and turned into  regulations by local authorities.    The aim is to prevent the violation of business ethics and  disorder on the market, according to the State Planning  Commission.    Excessive profits do not reflect the true relation between  supply and demand, he said.    There is not yet enough competition to guarantee proper  pricing and the commission is drafting a document designed to  help create a fair market and protect consumers in the meantime,  said Hong Feng, vice-director of the Department of Market and  Price with the commission.    The department is currently working on the document which  will be approved and issued by the State Council in the form of  a decree.    But the decree will not set the prices of all commodities,  said Hong.    The government will see to it that profits obtained by  businesses do not exceed "a reasonable range based on average  social cost of manufactured goods or services, he said. [no  ending quotation mark as received]    It was up to the localities to work out specific regulations  to decide what that range should be in the light of local  conditions.    Shanghai spearheaded this mission in April by issuing "the  Temporary Code against Price Cheating and Excessive Profits,"  which is believed to have informed the drafting of the national  decree.    Hong admitted that it is difficult to define what was  "illegal profiteering" because it could not be decided simply by  fixing specific profit margins.    High-profits alone do not indicate profiteering, he said.    If high-profits are obtained by reducing production costs  and  introducing new technical methods, it would be normal and should  be encouraged, he said.    Profit margins must be in line with general price standards  and the balance between supply and demand in any given commodity  market, the vice-director noted.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / London council in corruption probe Police are investigating allegations of corruption at Brent Council in north-west London. Three men were arrested in connection with the sale of former Brent Council properties on March 17 by the public-sector corruption unit of the Metropolitan Fraud Squad. The men were not charged but bailed to return in three months. Police would not name them but a spokesman for Brent's Labour group said that they included Mr Ahmad Shahzad, a Labour councillor. One of the main properties involved is Anson Hall in Willesden, Brent, which is now owned by the Dar Al-Islam Foundation. This property was sold by the council in early 1992 to Merpark, a company registered in the Isle of Man. In September 1992 Merpark sold it to the Dar Al-Islam Foundation for Pounds 375,000. Merpark began as a Manx shelf company in 1990 and was not activated until sold to its present owners in 1991. Its shares are in the form of bearer warrants. The company is owned by whoever holds the bearer warrant - a system that provides anonymity. Although the deeds of sale to the Dar Al-Islam Foundation were correctly signed by one of Merpark's two Manx directors, the deeds of purchase by Merpark from the council apparently were not. The only people authorised to sign the deeds were any two of the company's two directors and the company secretary at the time. Neither director saw or signed the purchase deeds.</p>

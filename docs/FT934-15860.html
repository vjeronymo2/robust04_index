			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Estate agents warn on recovery RECOVERY in the housing market remains on a knife-edge, estate agents warned yesterday. They urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to do nothing in his Budget next month which would jeopardise an upturn. Mr David Goldsworthy, president of the National Association of Estate Agents, said that any plans to cut mortgage tax relief over the short term could have a devastating effect on buyers' confidence. The association's monthly survey of market trends showed London and East Anglia had fared best last month, with 40 per cent of agents reporting increased business, followed by Wales and south-east England. The national average was 22 per cent. Barry Riley, Weekend Page I</p>

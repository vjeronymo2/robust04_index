			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Thai bank plans Dollars 400m Euro-convertible issue Thai Farmers Bank is to raise Dollars 400m with Euro-convertible debentures to help fund its long-term growth plans. The move comes in spite of fears that a rush of recent issues may have temporarily saturated the market. The bank's executive chairman, Mr Banyong Lamsam, said there was still enough demand from foreign and local investors to take up the issue. He said the market's appetite for convertible debentures with a 10-year maturity, non-convertible debentures or warrants, or a mixture would dictate the nature of the offer. Thai companies raised Dollars 1.4bn through Euroconvertibles in 1993, following an easing in Thai financial regulations. However, the dubious quality of some issues, the stalling of the local stock market, and the increase in global interest rates may have taken much of the wind out of this particular fund-raising channel.</p>

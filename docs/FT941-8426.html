			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Rate cuts undermine Sterling's rise - At a glance Sterling's rise from a low of DM2.43 in mid-October to a high of DM2.6250 in mid-January was driven by a gathering consensus that the UK was enjoying an economic recovery. The trigger for the recent correction was the 25 basis points cut in UK interest rates announced last week. The move was not well received in the market, which queried the economic justification and worried about possible political motivation. The Bundesbank's half-point cut in its discount lending rate on Thursday, has not helped sterling. The market appears to take the view that UK rate cuts are more likely in the short term than German cuts.</p>

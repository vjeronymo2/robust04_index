			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: VAT would hit UK printers Sir, A better reason than possible poor publicity for the chancellor to refrain from imposing VAT on books, magazines and newspapers is the ease with which such a tax could be avoided. No VAT is levied on imported postal packets with a value of up to Pounds 15  -a sum in excess of the price of single copies of most magazines and many books. Publishers and book clubs may, therefore, legitimately supply their UK customers with VAT-free publications by collecting subscriptions and mailing from outside the European Union. The practice would be cost-efficient only were the printing to be done outside the EU too. If the present chancellor accepts former chancellor, Nigel Lawson's, advice he will inflict severe damage on the printing industry, not to mention newsagents and bookshops, and fail to collect the revenue he expects. John Arnold, director of corporate and policy affairs, British Printing Industries Federation, 11 Bedford Row, London WC1R 4DX</p>

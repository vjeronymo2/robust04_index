			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK TAKES STEP FOR GROWTH CONTROL  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council has voted to adopt new design standards for apartment  and condominium buildings despite protests from residents and developers.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 late Tuesday to tentatively approve the design  standards recommended by the city Planning Department. Council members Mary Lou  Howard and Tim Murphy cast the dissenting votes, saying the council should take  more time to evaluate the proposed requirements.  </P> <P> The council is expected to take a final vote at its meeting next Tuesday.  </P> <P> Measure One, a controlled-growth ordinance passed by voters in February, calls  for the council to establish design standards to force developers to reduce the  size of large residential buildings and make them more compatible with their  surroundings.  </P> <P> But many residents complained that the proposed standards will not protect  their single-family neighborhoods, which they say are besieged by traffic,  pollution and noise from development.  </P> <P> "We're not getting what we voted for," said Raymond Lambert, 62, a member of  the Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "They're making this a developer's paradise."  </P> <P> Some of the design standards include limiting the height of new apartment  buildings to 23 feet if they adjoin single-family neighborhoods. The same  buildings would have to be set back the same distance from the street as the  adjacent houses; construction would be limited to 60% of a lot's area, and at  least 25% of a lot would have to be landscaped.  </P> <P> Lambert and several other members of the Burbank homeowners' group said the  council should limit the number of building permits issued. They said the city  also should tighten controls on commercial and industrial development, which  are not addressed in Measure One.  </P> <P> Some developers argued that the standards are too stringent and will cause  rents to skyrocket and property values to drop.  </P> <P> Councilman Thomas E. Flavin, however, defended the design standards.  </P> <P> "I don't think people who voted for Measure One wanted to put a stop to all  residential development," Flavin said. "I think they wanted fewer projects and  less density. I think these design standards are the first step in that  process."  </P></p>

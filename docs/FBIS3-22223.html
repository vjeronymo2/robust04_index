Skillius said that 103 states have already prohibited  importing dangerous waste, among others Hungary, Poland,  Lithuania and Latvia.    Head of Estonian Green Movement Baltic Sea Bureau Valdur  Lahtvee said that as Estonia has no such law, problems with  dangerous waste being imported with uncertain aims have already  risen, quoting an incident two years ago when Asian Trade Gmbh  and its Estonian partner United Products imported great numbers  of used tyres which for an unclear reason caught fire. He also  said that at present a cooperation project with Finnish Kemira  to produce water purification coagulate was under way, in the  course of which dangerous titanium oxyde waste is to be imported.</p>

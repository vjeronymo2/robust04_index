			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Noskov: "Elections '94: A Billion and a </F> Half Split Three Ways"; commentary by Valentin Loginov]    [Text] Ancient and once tranquil Nizhniy Novgorod was quite  unlike itself in February and March -- all because of the  mayoral election campaign.    At first everything seemed to go "according to plan." The  other candidates for mayor besides incumbent D. Bednyakov were  two of the city's well-known individuals, Ye. Krestyaninov and  O. Maslov. True, the latter dropped out during the registration  period "due to an insufficient number of voter signatures for  nomination."    However, the two remaining candidates have waged such a  campaign that the citizens of Nizhniy Novgorod have begun  following it just like they do events on the shows "Santa  Barbara" and "Simply Maria." The election campaign gets daily  coverage on the two local television channels.    The two candidates were allies until just recently. Together  with the governor they discussed and decided all the key issues  in the life of Nizhniy Novgorod's citizens. But then at some  point (exactly when remains a mystery to a majority of the  city's population to this day) their relations went sour. Worse  yet, B. Nemtsov, abusing his official position and violating his  own "democratic principles," set out to "dump" Dmitriy  Bednyakov, his former protege. Now he likes Ye. Krestyaninov  better. Nor did the governor make any secret of his sympathies.  Higher-level authorities pointed out to B. Nemtsov that he was  in violation of legislation when he campaigned in favor of  Yevgeniy Krestyaninov. Supposedly the governor should remain  neutral in election campaigns.    However, last Friday evening, just two days before the  election, in a speech broadcast on local television the governor  gave the people a de facto ultimatum: do not elect  Krestyaninov, or bad things would happen to the city. That same  evening Bednyakov stated on a different television channel that  under pressure from the governor he had been forced to withdraw  the "city charter" from a referendum which was supposed to take  place simultaneously with the mayoral election. He also issued  an invitation to independent observers to oversee the election.    The next thing that happened was completely unexpected. At  around midnight Yevgeniy Krestyaninov showed up at the  television studio and announced that he was withdrawing his  candidacy. And under the election statute that could mean only  one thing: no mayoral election could be held.    The next day, on Saturday, people waited to hear local radio  and television reports announcing that the governor and the two  candidates had come to some sort of agreement. Yet nothing  changed. The result is that the election was not held.  Approximately a billion and a half rubles of budget funds had  been spent for nothing. And that despite loud talk --broadcast  around the world -- of "new democratic principles in local  government..."  <H5>  Our Commentary </H5>   Never before have the people of Russia seemed so passive  with  regard to their voting rights as in the course of elections to  local representative bodies that began late last year. Voter  turnout hit a "record" low at about one-third of eligible  voters. Yet there were seemingly innumerable okrugs, rayons and  cities where the numerous candidates for deputies' seats were  not able to get even 25 percent of voters to turn out on their  first attempt. As you will recall, that kind of "massive"  turnout is now sufficient to constitute a legal election.    Last Sunday elections were held in approximately 30 regions.  This does not include areas where a runoff election was  scheduled. The final results of this latest stage in the  sluggish campaign, enlivened only by scandalous events of the  sort that occurred in Nizhniy Novgorod, may become available in  a day or two or, most likely, at the end of the week. But  judging by fragmentary preliminary information received from a  number of regions, the voters were once again none too eager to  perform their civic duty. For example, nine districts in Nizhniy  Novgorod will have to hold runoff elections for local Duma  seats. In Ryazan only one candidate for deputy out of 14 was  elected, and in Novgorod no Duma election was held at all in one  out of eight districts. Voter turnout in three Bryansk districts  ranged from 18.5 to 22.2 percent... Good grief, should we just  start over? Oh, Moscow, give us a few more billions!    From the Russian Federation Central Election Committee and  structures close to the president there have been complaints  that local elections are just taking place spontaneously,  without any sort of "sponsorship" on the part of federal  authorities. Supposedly if the latter were to "get involved" the  outcome would be different. It is also supposedly time to  finally approve a whole series of laws, one of the most  important of which would pertain to fundamental guarantees of  citizens' voting rights and... financial support for election  campaigns.    But citizens are sick and tired of these "democracy games"  in  which they are supposed to play the role of spectators. A  majority of citizens see no benefit whatsoever in all these  expensive elections, referendums, polls, etc., which threaten to  become endless. Therefore they are in no hurry to get out and  vote... It would seem that this is clear to everyone by now.  Unfortunately, everyone has not yet realized who does in fact  benefit from all THIS. Who is it? Just the bureaucrats and  administrators who are gathering more and more local power into  their hands. And perhaps some bureaucrats higher up as well?  Think about it, voters. Think!</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: MOTHER, DAUGHTER PLAN BIKE TRIP ACROSS U.S. FOR  TOGETHERNESS, LUNG ASSN.  </P> <P> When Ellen Lowe, 42, decided to take a cross-country bicycle ride this summer,  she first had to convince her husband and two of her three daughters that they  could survive without her for 2 months.  </P> <P> A more difficult problem was convincing herself that she could bicycle 3,359  miles from Seattle to Atlantic City, N.J., and keep pace with her other  daughter, 21-year-old Shelley Lowe of Brea.  </P> <P> They plan to peddle an average of 80 miles a day.  </P> <P> However, there is another problem.  </P> <P> "I know I can handle it physically," said Ellen Lowe, 42, an accounts payable  office supervisor in Walnut in easter Los Angeles County. "But getting sponsors  is turning out to be a bigger challenge than I thought." Each wants to raise  $5,000 for the American Lung Assn.'s cross-country ride, which is expected to  attract 400 bicyclists.  </P> <P> "We have sponsors who have committed to as little as $1 and as much as $150,"  she said. "We ask everyone we talk to to help us out. We've worked with the  Lung Assn. and have seen the great work it does."  </P> <P> Aside from raising money, "I'm thrilled I'm going to do this with my mom," said  her daughter, who works as a waitress and attends Cal State Fullerton. "We try  to ride together three times a week. Our relationship is built around cycling."  </P> <P> Before cycling, their main activity was running. "It was a good way to spend  time together and I even thought of running a marathon," Shelley Lowe said.  </P> <P> The bicycling three times a week helped both progress to more challenging  rides, such as the demanding 100-milers that each has taken.  </P> <P> "When we first committed to the cross-country ride, it didn't sound as enormous  as it is now," Shelley said. She said they are spending half their waking hours  looking for sponsors and joining organized rides to better prepare themselves.  "We're also learning how to eat more nutritiously for the ride."  </P> <P> Bicycling gives Shelley "everything I need. I want to do something physical  every day of my life and bicycling has everything I want, including speed and  excitement."  </P> <P> And her mother likes to think it helps keep a family together. "In years past,  families were closer. But today's families seem to be drifting apart. My family  is close and I like to think that other families will get closer once again."  </P> <P> She said cycling gave her the opportunity to see her eldest daughter on a  regular basis.  </P> <P> "After she moved out I missed her a lot," she said. "And cycling gave us the  opportunity to get together again."  </P> <P> Besides their togetherness, the summer cross-country cycling trip will offer  them the chance to see the country.  </P> <P> "Most people traveling across the country are intent on their destination and  miss what they are traveling through," said Ellen. "We're going to take it all  in."  </P> <P> Arash Alizadeh will graduate this year from Bolsa Grande High School in Garden  Grove and plans to attend UCLA for a couple of years before moving on to  Stanford. He wants to wait until he is old enough to get a driver's license.  He's only 14.  </P> <P> Arash moved with his parents from Tehran, Iran, to Westminster 2 1/2 years ago,  learning English after arriving.  </P> <P> "I don't have a problem communicating with people," Arash said, but added that  he worked hard and was under a great deal of personal pressure to learn the  language. "It was important to learn English to prepare me for the life I have  ahead of me and to become a well-rounded person. I feel I do better under  pressure."  </P> <P> Arash said he wants to be a neurosurgeon and hopes someday to become the  country's surgeon-general. "I plan to enter politics at a certain level," he  said.  </P> <P> The ability to master schoolwork is not a matter of intelligence, he said.  </P> <P> "I think I have worked hard and I believe the culture I was raised in and the  support of my mother and father has had a great deal to do with it."  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Santa Ana's Valley High School won first place in drill team  competition at the recent National Date Festival in Indio. The school also won  second place for tall flags, a third for drum major and fifth for its marching  band.  </P></p>

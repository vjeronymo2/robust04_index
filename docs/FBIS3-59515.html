			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fabienne Roulleaux: "Booming Environment Markets </F> in Southeast Asia"; introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Text] Singapore--This part of the world is becoming  aware of the effects of industrialization on the environment.  Budgets are swelling in every country. Water treatment is taking  the lion's share.    The Regional Institute of Environmental Technologies (RIET)  was inaugurated in Singapore at the end of July with a budget of  5 million ECU's (32.5 million francs). It is a joint project  between the European Community and Singapore. The purpose of the  institution is to provide expertise and serve as a data bank.  "Establishment of the RIET comes at a crucial time for the  countries of Southeast Asia, where the effects of  industrialization have two sides: the growing economic  importance of this part of the world and the other side of the  coin, which is the rapid accumulation of problems linked to the  environment," says Philippe Bergeron, the institute's director.  Beyond that, the institute is also a response to Singapore's  ambition to become a model "green city" and a regional center of  expertise on environmental matters.    The island state with 2.8 million inhabitants has already  positioned itself in that market by establishing the Semes firm,  an indirect subsidiary of the Ministry of Environment that  specializes in environmental protection projects in the regional  market.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rapidly Expanding Investments: ASEAN Country Commitments to Water, Air and |  |Waste Treatment (in billions of francs)                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Area              |1990              |1995              |2000              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Water             |21                |30                |46                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Waste             |10                |15                |28                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Air               |10                |16                |26                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Helmut Kaiser Research Center.                                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  110 Billion Francs in Year 2000 </H5>   The fact is that the size of the regional market is far from  negligible: activities linked to environmental cleanup, waste  treatment, and air pollution are expected to be worth 66.5  billion francs in 1995 and over 110 billion francs in the year  2000 (promising figures even when compared to the European  market, which is 10 times as large). Air and water pollution are  expected to increase tenfold over the next 15 years -- a result  of the 300-percent increase in the number of vehicles and an  increase of from 150 to 200 percent in industrial activity.    Within ASEAN (a free trade agreement among Southeast Asian  countries), Singapore has had the strictest air and water  quality standards and solid waste regulations for the past 20  years. The annual budget for the environment was close to 2.5  billion francs in 1991. "In the other countries in the area,  priority is assigned to the supply of drinking water, and  wastewater treatment has only begun within the past six months  to a year," says Hubert Broux of Degremont, a subsidiary of the  Lyonnaise-Dumez firm.    In Malaysia, the 1991-1995 plan calls for investing 13  billion francs in the quality and distribution of water. For its  part, Thailand has announced a 1.7 billion-franc program for  building a water treatment plant in Bangkok to combat pollution.  In both Indonesia and the Philippines, awareness is a more  recent phenomenon. Indonesia, for example, is spending about 3.5  billion francs annually to protect its environment.    With its six sewage plants, the incineration of 60 percent  of  its refuse, controls on the number of vehicles, and the  relocation of certain polluting industries, Singapore presents  real opportunities for specialized Western firms. The principal  areas are the modernization of existing systems using more  sophisticated technologies, especially to solve the problem of  odors from wastewater treatment plants; the introduction of a  telemetering system for controlling air quality; the treatment  of sludge from the unloading of oil tankers; and waste recycling.  <H5>  Desalination of Seawater </H5>   Sidem, a subsidiary of the Serete group, has obtained an 800  million-franc contract from the Shell Oil Company for supplying  a seawater desalination plant. Sita, a subsidiary of the Lyons  Water Company specializing in the collection and treatment of  waste, has signed several contracts with Singapore hospitals to  sort, transport, and incinerate hospital waste.    Whether expressed or not, those needs in the region are  considerable. In Selangor, Malaysia, Degremont is helping to  build the largest drinking water facility in Asia. In Indonesia,  where France is active as the third-largest lending country with  aid totaling 800 million francs in 1993, Degremont has won three  contracts for water treatment plants on Java, Bali, and Lombok.  For its part, the Lyons Water Company is not present in  Singapore, where water distribution is a monopoly of the state,  which has signed supply contracts with Malaysia and, just  recently, with Sumatra (Indonesia). In Malaysia, on the other  hand, the French firm operates three concessions for the supply  of drinking water: in Taipeng (300 million francs), Johore Bahru  (4.6 billion francs), and Kota Kinabalu (1.8 billion francs).  Last year the General Water Company won a contract worth about  10 million francs to build a water ozonization plant in Malaysia.    The market is likely to expand even more now that  privatization programs are about to get underway. Nowadays  governments are no longer able to finance the distribution and  treatment of water, so they are turning to private groups. The  Northwest firm of Great Britain, for example, is about to obtain  the contract for wastewater in Bangkok.</p>

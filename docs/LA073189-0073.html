			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS CRUSH PADRES BUT LEIPER PASSES TEST  </P> <P> It was only the second inning Sunday when the Padre bullpen phone rang. Bullpen  coach Denny Sommers picked it up, nodded to No. 52 sitting alongside him, and  said, "It's you, babe."  </P> <P> Dave Leiper felt every muscle in his body tighten. He tried to swallow, but his  throat was too dry. Instead, he took a deep breath, just trying to calm  himself.  </P> <P> This would be just be one of 161 professional games that Leiper has pitched in  his eight-year career, and with the Dodgers already up by five runs on their  way to a 10-1 victory, this hardly could be perceived as a critical situation.  </P> <P> But Leiper, 27, considered it the game of his life.  </P> <P> It was back in November, as Leiper watched TV at his Scottsdale, Ariz., home,  that he felt a funny pain in his chest. He thought little of it, and decided to  go to bed early. He awoke in the middle of the night, wondering if he'd make it  to morning.  </P> <P> He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors informed him he had suffered a heart  attack. The Padres and Leiper now call it heart spasms, but whatever the proper  definition, it was enough to keep Leiper hospitalized for nearly a week.  </P> <P> Doctors couldn't tell Leiper exactly why it happened, but because several  checkups revealed no further trouble, Leiper felt there was no need to worry.  </P> <P> He went through spring training and the first 2 1/2 months of this season, and  the only physical ailment he endured was a strained right elbow, which required  a stint on the disabled list and a 20-day rehabilitation assignment with the  Padres' triple-A club in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Just one day after returning from Las Vegas, Leiper was called on to pitch an  inning against Pittsburgh. He retired three of the four batters he faced, but  something did not feel quite right when he was on the mound.  </P> <P> His pulse was racing, he was short of breath, and he felt a little  light-headed. It was probably nerves, he thought.  </P> <P> No need to panic. So he just kept it to himself.  </P> <P> Three days later, pitching in the fifth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals,  Leiper found himself bending over on the mound, fighting to catch his breath.  He got two outs, but could go no further. He summoned the dugout for help, and  was whisked into the trainer's room. They found his pulse rate alarmingly  rapid.  </P> <P> When the Padres went to Cincinnati, Leiper stayed back and underwent extensive  testing at the Scripps Clinic. He had so many wires attached to his body that  he must have thought he was a walking electronics store.  </P> <P> After a three-hour test Wednesday, during which he was heavily sedated, he was  given medication for his heart condition. One pill in the morning and one in  the evening before bed were the instructions.  </P> <P> "Everything's been going through my mind these past few days," Leiper said. "I  wondered what was going to happen when I went back out there. I wondered if  maybe my career was over. I wondered what I'd do if I couldn't pitch again.  </P> <P> "So when I got that call to go in today, I felt a nervousness I've never  experienced. I really didn't know what was going to happen.  </P> <P> "I tried to block it out of my mind, but really, how was I going to do that?"  </P> <P> With all that to consider while simultaneously trying to throw a baseball past  major league hitters, it was not surprising that the Dodgers welcomed back  Leiper by getting three straight hits, including a home run into the  right-field seats by Franklin Stubbs.  </P> <P> It was like a good news-bad news joke. The good news, Leiper said, was that he  was breathing fine, believing that everything would be all right, after all.  The bad news was that he wasn't going to be around much longer anyway if he  didn't start pitching better.  </P> <P> Leiper finally got Mike Scioscia to line out to first baseman Jack Clark for  the first out, and after that, everything went quite smoothly. He didn't allow  another run in three innings, and finished with a pitching line of three  innings, five hits, two runs, and one walk.  </P> <P> Hardly impressive numbers, but forgive Leiper for feeling as if he had just  received a new lease on life.  </P> <P> "I know I'm sounding selfish by saying this," Leiper said, "but I'm the  happiest guy in here. I really had a lot of doubts, and a lot of questions  whether this medication would work. Who knew what was going to happen?  </P> <P> "I'm not happy with the way I pitched, but considering the way I feel right  now, it couldn't have gone better."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Padres, there was no one else who could relate to  Leiper's sense of satisfaction.  </P> <P> The Dodgers teed off on starter Ed Whitson, scoring five runs to knock him out  of the game after two innings. The Dodgers finished the game with 15 hits and  10 runs, equaling their season high.  </P> <P> The Dodgers scored all five of the runs off Whitson -- two in the first inning  and three in the second -- with no one on, and two outs.  </P> <P> In the first inning, Eddie Murray hit a two-run home, the first of two he hit  in the game. In the second inning, Lenny Harris drove in two runs with a  double, one of three he hit in the game.  </P> <P> Whitson (14-7), who had pitched at least five innings in each of his previous  21 starts this season, said that he was troubled by a blister on the middle  finger of his right hand. He couldn't grip the ball tightly enough to throw  breaking balls, and when a major league hitter knows he's going to see all  fastballs, Whitson can tell you what will happen.  </P> <P> "It was like throwing batting practice," Whitson said. "When you're pumping  fastballs like that, no matter how hard you're throwing, they're going to turn  on it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Padres didn't have a clue on figuring out Dodger starter Tim  Belcher. Their only rally came in the third inning, when Benito Santiago led  off with a home run -- his sixth of the season and first since June 14. The  Padres then loaded the bases with two outs, but Marvell Wynne ended the rally  by hitting into a fielder's choice.  </P> <P> Belcher (8-9) retired 18 of the final 21 batters he faced, finishing with a  four-hitter, and ending the Dodgers' five-game losing streak against the  Padres.  </P> <P> "It was ugly out there, wasn't it," said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn, who  went one for four, and saw his batting average (.334) drop to its lowest since  June 4. "I'm so mad (about) the way I'm hitting, I can't even talk.  </P> <P> "I should have known what kind of day it was going to be when I got so mad that  I threw my helmet against the wall, and didn't even crack it. Heck, it didn't  even scratch it.  </P> <P> "Man, I hope we can forget about this day forever."  </P> <P> Sorry, but Leiper hopes he never will.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre shortstop Garry Templeton had his left knee drained Sunday morning and is  expected to miss the upcoming three-game series against the Atlanta Braves.  Templeton suffered a strained tendon in the back of his knee Wednesday night  while beating out an infield single and has missed the past four games. . . .  The Padres now are 10-22 in day games this season. What does Padre Manager Jack  McKeon plan to do to help rectify the situation? "Pray for rain," he said. . .  . NBC, figuring at one time that the Padres-Dodgers game Saturday would have a  bearing on the pennant race, has decided to scratch the scheduled national  telecast. Instead, it will telecast Houston against San Francisco. . . .  Perhaps the highlight of the afternoon occurred after the game. Ronnie Rinden,  a 35-year-old plumber from San Diego, and Rosemary Thompson were married at  home plate before the start of a game between former Padre players and fantasy  campers. Rinden, wearing a Padre uniform with No. 00, and Thompson, wearing a  dress, exchanged vows and walked under crossed bats to the Bruce Springsteen  song, 'Glory Days.' Rinden then played in the fantasy game . . . McKeon finds  trade rumors involving Detroit Tigers shortstop Alan Trammell rather curious.  The rumor, reported by ESPN, had the Padres offering pitcher Greg Harris,  outfielder Carmelo Martinez and minor league outfielder Jerald Clark to the  Tigers for Trammell. McKeon said that the rumor is totally unfounded and he has  not spoken with Tiger General Manager Bill Lajoie in months. . . . The Chicago  White Sox contacted the Padres to ask if they were interested in Harold Baines,  according to Padre management, but with his troubled knees, and no designated  hitter in the National League, the Padres declined. . . . Padre catcher Benito  Santiago threw out Franklin Stubbs in the second inning, and now has thrown out  seven of 11 from his knees this season. . . . The Padres are off today, and  will travel to Atlanta for a three-game series against the Braves. The Padres  altered their pitching rotation for the Braves' series, enabling Don Schulze to  start against the Braves instead of making a second straight start against the  Dodgers. Greg Harris, who originally was scheduled to pitch Wednesday, now will  be in the bullpen with his next scheduled start Saturday in Los Angeles. The  revised pitching matchups: Dennis Rasmussen (4-7) vs. Marty Clary (3-1)  Tuesday; Bruce Hurst (9-8) vs. Tom Glavine (9-6) Wednesday; and Schulze (1-0)  vs. Pete Smith (2-11) Thursday.  </P></p>

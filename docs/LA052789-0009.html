			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEW BLOOD SOUGHT TO FAN THE FLAMES;  </P> <P> AFTER ITS CUP RUNNETH OVER, CALGARY LIKELY TO BID OLD GUARD ADIEU  </P> <P> The Calgary Flames are being fitted for Stanley Cup rings. In the case of each  player, it is the first. For some, it will be the last.  </P> <P> The Flames, oldest team in the National Hockey League, can expect personnel  changes before they leave for the Soviet Union in early September. General  Manager Cliff Fletcher stuck with the old guard as long as possible and was  rewarded. Now, it is time to move on.  </P> <P> Co-captains Lanny McDonald and Jim Peplinski seemingly were going nowhere until  McDonald, after sitting out three consecutive games, dressed for Thursday's  finale and produced the goal that put the Flames ahead to stay.  </P> <P> It was the first goal of the playoffs for McDonald, 36, who was joined by the  scratched Peplinski in sweat clothes for the ceremonial skate with the Stanley  Cup.  </P> <P> "There was no weight to the Cup at all; you could carry it forever," McDonald  said. "I was ecstatic about being in the lineup, but I didn't want to just be  in the lineup. I wanted to contribute and I did."  </P> <P> Coach Terry Crisp, the 12th man since 1917 to win a Stanley Cup as both player  (Philadelphia 1974 and 1975) and coach, said, "Lanny McDonald was rested and I  felt to put him back in there with that 'C' on his chest would give the team an  emotional lift. I didn't put him in for sentiment. The main reason was to win  the game -- and we did."  </P> <P> Afterward, McDonald said he had not yet decided whether he would retire. But  Fletcher left little doubt when he said, "That was a great way for Lanny to end  his career, scoring a big goal in the game that gave us the Stanley Cup."  </P> <P> It was a big 16th season for McDonald, who collected his 500th goal and 1,000th  point, in addition to his first Stanley Cup ring. McDonald already was wearing  two diamond rings, one commemorating the 500th goal and another in the shape of  the Flames' logo, given him by his wife Ardell.  </P> <P> "She gave it to me on my 30th birthday and told me that if I wore it, I'd never  get old," McDonald said. "You know what? She lied."  </P> <P> Right wing Hakan Loob is headed back to Sweden, where he will join Washington's  Bengt Gustafsson, Winnipeg's Fredrik Olausson and the Montreal's Kjell Dahlin  on a Farjestads team that ought to be a potent force in the Elite Division.  </P> <P> Peplinski, defenseman Rob Ramage, right wing Mark Hunter and backup goalie Rick  Wamsley are others who figure to be playing somewhere else next season.  </P> <P> It would be no surprise if the Flames packaged all of them in a giant deal with  the Toronto Maple Leafs. Fletcher is known to covet right wing Gary Leeman, one  of the few Toronto players who could make a major contribution in Calgary.  </P> <P> Regardless, Fletcher has to make room for several players from the Salt Lake  City farm club, which reached the final of the International League playoffs  before falling to Muskegon.  </P> <P> Defenseman Rick Lessard was a first-team IHL all-star in his first pro season.  Center Paul Ranheim racked up 68 goals and center Peter Lappin had 48. Goalie  Steve Guenette had an excellent year and could easily fill Wamsley's role.  </P> <P> Then there is the matter of Iron Curtain forwards Sergei Priakin and Jiri  Hrdina, who saw limited duty this season. The Flames have paid too much to the  Soviet and Czech federations to allow them to continue as part-timers.  </P> <P> If Soviet right wing Sergei Makarov elects to play in the NHL, he would be a  capable replacement for Loob. Makarov has received his release from the Red  Army and can come to Calgary if he wishes, providing the Soviets' monetary  demands are not too high.  </P> <P> All of which means the Flames are in good shape to make a run at another Cup.  </P></p>

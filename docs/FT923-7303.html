			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / French wine exports up in value FRANCE'S troubled wine industry managed to muster a 4.7 per cent increase in exports to FFr13.1bn (Pounds 1.37bn) in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 1991. According to the latest figures from the Centre Francais du Commerce Exterieur the increase was solely due to higher prices and favourable currency trends, as the volume of wine exports fell by 7.5 per cent to 5.4m hectolitres between January and July. The worst affected area was champagne, which registered falls in both volume and value sales of 7.2 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively. The French wine industry has been hit by the combined effects of the global economic slowdown and a surplus of supply after the bumper harvests of 1988, 1989 and 1990. The supply situation has been eased by last year's smaller crop and France's wine producers are now anxiously waiting to assess the 1992 harvest when they pick the grapes next month.</p>

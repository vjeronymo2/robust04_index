			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A spoonful of TV makes the medicine go down. A new 24-hour a day, in-house  children's television channel will go on the air today at Cedars-Sinai Medical  Center. The commercial-free, nonprofit channel is being donated by DIC  Enterprises, and will showcase such DIC-produced kidvid favorites as "The Real  Ghostbusters," "ALF," "ALF Tales," "The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin," "The New  Archies," "Inspector Gadget" and "Zoobilee Zoo." "We felt we should do what we  could to prove the adage that laughter is the best medicine," says Andy  Heyward, president, DIC Enterprises Inc. For his part, Dr. David Rimoin,  director of pediatrics at the hospital, says a patient's outlook is crucial to  the healing process and the new children's channel is "just what the doctor  ordered."

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTRAIT OF A PLANET  </P> <P> Imagine lacy fingers of red coral groping in the silent depths of the Pacific.  Picture baby seals frolicking on the sun-drenched shores of islands in the  Atlantic.  </P> <P> These are two visions of a planet both beautiful and diverse, unspoiled by  human activity. Now picture Argentine rivers blackened with oily industrial  toxins. Imagine Mt. Everest littered with the rusting garbage of countless  expeditions. These, too, are images of Earth -- and civilization's undeniable  presence.  </P> <P>  In "One Earth," a collection of color photographs published this month by  Collins Publishers, 80 photojournalists from around the world have documented  the gamut of environmental problems, including global warming, pollution,  deforestation, endangered species and overpopulation. The photographers, many  of whom contributed to the books "A Day in the Life of America" and "A Day in  the Life of the Soviet Union," began shooting in August, 1989. Seven months  later, they had amassed thousands of pictures, producing a dramatic portrait of  the planet and the state of its fragile natural resources.  </P> <P> "The goal was to present a serious issue in an accessible way, using the power  of photojournalism," says Kate Kelly, managing editor of the project. "We  wrestled long and hard with how best to show not only the gravity of the issue  but also the spirit of hope, the momentum of people worldwide who are trying to  do something about these problems."  </P> <P> All photographs from "One Earth," 1990 by Collins Publishers.

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TAKING 'MEASURE' OF SHAKESPEARE'S COMEDY  </P> <P> Solvitur ambulando, the Jesuits used to say -- we'll work it out as we go  along. That seems to be director Adrian Hall's approach to Shakespeare's  "Measure for Measure" at the Old Globe Theatre, and the results are  surprisingly convincing.  </P> <P> Hall came to the production late, as a substitute for the ill John Hirsch (who  died Aug. 1 of AIDS). A program note suggests that Hall not only didn't have a  concept for the show in his pocket, he didn't know the play all that well.  </P> <P> But then, who does know "Measure for Measure"? This is one of Shakespeare's  iffiest "comedies," a dish whose ingredients strike us as none too wholesome.  Isn't it comical the way the Duke (Richard Easton) sneaks around Vienna in his  monk's outfit, checking out everybody's behavior once they think he's gone?  </P> <P> Not when you see what it leads to, no. And not when you consider what the  Duke's real motives are. The city has become a moral stew, thanks to his own  negligence. So he will pretend to go off to the country, let things go from bad  to worse (in fact, assist them) and then magically appear to make everything  right -- to mete out justice and, of course, mercy.  </P> <P> And, incidentally, to get the girl. Machiavelli would have approved of this  plot. Shakespeare seems to have his doubts, judging from his description of the  Duke as "the Duke of dark corners" and from the many heavy-hearted passages  about lust, poison, guilt and retribution.  </P> <P> Still he's stuck with the comic mechanics of the play. Something feels uneasy  and the golden note of comic forgiveness isn't struck at the end of the play,  although the motions are gone through.  </P> <P> How to stage "Measure for Measure"? An inch at a time. At least that is Hall's  solution. He gives each scene its due, and lets the audience decide where  Shakespeare is writing to formula and where his heart is in it.  </P> <P> There are hints, of course, as to Hall's opinion. The final scene where the  Duke plays God is enacted on a floor made not of marble, but of plywood -- and  second-cut plywood at that. Up to now, set designer Ralph Funicello has made us  believe in his Vienna, but here he allows us to see that it is a theatrical  construct, and the implication can be transferred to the scene being played, if  we wish.  </P> <P> Hall and his designers (Lewis Brown, costume; Peter Maradudin, lighting) don't  overdo this sort of comment. But we can see them lurking in the shadows, not  unlike the Duke. Hall's actors, however lack this sort of ironic  double-mindedness. They go at their characters as if they believed in them.  </P> <P> Easton's Duke absolutely adores hearing people's confessions and getting them  into trouble. It is almost as good as having a life of one's own. A  psychoanalyst might say that he is headed for a breakdown but for the moment he  feels marvelously in touch with himself. For Easton's Duke, "Measure for  Measure" is definitely a comedy, perhaps even a puppet show. What fun to pull  the strings!  </P> <P> For Stephen Markle as Angelo -- the Duke's second in command, on whom he gets  the goods -- it is a tragedy. A 1985 Mark Taper Forum "Measure for Measure"  made Angelo a bore. Markle makes him fascinating -- a sincere hypocrite. A  "moral" man, merely because he has never been tempted to be otherwise.  </P> <P> Flooded suddenly by lust for the innocent Isabella, he finds himself astonished  by the force of his emotions, including a cruelty more joyous than anything he  has ever felt. This "angel" turns devil at a shot. Shakespeare's heart is  absolutely in these scenes, and Markle plays them with the truth of the damned.  </P> <P> Nance Williamson plays Isabella as a wise virgin who refuses to be shaken by  what she has discovered about the perfidy of men -- not only Angelo, but her  own brother Claudio (a rather recessive Michael Cerveris). It's a sensible  performance, but it is hampered by a tendency to hammer out lines rather than  thinking them through, a problem heard elsewhere in the cast as well.  </P> <P> Tempo is obviously one of Hall's desiderata in this production. It sometimes  leads to a runtogether text, as if the space bar had broken on a word  processor.  </P> <P> This is not a problem with Easton, who phrases superbly, even if he does  sometimes fall into Gielgudisms. And it is not a problem with James Winker  admirably sleazy as the good-for-nothing boulevardier, Lucio. Winker is very  much into the time frame of the show (Vienna in Freud's day), as is Jeffrey  Alan Chandler, whose Pompey suggests a dainty, nasty silent-film comic -- Fatty  Arbuckle, perhaps.  </P> <P>  (Lewis Brown's costumes are a great help here and also solve more complicated  problems.)  </P> <P> The physical and psychological atmosphere is dark and repressive, with a sense  that the barbarians are at the borders of the city. While the Duke fiddles,  Vienna is on the point of burning. This "Measure for Measure" has room to make  such a statement while also allowing the play as much laughter as it deserves  to get.  </P> <P> Hall has said that he didn't want to be a naughty boy in his first directing  assignment after being fired as the artistic director of the Dallas Theatre  Center, and he hasn't been. But he has taken the measure of a naughty play.  </P> <P>  Solvitur ambulando.  </P> <P>  At the Old Globe in Balboa Park Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with  matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2.

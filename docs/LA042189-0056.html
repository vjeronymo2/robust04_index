			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MT. CARMEL'S KLEMASKE SHUTS OUT VISTA, BUT LOSES NO-HITTER IN SEVENTH  </P> <P> Pitcher Byron Klemaske of No. 1 Mt. Carmel was all set to pitch a no-hitter  Thursday afternoon. And if not for his coach's brilliant defensive strategy, he  might have pulled it off during his team's 8-0 victory over No. 5 Vista.  </P> <P> He had a good live fastball early, a hard-breaking knuckle-curve in the middle  innings and a new-and-improved slider late. He even warded off some evil  "voodoo dust" from teammate Doug Hill in the sixth to keep the no-hitter alive.  </P> <P> Then, after Vista's Rodney DeLeon led off the seventh with a sharp grounder  right at Mt. Carmel third baseman Mark Van Aelstyn, who misplayed it for an  error, Klemaske hit Vista pitcher John Land.  </P> <P> Now for Mt. Carmel Coach Sam Blalock's maneuver.  </P> <P> Eight runs up, Blalock brought his infield in. But Vista's Ryan Tamburrino  slapped a line drive past diving first baseman Sean Robinson. A fielder's  choice groundout and a 5-4-3 double play later, Klemaske had his one-hit  shutout but no no-hitter.  </P> <P> "It was my fault he didn't get the no-hitter," said Blalock, whose team moved  into sole possession of first place in the Palomar League. "If (the first  baseman's) back, it's a double play. I apologize for that."  </P> <P> Blalock's defense made what he called "three major league plays" behind  Klemaske, who struck out seven, walked three and lowered his 1.30 ERA.  </P> <P> The "voodoo dust" spell was put on Klemaske in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> "I said it to (Hill) the last time he had a no-hitter going, so he just said it  to me today to get back at me," said Klemaske, who increased his record to 8-1  and his strikeout total to 53.  </P> <P> While Klemaske took care of the pitching, Van Aelstyn took care of the hitting,  going three for four with an RBI and two runs scored. John Tejcek added two  hits an RBI and two runs scored, and Sam Cornblum was one for one with two  walks and a hit-by-pitch for Mt. Carmel (16-2).  </P> <P> Vista dropped to 13-4-1, 4-1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The National Defense Ministry's Chungshan Science  Institute, reputed to be the bastion for research and  development of defense science and technology, will be forced to  retrench its staff due to reduced programs and fund shortage,  and it is expected to streamline the existing 18,000-member  staff down to 9,000 over a period of four years.    According to Chao Chih-yuan, vice minister of national  defense, the institute, in order to continue its capability to  conduct research and development in defense industry, will  retain the core defense science and technology personnel.    To some sectors of the public who are often skeptical of  whether weapons and equipment developed by the institute with  lavish funding can meet the basic defense needs, the elimination  of superfluous and retention of primary personnel in the  institute's upcoming staffing streamlining will, at least, save  expenditure on nonessential personnel and avoid foolish waste.  However, others are apprehensive that the measure to  drastically reduce defense science and technology personnel may  undermine the defense industry's foundation built with hard work  and affect the country's future capability to develop defense  industry.    The Chungshan Science Institute's personnel reduction plan  will be carried over a period of four years beginning from 1995.  The number of current 18,000 staff members will be reduced to  about 9,000, including 7,000 for the headquarters, 900 for the  aviation research institute, and 1,300 for the systems  manufacturing center, while the 5,000-member aviation  development center will be transferred to the Hanhsiang Company  and will no longer belong to the Chungshany Science Institute.</p>

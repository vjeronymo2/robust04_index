			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, we are defining ``substantial compliance'' at &sect;488.301 as a level of compliance with requirements of participation such that any identified deficiencies pose no greater risk to patient health and safety than the potential for causing minimal harm. Thus, while a facility may avoid a remedy even if it fails to comply perfectly with all statutory requirements, it still has a duty to each resident to provide care that enhances the chances of positive outcomes and avoids negative outcomes. If a single resident experiences any harm, a facility will not have satisfied its statutory obligations. Given the statute's focus on each resident's right to receive quality care, and the facility's mirrored obligation to provide it, we believe that we could not adopt a less rigorous standard of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We acknowledge that there might be many definitions that we could have chosen from, but in our view the definition we have settled upon strikes the appropriate balance that best implements the statute, the IoM study, and accommodates both facility and resident concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, as commenters suggested, we considered the fact that section 1866(b)(2) of the Act allows the Secretary to enter into provider agreements with facilities that ``substantially'' meet applicable requirements. Although there is no analogous provision in the Medicaid law for nursing facilities, we are exercising our general rulemaking authority in section 1102 of the Act, to extend the ``substantiality'' concept to Medicaid providers. We believe that since Congress stressed that it intended to adopt the IoM recommendation that the same requirements apply to both Medicare and Medicaid facilities, it is logical to recognize substantial compliance as an acceptable standard to meet for participation in both programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we discuss in more detail later in this preamble, the scope and severity gradations that appeared in the proposed rule will only serve as one example of how States can determine remedies. Furthermore, we are removing the numerical designations from the scope and severity measure. In response to the commenter who asked if a deficiency at a scope of 1 and a severity of 1 would constitute noncompliance sufficient enough to exclude a prospective provider from program participation, the answer is no. While we are not mandating the use of numerical ranges, if States use such ranges, and if a 1/1 designation denotes a deficiency which is of limited scope and which has caused no harm and is unlikely to cause more than minimal harm, a facility with such a deficiency would not be precluded from participating in the Medicare or Medicaid program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange is amending Rules 1300 (``Applicability of 1300 Series'') and 1302 (``After-Hours Trading Orders'') for a one year pilot period to permit specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities listed pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  to participate in the AHT facility to ``clean-up'' order imbalances in the AHT facility by entering an order for the specialist's account. For example, if there were single sided orders to buy 10,000 and sell 20,000 SPDRs immediately prior to the 5:00 p.m. close of the AHT facility, the specialist would be permitted under the Exchange's proposed rule amendments to enter an order for its account to buy up to 10,000 SPDRs in order to eliminate the sell side order imbalance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange currently lists one Portfolio Depositary Receipt,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> viz. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs''); and two investment trust securities pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines: LOR Index Trust SuperUnits and LOR Money Market SuperUnits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange is also amending Rule 1302(b) to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility. Currently, Amex Rule 1302(b) provides that a regular way good 'til cancelled order that is designated as After-Hours eligible, that is on the specialist's limit order book, and that is executable at the closing price or better, shall migrate from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT program. Any order for an account in which the specialist member organization or any associated party has a direct or indirect interest is prohibited from migrating to the AHT program. The rule is being amended to provide that any order for a Portfolio Depositary Receipt or an investment trust security listed on the Exchange pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Standards, Policies and Requirements will not be permitted to migrate to the AHT program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange is also amending Rule 1302 to permit specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in a coupled closing price order so long as the other side of the order is not for an account in which a member or member organization has a direct or indirect interest. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  For example, under the Exchange's amendment, the specialist in SPDRs would be permitted to agree prior to the 4:15 close of the regular trading session for such securities to take the other side of a customer order to buy or sell SPDRs for execution in the AHT facility as a closing price coupled order. The Exchange believes that such a capability would conform the trading of PDRs and investment trust securities to the practices of the ``basket'' market for equities where it is customary for a dealer to agree prior to the close of the regular trading session to take the contra side of a customer basket order and the closing index value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As amended, Amex Rule 1300 (e)(i) defines ``closing price'' as the price established by the last regular way sale on the Exchange prior to the official closing of the 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. trading session, as determined by the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in the AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing price coupled orders would benefit investors by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative securities based upon well known market indexes, such as those described above. The market price of these securities is based upon transactions largely effected in markets other than the Amex. The Exchange states that the specialist in such securities has no unique access to market sensitive information regarding the market for the underlying securities or closing index values. The Exchange, therefore, believes that specialist participation in the AHT facility in PDRs and investment trust securities in the manner described above does not raise any market integrity issues. In addition, should a customer not care for an execution at the closing price, the rules of the Exchange's AHT facility permit cancellation of an order up to the close of the AHT session at 5:00 p.m. (orders in the AHT facility are not executed until the 5:00 p.m. close of the after-hours session.) A customer, therefore, will have approximately 40 minutes to determine if an execution at the closing price suits its needs, and may cancel its order if it believes that the closing price does not suit its objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Roads agency to reduce staff cuts after protests Opposition from staff has forced the Highways Agency to scale down restructuring plans. The agency, which was set up in April to take over responsibility for the Department of Transport's roadbuilding programme, has reduced the number of proposed job losses from 500 to 450, which will take its workforce next year to a total of 1,950. It will also keep open offices in Manchester and Bristol previously destined for closure and keep more staff in the regions instead of relocating them to London. The agency still believes it will be able to achieve cost savings of more than 20 per cent by the target date of 1995-96, reducing its annual budget to Pounds 73m. The IPMS civil service union, the union with the largest number of members at the agency, said it hoped other government departments would appreciate the need to involve staff in restructuring plans. 'The agency has recognised reality,' said Mr John Higgins, national officer for the IPMS. 'They were surprised at the vehemence with which staff greeted their proposals.' Construction industry sources said morale was so low at the agency after cuts had been announced that roadbuilding work slowed considerably. The agency had originally planned to base its road programme directorate in a single office in Birmingham, but staff resistance to moving has meant that the satellite offices will be kept. Most of the agency's traffic division will now stay in Bristol and not be moved to London while its land teams will be based at offices in Leeds, Bradford, Dorking in Surrey, London and Exeter. IPMS said the revised proposals were an improvement but it is to meet agency officials next week to press for offices in Newcastle upon Tyne and Nottingham to be kept open. Mr Lawrie Haynes, the private-sector manager brought in as chief executive of the agency, said: 'These modifications reflect the value of effective consultation. Retaining the expertise of existing staff is as important to the future of the agency as introducing modern management systems and more efficient procedures.'</p>

The boss of labor circles, Rengo  Chairman Akira Yamagishi, finally voiced his real motive. What  he is aiming at is the straight line of a new liberal party. Its  leaders will be Hosokawa, Takemura, Eda, and Yokomichi. What  about Ozawa and Ichikawa?    [SANDE MAINICHI] What will become of the political reform  bills?    [Yamagishi] I think they will be passed in the upper house.  But I think it will be a slim margin of about 10 votes.    [SANDE MAINICHI] Do you mean that the rebel group in the  SDPJ  will not oppose it that much?    [Yamagishi] Rengo, too, is making independent approaches, as  a support group, to see that they are approved. Even so, I  suspect that some crimes of conscience will appear. Persuasion  will have no effect whatsoever on people who withdraw this time.  In other words, it is a case of it being an ill bird that fouls  its own nest. We cannot have this,but I think it can be kept to  about five people.    [SANDE MAINICHI] Is there no chance of the bills not  passing,  the Diet being dissolved, and a general election being held?    [Yamagishi] No, that won't happen. Politics is a living  entity, so one cannot tell until the very end, but the mission  of a support group is to persuade people.    [SANDE MAINICHI] What was your impression when you saw the  SDPJ conference on the 11th and 12th?    [Yamagishi] As might be expected, I had a gut feeling that  the split between the faction which supports the coalition  government and the independence faction is quite wide. As a  guest, I said a few words, but there was a great deal of  heckling and outcries. The heckling from those on the left was  so outrageous that in the middle of my address I shouted back  "shut up and listen!" It was my first experience with this kind  of thing. I was gripped by a hallucination that I had mistakenly  blundered into a conference of the Communist Party.    What made me mad was the heckling by Diet members. What is  going on when local executives of the largest party that props  up a government are heckling at the top of their lungs? One  cannot keep the public trust by this kind of behavior. This is  a manifestation of the split between the two factions.    [SANDE MAINICHI] The two factions can no longer endure  working together.    [Yamagishi] That is right, both of them say that, having  come  this far, they have to split up. They have already reached their  limit. But if the SDPJ splits now, the coalition government will  collapse, and the political reform bills will also be rejected.  That is the weak point. I suppose that is why the group  supporting the coalition government is having the most difficult  time.    [SANDE MAINICHI] If the political reform bills pass, next  will be the issue of a source of revenue for compiling a budget.  When that comes, the consumption-tax issue will become the  occasion for a split.    [Yamagishi] That will not happen. The broad tax reduction of  over 5 trillion yen should be financed by two or three years of  short-term deficit-covering bonds. Both the right and left  factions of the SDPJ agree on this. If they announced increasing  the consumption tax as a package deal with reducing taxes, the  Hosokawa cabinet would collapse. Hosokawa ought to understand  that better than anyone else.    [SANDE MAINICHI] In that case, when do you think there will  be a second realignment of the political landscape which  includes the breakup of the SDPJ?    [Yamagishi] For that we probably have to consider the next  general election. I think that, if the reform bills pass, the  next general election will probably be after the autumn of next  year. It will take six months to draw up the bill for dividing  the districts. That bill will also be very difficult because of  party interests, so I suppose a special session of the Diet will  be called at the very end of the year. Moreover, as is common  knowledge, the period is three months. In addition to which,  April 1995 are the local elections, right? June is the upper  house election. Therefore, the general election will be after  autumn. There is enough time before a second realignment of the  political landscape.    [SANDE MAINICHI] You are advocating the concept of a "new  liberal party," what would it be in concrete terms?    [Yamagishi] After this, the political landscape will  converge  into a system of two large political parties. But even in such a  case, we should not adopt the thesis of two conservative  parties. I think it should be a system of two large parties,  conservative versus nonconservative. But the process of going  there must pass along a tripolar path.    The three poles will be conservative A, conservative B, and  nonconservative. I think that conservative A will be Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] type conservatives, conservative B will  be a group which aims at a non-LDP, new conservatism, and that  the nonconservative will be a body in which social democratic,  moderate, and liberal groups join forces. Therefore, I think  that such as SDPJ, Japan Democratic Socialist Party, United  Social Democratic Party, Sakigake [Harbinger]. The Japan New  Party, the reform faction of the LDP, and the political forces  located on their borders should join together in a  nonconservative, liberal new party. The SDPJ must discover a  path to survival in the midst of that and settle itself in a  manner which leads to expansion. That is true for all of them,  including the Japan New Party and Sakigake.  <H5>  It Would Be Rude To Place Ozawa in a Different Dimension </H5>   [SANDE MAINICHI] Are you saying that you would draw a clear  distinction between it and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc?    [Yamagishi] That part has been greatly misunderstood. What  kind of people do you imagine in the group of leaders of the  nonconservative, liberal forces? I was asked this by Soichiro  Tawara on television and said people like Yokomichi (governor of  Hokkaido), Hosokawa, Takemura, Eda, and Hiramatsu (governor of  Oita).    He asked me if it did not include Ozawa and Ichikawa, so I  replied, no; I think they belong to the B conservatives, so they  "are not included." That statement appears to have been taken as  if I had said it excludes Ozawa and Ichikawa.    The nonconservative, liberal group has no room for  cooperation with conservative A. But it should conclude an  agreement on policy with conservative B and fight at their side.  In fact, that is the framework of the current coalition  government. The starting point of my idea is to maintain this  framework in the future as well.    [SANDE MAINICHI] In that case, do you mean to say that your  posture has not changed since around the time of the general  election last summer?    [Yamagishi] That is correct, I have not changed my posture.  I  said that (joining hands with Ozawa and Ichikawa) was  collaboration between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At  one time the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Nationalist  Party joined hands and rose in a war against Japan in order to  oppose military aggression by the Japanese military. I took that  historical fact as a model.    In addition, I said that I did not have Ozawa in mind as a  leader of the new liberal party because Ozawa said that he is a  new conservative. It would be rude to put him in the midst of  people such as social democrats and liberals who live in a world  of a totally different dimension. I certainly have no antipathy  or hostility toward Ozawa.    [SANDE MAINICHI] I understand that you met Yokomichi at the  end of last year; is he going to return to the central political  scene?    [Yamagishi] I do not think he will serve a fourth term as  governor. He is not inclined to run. In the history of Hokkaido,  there is no governor who has served for four terms. Therefore, I  think that Yokomichi understands the situation clearly. Surely  he is not at an age to retire either, so naturally he is  thinking of returning to the central political scene. We  exchanged views, and I took him to be very enthusiastic about it.    But it is a matter of the timing of his return. Yokomichi  wants to serve out his third term as governor and then return to  the central political scene. The situation is developing in that  way, so there will probably be no contradictionbecause his term  will end in April 1995 and the general election will be the  autumn 1995 at the earliest.    [SANDE MAINICHI] Are you saying that Yokomichi has no desire  to return to the SDPJ in its current state?    [Yamagishi] Yes. Therefore, it is what I call the new  liberal  party concept. He says clearly that he can no longer operate  within the framework of the SDPJ. Yokomichi will fulfill the  role of creating one pole of the tripolar structure. The SDPJ  will sublimate within that.    [SANDE MAINICHI] What will become of the so-called  protect-the-constitution group?    [Yamagishi] How would I know something like that? I suppose  it will cause a chemical reaction and break up.    [SANDE MAINICHI] If the party breaks up, what will become of  the party headquarters building?    [Yamagata] The reform group of the SDPJ will not make a fuss  about the Miyakezaka Headquarters. The land belongs to the  country. They will take care of such things by a fund-raising  campaign.    [SANDE MAINICHI] Will you not also be forced to reconsider  Rengo's endorsements when the election system changes?    [Yamagishi] The small election districts will have a single  seat, so the LDP will narrow down to a single person. The  coalition government side will also have to adjust to a single  candidate. If it fails in this, it will lose miserably to the  LDP. Deciding to back a conservative B in this district and a  liberal in that district, Rengo will support them in order for  them to be elected. It will only benefit the LDP if we say  things like they were formerly in the SDPJ, so we do not back  them, or they were in the Shinseito, so we will not work hard to  support them.</p>

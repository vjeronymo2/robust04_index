			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Blood will be collected from migrants during spring 1999 at Padre Island, Texas, as part of an ongoing study to track changes in the exposure of arctic peregrine falcons to organochlorines during the winter. Organochlorine concentrations in 1999 will be compared to those in blood collected in 1978&hyph;1979, 1984, and 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eggs and blood will be analyzed, using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, for organochlorines, other pesticides (including mirex), and polychlorinated biphenyls and hexachlorobiphenyls. These analyses will be modified, if appropriate, to include other contaminants that are identified as posing a risk to arctic peregrine falcons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Migration Counts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the Service will also review counts of migrating arctic peregrine falcons. Counts of migrating peregrine falcons passing fixed points along migration corridors provide information on gross trends in population size. Hundreds of arctic peregrine falcons are counted annually during fall migration at Cape May, New Jersey, Assateague Island, Maryland, and Padre Island, Texas. Smaller numbers are counted at a number of other locations. The Service will continue to request count data each year from all studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Region 7 (Alaska) of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for coordinating the listing, recovery, and monitoring of arctic peregrine falcons. Therefore, Region 7 will coordinate this monitoring effort. Region 7's efforts will include three facets:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Region 7 staff will continue ongoing arctic peregrine falcon status surveys on the Colville River, Alaska, measuring population size and reproductive performance, and collecting biological samples (eggs, blood, feathers) for contaminant analyses as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Region 7 staff will encourage, through memoranda of agreement or similar mechanisms, the continuation of non-Service research efforts that have provided important data on the status of the arctic peregrine falcon throughout its range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Region 7 staff will exchange information with parties involved in arctic peregrine falcon studies throughout North America and Greenland. Region 7 will compile pertinent information and conduct annual reviews of the status of the subspecies based upon all available information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the end of the 5-year monitoring period, the Service will review all available information to determine if relisting, termination of monitoring, or continued monitoring is appropriate. The Service will consider relisting if during, or after, the 5-year monitoring effort, it appears that a reversal of the recent recovery has taken place. If one or more of the following conditions exists, the Service will deem it an indication that a reversal of recovery has taken place and relisting will be considered:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The number of pairs occupying territories in any of the major breeding areas declines by 25 percent or more. Baseline information must meet the standards defined earlier in this section. For example, reclassification would be considered if the number of pairs occupying territories along the Colville River falls below 42 pairs (this would be a 25 percent reduction from the 1992 breeding population of 57 pairs) in any one year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Average productivity of peregrine falcons nesting along the Colville River drops below 1.4 young per territorial pair for two consecutive surveys (unless other identified factors, such as abnormal weather conditions, explain the lowered productivity). Pre-DDT data are not available on arctic peregrine falcons for Greenland and Canada, so no thresholds of concern for subpopulations in these countries are identifiable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Average contaminant residues in arctic peregrine falcon eggs or blood exceed those values associated with widespread reproductive failure or mortality; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the number of migrating arctic peregrine falcons declines by 25 percent or more for three consecutive years, the Service will also consider relisting arctic peregrine falcons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

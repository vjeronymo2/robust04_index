			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: INTENTIONALLY OR NOT, SHE GETS IN HER SCHOTTS  </P> <P> Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott usually is good for some eyebrow-raising  remarks, and the Sporting News said she came up with a couple in Washington,  where she was the guest of honor at a Women in Business luncheon.  </P> <P> Of Barbara Bush, she said, "With her in the White House, we can age gracefully  now."  </P> <P> Noting several people from the Soviet Union at the luncheon, including  Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, Schott said: "I can't believe we have both the  Cincinnati Reds and the Soviet Reds here."  </P> <P> Ugh.  </P> <P> For What It's Worth: Dodger right-hander Ramon Martinez, after 10 starts and 2  relief appearances for Licey in the Dominican winter league, was 7-1 with a  1.39 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Now-it-can-be-told dept.: Latin American journalists at the Super Bowl were  disappointed when they discovered that Cincinnati Bengals guard Max Montoya, a  Mexican-American, could barely speak Spanish.  </P> <P> Says Montoya, who owns a Mexican restaurant: "Maybe I can't speak Spanish, but  I can cook it."  </P> <P> Trivia Time: Tim Kurkjian of the Baltimore Sun asks this one: "Name the only  three major league players who have played in 150 or more games in each of the  last 7 years." (Answer to follow.)  </P> <P> Add Kurkjian: Pittsburgh Pirates coach Rich Donnelly told him that new Angel  Manager Doug Rader has mellowed since his days at Texas, where Donnelly coached  for him.  </P> <P> "I don't think he'll be walking home from Kansas City anymore," Donnelly said.  "One year, he walked from the Royals' ballpark to the hotel, about 12 miles,  without his shoes. He wanted to punish himself. His feet were bleeding. He told  me, 'Carry these boots or I'll beat you up.' "  </P> <P> Terry Bradshaw, on his election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: "Anybody  who's followed my career, that stuff about being too dumb, can't spell cat,  can't read defenses, knows how special this is for me. Sure, I couldn't read  defenses. Who could? Like my pal George Blanda, I just looked for an open guy  and threw the ball. And when there was nobody open, I still threw the ball."  </P> <P> From San Francisco 49ers tackle Bubba Paris, who spent 12 days during the  off-season at the Pritikin weight loss clinic in Santa Monica: "I was the  celebrity. But I was one of the poorest people there. One guy came in his  private jet."  </P> <P> It-had-to-happen dept.: Magic Johnson, needing one assist for a triple double,  passed to Mychal Thompson, who was fouled and awarded 2 free throws.  </P> <P> Said Chick Hearn: "A pass that leads to 2 points should be called an assist.  That's a rule they should change."  </P> <P> Thompson proceeded to miss both free throws.  </P> <P> No sooner had Wayne Gretzky come out against fighting in the National Hockey  League than King General Manager Rogie Vachon acquired tough guy Jay Miller  from the Boston Bruins.  </P> <P> "They're all confused in L.A.," New York Rangers Coach Michel Bergeron told  Newsday. "Gretzky wants to ban fighting and Vachon gets Jay Miller. One thing  for sure, Gretzky is not the manager yet."  </P> <P> Trivia Answer: Cal Ripken, Johnny Ray and Dale Murphy.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers, on the inauguration: "I voted for  George Bush. My family got all over me because they said Bush is only for the  rich people. Then I reminded them, 'Hey, I am rich.' "  </P></p>

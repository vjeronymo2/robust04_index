			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates an article titled "Great Encyclopedia Giving Integral  Systematization of Chuche Idea" to the 12th anniversary of the  publication of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's historic  work "On the Chuche Idea" (March 31, 1982).    The author of the article says:    The dear leader's work "On the Chuche Idea" is an immortal  work which consummates in an integral system the principles and  contents of the chuche idea on a profound scientific and  theoretical basis; it is a great encyclopedia of the chuche idea  which enriches the chuche idea with a wealth of new ideas and  theories.    The greatness of the ideological and theoretical exploits of  the dear leader is, first of all, that he established in an  integral system a true world outlook of the era of independence  with the popular masses placed in the centre.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said:    "The chuche idea is a new philosophical thought which  centres  on man."    In the work, the dear leader gave a unique exposition that  man is a social being with independence, creativity and  consciousness and, on this basis, systemized in an integral way  the chuche outlook on the world with the popular masses placed  in the centre.    The philosophical principle of the chuche idea that man is  the master of everything and decides everything gives a  scientific exposition of the position and role of man in the  world on the basis of his essential characters. The  socio-historical principles of the chuche idea clarify from a  new angle the essence, character and motive force of the  socio-historical movement with the popular masses as the driving  force.    As clarified in the work, the philosophical world outlook of  chuche unifies the view of the world focussing on man and the  man-centred viewpoint and stand toward the world; the  socio-historical outlook of chuche closely combines the view of  the socio-historical principles and law centred on the popular  masses, the makers of history, with the viewpoint and stand  approaching historical development and social revolution with  the popular masses placed in the centre.    Thus, the chuche idea convinces the masses of people that  they are responsible for their own destiny and enables them to  discharge their duty and role as masters in the revolutionary  struggle and constructive work to transform nature, society and  man.    The dear leader's scientific exposition of the essential  characters of man and systematization of the world outlook of  chuche with the popular masses placed in the centre are immortal  exploits in that they bring into bolder relief the main  features, uniqueness and advantages of the chuche idea that  broke a new ground in the development of mankind's outlook on  the world, and provide the popular masses with a powerful weapon  to transform the world positively and actively.    The greatness of the dear leader's ideological and  theoretical exploits is also that he enriched the chuche idea so  that it may serve as a powerful weapon in the practical efforts  to shape the destiny of the popular masses.    In the work, the dear leader, basing himself on a scientific  analysis of the founding and development of the chuche idea and  the rich practical experience of the Korean revolution,  elucidated the guiding principles in the revolutionary struggle  of the popular masses to transform nature and society.    The guiding principles of the chuche idea -- maintaining the  independent stand, applying the creative method and placing the  main stress on ideology in the revolution and construction --  make it possible to firmly defend, embody and give full play to  the independence, creativity and consciousness of the popular  masses in the revolutionary struggle and constructive work so  that they can positively transform nature and society and  actively shape their own destiny.    The integral systematization and consummation of the chuche  idea in conformity with its main features and ideal by the dear  leader are an immortal exploit in making the chuche idea more  famous than before as a flawless system of scientific and  logical ideas and theories and a great guiding idea of the time  with a new, unique composition and contents. This was an  epoch-making event which provided the first perfect  revolutionary world outlook of the working class in human  history.</p>

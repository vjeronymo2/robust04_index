			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Technology: Going the whole hog - Britain's pig breeders have created a lean animal which is the envy of the world The humble bacon rasher may not look like a hi-tech industrial product, but the drive to provide the consumer with leaner cuts of pork has spawned a highly sophisticated pig-breeding technology in which Britain leads the world. Today's pigs are no longer the fatty cinderellas of the meat business, but are as lean as chickens. They are quicker to grow than their ancestors and produce more piglets. Future generations could be made resistant to many fatal diseases at birth by manipulating their genes in vitro. Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, recently praised Britain's pig breeders for 'revolutionising' the kind of animal produced in response to consumer demand. 'In the past 20 years, we've reduced the backfat levels on our pigs by half and improved the feed conversion rate by 30 per cent,' says Stephen Curtis, managing director for production at the National Pig Development Company. The feed conversion rate is the efficiency with which a pig converts its food intake into weight gain. 'The UK is a forerunner in all aspects of pig technology worldwide and we're seen as a source of the most advanced genetic breeding stock,' says Tony Walker, senior pig consultant at Adas, the government's farm advisory service. Leading pig breeding companies in the UK export their animals across the globe and five companies have developed links with leading breeders in the large US market in recent years. NPD and other pig breeders have produced a generation of svelte pigs by using rigorous systems of cross-breeding where only top animals are selected for reproduction. The process is monitored and recorded on computer, creating a database of pig information stretching across the generations. This information not only helps to create leaner pigs, but also improves farmers' profit margins since they can cut food supplies as hybrid pigs become more efficient at gaining weight. In a further attempt to improve margins, breeders have also been looking at increasing the number of piglets born to sows each year. NPD hit the headlines a year ago with the launch of a new hybrid, the Manor Meishan pig. The pure-bred Meishan - a phenomenally ugly breed of Chinese pig - has strong motherly instincts, producing more piglets than its western counterparts with more teats and milk, nurturing them well to maturity. But its meat is extremely fatty. When crossed with NPD's sleeker, slimmer offspring, it produces a lean pig. Dubbed the 'aristocrat of pigs' by American buyers, the Manor Meishan produces 14 piglets per litter compared with 11 to 12 for a conventional British breed. NPD carefully records the number of piglets born to each mother. It incorporates this information, along with data on weight gain and muscle formation, into an index setting estimated breeding values for each pig. This index is used to rank each pig so that only the top five to 20 per cent are used for breeding. More than 22,000 pigs are tested by NPD every year - the company records their weight gain over 50 days and measures their muscle growth with ultrasonic scanners. The plethora of information on every pig that passes through NPD's units extends to breeding animals that are sent overseas. In this way, the UK management can advise franchisees as far afield as the Philippines and South Africa on which pigs to use for breeding. The technological monitoring process is accompanied by traditional stockman skills where farmers assess the strength of a pig's legs, for example. 'I can see all the figures on screen and say 'that pig grows wonderfully', but the quality controller might point out that its legs are too fragile,' says Sam Hoste, NPD's geneticist. NPD is trying to institutionalise the stockman's intuition by asking them to give a score to the pigs' physical attributes such as strong legs. These can be recorded on computer and incorporated into the ranking process. One way of stepping up the monitoring process is with a new system of electronic ear tags which NPD is considering introducing this year. These register a pig's number on the computer when it passes through weighing scales. Farmers can pick up the pig's number with an electronic wand, tapping additional information on that pig into a hand-held computer. These details can follow the animal through the slaughterhouse to the supermarket shelf, allowing the consumer access to a variety of information about the way the pig was raised. Pig breeders are also taking their first steps into the science fiction world of molecular genetics, with DNA testing for stress genes that can cause pigs to die young. EC pig breeders are supporting a project to plot a map of the pig's genes. UK companies have also started a joint initiative to sponsor research into how the information on genes can be applied - for example, they want to isolate the series of genes responsible for reproduction. This will allow breeders to increase litter size - Curtis says he has bred a Meishan superpig capable of producing 40 piglets a year, against a national average of roughly 21. 'It would take us about 10 years to get to a point where we are producing 40 pigs a year at a commercial level, but with gene mapping we can probably do it in three,' he says. But this development may be delayed by pressure from animal welfare groups for less intensive farming methods. While consumers are eager to eat more lean meat, they want to be sure it comes from a happy pig.</p>

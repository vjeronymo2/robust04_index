			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: KIO to offer Prima for debt THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is to write-off its property investments in Spain and ask creditor banks to take over its 34 per cent stake in Prima Inmobiliaria, the domestic property developer, as payment for its debts. This will fuel the controversy that has surrounded the KIO in Spain since last July when Ercros, its Spanish domestic chemicals arm, went into receivership. The KIO has earlier changed and stopped the flow of funds to Spanish assets. A spokesman for Grupo Torras, the KIO's holding company in Spain, said yesterday: 'We cannot make Prima viable in the present environment'. He said Torras would offer the banks its shareholding for a symbolic one peseta and ask them to take over the running of the company. Prima's debts with some 60 creditor banks total Pta57bn (Dollars 555m), according to Torras, and more than half of it is secured against properties owned by the developer. In early August, the KIO, which had temporarily ceased paying interest on the Prima debt, resumed payments under a two-month moratorium plan. An initial angry reaction to the KIO's write-off came from the state-owned Argentaria banking group, which has Pta1.6bn of outstanding credit with Prima. An Argentaria spokesman said: 'We are not interested in a debt-for-equity swap. We want to realise our loan and Prima's chief shareholder has sufficient funds to pay up.' The KIO said two weeks ago it would pump Dollars 1bn into its Spanish assets and convert Dollars 1.4bn of the Torras holding company debt into capital but it did not include Prima as a recipient of the new funds. The KIO said the Torras Papel paper group would receive Dollars 400m as part of a rescue plan and it is thought that further funds could be made available to Ercros, whose troubled fertiliser business the KIO hopes to sell to Freeport McMoRan of the US. Prima's collapse has been triggered by its huge investment in two skyscraper blocks in Madrid. Some Dollars 500m of the debt has been incurred by this project, due to be be completed by the end of 1993. The Torras spokesman said the property values in the area surrounding the twin towers had fallen so steeply that they now represented half of what it had cost to build them. The row that is now brewing between Prima and its creditors will focus on the depressed value of the assets but it is also likely to include the extent of the KIO's shareholding in the property developer.</p>

Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--For the first time since the imposition of  international sanctions against Iraq, a cargo ship carrying  freight for Jordan coming through the Red Sea will be inspected  on shore instead of high seas in what could turn out to be a  precedent- setting event, informed sources said Saturday.    The sources said the Skyman, a 13,000-tonne German vessel  carrying 3,000 tonnes of general cargo for Jordan, was expected  to dock at al-'Aqabah on Monday and a "civilian officer" from  the diplomatic mission of one of the members of the anti-Iraq  coalition would inspect the cargo at the port.    The Skyman was prevented from proceeding towards al-'Aqabah  on March 18 by the U.S.-led enforcers of the international  sanctions against Iraq. After four inspections, the inspectors  ruled on Wednesday that the ship could not be allowed to proceed  to al-'Aqabah since they did not have "accessibility" to inspect  some of the cargo.    The vessel proceeded to a Gulf port to unload cargo destined  there before returning to the Red Sea for a new inspection with  better cargo accessibility, the sources said.    "It was half way to a Gulf port from the Red Sea when an  agreement was reached after Jordanian Government intervention  that the vessel could be inspected at al-'Aqabah port rather  than the Tiran Straits," where the inspections usually take  place, said one source. "Subsequently, it was recalled to  al-'Aqabah. The vessel is expected at al-'Aqabah on Monday."    The Skyman is carrying general cargo, including steel rods  and animal feed, for the Jordanian market, according to the  ship's agents.    The inspection of the Skyman will be the first on-land  inspection of cargo coming through al-'Aqabah after the  imposition of the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990.    It was not immediately clear whether the agreement for  land-based inspection of the Skyman was a one-time procedure or  the forerunner of a mechansim proposed by Jordan.    Jordan, whose maritime operations are severely hampered as a  result of what many officials here describe as over-zealous  enforcement of the sanctions, proposed early this year that the  inspections be carried out at al-'Aqabah port by an  international agency. The proposal was viewed positively by  American administration officials, according to sources.    However, follow-up action on the proposal was at snail's  pace, and Jordan was enraged by what appeared to be an  escalation of the inspections and tightened guidelines imposed  by the American-led warships patrolling the Red Sea.    At least seven al-'Aqabah-bound vessels, including the  Skyman, were denied permission to enter the Gulf of Aqaba by the  enforcers of the sanctions since January this year compared to  20 during the whole 1993.    The Jordanian Government repeatedly protested to the U.S. as  well as the U.N. sanctions Committee against the "siege of  Aqaba." (see separate story) The Lower House of Parliament urged  the government last week to refuse to return to the  U.S.-sponsored peace talks with Israel before the blockade of  Aqaba is lifted and the lifting is formally announced at the  U.N. Security Council.    Diplomatic sources said the inspection of the Skyman could  be  a "dress rehearsal" for setting up a firm mechanism for  land-based inspection at al-'Aqabah as proposed by Jordan.    Lloyds Register of London, an independent international  agency which has extensive experience in cargo inspections all  over the world, is tipped to be the body which would take over  the inspection at al-'Aqabah as and when the mechanism is in  place.    Lloyds officials have visited al-'Aqabah several times in  the  past three months to evaluate the facilities available for  inspections and for talks with Jordanian shipping officials.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Anger at BCCI allegation by MP THE Abu Dhabi majority shareholders of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International reacted angrily yesterday to allegations made in the House of Commons naming a senior adviser in the sheikdom as having benefited from fraudulent transactions. The allegations made by Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East, named Mr Ghanem Faris Al Mazrui, one of the most senior advisers to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nayhan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, as having gained from a 'no risk' share deal. The claims had been made before in the Section 41 Report on the BCCI fraud prepared by Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors. The report prompted the Bank of England's closure action on July 5 last year. But Mr Vaz's decision to reiterate the allegations in the Commons, drawing the information from a new report prepared by Norton Rose, lawyers advising British-based creditors of the bank, reopened the wound at a critical stage for the Dollars 1.7bn provisional compensation agreement with Abu Dhabi negotiated by Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross chief liquidator of BCCI. The High Court has adjourned the hearing into the liquidation until June 8 for creditors to seek 'clarification' of the deal. The unofficial creditors committee is seeking a better deal than the one on offer. Abu Dhabi said yesterday Mr Mazrui had been given no guarantee, indemnity or similar assurance that his transaction in shares in the BCCI group, which occured in 1986, would be risk-free. The details, said Abu Dhabi, had been voluntarily disclosed by Mr Mazrui to Price Waterhouse and the investigation committee set up by the majority shareholders. It said that at no time before April 1990 did Mr Mazrui know of fraudulent activities by BCCI management.</p>

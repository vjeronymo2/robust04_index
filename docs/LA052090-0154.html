			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CABLE COMPANIES' MONOPOLISTIC ROLE CRITICIZED  </P> <P> Cable companies in Orange County have 15-to-20-year contracts with the cities  in which they operate.  </P> <P> These companies are subject to no regulation whatsoever! They may not like the  increase in their tax assessments, but there is no reason why the taxpayers  should bear their burden further. We already put up with the cable companies'  ridiculous rates and horrible service. That is hardship enough!  </P> <P> SCOTT M. PEARSON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

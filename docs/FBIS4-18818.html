			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Portuguese EC Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro  stated that the trade embargo imposed by Greece on The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is illegal and a shot in  the foot of the present European presidency. In an exclusive  interview with Renascenca, Deus Pinheiro states categorically  that the Macedonia issue poisoned things during the Greek  presidency:    [Deus Pinheiro] They have let things be poisoned by the  Macedonia issue and have created some friction both in relations  with the member states and in the relations of the presidency  with other institutions. Thus a decision by the Commission  yesterday to take the case of The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia to the court of justice.    I believe that this decision by the Greek Government to  impose a trade embargo on The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--as far as I am concerned--is not only illegal in  terms of Community law but also, politically, a shot in the foot.    [Annuoncer] That was Joao de Deus Pinheiro in an exclusive  interview with Renascenca which will be broadcast in its  entirety tomorrow in the Por Ca e Por La program, at 1100 hours.

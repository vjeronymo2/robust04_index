			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Royal Bank staff on overtime ban SOME staff at the Royal Bank of Scotland are to begin an overtime ban today in protest against a pay offer and their union has instructed them to refuse to fill cash machines. Claims by Bifu, the financial services union, that dispensers could run out of cash over Easter weekend were refuted by the bank. Clerical staff voted for industrial action in protest at a pay offer of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. Managers have also voted for action to protest at a performance-related pay system.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOB RIGHTS VOTED FOR DISABLED;  </P> <P> LAW WOULD GUARANTEE THEM ACCESS  </P> <P> The House voted 403 to 20 today for landmark legislation prohibiting  discrimination against America's 43 million physically and mentally disabled  people.  </P> <P> The Americans with Disabilities Act goes to House and Senate negotiators after  the Memorial Day recess to work out the one major difference in the two  versions.  </P> <P> The difference is a House amendment, passed 199-187 last week, to let employers  reassign AIDS-infected workers to keep them from handling food.  </P> <P> Opponents say the amendment would allow discrimination against one group of  people despite overwhelming medical evidence that AIDS is not transmitted  through such casual contact.  </P> <P> President Bush has urged speedy passage of the bill, aimed at doing for  disabled Americans what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 set out to do for blacks  and other minorities: guarantee access to jobs, businesses, services,  transportation and telecommunications.  </P> <P> Prior to passage, the House voted 227-192 to defeat an amendment limiting the  remedies disabled workers could seek from employers who willfully discriminate.  The White House supported that amendment.  </P> <P> Among key provisions of the bill:  </P> <P> * Discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited. The requirement  would be phased in over two to four years, depending on the size of the  company. Companies with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt.  </P> <P> * Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business and  professional offices, along with any other "public accommodation," would have  to make themselves accessible to disabled people. Accessibility includes  structural adjustments, such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors, and  services.  </P> <P> * Transportation, public and private, would have to be made accessible.  Fixed-route bus systems would have to be accessible for people with  wheelchairs. Special facilities would be available for people with other  disabilities who cannot use regular transit. Amtrak, Greyhound and commuter  rail systems are covered. Timetables for implementation vary according to  system.  </P> <P> * People with speech and hearing impairments would have access to telephone  service by means of relay services. These services would have to be provided by  phone companies within three years.  </P> <P> "This is a significant and historical step forward for the disabled," Rep.  Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said.  </P> <P> The legislation builds on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which does not address the  disabled, and the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, which does not specifically deal  with public accommodations, private sector employment and programs not  receiving federal money.  </P> <P> The House rejected, 192-227, an attempt by Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (  R-Wis.) to limit the legal remedies for victims of job discrimination to those  now available under the Civil Rights Act. These include getting a court-ordered  injunction against bias and the awarding of back pay and attorneys' fees.  </P> <P> The bill allows disabled victims of discrimination to take advantage of  whatever is provided in the pending Civil Rights Act of 1990. Under  consideration is a proposal to allow monetary damages.  </P></p>

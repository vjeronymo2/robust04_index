			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lincoln National Bank Renamed: The parent of Lincoln National Bank in Encino  said it changed the bank's name to California United Bank after a federal judge  last week refused to block the switch.  </P> <P> The bank chose the new name to avoid confusion with Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan,  the troubled Irvine thrift. But United California Savings Bank, based in Santa  Ana, sued to prevent the change on grounds that the proposed new name was too  similar to its own. Lincoln National Bank's parent changed its name to CU  Bancorp.  </P></p>

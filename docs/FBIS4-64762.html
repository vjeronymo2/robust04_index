			<p>BFN     [Text] [Excerpts] Paris, May 6 (AFP) -- The question of  whether to continue with nuclear tests is a "major point of  disagreement" between the conservative French government and  socialist President Francois Mitterrand, Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe said on French radio Friday. [passage omitted]    Juppe, responding on France-Inter radio, said the issue was  "a major point of disagreement" with the government, which wants  to keep its options open. [passage omitted]    As for computer-generated tests, "most experts think further  nuclear tests are needed" before this was possible," he added.    A conservative member of parliament's defence committee used  stronger language, saying Friday that Mitterrand was making a  "vain testament, a farewell to arms" rather than showing a  "vision of the future."    The president "remains strangely faithful to an outmoded  vision of the bipolar world of the Cold War, without taking  account of the new unpredictable dangers which we should defend  ourselves against," said Jacques Baumel, from the ruling  coalition party Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR).    Juppe said he agreed with the broad thrust of the  president's  arguments.    This was that it was vital to French interests to maintain  an  independent nuclear deterrent and keep out of NATO's military  command, to allocate more money to computer research and  strengthen overall disarmament, he said.    "There is no question today of rejoining the military  organisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said  Juppe, who said development of computer simulation "will allow  us to move on from nuclear tests one day." [passage omitted]    Mitterrand also gave the first-ever official details of his  country's nuclear arsenal, saying France had some 500 nuclear  warheads.    The deterrent relied mainly on five nuclear-powered  submarines which each carried 16 missiles with six independently  targeted warheads. The number in service at any one time was 64  missiles, carrying a total of 384 warheads, each of 150  kilotonnes yield, Mitterrand said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben and 'Irit </F> Rosenblum]    [Excerpts] Israel is asking the United States for $5  billion special military aid as compensation for the security  risks involved in the Golan Heights withdrawal.    The United States and Israel will set up working groups of  experts to discuss the details of the Israeli aid request, it  was reported in talks held during Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's recent visit to Israel.    The granting of the U.S. aid to Israel will require special  legislation in congress. The Israeli aid request has two  components:    1. The storing of more than $1.5 billion worth of arms and  ammunition in emergency storehouses in Israel. The equipment  will belong to the U.S. Armed Forces and will be guarded by  them, but will be put at the service of the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] during wartime.    2. Providing the IDF with sophisticated arms and  intelligence, some of it state-of-the-art, so far not supplied  to Israel.    In addition, Israel wants U.S. aid to remain at the present  level of $3 billion for some time.    The secretary of state will arrive mid-month for another  round of shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Damascus.    Israel wants clarifications about the Syrian peace proposal  Christopher delivered a week ago. Senior political sources said  that Israel's request for clarifications mainly concerns the  security arrangements on the Golan and issues relating to the  implementation of the arrangement in stages. They said that  Israel rejects the Syrian demand for "symmetrical" security  arrangements, and addresses questions to Syria on that issue.    Israel also wants to know what the Syrians mean when they  talk about normalization within the framework of a peace  settlement. Political sources in Israel said yesterday they  believe that the chances of an imminent resumption of the  Washington peace talks are very low and that the negotiations  with Syria will be focused on Christopher's shuttle diplomacy in  the near future.    Nevertheless, it is still unclear how long the secretary of  state will have to invest in active mediation between Jerusalem  and Damascus, and it appears that the formula for continued  negotiations will be decided only after Christopher's upcoming  visit and according to the progress that will be achieved in it.

Scherzer  entered Syria on a foreign passport, but the Syrians knew she  was Israeli.</p>

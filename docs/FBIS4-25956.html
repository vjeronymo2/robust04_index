			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Liu Hongru,  vice-chairman of the Securities Committee under the State  Council, said here today that China must create stable growth  for the futures market through experiment and tightening control  measures.    At a forum on the management and supervision of futures  markets in the country, Liu said that at present, the conditions  for China to promote all-round development of the futures market  are not ripe.    More than 40 futures markets have been set up in China over  the past few years. There are also more than 300 futures  trading companies approved by local authorities.    Liu said that some of the futures markets and futures  trading  companies operate in line with the standards of the  international market and a few futures exchanges have produced  effects on the formation of the prices in China's production and  circulation sectors.    He said that the development of the futures exchanges has  also met many problems such as exceeding the allowable number of  exchanges and nonstandard operation of some futures exchanges.    These problems not only impede the positive function of the  futures market, but also affect the implementation of the  state's macro control policies and social stability, he said.    He pointed out that the development of futures markets  requires some conditions, involving law and regulations,  personnel, business experiences and people's concepts of risk  factors.    The market environment and market mechanism for futures  exchanges also call for improvement.    Liu said that the State has to enhance the management and  supervision of futures markets.    The State Council recently approved the Securities  Committee's circular on stopping the tendency of blind  development of futures markets, which demanded that local  governments rectify futures markets and exchanges.    The circular stressed implementing special measures over the  futures abroad and dealing with illegal futures trading.    The circular said that local governments and all central  departments should cease to approve setting up new futures  exchanges.    No agencies are permitted to engage in futures trading of  renminbi (Chinese currency) and foreign currencies.    Liu noted that the state enterprises and institutions taking  part in futures exchange must be under strict control.    The officials of provincial securities management  departments  and specialists attended the forum.</p>

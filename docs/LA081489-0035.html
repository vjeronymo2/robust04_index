			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING A U.S. GRANT -- HOW THE SYSTEM REALLY WORKS  </P> <P> It is a classic case of how Washington works -- of how insiders can use their  connections to circumvent the bureaucratic procedures that can pose obstacles  to those without special access.  </P> <P> At the same time, it demonstrates that political clout is a two-edged sword  that can cut surely through bureaucratic red tape but can also turn on the  wielder, with painful results.  </P> <P> The tale began in 1987 when Yeshiva Rav Isacshon, a well-regarded private  Orthodox Jewish primary school in the Beverly-Fairfax area of Los Angeles,  decided to seek federal aid to start a day-care center.  </P> <P> Instead of approaching the faceless Washington bureaucracy directly, the Los  Angeles group's first call was to a politically well-connected Brooklyn, N.Y.,  rabbi named Milton Balkany, who boasted that he met regularly at the White  House with then-Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan. Balkany went to Regan on the  yeshiva's behalf, and Regan put him in touch with the undersecretary of health  and human services.  </P> <P> In a matter of weeks, Oakwood Child Development Center Inc., the corporation  that the yeshiva had created to seek federal aid, had won a $1.8-million  Department of Health and Human Services grant to buy a building at 555 N. La  Brea Ave. and start a day-care center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Money Returned  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Los Angeles group, however, what looked at first to be a  successful maneuver has turned into a tangled controversy and the government is  now demanding its money back. The yeshiva, in turn, has called out even more  political clout, including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and several of his  congressional colleagues.  </P> <P> At Balkany's urging, Wilson has sponsored a bill, opposed by the Department of  Health and Human Services, that would permit the Los Angeles group to use the  money in a manner that does not have the government's approval.  </P> <P> Wilson, a candidate for governor, received $2,000 in contributions -- the  maximum allowable under law -- from Balkany and his wife, Sara, during his  primary Senate reelection campaign last year. But he says the contributions did  not influence his decision to offer the bill.  </P> <P> Yeshiva Rav Isacshon's initial decision to seek federal funds for a day-care  center grew out of its effort to expand its own operations, which are located  across the street from the La Brea Avenue building. According to local  officials, Yeshiva Rav Isacshon has recently been searching for ways to expand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rabbi's Explanation  </P> <P> Rabbi Yakov Krause, education director at Yeshiva Rav Isacshon, said in an  interview that the school created the Oakwood organization primarily to seek  government funding for the day-care center. He said the group contacted Balkany  because it needed advice on how to obtain federal funds.  </P> <P> Balkany, an old school friend of Krause, is a conservative Republican who  during the last election contributed thousands of dollars to Vice President  George Bush's presidential campaign and to 14 GOP Senate candidates. By his own  account, Balkany is so well known in Washington that he has been chosen to  offer the invocation at an annual dinner honoring the President for the last  several years, and he once even declined an invitation to become the rabbi  chaplain of the Senate.  </P> <P> It was Balkany's close relationship with Regan that prompted Oakwood to contact  him, he said. "The reason that they called me to get involved was because I  had, at that time, with the chief of staff in the White House, a meeting every  two or three weeks," he said.  </P> <P> When Balkany first talked with Regan in early 1987 about Oakwood's desire for a  federal grant, according to the rabbi, Regan summoned a White House car to  drive him across town to meet personally with Donald Newman, then  undersecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.  </P> <P> Balkany recalled that department officials instructed Oakwood to hire Robert  Brandwein, a Boston consultant, to put together the funding request, and  Brandwein received $6,500 for preparing the application.  </P> <P> On Feb. 11, 1987, Oakwood formally applied for a $2.3-million community  services block grant. Although the request far exceeded the $500,000 limit that  the department had set for such grants, the department awarded Oakwood $1.8  million on an "urgent" basis two weeks later without having an independent  review of it or comparing it with other grant applications.  </P> <P> On the day that the Department of Health and Human Services handed over  Oakwood's grant check, Balkany recalls, top-level department officials -- some  of them wearing yarmulkes in his honor -- hosted a champagne reception in  Newman's office. The rabbi was asked to say a prayer.  </P> <P> The community services block grant program makes about $300 million available  each year for projects designed to create jobs for low-income people. While the  money normally goes to state and local governments, Health and Human Services  officials are permitted to grant some money directly to local groups such as  Oakwood. Knowledgeable sources said a portion of these discretionary funds  usually go to reward political supporters of the Administration.  </P> <P> To receive the grant, Oakwood had to sign a pledge stating: "No portion of any  property or facility acquired or renovated in whole or in part with funds  awarded or otherwise acquired pursuant to this application will be used for  religious worship, sectarian instruction or any other religious purpose."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflict With Pledge  </P> <P> Shortly after acquiring the building, however, Oakwood officials sought  permission to use private funds to build additional floors on the structure, to  be used as classroom space by the yeshiva. The government first accepted but  ultimately rejected the plan as a violation of Oakwood's pledge to conduct only  non-sectarian activities in the building.  </P> <P> More than a year after receiving the grant, Oakwood applied for a one-year  extension and was turned down -- the first such recipient of a department grant  ever denied an extension. Instead, department officials ordered Oakwood to sell  the property at 555 N. La Brea Ave. and return all the money to the government.  </P> <P> Oakwood appealed that order, and a department appeals board is reviewing the  appeal. Meanwhile, the La Brea Avenue building stands idle, except for one room  that is being rented as office space.  </P> <P> As government attorneys see it, Oakwood officials were more intent upon using  the building for Yeshiva Rav Isacshon students than creating day care for  preschool children. "Oakwood didn't do its project because it was so very busy  trying to do another project," declared Madeline Neese, a Department of Health  and Human Services attorney.  </P> <P> Supporters of the Oakwood project contend that the department treated their  project unfairly. They charge that the department contributed to the delay by  failing to respond quickly to their requests for changes in the plan.  </P> <P> "The main reason why the project was not completed in the one-year period was  because (the department) has never replied to any of our requests for  clarification, etc., in a timely fashion," Joseph Bobker, an Oakwood official,  complained in a letter to the department in August, 1988.  </P> <P> Judging from testimony at the department's appeals board hearing, much of  Oakwood's trouble with the bureaucracy appears to stem from the way its grant  was obtained. Government sources said Oakwood would never have received such a  large grant without the help of Balkany.  </P> <P> Department of Health and Human Services employees testified that Balkany even  tried to ease the way for Oakwood at the department by promising to help one  top official obtain a better job in the Administration. That same official  testified that he received free tickets to a $1,500-a-plate political dinner  for President Ronald Reagan, where Balkany offered the prayer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Officials Involved  </P> <P> But the rabbi's political influence apparently began to wane as the officials  who approved the grant were replaced by others less sympathetic to the Oakwood  project. Balkany sought Wilson's support for the project shortly after Oakwood  received the grant in February, 1987.  </P> <P> Wilson, in an interview, said he decided to support the project many months  before receiving campaign donations from Balkany and his wife in late 1987. He  dismissed the $2,000 in contributions as insignificant -- nothing more than "a  tiny fraction of 1%" of the total cost of his $14-million reelection campaign  budget.  </P> <P> Wilson offered his legislation in the Senate last March 8, six months after  Oakwood was ordered by the government to return the grant on grounds that it  was not being spent in accordance with the original proposal the group had  submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services.  </P> <P> The bill would permit Oakwood -- if it wins its legal battle with the  department to keep its grant -- to use the building as a community center for  senior citizens as well as for child care. It also would allow both programs to  be staffed by local university students, who would be housed at the Oakwood  center. The bill is silent on whether the center could be used for sectarian  purposes.  </P> <P> Department officials strongly oppose the bill. Spokesman David Siegel said it  "would circumvent the department processes for making and administering grants"  and "would afford preferential treatment to one grantee over other  organizations and agencies which likewise seek support for their projects."  </P> <P> Wilson has tried other ways to help Oakwood. In 1987, according to aides, he  sought unsuccessfully to obtain additional money for Oakwood in an  appropriations bill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Capitol Hill Connections  </P> <P> Likewise, Balkany had previously called upon his political contacts on Capitol  Hill to help Oakwood. A number of other recipients of Balkany's campaign  contributions, such as Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), have made appeals to  the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of Oakwood.  </P> <P> In addition, Rep. Vin Weber (R-Minn.), another recipient of campaign  contributions from Balkany, tried last year to give Oakwood an additional $1.8  million for the child-care project without seeking the approval of the  Department of Health and Human Services. Weber's efforts to write the  appropriation into law failed, apparently as a result of opposition from Rep.  Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Waxman, whose congressional district includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, said in  an interview that he originally supported the Oakwood project but changed his  mind on the basis of Oakwood's dismal record of dealings with the department.  He added that he also opposes the plan for Oakwood as outlined in Wilson's  legislation.  </P> <P> In a recent letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan,  Waxman described Wilson's support for Oakwood as "illogical and inappropriate"  and added: "I do not believe any federal expenditures should be made on the  basis of political or personal friendship."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, if the department's appeals board rules that Oakwood can keep the  money, Wilson expects the Senate to approve his legislation quickly.  </P></p>

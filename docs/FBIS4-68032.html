			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Quito, 1 May (EFE) -- A low-intensity bomb that  exploded early this morning in Santo Domingo de los Colorados,  100 km west of Quito, and which did not cause personal injuries  has been the main incident of the legislative and gubernatorial  elections being held today in Ecuador.    Quito radio stations that reported the attack added the bomb  did not cause substantial damage in the building where it was  placed, and no information was known about the perpetrators.    There were two false bomb threats at polling stations in the  capital, and in Esmeraldas, a city on the Pacific Coast, three  people were injured in an incident between political  adversaries, according to a television network.    No incidents have been registered throughout the rest of  this  Andean country of 11 million people, except for delays in the  opening of polling stations due to the late arrival of electoral  officials, the lack of voting material, and similar cases.

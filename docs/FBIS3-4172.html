Chinese President Jiang Zemin reiterated the need for  patience on all sides and added pressure should not be used,  spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters after a summit meeting  between the two leaders.    Although there has been no breakthrough on easing tensions  on  the peninsula, Shen said, "China has its own diplomatic  relations with the DPRK (North Korea), so the diplomatic channel  between the two countries is open."    "China has made contacts with all the parties directly  concerned in the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and China  hopes that all these parties express patience and constructive  ideas," the spokesman said.    It was one of the clearest public statements concerning  China's involvement in the crisis over North Korea's refusal to  allow international inspections at areas of two sites suspected  of being part of a clandestine nuclear weapons program.    North Korea again lashed out Sunday at what it calls U.S.  imperialism.    But Shen maintained, "We have made a due effort but China  can  only play a limited role." He said the issue should be resolved  through dialogue between North Korea and its counterparts in  South Korea, the United States and the International Atomic  Energy Agency.    The two leaders did not discuss the proposed UN Security  Council nonbinding presidential statement concerning the issue  and raised Friday in New York, nor did they discuss the  possibility of hostilities breaking out, Shen said. [sentence as  received]    Concerning the United Nations, he said China's Foreign  Ministry's position is that "the rhetoric of such a presidential  statement shall be constructive and shall contribute to the  resumption of the three bilateral talks involving four parties."    "Such talks are the only effective way to settle the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula," he said.    When asked about the renewal of Team Spirit war exercises  and  the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea, Shen would  only say China is opposed to "any actions detrimental to the  deterioration of the situation on the Korean peninsula."    In the talks with Jiang, Kim expressed his desire to see the  issue solved through dialogue, without pressure and China would  continue to play its role, Shen said.    Kim, on the third day of a five-day trip to China, arrived  in  Beijing late Sunday and will hold talks with Chinese leaders  Tuesday and Wednesday.    Other than the nuclear issue, economic cooperation and trade  have been high on Kim's agenda with bilateral trade growing to  more than 9 billion dollars in 1993.    Kim is the first South Korean president to go to China since  former president No Tae-u visited one month after diplomatic  relations were established in August 1992.</p>

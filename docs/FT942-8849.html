			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (8): Where rugby is rife - The region's top sport derives from Great Britain The taxi driver from Castres is silent as he steers his Renault along the road to Toulouse. Silent, that is, until mention of the word rugby. 'Thousands of us went to Paris for the championship final last year,' he says proudly, before launching into a scrum-by-tackle analysis of the victory over Grenoble. It is a familiar topic in the Midi-Pyrenees. Mr Michel Castel, the mayor of Albi, becomes visibly excited when the sport crops up in conversation. From then on, investment strategies and the prospects of his Socialist party are described in terms of teamwork, tries and conversions. Professor Remy Pech of Toulouse-Mirail University, author of a book on the history of rugby, is similarly animated by the subject. A former player himself, he describes how his father would cycle 150km from Narbonne to watch the regional final in Toulouse. Such a common enthusiasm in such an ostensibly disparate group of characters reflects the importance of rugby in the region. 'All the people here care about rugby,' says Prof Pech. 'It provides a powerful social bond at every level, from quartier to village, town and city.' It has done so for the best part of a century. News of the game travelled east from Bordeaux in the 1890s and quickly took root in the Midi-Pyrenees. As in Bordeaux, there was an important British influence in the birth of the game. For example, Higgens, the captain of one of the first Toulouse teams was the son of the British consul. The expansion of the sport was rapid. From urban teams based on professions, notably vets and miners, rugby passed to villages and rural districts. Schools, according to Mr Pech, played a valuable role in rugby's dissemination throughout the region. The reasons behind the rise of rugby in the Midi-Pyrenees are as numerous as the local teams. For Mr Castel, the sport gives expression to the character of the region's inhabitants. 'It combines our Latin fire with the sense of teamwork and community,' he says. 'Rugby accommodates all types of people, from the large powerful forwards to the smaller fast wingers. When you look around the street, you can imagine a position for everyone.' The amateur status of the sport, and the strict rules which govern it, have also encouraged strong ties with the local communities. Mr Labbe, treasurer of the Stade Toulouse rugby club, points out that, unlike in soccer, it is extremely difficult to transfer rugby players from one club to another. The players must have a licence to represent their team and this requires a job or a student certificate. As a result, teams are largely comprised of local players. There are exceptions. Rob Andrew, the England captain, played for Toulouse in 1992-1993. Emile N'Tmack, the quicksilver Toulouse three-quarter who also plays for the French national team, came originally from the east of France. Such exceptions, however, tend to confirm the rule. Andrew had to find a job with a local company. The Toulouse club helped relocate N'Tmack's brother and mother when he decided to join them. Despite its strict codes and amateur status, the attraction of the game is strengthened by the social and economic opportunities it provides. Laurence Spanghero, one of six rugby-playing brothers in an Italian immigrant family, used his fame on the rugby pitch to develop his Cassoulet food empire. A local government representative in the Pyrenean town of Tarbes refers to employment advertisements in which rugby skills are cited as an advantage for applicants. Unsurprisingly, given the level of local support for the sport, the region has emerged as a powerhouse of French rugby. Many of France's leading teams, from Castres to Colomiers and from Toulouse to Tarbes, come from the Midi-Pyrenees. While Castres claimed the championship last year, Stade Toulouse look good for the 1994 title. Training in the Stade des Sept Deniers, the players work together as a slick unit. In the play-offs, they have already overcome an important hurdle by beating local rivals Colomiers by 32-12. Should they go all the way to the trophy, their exploits will provide any conversation that is needed in the taxis of Toulouse.</p>

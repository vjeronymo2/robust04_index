			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Boost for S Korean deregulation South Korea has launched a sweeping reorganisation of the government, including the merger of its two main economic agencies, the finance ministry and the Economic Planning Board. The measure is seen as an attempt by President Kim Young-sam to revitalise his programme for economic deregulation, which appears to have lost momentum recently due to bureaucratic resistance. Pressure is growing on South Korea to reduce its trade and foreign investment barriers and promote financial liberalisation as it prepares to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1996. The government reorganisation is expected to be followed by a large-scale cabinet reshuffle later this month once parliament approves South Korea's membership in the World Trade Organisation. The creation of the finance and economic board marks the demise of the EPB, which symbolised strong state intervention in the economy over the last three decades. The EPB was established in 1961 when the military took control of South Korea. It was the main architect of the country's subsequent rapid growth by issuing blueprints on economic development. But its role has declined in recent years following the downfall of the military dictatorship in 1987, with much of its power being transferred to the finance ministry. Since then, the EPB has become a supporter of economic deregulation, while the finance ministry is now regarded as the main centre of resistance to liberalisation. The merger of two agencies is considered an attempt by President Kim to leaven the ranks of the conservative finance ministry with EPB officials favouring reform. Mr Kim also hopes to reassert his authority over the bureaucracy by strengthening the role of the prime minister's office as policy co-ordinator for government administration. The ministries have increased in power in recent years following a decision by Mr Kim's predecessor, President Roh Tae-woo, to decentralise decision-making in order to promote democracy. The result, however, has been to give them the ability to hamper the Kim administration's deregulation proposals which represent a loss of power for bureaucrats and threatens their jobs. The prime minister's office will take control of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from the EPB, indicating that Mr Kim will renew efforts to curb the economic power of the country's leading industrial groups, or chaebol. Other main features of the government restructuring include the merger of the transport ministry with the construction ministry. This reflects government plans to spend Dollars 100bn on infrastructure projects primarily related to transport over the next eight years. The environment ministry will also be upgraded to cabinet status, reflecting concerns about increased pollution.</p>

This is the high hope placed on comrades working on the  propaganda and ideological front by the chief designer of  China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive.    Reform and opening up over the past decade and more have  greatly emancipated and developed China's social productive  forces, while socialist economic construction has attained  world-renowned accomplishments. The building of socialist  spiritual civilization has also made new headway. Judging from  the present situation of our practical work, however, we can see  that many localities have failed, to varying degrees, to pay  close attention to or make solid efforts in the building of  spiritual civilization. Moreover, malpractices such as money  worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism have spread in  society, the party style and the general social mood are not  satisfactory, and corrupt phenomena have multiplied. A failure  to put a resolute end to this situation and build a high degree  of socialist spiritual civilization would lead to our failure to  build up socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore,  molding people with lofty spirit means cultivating a new  generation with lofty spirit. This is an arduous yet glorious  task for the propaganda and ideological front.    What is the lofty spirit we are talking about? It is the  spirit of serving the people heart and soul, which was advocated  by Comrade Mao Zedong long ago; it is the spirit of "having  ideals, moral standards, education, and discipline," which has  been repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; it is the  pioneering spirit summarized by Comrade Jiang Zemin, which  reads: emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, making  positive explorations, having the courage to open up new paths,  carrying out hard struggles, pressing forward in the face of  difficulties, learn from foreign countries, persistently relying  on ourselves, being modest and prudent, guarding against  conceitedness and rashness, working with concerted efforts,  taking the overall situation into account, practicing thrift,  being honest in performing official duties, devoting great  efforts to making the country prosperous, and making selfless  contributions. All of these spirits have not only given  expression to the fine traditions of the communists, but have  also carried forward the traditional virtues of our nation. As  an embodiment of our valuable experience gained from the  building of our country over a long period of time and marked by  the distinctive features of our era, these spirits serve as  powerful spiritual pillars for the building of socialism with  Chinese characteristics. In the future, we will strengthen  ideological and moral education, which centers around  patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; carry out education on  building our country through hard struggle and thrift, on  professional ethics, social morality, and basic national  conditions; and do a good job in mass ideological work.    To mold people with lofty spirit, we need to integrate the  work closely with realistic conditions, as well as with the  goals and tasks of struggle put forward by our party. At  present, the whole party and the people of the entire country  are making vigorously efforts to implement the resolutions of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand opening up,  step up development, maintain stability, and strive to build up  a socialist market economic structure and bring about a fairly  comfortable life by the end of this century. Ideological and  moral education should obey and serve this overall situation.  We are now cultivating people of a new type under open, not  sealed, conditions. To reach our goal, we must carry out the  spirit of patriotism, enhance the self-respect and  self-confidence of our nation, and learn to recognize and resist  the dross while using for reference and assimilating the essence  of foreign cultures.    To mold people with lofty spirit, we need to deal with  different people in different ways and should refrain from  treating people with a fixed pattern. Because children,  teenagers, and the youth are the hope and future of our  motherland, we must further strengthen and improve education on  their ideals, morality, and discipline. We should uphold the  general direction while using different methods for different  people. The concrete content and forms of education should suit  the age and psychology of the young; in others word, we need to  integrate practical with abstract concepts, history with  reality, guidance with criticism, and words with action. By so  doing, we can, on the one hand, help them gradually establish a  correct outlook on the world, life, values, and morality, and  take a correct road in life, and on the other hand, bring up  reliable successors for our great socialist modernization cause.    Molding people with lofty spirit is a long-term and  complicated social systematic project, which cannot be fulfilled  with a little efforts by one or two departments; instead, the  success of the work relies on the well-coordinated cooperation  of all departments and links. As for the propaganda and  ideological front, all departments concerned, including  theoretical studies, education, press, publication, and  literature and arts, should all give full play to their own  unique functions and roles and make contributions to molding  socialist people of a new type. Besides, strong coordination  from law-enforcement departments is also indispensable. Without  the coordination of law and discipline, education will be  spiritless. Therefore, strict enforcement of law and discipline  is an indispensable means of molding people.    Educators should first receive education. Leading cadres at  all levels and the vast number of propaganda and ideological  workers should first mold themselves with lofty spirit, make an  exemplary role, and be honest in carrying out official duties.  We should keep in mind the repeated exhortations of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping: "The greater efforts our party and government  are making to implement various policies on economic reform and  opening up, the greater attention our party members, especially  the party's high-ranking cadres, need to pay to setting an  example on cultivating Marxist ideology and morality. If we  have disarmed ourselves ideologically, how can we educate the  young generation and lead the country and people to build  socialism?"    The building of a rich, democratic, and civilized modern  socialist country is based on the struggle of many generations  of socialist new people who have ideals, sound moral standards,  education, and disciple. Through their arduous, solid, and  fruitful labor, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front  should be able to turn more party members into "four-have's"  party members, more cadres into "four-have's" cadres, and more  young people into "four-have's" youth, with the aim that they  can commonly undertake the heavy tasks of history.</p>

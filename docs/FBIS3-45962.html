A number of  professional and technical experts came to the fore during a  recent submarine mine skill contest.    Our country was the earliest to invent and use submarine  mines. Submarine mine warfare was recorded as early as in 1549.  Submarine mines have attracted the attention of other  countries' navies because they can pose threats over an extended  period, can launch surprise attacks from hiding, and cannot be  eliminated easily.

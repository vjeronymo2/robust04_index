			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["People Believe in General Kim Chong-il" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today in  a political essay says the august name of the great General Kim  Chong-il, a dear name which the Korean people always call with  great pride and self-confidence, deeply reflects the  unquestioned trust in and worship for the illustrious leader,  the defender of their destiny who takes responsibility for their  destiny and leads them to a brilliant victory with his matchless  grit, iron will, broad magnanimity and warm human love, and  their unshakable faith and death-defying resolve to fight it  out, holding him in high esteem forever.    The political essay quotes great leader Comrade Kim Il-song  as saying:    "Comrade Kim Chong-il is respected and loved by the people  and enjoys high authority as a people's leader for his  leadership ability and personality, loyalty, devotion and feats."    The essay reads in part:    The distinguished greatness and extraordinary leadership  ability of our general as an illustrious leader taking  responsibility for the destiny of the people and leading them  lie in firmly defending socialism, their life and soul, from the  imperialists and glorifying it.    The intelligence of respected General Kim Chong-il is a  clairvoyant one of clearly seeing through what the enemy intends  to do at all times and unfolding operations in a far-sighted  way. It is a flexible stratagem of striking at weak points of  the enemy with his mysterious and marvelous strategy and tactics  according to the situation and circumstances and bringing  victory on his own initiative.    His grit is a matchless grit of not wavering under whatever  thunderstorm but countering any large Army, and an all-mighty  strength of forging ahead in any storm and stress.    His spirit is one of certain victory, his magnanimity is an  unfathomable one like the ocean into which all the rivers, big  and small, empty, and his human love is a fiery one pulling at  the heartstrings of the masses.    General Kim Chong-il and our people are an integrated whole  sharing the same destiny, linked by one blood, one breath and  one ideology.    Ours has become a people with a great purpose, strong faith  and inexhaustible strength as they repose unquestioned trust in  respected general Kim Chong-il and follow him.    Voices of the people vowing to become rifles and bombs and  defend him with their lives constitute the acme of the immovable  faith, the highest reach of the minds of the people who believe  in and follow respected General Kim Chong-il, like a gem stone  monument of the times erected high.</p>

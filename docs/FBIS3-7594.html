			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Wednesday [30 March] denied that he was personally  involved in a 1986 purchase of 300 shares of giant Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT).    Hosokawa told the House of Representatives Budget Committee  he never met the investment consultant who said he arranged the  deal on behalf of Hosokawa. "I have never met (the consultant)  nor sought his advice," Hosokawa said in response to a query by  Taro Nakayama of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Japanese  Communist Party lawmaker Zenmei Matsumoto.    What the consultant says "is not a fact," he said. Hosokawa  says the share transaction was conducted by his late  father-in-law. It is not known whether the deal was legal.    Earlier, Shuzo Fujiki, the consultant, said at an  LDP-arranged press conference in the Diet building that the  transaction was the prime minister's own. Fujiki said he  arranged a 418 million yen loan for Hosokawa's former aide from  a stock investment company to help finance the purchase of 300  NTT shares in 1986 just after NTT went public.    Fujiki said the stock investment financing company agreed to  allow Hosokawa to use the name of his father-in-law at the  request of Hosokawa's financial secretary Masatoshi Miyama.  When Fujiki visited the company in October 1986 with Miyama,  the former Hosokawa aide asked a company official to permit the  use of a name other than Hosokawa's for the account for the loan.    Everything concerning the transaction was conducted "on the  assumption that it was Mr. Hosokawa's own deal," Fujiki said.  He said he is willing to testify before the Diet about his  allegations.    Over Miyama's involvement in the stock deal, Hosokawa said  all he knows is that Miyama provided advice to his father-in-law  from time to time, dismissing the call for Diet testimony on the  matter by the former aide.    Concerning a murky loan Hosokawa took from a scandal-tainted  trucking firm, Sagawa Kyubin, which had paralyzed the Diet  budget business for three weeks, the Communist Party's Matsumoto  said there were some faults in the documents the prime minister  submitted to the Diet. But Hosokawa only responded by saying,  "They are all documents maintained by Sagawa Kyubin."    "I borrowed 100 million yen from the company, and nothing  more," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Teresa Poole: "Kim IL-song Spells out Terms for </F> Nuclear Peace"]    [Text] Beijing -- President Kim Il-song of North Korea is  prepared to freeze his country's nuclear programme in return for  US diplomatic recognition and other concessions, according to an  American scholar who met him for three hours last Thursday.    Selig Harrison, an Asian affairs specialist, said in Beijing  yesterday that Mr Kim wanted the US and other countries to  guarantee that they would supply North Korea with a light water  reactor if Pyongyang suspends what is widely viewed as an  attempt to develop nuclear weapons. Mr Kim disclosed his terms  as the US and South Korea prepared to impose sanctions on North  Korea for not allowing international inspection of its nuclear  facilities.    North Korea, which says it will view sanctions as an act of  war, threatened South Korea last week with devastation and  warned that Japan would face "deserving punishment" if it joined  an embargo. The crisis impelled President Bill Clinton to devote  four hours of meetings at the White House on Friday to the  sanctions question.    Mr Harrison, who met Mr Kim, 82, at a residence outside  Pyongyang, described the dictator as an alert man who did not  seem bent on nuclear confrontation. "I found him very sharp,  very alert. We talked for two hours and he was absolutely  forceful, and alert, and quick and sharp. After the two hours,  at lunch, he was a little -- like anyone at 82 -- slower, and he  wasn't talking as much. But he's walking well and seems fine."    He described Mr Kim's parting words: "He chainsmokes, and he  shook his cigarette at me and threw down his matches, and said:  'The point is we (the US and North Korea) must be on good terms  with each other, and then we will both know everything about  each other. And we mustn't put preconditions. How can you  expect (us) to let a country with which we are still at war know  everything about our country?"    Mr Harrison said North Korea would not build nuclear weapons  if the US gave it diplomatic recognition and lifted the economic  embargo in place since the 1950-53 war. North Korea also wants  a US guarantee not to use nuclear weapons first on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

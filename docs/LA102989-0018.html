			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> RECIPES OF MEMORY;  </P> <P> A BANQUET RESURRECTS AN ALMOST-FORGOTTEN MEXICAN CULINARY TRADITION  </P> <P> THE FEAST began with a blur of wings.  </P> <P> Days before, my grandmother Delfina had decided to get rid of the pigeons  crowding the coop that leaned against my aunt's back-yard fence in Canta Ranas  (Singing Frogs), one of the older Southeast Los Angeles barrios. The pigeons  roosting in the tall, battered coop had become too fertile, and when I looked  up into the coop's feather-tufted plywood boxes, I saw that they squirmed with  plump, young birds. It was the late '50s. I must have been 8 years old.  </P> <P> My grandmother set our feast in motion by calling her sons and nephews to  slaughter the innocents. My cousin and I were assigned to clear out the large  abandoned grocery store next door, where the meal could be served more easily.  A confusion of smells -- overripe fruit, dust, cilantro -- lingered amid the  store's clutter of old furniture and splintered sawhorses. Next door, under my  Aunt Estela's patio, my father and his brothers had their hands full --  literally -- of gray down as they plucked and dressed dozens of birds.  </P> <P> DELFINA, I LATER discovered, had turned to the past for the day of the feast.  She had unearthed the sopa de pichones (loosely translated, squab on saffron  rice) recipe from a collection recorded in an elegant, elliptical script by my  great-great-aunt, Catalina Clementina Vargas. The recipe is one of 109 dated  June 7, 1888, and it has little to do with today's notions of nouvelle Mexique  or the Tex-Mex fare we've come to associate with Southwest cookery. Instead,  Catalina's old recipe typifies the cuisine of Guadalajara, which is roughly  comparable in function and complexity to provincial Cantonese or French  cuisines. Unfortunately, in Los Angeles, history conspired to drive this aspect  of Mexican cooking underground. But it is part of a rich, 400-year-old urban  tradition that endures in the private kitchens of families like mine.  </P> <P> My grandmother simmered the squabs with parsley, onion and garlic in her large,  weathered pot. She cooked the rice in the broth of the squabs, adding freshly  ground cloves, cinnamon and saffron. Finally, minutes before serving, she  returned the squabs to simmer again in the broth and rice suffused with  paella-like spices. The trick, my aunt recalls, was leaving enough broth to  impregnate the squab with the spices without leaving the rice too dry.  </P> <P> In the meantime, my cousin and I had cleared enough space in the empty store  for a long row of tables. By early evening, when everyone had arrived, my  grandmother and my aunt proudly made their entrance with platters of squab on a  bed of fire-orange rice. Garnishes of raw, sliced onion immersed in vinegar,  salt and a hint of oregano, and gallon jars of iced, sweetly sour jamaica  (hibiscus tea) also were brought to the table. My grandmother took her  customary pleasure in serving my uncles, cousins, aunts and eldest sister, who  wasn't quite sold on the idea of eating baby birds. Midway through the meal,  Estela says, Delfina probably made everyone laugh by telling how her first try  at getting rid of the pigeons failed when the birds returned to their old coop,  flying all the way back from her brother-in-law's house a dozen or so miles  away in Artesia.  </P> <P> I'm not sure what else Delfina prepared. My aunt says she's certain the meal  would have opened with steamy bowls of puchero, a hearty soup swimming with  carrots, turnips, zucchini, parsley, beef bones, some chicken and garbanzos or  rice, which Delfina cooked in the pot tea-bag-style by placing the grains in  small cheesecloth sacks. A simple lettuce salad dressed with olive oil and  vinegar might have preceded the main course. The whole affair would end with a  sancocho de guayaba, a typical Mexican dessert of halved guavas stewed in  cinnamon and piloncillo, an unrefined, flavorful sugar.  </P> <P> It is the taste of squab and saffron that stays with me. I found the faintly  bitter, smoky intensity of saffron, made bolder with cinnamon and cloves,  intoxicating. Between bites of pickled onion, I sucked the dark meat from  diminutive bones and probably stained my shirt. Afterward, the tables were  pushed aside and our parents began to dance. I lay my head on my grandmother's  lap and fell asleep as she smoothed my forehead.  </P> <P> But my great-great-aunt's squab recipe wasn't the only source of my  grandmother's culinary inspiration. A year before she was married, my  grandmother and a cousin had copied another 141 recipes from Catalina's mother,  Trinidad Vargas. All of these recipes, in their own curious way, open windows  to another time.  </P> <P> For example, Catalina's consume violento (violent consomme) is as much an  elegant, subtle soup as it is a proclamation of romantic sentiment. The recipe  gets its name from the manner in which an egg yolk and Jerez (Spanish sherry)  are briskly whisked into a steamy tureen just before it is served to admiring  guests. Delfina kept the memory of Catalina's time alive by preparing her soups  for both her immediate and extended family.  </P> <P> MY GRANDMOTHER'S culinary influence also followed me home. Besides the typical  recipes from her home state of Jalisco, Delfina taught my mother how to prepare  a delicate, aromatic stew that has a poetic title -- conejo en huerto meaning  "rabbit in the garden." This stew, fragrant with quince, plantain and Spanish  olives, was derived from one of Catalina's recipes with substitutions for  hard-to-get ingredients such as tejocotes, a pungent, apple-like fruit from  central Mexico.  </P> <P> "I believe she (Delfina) was a superb cook," my mother, Lilly Valle, told me  recently. "If she taught anyone, she wanted them to learn to do things her way.  Like the recaudo (a puree of roasted tomato with onion or garlic added to soups  or sauces), which is a basic part of Mexican food. To me, some of these things  seemed like minor details. But she would get angry if you didn't do it her  way."  </P> <P> I'm convinced that for Delfina, the recipes were nothing less than formulas for  invoking cultural and culinary values as well as personal memories. They  reminded her that she was both Mexican and a daughter of Guadalajara's mestizo  (racially mixed European, Indian and African) petit bourgeoisie.  </P> <P> After doing some culinary archeology, I realized that many of the recipes  represented a distinct Guadalajara cuisine. The recipes that follow, for  example, don't appear in 19th-Century Mexican cookbooks, such as "El Nuevo  Cocinero Mexicano," a dictionary of Mexican cuisine that was published in Paris  in 1872 and is only available in rare-book collections, or, to my knowledge, in  any texts published since then. This isn't surprising.  </P> <P> Recipes in 19th-Century Mexico were usually passed from mother or aunt to  newlywed daughter or son. A middle-class Mexican kitchen was more likely to  contain an updated 18th-Century version of a Spanish cookbook than a Mexican  cookbook. It would take a revolution in 1910 and its convulsive nationalist  aftermath for Mexico to take greater pride in preserving its mestizo art forms.  </P> <P> For me, these recipes have more than a strictly culinary meaning. Knowingly or  not, my great-great-aunt, my grandmother and my aunt passed along to their  descendants a tradition of recording family history while preserving Spanish as  a written language in a sometimes hostile English-speaking world. Despite the  stereotyped peasant image of Mexicans, these recipes are reminders that a huge  portion of Mexican cultural history was written in cities, which still shape  artistic styles and gastronomic revolutions. These recipes spring from a rich  urban cuisine that predates fajitas or nouvelle experiments to elevate comida  casera (home cooking) to haute elegance. More lie buried in all the places  where memories are hidden. Estela and my wife, Maria, by reviving the following  recipes, have merely indicated a way of excavating this culinary history in our  midst.  </P> <P> CONSUME VIOLENTO  </P> <P> (Violent Consomme)  </P> <P> 4 cups Puchero  </P> <P> 1small white onion, or braised or roasted and quartered  </P> <P> 1 medium tomato, roasted, peeled and seeded  </P> <P> 3 teaspoons olive oil  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg  </P> <P>  1/2 teaspoon finely cracked white peppercorns  </P> <P> 1 bay leaf  </P> <P>  1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 egg yolk, slightly beaten  </P> <P>  1/8 cup Jerez Sherry  </P> <P> 1/4 cup Italian parsley, coarsely chopped Croutons  </P> <P> Grind roasted tomato and onion in a molcajete (basalt mortar and pestle) or  place in blender at high speed for 5 seconds.

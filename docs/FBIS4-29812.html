			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (AFP) -- Human rights activists  Tuesday called on western powers to take action against  President Suharto's government for banning three publications.    The weeklies TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK were banned after  running articles sharply critical of a close associate of  Suharto.    Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation chairman Adnan Buyung  Nasution said, "I would say (US) President Bill Clinton should  say something and drop his plans to come to Indonesia" in  November for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meet.    Saying he was "very angry" and calling the action an "abuse  of power" he also said Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating  should call off his visit next week.    Keating is due to arrive for the biggest Australian  promotion  ever in Jakarta called "Australia Today."    "I hope he (Keating) also understands the feelings of the  people here and announces that he will not come to Indonesia,"  he said.    Political Sciences professor Arief Budiman said he hoped  that  Indonesia's main creditors would let Jakarta know how they felt.    "I hope there will be an intervention from abroad," he told  AFP.    The Consultative Group on Indonesia, chaired by the World  Bank, is due to hold its annual meeting on financial aid to  Indonesia July 7-8 in Paris.    By far the largest donation comes from Japan, followed by  France and the United States.</p>

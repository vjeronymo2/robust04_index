			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ARRESTED DURING PROTEST AT UCSD  </P> <P> Two men were arrested Tuesday at a UC San Diego protest by animal rights  activists outraged about the use of dogs for a campus laboratory class on  emergency medical procedures, according to UC San Diego police officials.  </P> <P> The identities of those arrested was not released, but one man was arrested on  suspicion of trespassing and another on suspicion of giving false information  to a police officer, said Sgt. Stephen Branen.  </P> <P> A banner with the words "Stop Dog Lab" was displayed over the Basic Science  building where the lab class is scheduled to take place, said Sally Meckler,  director of San Diego Animal Advocates, one of three organizations sponsoring  the protest. About 100 protesters were at the campus.  </P> <P> "Physicians will basically be cutting dogs up to learn trauma techniques,"  Meckler said. "They are already licensed doctors. They could learn much better  by working on an anatomically correct model."  </P> <P> Attempts to reach university administration officials were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREFABRICATED CLASSROOMS OKD  </P> <P> The City Council has agreed to extend a building code variance permitting the  Anoakia School to use prefabricated trailers as temporary classrooms.  </P> <P> The one-year extension, approved 5-0 last week, will allow the private school  to continue operating at 758 Anoakia Lane.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, fire officials had sealed off the temporary classrooms  because the sprinkler systems were not hooked up to a water source. Frustrated  by that action and what they said were other burdensome fire code warnings,  operators of the school decided to close the school by June.  </P> <P> After meeting with city officials, school administrators later agreed to  install a working sprinkler system and to keep the school open until at least  1990.  </P></p>

He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on  the  ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994,  has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance,  what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated.    Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian  parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the  START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the  Ukrainian  missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated.  "This  goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements.  It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate  100%  of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict  accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he  said.    According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine  will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state.    Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership  for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue  calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept.  Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / O&amp;Y plans to sell some US office property OLYMPIA &amp; YORK plans to sell about a dozen of its US office buildings and concentrate in future on high-quality properties in a limited number of cities. The disposals, as well as restructuring of some debt and new loans, are required to keep the developer's US operations outside the court protection granted last month to its businesses in Canada and the UK. The extent of new borrowings is likely to depend on O&amp;Y's success in attracting tenants to its buildings. The extra money is required for refurbishing to meet new tenants' needs, and for brokers' commissions. The advances would be secured by the leases. Mr John Zuccotti, who heads O&amp;Y's US operations, is understood to have told lenders that the company intends to retain its flagship buildings, notably the World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan, as well as properties in Boston and Los Angeles. Properties to be disposed of represent about a third of O&amp;Y's 29m sq ft of office space in the US. They include 55 Water Street in Manhattan, the world's biggest office building. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y and its lenders in Canada have postponed court hearings due to start today on applications by several groups of lenders to 'carve-out' individual buildings from last month's order freezing O&amp;Y's debt obligations. The lenders, which include some European institutions, contend that they lent to single-purpose companies without recourse to O&amp;Y. The company says it needs to keep all creditors at bay if it is to succeed in restructuring its CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 6bn) debt. Fears have been expressed that a court order confirming O&amp;Y's actions might undermine what has become one of the most popular forms of property financing in North America. Mr Justice Robert Blair of the Ontario court of justice will, however, hear numerous other motions today from creditors seeking to protect their interests. At a meeting in Toronto today, one of the Canary Wharf administrators is due to outline initial proposals for the future of the project in London's Docklands. Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, has flown to Canada to meet representatives of the 11 banks which lent Pounds 500m for the construction of Canary Wharf. Contractors consider action, Page 22</p>

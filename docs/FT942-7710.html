			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Foreign investors block Hungary telecoms float Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, the German and US telecoms companies, have blocked the Hungarian government's plans to float Matav, the national telecoms utility, on the Budapest stock market. Hungary's state holding company, AV RT, sold 30 per cent of Matav to Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech in December, in eastern Europe's largest single privatisation. The AV RT, with its residual shareholding of 67 per cent, hoped to sell a further tranche of shares to the Hungarian public this autumn. The public offering was to have been the centre piece of the conservative government's mass privatisation programme. Its delay is another severe blow to the scheme. In any case, the Hungarian Socialist Party is likely to form the next government after the second and decisive round of elections on May 29, and the former communists have vowed to end the small-shareholder programme. Under local law, approval from shareholders with at least 75 per cent of the capital is required before a listing can be sought, so the foreign groups have been able to block an immediate float. A Matav committee investigating possible timing for the flotation is expected to recommend holding off until 1995 or even 1996. Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech believe Matav should go to the stock market once their revamp of the utility becomes visible to the market. Matav, which is at the start of a Dollars 4bn investment programme, last week reported after-tax profits of Ft1.6bn (Dollars 16m) for 1993 and expects only to break even this year. Moreover, an early flotation of Matav, one of Hungary's largest companies, runs the risk of overwhelming the Budapest stock exchange, the least active of the three main east European bourses. Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech fear a public offering this autumn could only succeed if it were priced below the level investors paid at the end of last year: Dollars 875m for a 30 per cent stake. While it would be the AV RT that bears the direct loss, US regulations would force Ameritech to value its investment at the prevailing market price and make a write-off. Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech have little incentive to use a premature flotation to increase their shareholdings, because their consortium has effective control of Matav's operating committee and day-to-day management. The Matav case exemplifies the difficulties inherent in the Hungarian authorities' efforts to combine the sale of controlling stakes in state companies to industry investors with later public offerings of its residual shareholdings. French hotel group, Accor, has held back the flotation of the Hungarian hotel chain Pannonia Hotels.</p>

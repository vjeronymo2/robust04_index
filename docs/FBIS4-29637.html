			<p>BFN     [Text] Oita, June 19 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Sunday it will be difficult  for Japan and the United States to reach "a complete agreement"  in their framework trade talks by the G-7 summit meeting  scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples.    At a press meeting in Oita, western Japan, Hata did not  elaborate further, but said the two countries have already  agreed on the direction of the trade talks. Hata also said that  Japan would not agree to setting "numerical targets" since it  could lead to managed trade. Japan has strongly refused U.S.  demands to set numerical targets to measure progress in the  opening of the Japanese market. Hata added that Japan will not  replace "objective criteria" with numerical targests.    Both Japanese and U.S. officials have said they want to get  an agreement at least on some industry sectors prior to the  Naples summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized  nations. A bilateral summit meeting between Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled in  Naples.    The current trade talks between Japan and the U.S. focus on  seven Japanese market sectors of particular interest to U.S.  firms. Among them are Japanese Government procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment, insurance, and  automobiles and auto parts.    The two countries have also kicked off negotiations to ease  market-access regulations in Japan's financial sector, tighten  the protection of foreign patents and copyrights in Japan and  increase sales of foreign-made flat glass in Japan.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 0000 GMT on 29 December broadcasts highlights of the morning  session of the National Assembly of the People's Government  [ANPP] plenum at the Convention Center in Havana. ANPP President  Ricardo Alarcon opens the session, stating: "With 533 delegates,  a 90.8 percent attendance, we declare our meeting open. It is  now our duty to examine the third point of our agenda, the  discussion of ratification of the decree laws and accords issued  by the Council of State. We have in our hands a note from  Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, president of the Council of State,  listing the decree laws and accords issued from 1 June to 30  November 1993."    Alarcon gives the floor to delegate Alexis Hernandez who  expresses full support for decree laws no. 141 and 142, but  stresses concern over their unregulated application, and speaks  against the potential "for selfishness, personal interests."  Delegate Alicia Blanco Fernandez states that decree law 141  lacks some definition and needs clarification of the activities  it comprises.    Delegate Genoveva Morales observes that people are upset  with  the halt on licenses for certain self-employment jobs and with  the fact that messengers are exempt from paying taxes. Alarcon  stresses that comrades have spoken in support of ratification,  but have expressed concerns with implementation of the decree  law. This, he says, is not the issue.    Castro states: "Alarcon, I agree with what you have said and  with the issue of methodology. Nevertheless, I am worried about  the concerns of our comrades, some of them presidents of the  People's Councils, who have to answer this and that.    "Some comrades have brought up ideological issues. They  said:  I agree with this; but I do not like that because it might  result in this or that consequence, misuse. I well understood  the first two who spoke. But I did not understand the third  comrade very well. I do not wish to get off the agenda and  dedicate today, tomorrow, and the next day to discussing this,  perhaps until 2 or 3 January, because we would destroy the  agenda if we changed it. This is enough material for three days."    Castro chats about the messenger job and the granting of  licenses.    Delegate Genoveva Morales adds that she disaproves of the  fact that certain comrades are growing rich inappropriately and  asks where they are getting the fuel, meat, rice, beer, and  beans.    Castro adds: "I am not bothered by the uneasiness. This  means  that people have a socialist awareness; they do not like to be  robbed. That is bad news for the supporters of capitalism. Man,  if the people do not understand this, how in hell are they going  to resign themselves to living under capitalism? Capitalism is  constant, incessant robbery, permanent, incessant inequality. I  do not know if Alarcon wishes to talk a bit more about this."  Alarcon and Castro chat about the number of speakers who have  asked to speak.    Castro states: "If there are mistakes, we are all  responsible  for those mistakes -- those who have promoted and issue decree  laws. We could bring the comrade responsible for the decree here  to speak. Everyone knows that we have to speak here and take  responsibility for what is done. There are evident  contradictions that anyone can understand. We have done certain  things here that I have half regretted. It is the truth, but we  cannot deny that there are contradictions."    Delegate Jose Antonio Perez Gonzalez stresses his concerns  with decree law 141. He believes that honest people should be  allowed to be self-employed, and that although these jobs will  not solve problems, it will help many people. He adds: "I do not  think all these people are dishonest."    Delegate Maria Ducas observes that there is uneasiness among  the population regarding the fact that messengers do not pay  taxes while others have many regulations piled on them.  Likewise, there is a lack of control by the inspectors. The  people are not aware of the details of the law, and certain  comrades have been given licenses while others have not. Ducas  gives examples of People's Council involvement in regulating  proper implementation of the law, recommends that the granting  of licenses continue, and that they stop worrying about where  the supplies are coming from.    Delegate Jesus Infante stresses that the problem with decree  141 is a lack of information among the people and a lack of  standardized implementation. However, more of a consultation  process ia required to avoid misinterpretation at the base level.    Delegate Rodolfo Serrayonga points out that decree 141 is  needed, and that its aspects are necessary and useful. The  problem, however, lies in its implementation and control.  Regarding messengers, Serrayonga stresses that a clear law  regulating this service was annulled and replaced by vague  guidance in decree 141. He adds: "What they have done is to  regress in the case of the messengers." He goes on to say  base-level bodies must ensure proper implementation.    Delegate Manuel Sanchez Sardina expresses support for decree  141, but notes that there are some activities not included.  Sanchez expresses concern with the video-show job, which might  present an ideological danger, since no regulation exists on  what can be shown.    Alarcon gives the floor to delegate Xiomara Rivero who  observes that the delegates must consider how the people  accepted the decree and that like other presidents of People's  Councils, she was told of the promulgation of the decree by the  people, and that problems would have been avoided had a broad  consultation process been conducted. She agrees with previous  speakers that the base level bodies are responsible for proper  implementation of the law.    Delegate Jasin Chaspar observes that decree 141 is like  building a train engine without any cars to follow, in this  case, the inspection corps. He stresses that inspectors also  need to be supervised, and that there is room for blackmail and  bribery. He stresses that the People's Councils' role is very  important.    Raul Castro is shown sitting in the assembly.    Alarcon introduces Francisco Linares, minister president of  the State Committee for Labor and Social Security, but gives the  floor to Delegate Lazaro Barredo who wishes to make a point of  order.    Delegate Barredo states: "Comrade president, I made my  request to speak on this issue to the floor attendant yesterday  morning because rather than on a problem of implementation, I  had prepared an address on several concerns regarding the  conception of the decree law. I made my request to speak, in  writing, yesterday morning. I do not know what mechanism has  violated my human right to speak. I am worried because I truly  had certain concerns. I had been writing my address since  yesterday on the conception of the decree, rather than its  implementation. I would like to ask to be allowed to speak."    Alarcon tells Barredo that he himself was not told of  Barredo's request, and that since Linares had already been given  the floor, he would speak first, then Barredo could do so.    Francisco Linares states that the decree does not establish  self- employment. Self-employment was established in 1978. The  decree simply extended the number of approved activities and the  requisites for those activities. He observes that no other  legislation has caused as much interest, and that they have  visited the provinces and talked with the workers. He goes on to  say that two meetings have been held to analyze the application  of the decree; that the concerns expressed by the comrades are  the concerns we have all had. Linares points out, regarding the  corps of inspectors, that steps have been taken in the provinces  to establish controls and that this decree is helping to solve  some of the problems being faced in the country.    Linares acknowledges that they did not establish what light  foods are, and that it was necessary to eliminate this activity  because many of these restaurants or stands began to appear in  Havana City. It was decided in a meeting with all the presidents  of the provincial People's Governments not to grant any more  permits for this activity. Linares observes that they had to  stop the taxi service because these taxis had began offering  their services to tourists, and that was not the idea.    Linares stresses that the decree stipulates that the list  can  be increased or reduced, and that steps are being taken to  regulate its implementation. Linares observes that there is no  need to worry or believe that this will solve all problems, nor  is it a prelude to capitalism.    In the case of messengers, Linares observes that they have  always existed and that this decree establishes exemption for  messengers. He believes it is a good idea for messengers to be  charged a license fee. He concludes by observing the number of  measures that have been taken.    At this point, Politburo member Carlos Lage states that  they need to continuously examine the responsibilities and  implementation measures, the scope of consultation and prior  analysis, before taking a measure on implementation of the  decree law. He stresses that the issue is complex and that not  all is related to implementation, but to the issue's complexity  and how it relates to the country's situation. Lage observes  that the decree law should be reasonably malleable and that  changes will be studied to perfect implementation.    Lage stresses that the decree represents months of  consultations and that they were waiting to see how it would  work in its initial months. Lage points out that the complaints  stem from lack of control, irregularities in implementation, and  what is being done in practice, which have nothing to do with  what was approved.    Lage observes that the five jobs suspended were discussed  and  analyzed and that he believes there is a consensus on the need  to approve the decree.    Alarcon and Castro discuss the point of order made by Lazaro  Barredo. Alarcon suggests postponing his comments until after a  recess. Castro states: "Alarcon, but we did tell him he could  speak." Raul Castro States: "Yes, we have to fulfill our  promise."    Fidel Castro and Alarcon discuss the intricacies of point of  order procedures, efforts to keep the agenda's order, but still  being able to give the floor to Barredo.    Barredo states that the two basic pillars of the nation,  when  it comes to implementing changes, are independence and social  justice, adding, "A social justice that does not mean  egalitarianism or paternalism, but a social justice incompatible  with forms that go against social ownership. Commander, as you  mentioned in the Union of Cuban Journalists Congress: Our  socialism has to be more efficient with state ownership as the  base, linking responsibility and capability, linking the  economic sense of control with costs, production, and services;  all this without rejecting other concepts of social ownership,  such as the cooperatives in certain sectors and as it is being  done in certain areas of agriculture."    He adds that certain points of decree 141 somehow raise  doubts on ethical questions. Barredo warns that there is a  pattern of inappropriate profiteering and illegal resources in  projects such as this. Barredo stresses that self-employment is  a vital need, but that in its implementation, there is gray area  between self- employment and profiteering [meroliquismo]. He  adds that turning those jobs into cooperatives might have been  more appropriate, thereby avoiding competition between  self-employment and state services. Barredo denounces the theft  of spare parts for use in self-employment repairs. Barredo  stresses that cooperatives might not make more money, but are a  good tool to prevent negative trends.    Castro asks Barredo what the moral of the story is: "Should  we approve it or not, reject it or not?" Barredo answers that he  is not against the decree, that it is important for Cuba, but  that these issues must be pondered independent of its approval.    At this point, Castro addresses the plenary for 90 minutes.  This material is covered by Fl2912195592 and adds.    Following this address, Fidel and Raul discuss removing the  "etc." from the decree law. Raul asks: "Can this be done? I do  not believe so. This has to be approved by the assembly. If we  do not take out the `etc.,' we can agree to take out the `etc.'  and that is it. Can this be done or not? If it cannot be done,  do not even invite me to another assembly." Raul says this as he  abruptly pushes the microphone away. This is followed by  applause.    Alarcon states that it is possible to do so because the  "etc." only makes things more confusing. Fidel Castro,  chuckling, states: "Approved the removal of the `etc.' This is  not a solution, but it should help."    Alarcon agrees and takes a vote on all decrees by show of  hands. The video cuts to closing applause. No figures are given  on pro or con votes, or abstentions.</p>

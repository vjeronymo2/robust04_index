The decision, made in an unofficial session after a cabinet  meeting, supports a proposal put forward by the Food Agency,  which said the move is needed to stop hoarding of domestic rice.    The move was criticized by Wakako Hironaka, director general  of the Environment Agency, as going against the government's  deregulation policy, the sources said.    They said Farm Minister Eijiro Hata stressed to the cabinet  that consumers should not rush to purchase for fear of a  shortage, saying, "Japan has sufficient rice. There is no need  to worry."    Regarding blending, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said the  government needs to tell the public how to cook foreign rice.  This view was echoed by Manae Kubota, director general of the  Economic Planning agency.    The farm minister told reporters after the cabinet meeting  that his ministry favors blending because it wants rice to be  distributed equitably among consumers amid the shortage of  domestic rice.    Referring to growing criticism that consumers will be forced  to buy foreign rice, he said, "I know there are some problems  about blended rice. Our ministry will monitor a wide range of  opinions, including when to start distributing the blended rice."</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Sport: Is this grand prix's saviour? - Motor Racing / The flag rises on the first season with a 'technology ban' Max Mosley may have saved grand prix from itself. When the cars line up for the start of the Brazilian grand prix at Interlagos tomorrow, they will no longer have on board highly complex electronic systems which have been painstakingly, and expensively, developed by the leading teams. Out go traction control, anti-lock brakes and 'active' suspension systems under the 'technology ban' which Mosley has orchestrated in his role as president of the Federation Internationale de l'automobile, the Paris-headquartered motoring organisation which is also the world's governing body of motor sport. Inevitably, there have been grumbles from front-running teams such as Williams and McLaren, which have invested so much time, money and effort in them. But, in the small Knightsbridge office which serves as the FIA's London base, Mosley - former racing driver and March racing team founder - this week painted a startling picture of just how far the technology had already gone in taking control of the car away from the driver, and why the authorities felt they had no choice but to intervene. The logical consequence of the route the technology was taking, he maintains, was the virtual disappearance of the driver's role - and with it, sport administrators feared, spectator interest in what would have become a life-size Nintendo game. 'This trend is already happening with road cars, which are becoming more and more self-driving, and this is a good thing because it will reduced stress and road accidents. 'But there was a device in use (in grand prix) last season in which, when the red lights turned to green, the driver would press a button; the computer would maintain the engine at optimum revs; it was the computer which depressed the clutch, engaged first gear, let the clutch out, stopped the wheels spinning, changed up to second gear when necessary, then into third and so on. All the time, although spectators weren't aware of it, the driver would just steer, thereby eliminating one of the great skills of racing.' Without the ban, this year would have seen the introduction of a sensor to watch the start lights. 'When they went to green it would have started the whole process automatically, without the driver even pressing a button.' And that, says Mosley, was just current stuff. Coming along was technology which would steer all four wheels so that if you went into corner too fast and slid, the computer would sort it out. Provided the driver didn't make a fundamental misjudgment beyond the laws of physics, it would turn any driver into a Senna. 'Endless similar things were coming. And we thought that if we allowed these things to continue, we would fairly quickly eliminate the driver. One skill after another would go until, in the end, almost anybody would be able to drive the car. It's all technically fascinating and very relevant to road cars - but we felt it would destroy an essential element of grand prix racing,' said Mosley However, the widely-held perception that grand prix is turning its back on technology per se is wrong, he maintains. 'The car can still be as high-technology as you like, and that is the way Formula One should be. The only caveat is that it must not replace the driver.' After lengthy discussion of the detailed regulations with teams and the Formula One Constructors Association - led by FIA vice-president Bernie Ecclestone - Mosley insists: 'No team is going to Brazil in any doubt about what we (the FIA) think on any issue.' Mosley and Ecclestone say there will be harsh penalties for any team that seeks to use the technology surreptitiously. One hoped-for result from the ban is that: 'in a given car the best driver will be able to demonstrate his superiority'. Thus when the lights go green tomorrow drivers will be competing more evenly than for years. With recent world champions out of the running with Alain Prost confirming his retirement and Nigel Mansell racing for a second year in IndyCars, the questions are endless: will Damon Hill really not be intimidated by his new team-mate at Williams, the ruthless, three-time world champion Ayrton Senna? Will Mika Hakkinen, the young flying Finn, be able to mount an effective challenge in the McLaren-Peugeot? Is this the year that Jean Alesi finally brings Ferrari back from obscurity? Or will the hard-charging German Michael Schumacher give Benetton its big break? But it will be what happens further down the field which will be almost as important for Mosley. The technology ban, he hopes, will give a break to the smaller teams for whom developing such technology 'would have been ruinous in the current economic climate.' Grand prix teams cost what Mosley himself acknowledges as 'horrifying' amounts to run. 'To be in with a chance of finishing in the points a team needs not less than Pounds 10m, and to run at the front they would need Pounds 30m - that's plus a deal with a major engine manufacturer.' Even with the technology ban it will cost any team Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m just to get on to the back of the grid and keep running. 'But if we'd kept on going the way we were they would have needed more than Pounds 10m.' Another positive effect of the partial technology ban is that it is already encouraging new entries. Two new private teams, Simtek and Pacific, have already signed up and Mosley maintains that Peugeot has come into grand prix only because of its new-found stability. At least two more large European manufacturers - names circulating around the grand prix world are BMW and Audi - are expected to join as early as next year, and Honda is also expected to return with its own engine and car. Mosley accepts that for the leading grand prix teams, the technology ban has been very annoying. 'But we must bear in mind that grand prix research is on a very broad front and that what we've banned is a very narrow bit. All the rest is usable. You've only got to look at how much faster the cars are already, even without the banned technology, because there's been such an enormous amount of research on aerodynamics, materials, chassis dynamics and engines.'</p>

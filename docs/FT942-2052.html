			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Improving market lifts Imry to Pounds 18.3m Imry Holdings, the property company that was taken over by Barclays after one of the biggest debt write-downs in corporate history, yesterday announced a return to profitability. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.3m for the 12 months ended March, compared with a loss of Pounds 24.5m last time. Net assets increased by 26 per cent from Pounds 71m to Pounds 89.3m, while gross property assets rose from Pounds 290m to Pounds 367m. Mr Martin Myers, chief executive, said he believed that 'Imry is well placed to take advantage of a generally improving market, which I expect to continue for the next few years'. Mr Myers said Barclays did not intend to continue to own Imry in the long term, although there were no immediate plans to float the company. 'We are not really thinking about it. We are too busy building up the company,' he said. Barclay's involvement in Imry stems from 1989 when it financed a leveraged takeover. During the year, Imry bought Pounds 145m of property, while sales totalled Pounds 39.6m. The largest deal - in partnership with GE Capital - was the acquisition of 77 properties for Pounds 112m. This was funded by loans from GE Capital, Barclays Bank and Imry Property Holdings. It also bought 13 development properties for Pounds 5.9m from General Accident. Following the year end, Imry has reached agreement with Southampton City Council to develop a 30 acre site in the centre of the city into retail warehouses and a 500,000 sq ft retail scheme. No dividend is proposed.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Unnecessary EC recession WATCHING THE European Community's economy has become like watching a crash in slow motion. With the bumpers already crumpled, the question is whether the occupants will survive. Only last week one driver, Mr Jacques Delors, argued that 'the very idea of a united Europe is in peril'. But what does he suggest? That the EC should drive further in the same direction. Hard times breed conspiracy theories. Many, for example, blame current woes on 'speculators'. Some go still further. Mr Raymond Barre, former French finance minister, argued last week that some people were determined to prevent the creation of European economic and monetary union by blowing up the EMS. Such theories rest on the assumption that the largest and most liquid market in the world -  foreign exchange - can be manipulated by private institutions more effectively than by central banks. It makes more sense to ask whether 'speculators' have reasons for acting as they have. They do. Suppose, for example, that an investor believes there is a 20 per cent chance of a 5 per cent devaluation of the French franc against the D-Mark over the next three months. That would be quite enough to justify the current interest rate premium on three-month money of nearly 4 percentage points. Is it unreasonable for investors to believe this? Hardly. Why, after all, should they believe that a new French government will tolerate what seems to be an unnecessary recession, especially if rising unemployment turns out to cause an overwhelming defeat for the current government? It is not enough to agree that the realignments might have come sooner. The problems facing the EC are more fundamental. The truth is that, however beneficial it may be in normal circumstances, the ERM is unable to cope with the unique problems created by German unification. The initial consequence of German unification had to be a real appreciation of the D-Mark, in order to allow resources previously exported through the current account surplus to be used within the German economy. Such an appreciation could, indeed, have been achieved by earlier acceptance of the realignments wanted by the Bundesbank. But unification had the additional and probably inescapable consequence of raising German interest rates, especially at shorter maturities. Higher interest rates in the ERM's anchor currency became the floor everywhere else. As investors came to realise how inappropriate those interest rates were for the EC as a whole, the higher interest rate premiums had to become. High real interest rates cannot be evaded by realignments alone, unless those realignments are large enough to offset the deflationary effects of the interest rates or to persuade the Bundesbank to keep interest rates down. Thus the position advanced by Mr Delors last week -  that there need be nothing wrong with realignments, provided there are fundamental economic divergences between members and the realignments themselves are not a 'wildcat' affair -  misses the point. Because the principal difficulty is not inadequate competitiveness vis-a-vis Germany, but high real interest rates, temporary bands wide enough to allow a country such as France to put its short-term interest rates below German levels would seem the rational response. But the ERM would be transformed by this means into a managed float, which is what most European governments abhor. What remains is hanging on. Maybe the 'glimmer of hope' identified by Mr Delors in the Bundesbank's recent easing will soon become a flood of light. That is, indeed, the only way to combine the present ERM with satisfactory economic performance throughout the EC. But will the Bundesbank oblige? It seems unlikely. In the last resort Germany might offer accelerated monetary union to France and a few other countries. Yet this too is no safe solution. Such a union might not be on offer. It may also not ease French interest rates that much, while exacerbating political tensions within the EC. The causes of the current discontents are not just that the EC offers toil, tears and sweat, but that it offers unnecessary toil, tears and sweat. Maybe this is just an unavoidable episode on the EC's journey to economic and monetary union. But it is increasingly difficult to see why.</p>

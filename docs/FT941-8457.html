			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suzuki Spanish offshoot applies for protection Santana Motor, the troubled majority-owned Spanish subsidiary of Suzuki of Japan, was forced to apply for protection from its creditors yesterday in the face of mounting losses. The move raised fears that it could close down its assembly plant in southern Spain, unless the company received help from the government. Santana is one of the leading makers of four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles in Europe and produces the Suzuki Vitara and the Suzuki SJ series. The financial collapse is a second setback for the Japanese vehicle maker's expansion plans in Europe following the Volkswagen group's decision last year to abandon the joint development programme for a small car between Seat, its troubled Spanish subsidiary and Suzuki. Suzuki, which holds an 82 per cent stake in Santana, said that it was only prepared to cover losses of Pta5.2bn (Dollars 36.9m) to help restore the company's balance sheet, a sum that falls short of the capital injection required by Santana. It was prepared to continue to provide technical and commercial support but said that it would not make any additional financial contributions to salvage Santana. Santana is understood to have current assets of Pta24.5bn and liabilities of Pta22.6bn. The company's losses jumped by 53 per cent to Pta6.3bn in the first nine months of last year from the corresponding period a year earlier. In July it had accumulated debts of Pta16bn. Suzuki's decision to apply for receivership underlines the gravity of the crisis in the Spanish motor industry, where both Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of Volkswagen, and Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish subsidiary of Nissan of Japan, have suffered heavy losses and have undertaken drastic restructuring programmes. Suzuki said it did not feel bound by previous agreements on financial, technical and commercial assistance to Santana that had been undertaken with the regional government of Andalucia. In March last year, it was agreed that subsidies by the local authorities would match a Pta12bn three-year investment plan for Santana. This agreement was jeopardised by the financial problems of the Anadalucia government and when an attempted financial restructuring of Santana ran into difficulties. This involved a write-down of the share capital to offset losses and a subsequent rights issue. The financial collapse is threatening the Santana plant at Linares, near Cordoba, which has a workforce of 2,400 people. Production at the plant, which chiefly assembles the Suzuki Vitara, fell by 6 per cent last year to 36,700 units from 39,000 in 1992. It had forecast a drop this year to 25,000-30,000 units, and output fell by 38 per cent year-on-year in January to 1,654. Suzuki appears unwilling to shoulder alone Santana's financial problems. Its losses have risen sharply under the impact of the recession in the west European new vehicle market, and under the impact of the appreciation of the yen, which lifted the cost of imported components.</p>

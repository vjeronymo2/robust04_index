			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OLD HOMES MAY MOVE TO PARK  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach City Council will hold a public hearing July 11 on the  proposed use of Dominguez Park as a place where historic old homes scheduled  for demolition could be preserved. Officials said a citywide search failed to  turn up any other suitable sites.  </P> <P> If the plan is approved, the 20-acre park at Beryl and 190th streets would  provide space for several homes, beginning with the Morrell House, which is on  a temporary foundation at the Perry Alison Playfield.  </P> <P> The city paid about $80,000 to move the house from North Catalina Avenue to the  play field in March, but abandoned plans to set it up there permanently after  neighbors protested that they were being deprived of recreational space.  </P> <P> Public Works Director Ken Montgomery estimated that it will cost about $17,000  to move the Morrell House another 1,200 feet to Dominguez Park, a former city  dump site. Another $33,000 has been included in the proposed 1989-90 budget to  cover costs, which would include the installation of a permanent foundation and  a fence to protect the house from vandals. The Historical Society is raising  money to restore the turn-of-the-century home.  </P> <P> Montgomery said establishing an area for historical homes at Dominguez Park  will not detract from other uses of the park, which has a Little League field,  a playground, basketball courts, rest rooms and parking.  </P></p>

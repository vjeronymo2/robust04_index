"There is no hope for us if we don't practice real  democracy," according to Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of a  seven-member delegation which held talks here with 'Arafat and  close colleagues on Sunday and Monday.    He told AFP it was too early to announce the results of the  meetings which were to continue until Tuesday.    "We want to broaden the decision-making structure so that it  does not stay entirely in Abu-'Ammar's ('Arafat's) hands,"  'Abd-al-Shafi, who led negotiations with Israel in Washington  before the autonomy accord was signed in September, said after  arriving in Tunis Sunday.    He added he would call for a "collective leadership."    'Arafat agreed to meet the delegation representing 120  prominent Palestinians who two weeks ago sent the PLO leader and  executive committee a petition calling for more democracy in the  organization.    It called for mapping out a strategy for the self-rule  negotiations with Israel, setting up a committee for directing  the talks, and choosing negotiators based on merit rather than  on political considerations.    The petition also demanded respect for human rights once the  Palestine Liberation Organization assumes responsibility for  affairs in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.    At least six of the 12 executive committee members support  the demands, according to a Palestinian official.    'Abd-al-Shafi, a founding PLO member who has for months  demanded more democracy, said: "Committee appointments should  not be made only on the basis of political and personal  considerations."    He stressed the need to use Palestinians of ability at this  "decisive" time, when the PLO and Israel are failing to make  headway in implementing an accord for limited self-rule in the  Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.    Three leading figures in the Palestinian uprising against  the  Israeli occupation resigned December 26 in protest at 'Arafat's  decision to name a 13-member council to head Fatah operations in  the Gaza Strip.    'Arafat said the resignations had stemmed from a  misunderstanding and promised "serious changes will be carried  out" in the Fatah leadership in Gaza in order to satisfy the  three.    But a draft constitution for the Palestinians during  autonomy  was published in Jerusalem last Thursday putting wide powers in  'Arafat's hands.    'Arafat is named as the president of a highly-centralized  system with a five-year term in office, renewable once only, but  there is no reference to elections.    He controls the police and security forces, issues laws  after  ratification by the legislative authority, grants pardons and  may hand out capital punishment.    The constitution guarantees an independent judiciary under  the rule of law and recognizes freedom of religion, opinion and  the press and the right to work.    On Saturday, 'Arafat's Fatah faction urged all Palestinian  groups to help build a democratic state.    In a statement to mark the 29th anniversary of its creation,  Fatah said "democracy and political pluralism" would be at the  foundation of a Palestinian state and he pledged to "defend" the  principles of democracy.    Talks on the final status of the occupied territories are to  start in the third year of Palestinian self-rule. Opposed to  the interim autonomy accord are several PLO factions and Moslem  fundamentalist groups.</p>

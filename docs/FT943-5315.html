			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / This Week: Television 'She probably cried rape because the geezer didn't please her'. That's the opinion of one juror in a rape trial. How do we know? Because Network First (Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm ITV) has come up with a hybrid documentary format which allows the camera to be a fly on the jury room wall for the first time. A group of actors devise characters for themselves and with the help of police and the courts let us see what happens from the moment a rape victim rings the police to the point where the lights are turned off in the court. The police, barristers, judge and jury behave exactly as if they were dealing with a real case and the entire proceedings are filmed with two hand-held cameras and available light. This illuminates the process, without the artificiality of reconstruction, in which one feels sorry for nervous policemen stumbling over their lines. To what extent what we see is artificial and how the presence of the cameras affect behaviour is debatable but it is undoubtedly engrossing. The trial will be shown in three parts (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 2.20pm, ITV) and an edited omnibus version, next Tuesday evening. Paranoia thrillers which play with power politics are very much the fashion since the BBC's enormous success with the two Michael Dobbs serialisations - House Of Cards and To Play the King. Faith (Wednesday and Thursday 9.00-10.00 and 10.40-11.40, ITV) a four - hour original screenplay is the latest to come to the hustings and looks set for a landslide. Michael Gambon is P J Moreton, a former minister about to return to office. But first he must pay the political price by committing perjury. Customs and Excise is after the DTI which had secretly sanctioned the sale of arms to African guerrillas who are using them to shoot British aid workers. The scapegoat is a small-time arms dealer who is waiting to be slaughtered at the Old Bailey. Moreton also happens to be sleeping with his male researcher and there's even a press baron with strangely antipodean vowels who has satellite TV interests. The roman a clef element gives the piece its initial appeal but the drama takes on its momentum, helped no end by a superb cast, including: Susannah Harker, John Hannah, Keith Allen and Connie Booth.  The highlight of the week. The proms season comes to an end this week with the annual brouhaha which may seem a modern aberration but in fact began in 1895 when Sir Henry Wood ended the first Proms season with Koenig's Post Horn Gallop. The Last Night Of The Proms (Saturday 7.45-9.00pm BBC2) has Wood's arrangement of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Wood, who had been castigated for his other arrangements, did not claim authorship of the Bach until it had been played a few times and been well received. The fixtures of the last night, though, are Land Of Hope and Glory and the Hornpipe. The latter was introduced to mark the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar and the promenaders tried to outdo the orchestra by tapping their feet faster and faster. That boisterousness has now become the distinguishing factor of the evening. So much so that Sir Malcolm Sargent once had to appeal to the audience not to throw 'streamers of excessive width'. He meant toilet rolls.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BLUES AVENGE LOSS TO JETS, 4-2  </P> <P> Brett Hull, the NHL's top goal scorer, hit two posts and didn't put the puck in  the net, but the Blues started a new winning streak Tuesday night at St. Louis  with a 4-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets.  </P> <P> Gino Cavallini scored with 5:47 left in regulation to break a 2-2 tie and  avenge the Blues' 4-3 loss to Winnipeg Sunday night.  </P> <P> That defeat, in which Hull scored twice, had ended St. Louis' six-game winning  streak.  </P> <P> This time, Ron Wilson clinched the victory when he scored into an empty net  with 10 seconds left.  </P> <P> Serge Momasso put the Jets in a tie, 2-2, at 11:41 of the final period.  </P> <P> Hull had five shots in the first period, when the Blues had eight shots in one  two-minute power play.  </P> <P> "They gave it back to us tonight," Jet left wing Doug Evans said. "They played  the third period the way we did the other night."  </P> <P> Chicago 3, Edmonton 1 -- The Oilers had reason to feel pretty good after  winning three in a row at Edmonton. But the Blackhawks, the hottest team in the  NHL, quickly changed that.  </P> <P> Chicago, which dominated from the start, extended its unbeaten streak to eight  games (6-0-2). DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

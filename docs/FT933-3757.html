			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Investment that deserves the risk - The Speculator / In the first of a new series on high risk investments, David Harris of accountants Chantrey Vellacott, examines the use of share warrants WARRANTS are an excellent medium for both investment and speculation, but there seems to be a widespread lack of understanding of how they work. They present the chance of earning capital gains (warrants pay no income), making them an attractive proposition for speculative and longer-term investment. As a general rule, the investment performance of warrants will exaggerate individual share price changes. Therefore, if the market is in a 'bull' phase and moving upwards, holders of warrants will likely do better than ordinary shareholders. In a 'bear' market, the reverse is true. Technically, warrants are transferable quoted option certificates issued by companies. They entitle the warrant holder to buy a specific number of shares within that company, at a pre-determined price, at a time, or during a specific time in the future. They are traded on the Stock Exchange in the same way as the underlying shares. There are some 200 warrants listed on the Stock Exchange, issued by a variety of companies from many market sectors. However, the market is dominated by the investment trust sector which accounts for around two-thirds of the total amount of warrants in issue. The conversion terms governing the date, price and number of shares for subscription are set when the warrant is issued and companies are obliged to adjust these terms for any subsequent rights or capitalisation issues. The precise date for the conversion of warrants will vary considerably and it is therefore essential that investors are aware of the precise conversion details. The life of a particular warrant is specified at the time of issue. In general, they will have a lifespan of several years and may, in exceptional cases, be undated. Most of the current crop last well into the late 1990s and beyond. Advantages The first and most obvious attraction of a warrant is that an investor gains rights over a large number of shares for a relatively small outlay. For instance, if XYZ Plc shares are priced at Pounds 1 then for an outlay of Pounds 1,000, the investor would hold 1,000 shares. However, if, instead, that individual bought warrants in XYZ Plc (where each warrant conferred the right to buy one share) at 20p, then his initial investment of Pounds 1,000 would give him control over 5,000 shares and, therefore, offer a greater potential capital gain. Warrants also offer gearing. In essence, this is the opportunity for a larger percentage capital gain (or loss). Using the example of XYZ Plc, if the share price rose by 10p from Pounds 1 to Pounds 1.10, then a gain of 10 per cent will be produced. During the same period, individuals could expect the price of warrants to rise similarly from 20p to 30p - a rise of 50 per cent. The gearing factor can be calculated by dividing share price by warrant price. Generally, the higher the gearing factor, the greater the opportunity for large capital gains. Disadvantages The benefits of the gearing effect also work in reverse, thus exacerbating any fall in the underlying share price. Furthermore, if the underlying share price stays or falls below the exercise price during the subscription period, then the warrant is effectively worthless. Warrants do not have any redemption value if they are not exercised. Warrants do not rank for dividends and do not give the warrant holder voting rights or the right to attend ordinary shareholder's meetings. They simply provide the opportunity and right to buy shares on the agreed terms. Before deciding whether to invest in this area, it is important to have some idea of how to assess the attractiveness of warrants and have a knowledge of how to deal in this specialised market. Next week, I will set out ways of evaluating the attractiveness of any particular warrant and point you in the direction of specialised advice on what is basically an under-researched market sector.</p>

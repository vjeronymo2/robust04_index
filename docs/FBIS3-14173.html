			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by T.V. Venkatachalam, associate editor of </F> NATIONAL HERALD: "Indo-U.S. Relations"]    [Text] India-U.S. relations have taken some hard knocks of  late because of the remarks made by President Bill Clinton and  American officials, particularly Ms. Robin L. Raphel, assistant  secretary of state, on the sensitive subject of Kashmir. It is  a matter of history that in the evolution of Western policy  toward the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan, what  was proper and legal according to the accepted international law  and norms was not always followed. Cold War diplomacy and  strategic considerations had their impact on the policy. Over a  period of time, however, certain degrees of balance came to be  restored in the relationship even before the Cold War ended.  The big powers recognized that India has its legitimate  national interest and this country on its part gave the benefit  of doubt to those who were treading on its toes, conceding that  it might not be intentional.    The recent U.S. statement questioning the accession of Jammu  and Kashmir to India may not mean a change in the previous  policy formulation as far as the U.S. is concerned. The  American utterances, however, come at a time when Pakistan is  engaged in a proxy war to destabilize the situation in the area,  pursuing the same sterile policies which landed the subcontinent  in costly wars in the past, hurting their people. In such a  situation, India does not expect friendly nations to queer the  pitch for her with statements that exacerbate the situation.  For India, or for that matter for any country, it is a serious  issue if its sovereignty and unity are questioned. The  challenge to the fundamental facts of national existence cannot  be glossed over with clarification and explanation. It cannot  be that properly equipped foreign offices ignore historical  facts. The circumstances in which India's secular policy  rejecting the two-nation theory based on religious differences  became an integral part of Indian thinking and ethos are too  recent to be forgotten.    The whole range of Indo-American relations is marked by  several positive factors. The two great democracies share so  many human values. The potential for mutually beneficial  economic and business cooperation is enhanced by India's  liberalized economic policies. In the cultural, educational, and  technological fields, there are long-standing friendly  exchanges. These have to be strengthened at the political  level. With due regard to each other's vital interests, it  should not be difficult to find solutions to problems arising  from the reactivated U.S. policy on Kashmir and the possibility  of its supply of some deadly F-16 aircraft to Pakistan which  will adversely affect the security situation in the subcontinent.    In the present context, it is a matter of satisfaction that  there is an awareness of the issues involved and a measure of  goodwill for India in responsible sections in the United States.  At a recent hearing of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee,  American senators were appreciative of India's vital concerns,  including those on Kashmir. Some of the senators sharply  criticized the administration's handling of South Asian affairs.  Those who were critical of the utterances of Ms. Raphel  included Senator Hank Brown, Republican; the former U.S.  ambassador to India, Mr. Daniel Patrick [Moynihan], Democrat;  and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican. Mr. Daniel Patrick  [Moynihan] who visited New Delhi last month and had talks with  the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, sought to assure India  that there is no change in U.S. stand on Kashmir and America  believes that the Simla accord provides a sound basis for the  amicable settlement of the issue. To the extent that they  recognize the need to reassure India of their bona fides, the  American explanations and clarifications are welcome. A real  concern for India's vital interest, which in no way conflicts  with the national interests of other countries, can help in the  ironing out of the differences that have cropped up.</p>

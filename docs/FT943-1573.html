			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Observer: Buoyancy test Limping back under tow to the Hamble River, near Southampton, last night was a dismasted 41-foot Beneteau sailing vessel named Ingotism. Its doughty crew, who had dispatched a Mayday call in the early hours as they struggled against the elements off Barfleur in the Bay of the Seine, hailed from the registrar's department of the Bank of England in Gloucester. And yes, Ingotism is the pride of the fleet at the 20-year-old Bank of England Sailing Club. Open to all staffers working for the Old Lady, the Club boasts nearly 200 members, and the Commodore is none other than Eddie George, who inhabits that rank not by virtue of his governorship but because he enjoys messing about in boats. While the good ship will, at best, be in dry dock for some time, all hands were safe. The governor was on terra firma all day, and the gilt-edged market, for once, was not taking on water either yesterday.</p>

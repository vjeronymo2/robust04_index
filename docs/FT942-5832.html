			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Compaq Computer cuts prices in attempt to win market share Compaq Computer has sharply reduced the prices of several of its personal computer products in an attempt to expand market share. The Texas-based company has set its sights on overtaking IBM and Apple Computer to become the PC market-leader by 1996. The price reductions range from 4 to 29 per cent, with the deepest cuts applying to its sub-notebook PC, the Contura Aero, which will sell in the US at Dollars 999 for the basic model. Compaq also lowered prices on its multimedia Presario models, which incorporate a CD-ROM player, by about 13 per cent. Prices will now start at Dollars 1,299. High-performance Pentium-based desktop PCs and servers were reduced by up to 18 per cent. With its latest price cuts, Compaq is moving aggressively to undercut its largest competitors. 'With this move we (will) set the pace for value leadership in the PC industry,' said Mr Ross Cooley, senior vice-president. Compaq's US shipments outstripped those of IBM and Apple in the US market for the first time during the first quarter of this year, according to Dataquest, the US market research group. 'Compaq took advantage of Apple's PowerPC transition and IBM's traditionally slow first quarter to jump out to an early US PC shipment lead - but we expect it to be a close three-way race by year-end,' said Mr Philippe de Marcillac, director of Dataquest's PC group. Compaq captured the first-quarter lead by shipping nearly 55 per cent more PCs in the US than in the same period last year, he said. The US PC market as a whole showed strong growth, with shipments up by more than 17 per cent over the first quarter of 1993. The top 10 PC manufacturers accounted for all of the growth, with sales by smaller PC makers declining, according to Dataquest.</p>

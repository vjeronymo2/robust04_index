			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, Italian National Alliance </F> leader, by Carlo Fusi; place and date not given: "Fini: `So  Much Arrogance Against Us'" -- first paragraph is IL MESSAGGERO  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "I wonder how many of these arrogant  gentlemen have read our programs or know that we call ourselves  post-fascists." Gianfranco Fini opened his umbrella (or,  rather, his parasol, since he will be spending the weekend by  the sea) to ward off the deluge of charges being leveled by  politicians and the international press. He responded with the  following attack: "Such a hullabaloo is the result of the  propaganda of the left-wing parties, which are seizing the  opportunity to gain more space in their respective countries."    [Fusi] Is it only propaganda? The [French] Socialist Rocard  is even proposing a boycott....    [Fini] Everyone knows that in Italy Rocard's remarks count  for absolutely nothing. It is a polemic that serves only  election campaign interests. France too will be voting in the  European elections....    [Fusi] Pardon me, Mr. Fini, but are you not worried about  the  negative image that this is earning Italy?    [Fini] It is not true that there are negative reactions  abroad. What is going on is the result of left-wing activists.    [Fusi] Is the NEW YORK TIMES a left-wing activist, too?    [Fini] No, in that instance, it is a question of  misinformation and superficiality, the result of intellectual  laziness. They have a view of Italy that does not correspond to  the present situation.    [Fusi] So will the alarm over "the fascist ministers" have  no  repercussions abroad?    [Fini] The governments are not worried about it, nor do they  have any reason to be. It is enough to wait for a few weeks in  order to dispel any uncertainties. One of the new Italian  Government's first tasks will be the G-7 meeting. On that  occasion it will be clear to everyone that the positive  evaluation of Italy will not suffer any threats because our  country will not veer away from the options already adopted in  the international context, nor will it fail to honor its  pledges. And it will also be clear that the National Alliance  ministers will not carry out any action that could modify  Italy's positive international image.    [Fusi] You are trying to play matters down, but the anxiety  remains.    [Fini] I am not worried. It is a campaign which will soon  die down, precisely on the basis of the actions taken by  Berlusconi or his various individual ministers. Be that as it  may, I will soon be touring Europe's capitals to explain who the  National Alliance is and what it wants.    [Fusi] Will that be enough?    [Fini] In Strasbourg [European Parliament] we will not join  the far-right groups. As everyone knows, we are not allies of  [French National Front leader] Le Pen, and we will continue on  that path.    [Fusi] The anxiety is not confined to other countries. Some  people maintain that the president too suggested not including  MSI [Italian Social Movement], but only National Alliance  ministers in the government....    [Fini] Nonsense. There have been no vetoes, nor could there  be any. The president is the guarantor of the Constitution, and  the Constitution does not prohibit any individuals from becoming  a minister. The only guarantee with regard to the ministers  must be provided by the prime minister -- first and foremost,  concerning the ethics of the individuals chosen, and also  concerning their belief in democracy and freedom. But these  principles apply to all future ministers, not only those of the  National Alliance.    [Fusi] The fact remains that it is Scalfaro who must sign  the  ministerial appointment decrees.    [Fini] I repeat: There will be no problems, nor could there  be any.    [Fusi] What do you think of [Chief Prosecutor] Borrelli's  decision to remain in charge of the corruption investigation  panel?    [Fini] He was quite right. It seems clear to me that he is  trying to keep the panel united.    [Fusi] What about [Judge] Di Pietro, who has denied that he  wants to become minister of the interior?    [Fini] I have already said that I would welcome Di Pietro as  interior minister. This, even though I believe that his chances  have faded now.    [Fusi] Mr. Buontempo takes issue with you. Does that not  worry you either?    [Fini] Teodoro is contrary by nature. He is the only one who  is worried, and I am pleased to leave him to his worries. I  have always said that the National Alliance is a confederation  of several members, and one of these is the MSI. Buontempo's  fears are exaggerated and obsolete.    [Fusi] So is there no right-wing fringe on the MSI side?    [Fini] If it does exist, I will take note of it. But it  certainly cannot influence me. I will not turn back: The  option for the National Alliance is definitive, and will become  increasingly so. We will contest the European elections with  that symbol and of 87 candidates only 45 are MSI members. In  any case, this is the only possible way.</p>

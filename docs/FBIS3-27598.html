			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Chuen Liang (0193 5328): "Recent </F> Seminar on China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Reveals  That China Will Adopt New Strategy of Exchanging Markets for  Technology"]    [Text] At a seminar on China's foreign economic relations  and trade in the 1990's held a few days ago, senior officials  from China's foreign economic and trade departments revealed an  "overall strategic concept" for foreign economic relations and  trade in the 1990's. In the sphere of utilizing foreign  capital, it covers the practice of exchanging markets for  technology, a change from providing preferential treatment to  certain regions to guiding them with industrial policies,  amendments made to relevant policies according to GATT  requirements, the provision of "citizen treatment" for  foreign-invested enterprises, and so on.    The concept also proposed that 10 extra-large foreign trade  enterprises should be capable of competing with large  multinational corporations and should be set up in China within  five to eight years.    As pointed out in the "strategic concept," China's foreign  trade increased by 16 percent each year between 1978 and 1992,  which was seven percentage points higher than the national  economic growth rate.    Foreign trade in the 1990's should continue growing at a  rate  three to five percentage points higher than that of economic  development.    Taken as a whole, this "overall strategy on economy and  trade" formulated by senior economic and trade specialists  includes the following aspects:    -- The formation of a domestic and international open  pattern  of multiple directions, channels, and areas; the development of  a diversified markets with stress on the Asia-Pacific region;  and the accelerated unification of the domestic and  international economies.    -- An extensive merger of foreign economic and trade  undertakings, including the merger of foreign trade, foreign  capital, foreign investment, and other foreign economic and  trade businesses; "integrated" and coordinated development of  commodities, technology, services, and trade; the close  integration of multilateral, regional, and bilateral economic  and trade cooperation; the close integration of trade, industry,  agriculture, technology, banking, and commerce; and the  integration of macroeconomic regulation and control at home and  abroad, thus forming a concerted force for China to participate  in international competition.    -- Great changes in function, such as the expansion of the  scope of foreign economic and trade, increasing contributions  made to the economy as a whole, the promotion of industrial  structural readjustment, and exercising a comprehensive, guiding  role in economic and technological advances and industrial  development.    In the utilization of foreign capital, it is necessary to  increase scale, pay more attention to quality, and enhance the  level of utilizing foreign capital in the regions of central and  western China; carry out the practice of exchanging markets for  technology; change from providing preferential treatment to  certain regions to guiding them by industrial policies; expand  the investment scope of multinational corporations; participate  in the international division of labor with regard to technology  and knowledge-intensive industries; grant treatment as citizens  to foreign-invested enterprises; and extend the utilization of  foreign capital to banking, insurance, transportation, commerce,  and so on.    In importing technology, it is necessary to strive to  increase the proportion of advanced technological equipment from  30.8 percent in 1990 to 40 percent by the end of this century,  and greater emphasis should be laid on importing strategic  industries.    In overseas investment, the proportion of investment abroad  and the importation of foreign capital should be around 1:0.15,  and work should be focused on giving export guidance, developing  natural resources, and importing technical know how.    The concept put forth the necessity of establishing a number  of large, comprehensive and internationalized foreign trade  enterprises operating as enterprise groups, Chinese-style  business firms with the nature of industrialized and  internationalized foreign trade enterprise groups, and 10  extra-large economic and trade enterprises capable of competing  with big multinational corporations within five to eight years.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian brokers worry over exchange rate policy Sao Paulo recovered most of a mid-morning fall of 2.4 per cent, the Bovespa index closing 166, or 0.46 per cent, off in local currency terms at 35,643. Volume was thin, and brokers said that concern over the government's exchange rate policy was keeping foreigners out of the market. They said that foreign investment in Brazilian markets came to an abrupt halt this week as the central bank implemented a new exchange rate policy which was clearly designed to inhibit foreign capital inflows. A trader said: 'There were almost no foreigners buying because of the exchange rate, and some Brazilian investors are selling to invest in fixed-income.' But brokers said the tone was stable due to the expected success of the government's anti-inflation plan. Mexico Equities were traded cautiously awaiting the result of the FOMC meeting in Washington, the IPC index gaining a mere 8.5 points at 2,276.1. Brokers were conscious that uncertainty would continue ahead of the G7 meeting at the weekend, and the country's elections on August 21.</p>

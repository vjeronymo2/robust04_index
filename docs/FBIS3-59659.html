			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Toshiba has developed a high powered krypton  fluoride excimer laser device that will be indispensable in the  mass production of the next generation of semiconductors.  Reportedly, it can be used as the light source for projection  equipment, and in the stepper (successive movement type  reduction projection equipment) by which 64 Mbit semiconductors  and beyond will be mass produced. So far, Toshiba has been  successful in heightening the output up to a maximum of 8 watts,  and has raised the exposure efficiency, which has been a weak  point with excimer lasers, by increasing the number of pulses  that can be irradiated per second by about 50&percnt;.    Currently, ultraviolet light is used for the light source of  steppers which mass produce 16 Mbit DRAMS. However, because  ultra fine circuit patterns are required when entering the next  generation of semiconductors, progress is being made in the  development of light sources using excimer lasers and X-rays  which put out ultraviolet light with even shorter wavelengths.    Because excimer lasers put out ultraviolet light, already  existing production processes can be used, and the equipment can  be made compact. These lasers are hopeful candidates for the  next generation light sources, but they have been found to have  problems in terms of mass production because of the output of  the laser, the frequency that is irradiated, and the  deterioration of equipment.    Toshiba's new equipment incorporates a resonator which  combines a mirror and an element that narrows the wavelength by  making a narrow band region, and thus the output of the laser  has been heightened to about twice that of conventional units  while preserving the quality. Additionally, the exposure time  can be shortened by being able to irradiate at a maximum  frequency of 600 times per second. Moreover, a means using a  prism was adopted to put only one part of the laser output in  the resonator, and this delays the deterioration of the element  within the resonator.    As a result, the longevity of the element that makes the  narrow band region can be extended 10 times or more, the  frequency and cost of replacement are reduced, and the  operational efficiency of the stepper can be improved. The  device has a compact size with a width of 150 cm, a height 160  cm, and a depth of 50 cm.    The device developed is effective as a light source for  steppers with a design specification of from 0.35 &mgr;m to 0.15  &mgr;m for use in 1 Gbit DRAMs.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Observer: On parade Interesting to see who turns up in Hampstead next Sunday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of Hugh Gaitskell, the former Labour leader who tried in vain to heal the party's internal divisions over disarmament and nationalisation. So far all we know is that Tony Clarke, chairman of Labour's National Executive Committee and former postal workers' union boss, will be there, but Glenda Jackson, the actress and newly elected Labour MP for Hampstead, will not. She has a prior engagement.</p>

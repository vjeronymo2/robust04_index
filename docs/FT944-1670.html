			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank lifts stake in motor insurance venture The Royal Bank of Scotland increased by Pounds 5m its investment in a new motor insurance company set up with Mr Peter Wood of Direct Line after discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry, the bank's annual report revealed on Friday. The bank announced last year that it intended to invest Pounds 24m in Privilege, which is aimed at 'non-standard' risk drivers, but it increased its stake to Pounds 29m in May after talks with the DTI, which is responsible for regulating the insurance industry. Privilege began trading in the autumn. Royal Bank of Scotland's decision increased the preference shares it owns in Privilege to 27.5m from 22.5m. The bank also owns 1.5m ordinary shares and Mr Wood owns a further 1m.</p>

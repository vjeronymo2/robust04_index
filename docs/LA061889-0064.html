			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TEAM PLAYER  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he's at work on the tentatively titled "Set-Up," which just began  filming for Warners. The Guber-Peters production, with Andre Konchalovsky  directing, co-stars Sly and Kurt Russell as two cops who are set up and  imprisoned, then break out and go after the villains. "But this isn't a prison  movie like 'Lock-Up.' The prison scenes take up only about four pages (of the  script)."  </P> <P>  He insists the back-to-back pics are not a comeback: "Oh, c'mon! 'Rambo III'  may have gotten scathing reviews, but it came in 11th at the (1988) box office  (gross: $53 million). And it did some good foreign box office. This is just  another cycle of my career.  </P> <P> "I'm returning to a safer place -- doing some interacting, after playing it  solo." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

The Aspen Institute  on Global Change, co-sponsored by the Amway Corp. of Ada, Mich., the U.N.  Environment Program and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will  bring leading scientists together each summer in Aspen, Colo., to trade ideas.  "This is not just another think tank," Denver said at a news conference in  Washington, adding that saving the environment is "the most important task that  faces the human race at this time."

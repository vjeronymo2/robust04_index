			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brighter outlook at Welpac WELPAC, the hardware and electrical goods wholesaler and distributor, incurred a loss of Pounds 305,000 pre-tax for the year to January 31. That compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13,000 for 1990-91. However, the year under review was one of reorganisation and strategic development and in the second six months Welpac returned profits of Pounds 53,000 before tax and exceptional items compared with losses of Pounds 248,000 in the first half. The full year loss, struck on turnover of Pounds 9.72m (Pounds 11.42m), took account of exceptional costs of Pounds 110,000 (nil) for redundancy and other reorganisation. Interest charges took Pounds 209,000 more at Pounds 541,000 but over the second half the charge was cut from Pounds 361,000 to Pounds 180,000. Losses per share emerged at 0.45p (earnings 0.42p). However, reflecting the recovery shown in the second half and expectations of a 'reasonable out-turn' for the current year the company is returning to the dividend list via a 0.2p payment. Year-end gearing was reduced from 126 per cent to 44.6 per cent.</p>

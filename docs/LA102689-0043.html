			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MILITARY SPENDING HAS INCREASED UNDER GORBACHEV, USAF SECRETARY SAYS  </P> <P> Soviet military spending has increased slightly since Mikhail Gorbachev took  power in 1985, despite his promises to cut back, Air Force Secretary Donald B.  Rice said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Rice told a gathering of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council that while the  Soviets apparently have spent a bit more on defense during the last four years,  U.S. defense spending and military aid to foreign nations has decreased  significantly during the same period.  </P> <P> "While Mr. Gorbachev has promised cuts, the U.S. has gone ahead and done it,"  the secretary told about 250 people at the luncheon gathering at the Biltmore  in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Since he came to power, our defense budget -- adjusted for inflation -- has  declined by 11%," Rice said. "The Air Force, like the other services, feels the  pinch."  </P> <P> Before he became Air Force secretary under President Bush, Rice was president  and chief executive officer of the RAND Corp. and previously held posts in the  federal Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense.  </P> <P> He also is a former director of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, a  nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that serves as a forum for the discussion  of international issues.  </P> <P> Rice said Air Force actions since 1985 have included cutting more than 30,000  personnel, delaying production of the B-2 Stealth bomber, deactivating the B-52  squadron, cutting Peacemaker missile deployment from 100 to 50 operational  missiles and starting the withdrawal of ground-launched Cruise missiles from  Europe.  </P> <P> "What have the Soviets done in terms of decreasing their budget and force  structure?" Rice asked. "While they've said they'll cut back, the fact is  Soviet outlays for defense increased by an average of 3% per year in real terms  since 1985.  </P> <P> "The U.S.S.R. has said 1989 spending will be less than 2% below 1988 spending,"  he said. "Even if Gorbachev reduced military spending by 14% by the end of  1991, that would only about equal the amount he increased spending during the  1985-88 period."  </P></p>

The test of the proposed rule change is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 4.19(a). A functional separation must be established (1) between a specialist firm and any associated approved person; and (2) between a specialist and any associated integrated member organization. The approved person or integrated member organization (collectively referred to as an ``affiliated upstairs firm'') must establish functional separation (a ``Chinese Wall'') as appropriate to its operation and further establish, maintain and enforce written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information, which includes review of employee and proprietary trading, memorization and documentation of procedures, substantive supervision of interdepartmental communications by the Exchange specialist firm's Compliance Department and procedures concerning proprietary trading when the firm is in possession of material, non-public information. The Exchange specialist firm or associated integrated member organization must obtain the prior written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the requirements above in establishing functional separation as appropriate to the operation and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation. A copy of these Chinese Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange's Financial Compliance Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The following are the minimum procedural and maintenance requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The specialist's book must be kept confidential in accordance with Rule 5.29(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The affiliated upstairs firm can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the affiliated upstairs firm from the issuer may not be made available to the specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated upstairs firm and specialist entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Information that may be made available to others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm may make available to the specialist only the market information that he or she would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal course of his or her trading and ``market probing'' activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A specialist may make known to a broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm only has the information about market conditions in specialty stocks that he or she would make available in the normal course of specializing to any other broker and in the same manner as it would make such information available to any other broker. The specialist may make such market information available only upon request of the broker of the affiliated upstairs firm and may not provide such information on its own initiative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An affiliated upstairs firm can popularize a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the existence of possible conflicts of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A specialist who becomes privy to material, non-public information must communicate that fact promptly to his or her firm's compliance officer or other designated official. The specialist shall seek guidance from the compliance officer or other designated official as to what procedures the specialist should follow after receipt of such information or such other action that should be taken. Appropriate records shall be maintained by the compliance officer or other designated official. The record should include a summary of the information received by the specialist and a description of the action taken by the compliance officer or other designated official. If the ``book'' is given up to another member of the specialist firm who is not in possession of the information or an independent specialist firm, the book must be transferred in a neutral fashion to ensure that the transfer itself does not disclose the material, non-public information and the Exchange must be immediately informed and a record kept of the time the specialist reacquired the book reflecting acknowledgement by the compliance officer that the reacquisition was appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The Exchange has established the following procedures to monitor compliance with this rule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Examination of the Chinese Wall procedures established by Exchange specialist firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated upstairs firm and its affiliated specialist or specialist firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Exchange will conduct periodic examinations of the specialist firm's Chinese Wall procedures to ensure that a functional separation between the affiliated upstairs firm and the specialist or specialist firm has been created and thereafter maintained. The Exchange will also monitor the trading activities of affiliated upstairs firms and affiliated specialists in the firms' specialty stock in order to monitor the possible trading while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison reports generated by the Exchange, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

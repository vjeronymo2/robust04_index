The HHS awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Federal Government has the right to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments purchased or otherwise acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally_authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the HHS awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of &sect;74.34 (g) and (h). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Property trust relationship. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipients as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved, and shall not be encumbered without the approval of the HHS awarding agency.

These standards are established to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. The standards apply where the cost of the procurement is treated as a direct cost of an award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Recipient responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipients of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the HHS awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;74.42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Codes of conduct. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, or any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employers, or agents of the recipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Lakopoulos: "Intelligence Service Factions"] </F>   [Text] For the past several months, a storm has been  brewing on the top floors of the Katekhakis Street skyscraper  which houses the offices of the National Intelligence Service  [EIP]. The internecine conflict, whose outcome to date remains  undecided, has escalated thanks to the actions of a group of  Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] party members who hold  official trade union status within EIP. Critical of their  director, they are demanding certain changes in the structure  and administration of the Service. The administration in turn  believes its critics' motives to be "largely self-serving and  vengeful." Service director Admiral Leonidhas Vasilikopoulos,  an officer with a brilliant career and a democratic past, is in  the eye of the storm and is observing in-house developments with  composure, and waiting for the waters to calm before giving in  to a counteroffensive trade.    Nevertheless, things are extremely serious. The trade  unionists who are criticizing the administration are members of  PASOK--some even participated in party congresses. In this  capacity, they sent two letters to the executive bureau on 14  January 1994 and 14 February 1994, seeking the removal of the  director. This was after the bridges between them had already  been severed.    Mr. Vasilikopoulos' reaction, though discreet, matched their  own style of operations: Being himself a member of the PASOK  Central Committee at the time, he addressed himself to the same  executive bureau in his vested capacity and, in the name of the  party, asked them to resume their duties.    At the next congress, the trade unionists were ready for  him:  they lobbied energetically to prevent his reelection. He got 346  votes and came in 190th. This "victory" was celebrated  appropriately, yet the admiral does not seem to mind. What  exactly is going on?  <H5>  Tempest in Intelligence Sanctum </H5>   The situation which has developed within EIP can be  characterized as explosive and dangerous. In a service sensitive  about its bad past, this escalating power struggle takes on at  times the form of an "unorthodox war" which threatens to reveal  to the public information--whether true or not--that could  damage even the service activities of EIP. Threats and  accusations are flying about, unsigned denunciations are  circulating, and personages known as "Anonymous" threaten old  EIP members with public disclosures. Throughout the mess, in  this atmosphere of reciprocal mistrust and blackmail, party  factionalism is rising rapidly, while "democrats" vs. "junta  supporters" and "greens" vs. "the Gryllakis people" coexist in a  silent balance of terror.  <H5>  Incriminating Dialogue </H5>   The trade unionists are asking for a "dialogue" and claim  that they already have the plan for the "democratization of  EIP." The administration counters that this "is not a matter of  trade unionism, but of party members who wish to control a  service which can no longer be influenced by political  parties--as was the case in the past." Serious insinuations hide  behind such declarations from the two sides. The trade unionists  are threatening to release "documents" detrimental to the  director, since they will prove that he "is collaborating with  people who were in power in the past." In a flyer signed by the  "Coordinating Committee" of the "Democratic Cooperation" one  finds the following statement: "Our national conscience obliges  us at present to keep our silence." The administration, on the  other hand, insists: "Even if Admiral Vasilikopoulos does belong  to PASOK, his very record does not allow him to repeat within  EIP what occurred in the past, and especially during that period  between 1981 and 1989, that nobody can be proud of." The trade  unionists reply that "The director has not honored the  preelection promise he made at a public rally, namely, to lend  his support to those who had been ousted previously." To this,  Mr. Vasilikopoulos' aides reply that "the fact that he  participated in a public rally in his capacity as a PASOK  official cannot be used to hinder the director of the EIP from  performing his duties." And the mess goes on.    The government, for the time being, is following these  events  with some embarrassment. Minister to the Prime Minister Mr An.  Peponis, nominally in charge of EIP, is avoiding any  involvement, knowing that Mr. Vasilikopoulos enjoys the full  trust of the prime minister. Nevertheless, the trade unionists  claim that they have been assured by departing PASOK members of  the executive bureau that the director will be replaced or, at  the very least, that their own demands will be accepted. When  Mr. Vasilikopoulos was informed of this--what kind of EIP  director would he be, had he not been?--he redefined the dispute  on a different basis: "Either you hold them back, or I'm getting  the hell out of here." Nevertheless, a few individuals are  trying to negotiate a compromise which will achieve a  frictionless coexistence between the director and the party  members, and eliminate the danger of having the dispute escalate  to the point that it would end up making public "documents" that  would hurt not only EIP but also the government. Already,  certain "papers" are circulating, which one side considers to be  "hot," while the other side thinks they are "counterfeit and  created for base purposes." What is their content? Terrorism,  which seems to be the "favorite game" of some EIP members, even  though legally EIP has no authority to play it.    From a certain point of view, all this is the result of a  peculiar kind of trade unionism that has been developing over  the past several years in EIP--a work place where,  significantly, the workers cannot even reveal their occupation.  <H5>  Retirees and Career Officers </H5>   In the beginning of the 1980's, the New Democracy [ND] tried  to "govern EIP from the outside," through a staff of retired  officers formed by the party to control--perhaps even more  decisively than the regular administration would have done--many  officers of the service. After 1989, PASOK countered this effort  by encouraging trade unionist activities within EIP. The ND has  already paid the price for its decision. PASOK is in danger of  doing so. The "retirees" of the one faction and the "trade  unionists" of the other are tending to develop into  complementary forces. How things develop during the present  period will be critical for the future. At the moment, the only  winners are the faceless and impersonal mechanisms of EIP, which  are often made to serve very opaque interests. In intelligence  work, the question what is "democratic" and what not often does  not have an easy answer.  <H5>  [Box, p A39] </H5> <H5>  Power Play </H5>   A certain theory says: "If you want to turn out good  pursuers, pick them from among the most pursued." The power  struggle that is going on at present in EIP is violating all the  rules of service operation. PASOK officials are asking to be  "vindicated" and wish to have their "persecutors" removed from  office. The director of EIP is sufficiently wise and experienced  to realize that playing with fire in this situation is  dangerous. Before he intervenes, he prefers to get to know in  depth the service in his trust and take stock of his own  strengths. On the other side, the trade unionists and party  officials appear to be in a hurry and demand "changes here and  now." The rift between them was unavoidable and was bound to  take on the characteristics that dovetail perfectly with the  specificities of the service itself. On Katekhakis Street there  is only one modus operandi. And so the theory is  confirmed: "If you want to turn out good pursuers, pick them  from among the most pursued."</p>

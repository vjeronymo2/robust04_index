			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Finance Ministry [MOF], which operates the  national automatic customs clearance system [NACCS] which  processes customs clearance with the help of computers, has  decided to make available the NACCS' information to exporters  and importers. With the NACCS being made open to exporters and  importers, trading firms including exporters and importers will  be able to obtain information on their import-export dealings  and simplify procedures for paying tariffs. The Finance  Ministry has decided to make the NACCS accessible to exporters  and importers in response to requests from the business  community, including the Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations]. Once the question of meeting the cost of  changing the system which the business community has requested  is settled, the NACCS will be opened in early 1995.    The NACCS, which is designed primarily to speedily process  customs clearance on exported and imported cargo, was first used  with air cargo in 1978 and then with sea cargo in 1991. The  NACCS processes all information about the origin and destination  of cargo, the permits for customs clearance, and the payment of  tariffs.    Currently only customs houses, customs clearance companies,  and banks have access to the NACCS. Major trading firms are  using the "comprehensive deferred payment procedure" which  allows them to make a monthly payment of tariffs, but they can  obtain information on the amount of tariffs only through customs  clearance companies. This has complicated the procedure for  calculating tariff payments.    Information provided by the NACCS is said to be of great use  to trading firms for managing their overall export and import  dealings. For this reason, the business community has asked the  Finance Ministry to expand access to the NACCS through the  Keidanren.    In response, the government decided to provide exporters and  importers with part of the NACCS-held information on the payment  of tariffs in a deregulation package it announced in September.  The latest decision by the Finance Ministry will make it  possible for exporters and importers to gain access to all of  the NACCS information about them through their on-line terminals  or other means.    In the future, the government and the private sector will  jointly promote responses to the requests of information users  and ways to meet those requests. Attention will focus on to  what degree private enterprises can bear the cost of altering  the NACCS.</p>

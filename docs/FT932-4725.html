			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Arts: Intractable 'Carrington' In January 1932, Lytton Strachey declared 'If this is dying, then I don't think much of it.' Seven weeks after he died his companion Dora Carrington (b. 1893) killed herself. Now, Jane Beeson's play Carrington at the Minerva Studio, Chichester tells the story of this overlooked and intense artist whose life represents the easy privilege and the hard radicalism of Bloomsbury in the 1920s. Beeson has chosen a fine but intractable subject. Carrington lacks structure and shape. The play charts a Lyttony of ambidextrous goings on between Strachey, Carrington, the artist Mark Gertler, Lady Ottoline Morrell and the Woolfs. Carrington evolved a sexual identity worked out between the coolly homosexual Strachey and the hotly heterosexual Gertler. What emerges is a picture of her studies at the Slade through to her troubled menage a trois with Strachey and her husband, Ralph Partridge, whom she married in May 1921 in order to stay close to Strachey. Beyond this circle the Bloomsburies hover en masse: Bell, Fry, the Sitwells, Nicolson and Sackville-West, Maynard Keynes, even the Lawrences. It was contact with the wider intellectual community which redeemed Carrington's life from indulgence and self-absorption. But she left, with a few dozen perfectionist paintings, a sense of talent wasted in depression and energies squandered in indecision. As matter for a play, Carrington's life presents few dramatic possibilities. The subject is difficult, and where the action fails to convey the complexities, the caricatures fare best: Virginia Woolf (played by Lucinda Curtis) is languid and vicious, while Ottoline Morrell (Dawn Keeler) keeps lubriciously hearty; both are most themselves. Woolf says vatically, 'Carrington grows older and her doings are of a sort that age'; while Ottoline chirrups 'Tomorrow, my darling, I'll take you to the asparagus beds  -we'll talk there.' Strachey (Robert Pickavance) is all flutter and fascination, quick with bon mot and willowy opinion. Carrington herself (Toyah Willcox), inhabits the spaces between the other characters, rather as she did in life. Willcox plays her nervily, tugging at her dress, romping around the open set, scratching at a charcoal sketch. But little in Annie Castledine's direction explains the absorbing and singular passion that Carrington felt for Strachey. She wrote: 'Strachey was the only person to whom I never needed to lie, because he never expected me to be anything different to what I was.' Minerva Theatre, Chichester</p>

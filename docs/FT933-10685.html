			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Lloyd's losses 'significantly damage economy' THE LOSSES suffered by the Lloyd's of London insurance market have significantly damaged the domestic economy and balance of payments, a report published today finds. Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist with Midland Global Markets Research, writes in Greenwell Gilt Weekly that Lloyd's losses over the past five years of more than Pounds 5.5bn are equivalent to the money lost on two or three 'Black Wednesdays'. 'Cumulative losses of this magnitude cannot be ring-fenced from the rest of the economy,' he says. Mr Shepherdson estimates that Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting - will need to find Pounds 2.3bn to fund the 1990 deficit of Pounds 2.9bn announced in June in line with Lloyd's three-year accounting system. He says the amount is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of UK personal disposable income and is more than the cost to the personal sector of 1p on income tax. He estimates: 'Personal consumption could be reduced by as much as 0.3 per cent or 0.4 per cent per year as a result of Lloyd's losses.' The crisis may also affect asset markets, he says. 'It is almost inconceivable that the losses will have no effect on the property market.' Lloyd's contribution to the current account has fallen from a surplus of Pounds 1.4bn in 1987 to a provisional deficit of Pounds 600m last year. Over the same period the annual current account deficit has risen from Pounds 4.5bn to Pounds 11.5bn. 'The Pounds 2bn swing in Lloyd's performance is equivalent to nearly 30 per cent of the deterioration in the current account as a whole,' says Mr Shepherdson. He concedes that the degree of the impact reflects the shrinkage in the current account deficit as a whole, but says the position could get worse. 'There is no guarantee that the losses have peaked.' Lloyd's problems have coincided with a decline in fortunes of the insurance sector as a whole, with the contribution of insurance companies, brokers and Lloyd's to the current account falling from more than Pounds 3bn in 1987 to some Pounds 700m in 1991. Lloyd's yesterday confirmed that Mr David Bruce had resigned as finance director to pursue other interests. The appointment of Mr Stephen Hall, who recently retired from Ernst &amp; Young, is temporary pending a permanent appointment. Professor Anthony King, professor of government at the University of Essex, has been appointed to advise a working party on voting arrangements and other aspects of Names' representation at the market. Lloyd's is reviewing its voting system which gives one vote to each Name irrespective of how much capital they supply.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (8): Britons are targeted - Immigration UNDER A NEW migration policy, New Zealand is once again actively promoting itself in Britain, the source of most of its European migrants since the whaling and sealing days of the early 1800s. From annexation by Britain in 1840, New Zealand's migration statistics have been dominated by British migrants. (This changed in 1976, when the Muldoon government, concerned about over the high economic cost of settlement in the face of the first energy crisis, clamped down on all migration.) Thousands of New Zealanders, many in senior positions in business, government and the bureaucracy, today speak with English accents and are proud to say they were assisted migrants under the long-running Pounds 10 assisted passage scheme. Thanks, possibly, to their numbers and the influence of their descendants, there is no anti-monarchist republican movement as there is in Australia. From the 1960s New Zealand received increased waves of Polynesian migrants as the country struggled to find unskilled labour for its protected industries. With the dismantling of protection since 1984, many are now unemployed. Most Polynesians now gain admission through family connections, although overstaying by island people on holiday, or with expired work permits, is a continuing problem for the authorities. Since the Fijian coup, New Zealand has had a high level of Indian migration, while thousands of Asians, many from Hong Kong, Taiwan or Malaysia, have gained admission through various entrepreneurial schemes. Officially, New Zealand welcomes migration from all parts of the world. But a preoccupation of Mr Bill Birch, the new minister of immigration, has been to emphasise skills. Mr Birch, regarded as the most powerful man in the cabinet, is the driving force behind the new policy which initially targets British migrants - and sets out to make them aware of their acceptability. Under the new system, people interested in buying an existing enterprise, or seeking a top position to manage the changes now under way in the country, will be keenly sought. Among others, this policy has led to the recruitment of Dr Peter Troughton, the former Telecom head who is now a senior government adviser on health, and Ms Angela Griffin, the new Wellington city manager. A second target group is people loosely described as wanting to 'take a chance with a new initiative, or doing their own thing, or in competing for management positions.' The British initiative has had a good response; in the first few days 600 applied for information from New Zealand House. A simple points system is designed to tell intending migrants quickly of their acceptability. Over the past year, the number of migrants from Britain appears to have reversed a declining trend - it is believed that the complex admission systems were a great handicap. A total of 3,547 British migrants received residence permits in the year to June 1990; 16.19 per cent. In the year to June 1991, 3,875 people settled from the UK (15.58 per cent) and in the year to June 1992, 3,267 - 16.92 per cent - have been accepted. Under the new policy this number is expected to grow over the coming months. Europe is also targeted (from the New Zealand embassy in Bonn): 5.54 per cent were accepted in 1990; 7.16 per cent in 1991; 6.72 per cent to June this year. The rest of the world provided 17,146 (78.27 per cent) in 1990; 19,209 (77.26 per cent) in 1991, and 14,745 (76.36 per cent) to June this year.</p>

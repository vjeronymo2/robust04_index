			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Letter: The fatal threat to a Euro air industry Sir, Since the late 1970s German governments have sought to re-establish the German aero-industry, but have found difficulty in obtaining finance to develop civil aircraft. While German withdrawal from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) could release the necessary finance to strengthen a German presence in civil aircraft manufacture, it could fatally wound the European aero-industry as a whole. The US aero-industry is in a towering commercial position with public finance for aeronautical research and development at 10 times that provided by west European governments together. The lesson of the Boeing 747, an aircraft with a monopoly in its market sector, ought not to be lost on policymakers thinking of leaving US industry with the world's last high-performance fighter aircraft. The estimated profit on each Boeing 747 is Dollars 50m] The unit price of EFA might be Dollars 18m. How much would a US fighter aircraft cost the European taxpayer in the absence of a competitive machine? Madron Seligman, deputy co-ordinator for energy research &amp; technology of the Parliamentary Group of the European People's Party</p>

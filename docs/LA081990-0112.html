			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY -- DON'T PENALIZE THE MOTORISTS  </P> <P> Regarding the San Clemente checkpoint problem of undocumented workers running  across the freeway: Please don't get too radical. Why should thousands of  drivers have to suffer because of selfish smugglers letting off their captives  who, in fright, seem to run.  </P> <P> We experienced the same problem on southbound Interstate 805 at Palm Avenue in  Chula Vista, and installing lights and flashing lighted signs "Watch out for  people running" seems to have deterred the accidental deaths.  </P> <P> We travel the San Clemente checkpoint every weekend and are irritated enough at  waiting five miles in line just to "cross the checkpoint" and don't wish any  further delays.  </P> <P> We admire the job the Border Patrol does with the resources available. As you  stated in the article, a high divider will probably not be the answer. Please  try the lighted signs.  </P> <P> SHERI GILMORE  </P> <P> Imperial Beach  </P></p>

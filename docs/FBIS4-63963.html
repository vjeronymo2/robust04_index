			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Grounds for Panic"] </F>   [Text] The distribution of iodine preparations to families  in Chernihiv Oblast created panic among the population. In view  of that, a news conference was held at which presidential  representative in the oblast Valentyn Melnychuk stated that it  had been a purely preventive measure, which had nothing to do  with a "new" accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power  Plant [AES]. Serhiy Parashyn, general director of the plant,  assured journalists that his collective had "rendered such an  accident impossible." In his opinion, the idea of closing down  the Chernobyl AES has been artificially spread at the initiative  of certain circles in the West. The people who are mainly  interested in this are those trying to obtain funds from  Ukraine's budget for implementing expensive projects.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Skandia may bid for Hafnia unit SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurance group, has emerged as a potential bidder for the core life and non-life operations of Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer which suspended payments to creditors in August. The move would be a significant step towards the group's ambition of achieving a 20 to 25 per cent market share in Scandinavia. It has a comparatively weak presence in Denmark compared with its operations in Sweden and Norway. It also renews the group's interest in Hafnia after its bid to take over the entire group was rebuffed in April. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the Skandia president, said prices had not been discussed as the group was not yet involved in active negotiations. Analysts value Hafnia's domestic non-life and life businesses at a minimum of DKr2bn (Dollars 328m). The sale of Hafnia's operations is being handled by the US securities house Morgan Stanley. It is understood that two other groups are also interested in Hafnia's Danish operations, including Codan, the Danish insurer which is majority-owned by Sun Alliance of the UK. Acquiring Hafnia's non-life business would make Skandia the biggest non-life insurer in Denmark, with a 20 per cent market share. Its life share would increase from 1 per cent to about 10 per cent. At the same time, the group might acquire Hafnia's 14 per cent Skandia stake, assisting it in its wider ambition of clearing up the uncertainty surrounding its shareholder base. Some 50 per cent of the group's shares are in the hands of willing sellers, including a 28 per cent stake held by Uni Storebrand group, the Norwegian insurer. Skandia also said it was discussing the sale of Panfinancial, its UK political risk and credit insurance business, with three continental European insurance groups. The group is re-shaping its strategy by sharply limiting its exposure to reinsurance and concentrating more heavily on direct non-life and life insurance on the Nordic home market as well as in the UK, US and continental Europe.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 560 MINORITY FIRMS READY TO DO BUSINESS AT CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Nine years ago, Jim Espinosa decided he couldn't spend yet another year working  for somebody else. He wanted to start his own business, and he went looking for  advice on how he should do it. But finding the kind of help he needed wasn't  easy.  </P> <P> "One guy -- who I had hired to help me -- said that because of my last name, I  would never amount to anything more than a shipping clerk on a warehouse  floor," recalled Espinosa, who is Latino.  </P> <P> Espinosa, 50, proved him wrong. Today he is the owner of Orange Coast Electric  Supply Co., a Santa Ana electric parts distributor with 25 employees and more  than $9 million in annual sales. He credits part of his success to programs at  area corporations that set aside a percentage of subcontracting work for  minority-owned firms.  </P> <P> Espinosa was among 560 minority business owners who attended an Anaheim  conference on Thursday to make contact with representatives of about 100 Orange  County and Los Angeles area corporations interested in contracting with  minority-owned firms.  </P> <P> "We're here to get some business," said Lou Flores, owner of Forms Consultants,  a Westminster office supplies company. "We wouldn't usually get a chance to  meet corporate buyers. This is a way for us to get our foot in the door."  </P> <P> Very few minority business owners walked away from the conference with  contracts in hand. But many said they felt encouraged, and some had scheduled  follow-up sessions with potential corporate clients. "I've learned a lot and  made some good contacts," said Nick Rosas, owner of NC Fabrication, a Santa Ana  machine shop.  </P> <P> A number of corporate participants said they were looking for minority-owned  high-technology firms. Aerospace companies in particular said they need  minority vendors to work on complex projects such as satellites and missiles.  </P> <P> "I would say there is a serious shortage of these companies," said John M.  Keany, corporate liaison with Hughes Aircraft. "We can't find enough of them."  The shortage, said experts, reflects the large amounts of money required to get  into the aerospace business.  </P> <P> Companies working on federally funded projects received orders in November to  try harder to contract with minority-owned businesses. Congress passed  legislation imposing fines on firms that fail to maintain existing affirmative  action quotas on certain kinds of projects.  </P> <P> "CEOs in Orange County are reaffirming their efforts to hire minority-owned  businesses," said Albert Dawson, chairman of the the Orange County Regional  Purchasing Council, a nonprofit organization that sponsored Thursday's  conference. "This new legislation has real teeth in it."  </P> <P> Dawson said the financial health of the minority business community has  steadily improved since the first Minority Business Opportunity Day was held 7  years ago. Since then, total revenue reported by minority-owned businesses in  Southern California has grown from $200 million to $700 million, according to  the Southern California Regional Purchasing Council.  </P> <P> "There are more opportunities and more sensitivity on the behalf of a majority  of corporations in the area," Dawson said. "We have come a long way."  </P> <P> Minority business owners seemed unconcerned about a recent Supreme Court  decision that struck down strict affirmative action quotas used to hire  minority firms for city and state government projects. The ruling did not apply  to set-aside programs involving federal funds or to contracts between private  companies.  </P> <P> "The only impact I think it will have is to send a message to corporations that  are uncomfortable dealing with minority vendors that it is OK to shut them  out," said Ron Parker, owner of Software Creations, a Carson software  development firm.  </P></p>

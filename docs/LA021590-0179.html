			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI 'SHANTYTOWN' GOING DOWN BUT PROTESTERS AREN'T GIVING UP  </P> <P> Student activists at UC Irvine decided Wednesday to dismantle a "shantytown"  constructed to protest the university's housing policy, but vowed to issue new  demands to Chancellor J.W. Peltason.  </P> <P> The cardboard shacks were erected last week to protest Peltason's statement  that the university's policy prohibits gay and lesbian and other  "non-traditional families" from residing in campus housing.  </P> <P> Judy Olson, vice president for internal affairs of Associated Graduate  Students, said the shantytown will be removed during a "big bash" Friday at  noon, after which protest leaders will issue a new set of demands to Peltason.  If those demands are not met within "a couple of weeks," Olson said, the  shantytown will be rebuilt.  </P> <P> Randy Kerr, a member of the Campus Coalition for Human Rights, said the  decision to dismantle the shantytown was reached because organizers, many of  whom have manned the shanties for a week, wanted to "conserve their energy" for  future demonstrations.  </P> <P> "We're going to have a party (Friday) to declare a victory for us in unifying  on this issue," Kerr said. "We don't feel in taking down the shantytown we're  admitting defeat."  </P> <P> Olson said student leaders also decided to maintain an information booth  detailing the students' position, and will construct a "thermometer" showing  the number of people who have signed petitions against the housing policy.  Organizers will also work on soliciting support from sympathetic faculty  members, she said.  </P></p>

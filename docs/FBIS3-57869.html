The whole  question is to define their mission. I think that the  leadership of UNPROFOR was right to raise a certain number of  questions. The current situation is intolerable. Recently, the  European Union gathered all the parties concerned around a table  in Brussels. We particularly asked them one question: Do you  agree to observe a truce during Christmas?

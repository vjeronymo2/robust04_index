			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver deficit at record and still growing Worldwide fabrication demand for silver outpaced supply for the fourth consecutive year in 1993, by a record 207.5m troy ounces, according to the annual survey from the Silver Institute, the Washington-based international association of miners, refiners, fabricators and manufacturers. The deficit is forecast to widen this year to 248.4m ounces. This suggests that stocks of silver readily available to the market, which stood at 1.1bn ounces in 1990 could be down to 620m at the end of this year. The survey points out that the 1.1bn of stock was built up from supply surpluses between 1979 and 1990. Any other silver stocks are probably relatively unavailable to the market at any price, given that they had not been sold when prices rose ten fold, from USDollars 5 to Dollars 50 an ounce in 1979 and 1980, nor when silver prices fell by more than 90 per cent in the following 13 years. According to the CPM precious metals consultancy group which compiled the data for the survey, silver supply fell by 6.1 per cent last year, from 501.7m ounces to 471.2m, the lowest level since 1986. This was mainly because of closures of copper, lead, and zinc mines where silver was produced as a by product. Fabrication demand, meanwhile, rose by 14.4 per cent, from 593.4m ounces in 1992 to 678.7m. Much of this growth came from a doubling of demand in India, the second largest consumer, after the US, for silver jewellery and decorative objects following the relaxation of import restrictions there in January 1993, which lead to lower Indian market prices. Worldwide fabrication demand is projected to rise this year by another 7.2 per cent to 727.8m ounces. Supply in 1994 is predicted to grow at a much lower rate, by 1.7 per cent to 479.4m ounces. The surge from India helped demand from silver jewellery and flatware manufacturers to jump by 27.5 per cent last year to 221.6m ounces, so that it overtook the use of silver in photographic film and papers, up by 1.3 per cent to 195.9m ounces. 'This was the first time in more than 25 years that silver used for jewellery and silverware was greater than silver demand in photography,' said Mr Dennis Wheeler, president of the institute at an analysts' briefing here. 'This is very significant and it reflects the increased demand for the metal from growing economies such as India and Thailand.' Mr Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM, picked up this theme when discussing long term trends in the use of silver. There had been a sharp increase in the share of the silver market represented by fabrication demand in developing countries, primarily in India and Thailand. Much of the jewellery formerly fabricated in Italy or the US was now made in Thailand. Consequently, silver use in developing countries, which was no more than 15 per cent of world demand between 1979 and 1989 was more than 30 per cent in 1994. Silver use in coinage last year rose from 29.4m to 38.1m ounces, mainly because the Mexican government began issuing again legal tender coins containing silver. This absorbed 15m ounces. Demand could be lower in 1994. The price of silver averaged USDollars 4.30 an ounce last year, up by 9.4 per cent (nine point four) from Dollars 3.93 in 1992. However, when adjusted for inflation, the real price of silver remained at one of its lowest levels since the 1940s. Mr Christian said: 'In the first four months of 1994 demand has continued to increase in most major market sectors. Indian demand and imports are rising and should exceed last year's phenomenal levels. Demand is also reviving in Japan and some European countries in which silver use, and economic growth in general, has been rather stagnant until recently. Demand is increasing in the US, Thailand and other big consuming nations'.

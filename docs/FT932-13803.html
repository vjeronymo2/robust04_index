			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Officials fence over Hong Kong's future: Long talks ahead for China and Britain SINO-BRITISH talks about Hong Kong's future constitutional arrangements, which begin in Beijing today, promise to be among the most difficult the two countries have had since they first sat down to negotiate the colony's change in sovereignty more than a decade ago. After six months of verbal warfare, British representatives in the Chinese capital are bracing themselves for intricate talks that may drag on for months and carry with them no guarantee of a successful conclusion. On the eve of talks, Beijing has muted its more extreme rhetoric, but this week Mr Lu Ping, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao office, firmly restated so-called 'guiding principles' which call for strict adherence to prior agreements in the lead up to 1997. At issue for Britain is the way in which Hong Kong elects its 60-member Legislative Council (Legco), the colony's lawmaking body, in 1995. Proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, envisage a broadening of the franchise so that a greater number of Legco members are popularly elected. For China it is how to secure a legislature that it has had a hand in fashioning, and possibly how to see off Mr Patten, once and for all. In Beijing's latest pronouncement, Mr Lu said in yesterday's People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, that Mr Patten's plans for elections could not be used as the basis of negotiations. He also emphasised that 'all the Legco members elected in 1995' must be approved by the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong special administrative region. This body was not due to come into operation until 1996, but its birth may be brought forward if talks fail. In effect, China is demanding in advance the right of veto over candidates for the Legco elections. This will prove a difficult, if not impossible, pill for the UK to swallow. A successful conclusion to talks holds with it the promise of Chinese approval for the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project, which has been in limbo ever since Mr Patten's appointment as governor was announced a year ago. Success may also bring in its wake a more constructive attitude by Beijing to the technical aspects of the colony's handover which are meant to be discussed by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. Today, the JLG is barely functioning. Initially China is not expected to reveal much of its hand. It will take the UK team to task over Mr Patten's alleged violations of the 'sacred texts' - namely the 1984 Joint Declaration, the 1990 Basic Law and a series of exchanges between foreign ministers in 1990 - which, it will claim, were high points in bilateral co-operation and mutual understanding. It believes Mr Patten's proposals run counter to the spirit, if not the letter, of these agreements, by broadening the democratic process in the lead up to 1997. Put simply, China fears a less than pliant Legco; it is also concerned about a Hong Kong democratic model inspiring liberal elements on the mainland. The British assume that the subject of the talks will be about Hong Kong's 1995 elections. Yet the risk exists that China may use the negotiations to increase its influence over the governing of Hong Kong much as it sought to do in 1990 and 1991 over the airport. Officials believe that the most contentious parts of Mr Patten's seven-point plan, include his proposal for a democratic election of an electoral college to choose a sixth of Legco members; and, that the voting pool for nine other seats comprise Hong Kong's entire working population of 2.7m. These are controversial - both in Beijing and among sections of Hong Kong's elite - but if China wants to drag out the talks it could cavil over others: specifically Mr Patten's proposal that the 20 seats of the 1995 Legco be decided on the basis of voting in single-member constituencies. British officials are hoping that international factors may now be weighing more heavily with Beijing; indeed, this may explain both China's decision to cool propaganda attacks on Mr Patten, and its agreement to resume talks. China wants membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - a symbol of its acceptance by the world trading community. Similarly it wants to host the Olympics in 2000, and a continuing row over Hong Kong would not help its chances for that decision, due on September 23. But a lingering worry for British officials is that China may use the talks to filibuster, so as to defeat Mr Patten through diplomacy where bombast has failed. Since last week's announcement of talks Mr Patten has been successful in winning Hong Kong's support for one key requirement of any agreement: that those who stand for election in 1995 serve until 1999, the first two years of Chinese administration. A poll published in the Sing Tao newspaper showed that 73 per cent of respondents want those elected in 1995 to continue to sit in Legco after the change in sovereignty. But if Hong Kong's clear desire for China to concede that point poses difficulties for Beijing, Mr Patten will not be immune from problems himself. During the talks the governor, who will oversee the conduct of negotiations from Hong Kong, may find he is torn between his heart and his head. Those close to him say he would be unhappy with a agreement that did not command the support of Hong Kong democratically-elected politicians. But, said one foreign office official, such an aim would be impractical: 'I do not see how he could throw out a deal on the basis of the minority not liking it. It would not be practical politics and there would be uproar in Hong Kong.' Mr Patten is a long way from having to make that decision. Last month he demonstrated his preparedness to confront China when he published, to Beijing's horror, his version of legislation for the 1995 elections. Yesterday China warned that it would not be prepared to countenance another such move. Mr Lu warned that 'if the present Hong Kong government clings obstinately to its course . . . then objectively and unavoidably it would become a 'lame duck' government.'</p>

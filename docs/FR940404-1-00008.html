			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin color maturity requirements for imported avocados in &sect;944.31 (7 CFR 944.31) were continuously in effect for several years prior to their suspension by a final rule issued May 15, 1991 (56 FR 23009, May 20, 1991). The avocado import maturity requirements were temporarily suspended to provide the USTR adequate time to review contemplated changes in those requirements, as required by section 8e of the Act. Suspension of the avocado import maturity requirements became necessary when the Florida avocado maturity requirements in &sect;915.332 (7 CFR 915.332), upon which the avocado import maturity requirements were based, were revised on May 15, 1991 (56 FR 23005, May 20, 1991). This revision was finalized on September 4, 1991 (56 FR 46224, September 11, 1991). Section 915.332 was most recently amended to make calendar date adjustments in the shipping schedule for several varieties of Florida avocados on June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34684, June 29, 1993), and that rule was finalized on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 46759, September 3, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to suspension, the avocado import maturity requirements were based on minimum weights and diameters applied to avocados grown in all foreign countries, except for those grown in southern hemisphere countries. Such requirements were applied to each variety for a specific time period during the first part of the shipping period. The minimum weights or diameters were not applied to avocados grown in southern hemisphere countries, such as Chile, where practically all imported southern hemisphere avocados have originated in recent years, because the southern hemisphere's avocado growing season and various shipping periods differed from those in Florida. The import maturity requirements based on minimum weights or diameters were applied to avocados grown in northern hemisphere countries, such as those in the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, where practically all northern hemisphere imported avocados have originated in recent years, because their growing season and various shipping periods are similar to those in Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The avocado import maturity requirements based on skin color for certain varieties of avocados which turn red or purple when mature were applied to avocados imported from all foreign countries in both the southern and northern hemispheres. Such requirements applied to all avocados grown in both hemispheres, because all such avocados turn color when mature regardless of where they were grown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would also reinstate the minimum size (weight and diameter) requirements for avocados and the skin color maturity requirements for avocados imported from all foreign countries by lifting the suspended provisions of &sect;944.31. However, this proposed rule would exempt the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties of avocados from such import maturity requirements, because such varieties are not grown in commercial quantities in Florida and regulated under the Florida avocado maturity requirements in &sect;915.332.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would obviate the need for exempting avocados imported from the southern hemisphere, since the major varieties imported from the southern hemisphere are the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would also add language to &sect;944.31 to cite the minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin color maturity requirements, and define the term ``diameter''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule also would exempt imported avocados under &sect;944.31, from minimum weight, diameter, and color maturity requirements if they are to be used in certain specified outlets. Similar exemptions from grade requirements established for imported avocados under &sect;944.28 were implemented by an interim final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 69182, December 30, 1993), with an effective date of January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

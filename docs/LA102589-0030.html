			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Please help: "Just saying no" hasn't been enough to drive drug dealers and  gangs from the neighborhood, so Pickard Elementary School students wrote  President Bush seeking his advice. Fourth-grade teacher Mary Sunny said 950  individually handwritten letters were sent to the White House from children at  the school on Chicago's South Side. "My neighborhood has drug users and gang  bangers that kill people and scare little children on the block," wrote Brenda  Lee, a fifth-grader. "That's why we don't go outside. We need your help."  </P> <P> * Big first birthday: Christy Andrews celebrates her first birthday Friday.  That's a remarkable achievement, because the Camden, N.J., girl weighed just 15  ounces when she was born three months prematurely and was given less than a 5%  chance of survival.  </P> <P> * New golden oldie: Portions of "The Old Farmer's Almanac," the planter's bible  that's been an institution for 198 years, will be available on videocassette  next month -- providing home remedies, gardening tips, offbeat features and  weather forecasts. The hourlong tape is narrated by Willard Scott of NBC's  "Today" and features comedian Jonathan Winters passing on home remedies.  </P> <P> * Return: Author Kurt Vonnegut paid a surprise visit to the City News Bureau of  Chicago where he worked as a cub reporter more than 40 years ago. "His first  question was, 'Where are the tubes?' " said managing editor Paul Zimbrakos  referring to the pneumatic tubes that City News once used to transmit stories  to clients.  </P></p>

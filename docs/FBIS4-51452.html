			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  today restated the Chinese Government's "goal on the Hong Kong  issue" as to resume the exercise of sovereignty on one hand, and  to practice "one-country, two systems," letting the Hong Kong  people rule Hong Kong, on the other, so as to ensure further  prosperity and stability there.    He made the statement here today while meeting with a  delegation from the Textile Council of Hong Kong headed by its  Chairman Kenneth Fang.    "To maintain Hong Kong prosperous and stable is not only the  hope of the Hong Kong compatriots, but also the need of the  whole nation," Li said, calling Hong Kong "a bridge between the  mainland and the outside world."    Li noted that Hong Kong's public servants, who have rich  administrative experience, had played an important role in  achieving Hong Kong's prosperity.    "We understand their predicament at present, and hope that  they would continue to work with ease of mind," he said. "We  also hope that they would make continued contribution to the  prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after 1997."</p>

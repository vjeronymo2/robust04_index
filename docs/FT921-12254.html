			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England to reduce deposits THE Bank of England is to return Pounds 200m of interest-free deposits to banks in the UK in the latest of a series of moves to lower its cash ratio requirements. The Bank said that the change was prompted by its internal financing needs and did not reflect any change in macroeconomic policy. Until now, banks have had to place 0.4 per cent of their sterling deposits with the Bank in interest-free accounts. This float, currently standing at around Pounds 1.6bn, provides the Bank's main source of income to fund its banking operations (although not operations in the money and foreign exchange markets). The ratio will be reduced to 0.35 per cent on January 31, the Bank said yesterday. It attributed the move to the increase in sterling deposits on which the deposits are made (around 6 per cent in the past year); increased efficiency in its own operations; and its view of how deposits will change over the next four years. The Bank has reserved the right to increase the ratio again at any time up to April 1986. The Bank does not publish details of its income and expenses, but in the year to last February made an operating profit of Pounds 161m (up from Pounds 122m the previous year). It also has reserves of more than Pounds 800m. The ratio was last cut a year ago, from 0.45. It had stood at 0.5 per cent before October 1986.</p>

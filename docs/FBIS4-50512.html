			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["LIAOWANG Forum" column by Mo Ru (5459 1172): "Party </F> Style, Government Style, Work Style"]    [Text] The problems in party, government, and cadre styles  have drawn a lot of comments.    As far back as 1980, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and other  leaders of the older generation solemnly pointed out: The style  of a ruling party is one concerning the life and death and the  rise and fall of the party. Since then, the party Central  Committee and the State Council have always listed the  rectification of party and government styles and a change in  cadre style as an important element that has to be grasped every  year. To this end, they have approved and adopted a series of  decisions and measures for rectifying unhealthy tendencies,  fighting corruption, and advocating clean government. At its  second meeting last year, the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission put forward the tasks, requirements, and specific  policies for the anticorruption struggle. At its third meeting,  held some time ago, it again put forward specific requirements  for the anticorruption struggle. These important decisions and  measures have played an important role in the building of the  party, political power, and the contingent of cadres. However,  it should also be noted that the phenomenon of impurities in  party, government, and cadre styles are still serious. Although  the struggle against corruption has attained marked results,  there is still a big gap when compared with the actual problems  and the demands of the masses.    How, then, should we approach the problems in party,  government, and cadre styles?    There is a view that, despite the efforts to rectify them  annually, the problems in party, government, and cadre styles  still exist, have gone from bad to worse, and have become an  incurable disease. In the eyes of these comrades, there seem to  be only negative and dark sides without any ray of light. This  is similar to Su San's remark in "Sending a Prisoner Away Under  Escort": "There is not a good person in Hongdong County." Is  that so? No. This is a one-sided, exaggerated, and pessimistic  view. If you challenge them to "cite the facts," they can only  cite tidbits of phenomena and rumors. Although there are indeed  many problems in actual life, we should make an analysis when  looking at them. At the macro level, since the reform and  opening up a dozen years or so ago, China's productive forces  have been enormously emancipated, with the output of steel,  coal, electricity, petroleum, and grain doubling and redoubling;  with its gross domestic product exceeding 3,000 billion yuan and  its foreign trade volume approaching $200 billion, China's  comprehensive national power has grown considerably; and the  urban and rural people's livelihood has generally improved.  This is a universally acknowledged tremendous achievement!  Even former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said with  assurance that China would become a major economic power in the  world in his remaining years. Looking around the world today,  which country has developed at such a high speed and attained  such huge achievements? Given such a flourishing and vigorous  country, it is inconceivable that its leadership should be  "unacceptable."    "The policies of the central authorities are good and the  enthusiasm of the masses is soaring." This is entirely correct.  What is similarly correct is that the party and government  cadres at all levels have performed meritorious deeds that  cannot be obliterated in implementing the good policies and  organizing and bringing into play the people's wisdom. Most  cadres have made contributions and worked painstakingly in  promoting reform and opening up, state progress, social  stability, and economic development. "Once the line is  established, cadres are the determining factor." This is a  truth repeatedly proved in history.    We can also make observations from a micro level. Everyone  can observe the cadres and party members around him and make a  fair, unprejudiced assessment. Are the good and relatively good  cadres in the majority or are the bad and unacceptable ones? An  objective figure can help some comrades change their excessive  estimate. The conclusion will be that the mainstream of our  ranks is good and the healthy tendency is predominant. Such an  estimate does not in any way cover up the seriousness of  corruption and the urgent need to rectify party, government, and  cadre styles.    There is also another view which underestimates the  seriousness and urgency of the anticorruption struggle. These  people believe that economic development overrides everything,  that it does not count for much to have some bureaucratism, some  problems of work style, and some problems of eating, using, and  taking more than one is entitled to, and that we should not be  too serious about them. These comrades no longer like to hear  "self-reliance and hard struggle" or talk about "serving the  people." They only pay lip service to the need to "maintain  ties with the masses and integrate theory with practice" and act  as if "practicing strict economy and thrift in all undertakings"  is out of fashion. Such a viewpoint is totally wrong.  Precisely due to the evil influence of such ideas, various  strange phenomena, such as inviting people to dinner, presenting  gifts, extorting or asking for money and goods, going in for  ostentation and extravagance, and practicing fraud, have been  rampant despite repeated prohibitions. Some people publicly  accept bribes and invitations to dinner, saying: "Are we not  practicing a market economy and compensated service. It is a  matter of course that you should spend money and I do the work.  Thus, the principle of commodity exchange has been brought into  the government administration of state organs and the decadent  bourgeois idea of "putting money first in everything" has  penetrated the Communist Party. Is this not serious! If this  should be allowed to spread unchecked, "a small ant hole can  cause the dam to collapse." Have not some people been put in  prison as a result? It is quite necessary to suggest to these  comrades, especially the leading comrades: Please go among the  masses and hear the satirical doggerel or ragged verses created  by the masses, which vividly delineate the lamentable image of  some cadres. These aspirations of the people are the good  medicine that will sober up the cadres!    There is a vivid saying: "People take up the bowl to eat  meat but curse unceasingly as soon as they put it down."  "People take up the bowl to eat meat" means that the economy  has developed and that the people's livelihood has improved.  This is naturally a good thing. "But curse unceasingly as soon  as they put it down" means people are so discontented with some  phenomena of corruption that their initiative and enthusiasm  have been dampened.    The various forms of corruption and the various unhealthy  tendencies have seriously obstructed the course of reform,  opening up, and development and seriously hampered the masses  from giving scope to their initiative and enthusiasm.  Rectifying party, government, and work styles, fighting  corruption, and opposing unhealthy tendencies is a long-term,  complicated, arduous, and urgent struggle. We should have both  firm conviction and perseverance and, in line with the  requirements of the party Central Committee, do a good job in  the anticorruption struggle and in building clean government so  that our party, government, and cadre styles can be purer and  suit the needs of the great undertaking of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics.</p>

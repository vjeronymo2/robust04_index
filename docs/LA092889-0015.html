			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GOOD WORK IN SACRAMENTO'  </P> <P> Common Cause wishes to extend its sincere thanks and appreciation to  Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) who, together with six of his colleagues,  played a leadership role in the drafting of a comprehensive package of reform  proposals designed to restore public confidence in state government.  </P> <P> As a member of the bipartisan Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, Katz had to  make some unpopular decisions concerning the activities of other legislators.  Through an extraordinarily open and deliberative process, the committee  recommended to the full Assembly an exhaustive, thoughtful list of reforms:  Eliminate honorariums, strictly limit gifts, prohibit the personal use of  campaign funds -- and much more. As far as substance, Common Cause gave them a  grade "B." The committee's effort, however, deserves nothing less than  "A-plus."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the recommendations were not fully implemented in either house.  This should not lessen our praise for each committee member who, faced with  tough decisions, made tough choices. They have provided for some restoration of  confidence in the institution they serve, and have opened the door to a more  responsive and effective Legislature.  </P> <P> MARK HAARER  </P> <P> Assistant Director  </P> <P> Common Cause  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Teesside braces itself for further job losses TEESSIDE, which has the highest concentration of ICI manufacturing assets in the world, has been bracing itself for unpleasant news from the long-heralded restructuring. Fears have been growing that Teesside is vulnerable to big job losses from its biggest private sector employer because of its over dependence on the bulky, least glamorous parts of ICI's business. Although ICI remains the dominant local employer with about 11,000 on its Teesside payroll, this is fewer than half the number employed before the last recession began in 1979. With the rundown in numbers the traditional image of ICI on Teesside as a paternalistic employer has dwindled, a shift recently reinforced by the proposed deal under which Du Pont will acquire ICI's European-based nylon business. Middlesbrough council yesterday called on ICI to invest more cash in its bio-science businesses in the Teesside area. 'That is obviously ICI's latest success story and we want to be part of it', said Mr John Jones, deputy leader of the council. Mr Peter Crowe, chief executive of the Teesside Chamber of Trade, said it was much too soon to tell what the implications of ICI's proposed demerger would be for Teesside. 'I hope this won't mean any threat to employment on Teesside,' he said. 'If ICI feels this helps them in a global market place and won't threaten employment or investment on Teesside any more than the known restructuring going on the Chamber won't criticise them for doing it.'  ----------------------------------------    WORLD'S LARGEST CHEMICAL COMPANIES       RANKED BY SALES (DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------                            Sales on                             Q1 1992  ---------------------------------------- BASF (Germany)                7,236 Hoechst (Germany)             6,978 Bayer (Germany)               6,807 Du Pont* (US)                 5,368 ICI (UK)                      5,303 Dow Chemical (US)             4,639 Ciba Geigy (Switzerland)      3,930 Rhone Poulenc (France)        3,863 Exxon* (US)                   2,604 Shell* (UK/Netherlands)       2,462 AKZO (Netherlands)            2,395 Monsanto (Italy)              2,188 DSM (Netherlands)             1,315 Norsk Hydro* (Norway)         1,286 BP* (UK)                      1,276 Union Carbide (US)            1,187  ---------------------------------------- *Chemicals only Source: Chemical Insight Issue 488  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Serbs renew 'ethnic cleansing' policy MORE than 200,000 people could be forced to flee northern Bosnia because of a renewed wave of Serb-inspired terror and intimidation, officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday. The upsurge in 'ethnic cleansing' in the north of the former Yugoslav republic coincided with a US report concluding that Bosnia's Serbs have largely attained their goal of carving a greater Serbia out of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The report, drawn up by two staff members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who travelled in the region between August 7 and 14, estimates 35,000 people have died in Bosnia, with Moslems bearing the heaviest toll of nearly five months of bloodshed. It suggests 20,000 or more deaths occurred during forced evacuation of Moslem villages. Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the committee, said he was deeply disturbed by the account, the first US congressional report 'to document the full extent of the horrors associated with the ethnic cleansing campaign being carried out by Serbs against the Moslem population of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. The report found that in some Serbian-run camps 'prisoners have been systematically beaten and starved'. In some locations there was evidence of 'organised killing'. The authors assert that 'systematic defects' at the UN and the State Department contributed to the slow international response to the crisis. As early as June, reports of atrocities were reaching Washington from US diplomats, the authors say. 'The UN apparently did nothing in response to the July 3 memo (noting the existence of camps) and the State Department did nothing to follow up on the information it was receiving from its missions.' According to their evidence, paramilitary groups from Serbia operate with impunity in Bosnia-Hercegovina and are among the most sadistic forces there. 'We believe the death toll associated with the forcible removal of the Moslem village population of Bosnia-Hercegovina far exceeds the death tolls from the bombardment of cities or from killings in prison camps,' they say. 'Unfortunately, this most lethal aspect of ethnic cleansing has received the least amount of public attention.' In the light of the report, western diplomats said a decision by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, announced on Tuesday night, to place Serb-controlled heavy artillery pieces located around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo under UN supervision, was 'too little too late'. A Washington official said, meanwhile, the US had received word that Serbs might be willing to empty detention centres in Bosnia-Hercegovina if the international community took responsibility for the inmates. But this presented a dilemma. 'If you do help, you are assisting in ethnic cleansing,' the official said. 'Is it in the interests of the international community to make it easy to drive these people out?' Weekend 'Chetniks' on the warpath, Page 2</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / 'Phantom' agent revealed Royal Life, the insurance company, has discovered a 'phantom' agent who sold 23 of its pensions without being registered by the company and without having received full training. The discovery came about after the agent, Mr John Maxwell, contacted the Financial Times to complain that he had not been paid for his work in selling Royal Life products. Royal Life, a subsidiary of the Royal Insurance investment group, said it would be talking to the 23 people to whom Mr Maxwell sold pensions to determine if they had received proper advice. The disclosure comes after months of controversy about the methods used by insurance companies to sell products. Mr Maxwell said that for a few weeks in 1989 he sold pensions for WF Lemon, a 'tied agent' in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, which sells life products on behalf of Royal Life. Mr Fred Lemon, manager of WF Lemon, told Royal Life he did not recall Mr Maxwell's name. Neither did Mr Maxwell's name crop up in Royal Life's records on the 23 policyholders. Later inquiries revealed, however, that the policyholders had been sold the products directly by Mr Maxwell. Royal Life said: 'From our investigations so far it has been obvious that Mr Maxwell was selling policies on an unauthorised basis.' The company said it was keeping Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the insurance industry, informed about the case.</p>

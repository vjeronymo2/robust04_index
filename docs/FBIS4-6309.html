			<p>BFN     [Text] Ho Chi Mihn City April 18 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec said today that after his three-day  stay in Vietnam he was convinced of the possibility for the  Czech Republic to return to the Vietnamese market.    Zieleniec told the journalists, who accompany him on his  current 7-day tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Australia, that  Vietnamese partners had made it quite clear during the talks  that in the future Vietnam did not intend to unambiguously  orient itself towards standard Western countries. Provided  Czech companies maintain a certain level of competitiveness,  Vietnamese state bodies were ready to assist them in entering  the Vietnamese market with the aim to diversify the country'  foreign policy contacts, Zieleniec said. He said his Vietnamese  partners had pointed many a time to the traditional relations  existing between the two countries and even used the proverb  that "one old friend is better than two new ones."    Zieleniec said the main goal of his visit -- adapting the  old  contacts to the new conditions -- had been achieved.    Zieleniec said that two Czech-Vietnamese agreements were  currently under preparation. One is a new trade agreement and  the Czech Republic would like to link its completion to finding  a scheme for repaying Vietnamese debts to the Czech Republic.  The other one is an agreement on the employment of the other  country's citizens which, although balanced, mostly concerned  Vietnamese. It would be signed soon during Czech Minister of  Labour and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka's visit to Vietnam,  Zieleniec said.    Regarding agreements on the prevention of double taxation  and  investment protection, Zieleniec said that it was important that  work on them started. Although such agreements are standard,  they are not a matter of course in the event of such countries  as Vietnam with predominantly centrally-managed economy and a  non-convertible currency.    Asked whether the Czech Government was considering the  establishment of a free trade zone with Vietnam, Zieleniec said  that this would be difficult in case of a country whose economy  was not based on the private ownership principle, and which was  lacking a united taxation system and a market economy.    On the last day of his stay in Vietnam, Zieleniec visited  the  Viet Tien textile factory here. He was accompanied by Czech  entrepreneurs and businessmen whose presence Zieleniec considers  one of the most important aspects of his visit.    Vietnamese guests acquainted Zieleniec with the current way  of industrial management in the situation when Vietnam has been  switching over to a market economy for several years.    A seminar to provide Vietnamese partners with information on  the current economic situation in the Czech Republic and exports  possibilities of Czech companies was organised today here by  Czech entrepreneurs and representatives of the Czech Ministry of  Industry and Trade and the Czech National Bank. On Saturday [16  April] a similar seminar was also held in Hanoi.</p>

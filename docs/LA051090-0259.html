			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON;  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> HOME, AT LAST;  </P> <P> COMEDIAN HASN'T PLAYED SOUTHLAND IN EIGHT YEARS, UNLESS ONE COUNTS HER MANY  AIRPORT APPEARANCES.  </P> <P> Stand-up comedian and cable TV fixture Elayne Boosler hasn't performed in  Southern California for about eight years. No big deal? Well, we're talking  about a woman who has lived in Los Angeles for the past 13 years.  </P> <P> "I just go to the airport here," she said. "When I was starting I did about 12  million shows here. Now I guess I perform in only 49 states."  </P> <P> That's a fact that makes her May 14 show at the Arlington Theater in Santa  Barbara all the more special. The performance will be the first stop on a  50-concert summer tour she said will take her to places where she has never  performed. "From Hawaii to the Catskills," she said. "And I'll probably see the  same people in both places on vacation."  </P> <P> Each performance on the tour figures to be unique because Boosler tailors her  shows to the area in which she is appearing.  </P> <P> "When I get to a town I'll read the town paper. Then I'll go to the hotel and  watch CNN. If I go to a mostly conservative city or a completely Republican  city, like I did in Arizona, I go with mostly liberal stuff. I'm not saying I'm  right, but it shakes them up . . . and I'll never see them again anyway."  </P> <P> What does she have prepared for Santa Barbara? She's not sure yet, but knows  one thing. "Obviously there's more of a West Coast sensibility so I won't talk  about subways," she said.  </P> <P> Not only does Boosler wait until she arrives in a town to prepare some of her  material, much of the time she waits until she gets up on stage. "That's when  I'm in the mood," she said. "I encourage talking back and forth. I can write a  joke at home, but I really cook when I'm on stage. My best stuff is in response  to someone."  </P> <P> Mixed in with all the more spontaneous material, Boosler is sure to touch on a  few of her standard topics. She might be most recognized for the routines she  does about her life.  </P> <P> "A show is kind of like going through the day," she said. "You go to the bank.  You read the paper. You talk to a friend. You go on a date. The humor comes out  of the fact that it is so tragic at times."  </P> <P> And then, of course, there are the topics of the day . . .  </P> <P> Like the state of the world: "Environment stuff is so big," she said. "It's a  bandwagon everybody has jumped on. . . . Let's just hope it's unleaded. I'm  cutting back. I'm recycling. On Earth Day I stayed home and put Styrofoam  covering on my house. What scares me is that hot dogs last 50 years on the  ground, but only a week in the fridge."  </P> <P> For her Santa Barbara performance, Boosler will be fresh. But a 50-stop tour  can be grueling. It's important that her hotel room accommodations are just  right.  </P> <P> "I like hotels where the 'Do not disturb' sign has meaning," she said. "A 'Do  not disturb' sign to a housekeeper is like a red cape to a bull. You hang the  sign out at two in the morning and wonder, 'Why do I bother? Why am I going  through this charade?' It's because there is always hope in man. But sure  enough, at 3 a.m. . . ."  </P> <P> And it isn't as though Boosler needs a housekeeper in the first place.  </P> <P> "I like a real filthy room with lots of noise, an unmade bed, food products in  the drawer," she said. "I like a room next to the ice machine, where you can  hear the ice dropping out one at a time and then you can hear the whole pile  drop out. But the machine only starts after midnight, so it doesn't bother  anybody during the day when they're not there. A room near a candy machine is  good too. It's good to hear people in assorted languages scream for change."  </P> <P>  Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $17.50. The Arlington is located at 1317 State  St. Call 963-4408 for tickets.  </P> <P> </P></p>

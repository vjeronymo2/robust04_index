			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Moves on bias set to anger activists - Disabled Government attempts to tackle discrimination against disabled people are likely to inflame rather than satisfy campaigners. A bill is to be introduced reflecting proposals in 'Disability - On The Agenda', a government consultation document published in July. This was produced after a furore in May, when the government blocked a private member's bill from Mr Roger Berry, a Labour MP, designed to outlaw discrimination against disabled people. The consultation document concentrated on employment, access to goods and services, financial services, building regulations and the establishment of a new advisory body. Disability activists regard the document's proposals as inadequate and will take the same view of a bill based on them. They are concerned that important areas such as transport and education are likely to be excluded from the bill's scope, while the suggested new advisory body would lack legal enforcement powers of bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission. The government could run into parliamentary pressure to strengthen its bill if a survey of MPs by the charity Scope - formerly the Spastics Society - proves correct. This suggests that 25 per cent of Conservative MPs believe Mr Berry's stronger proposals should be implemented, with 71 per cent of Conservatives saying they support them in principle but were concerned that the costs would be too high. In its opposition to Mr Berry's bill the government costed the extension of disabled people's rights at Pounds 17bn plus a recurring Pounds 1bn a year. Disability campaigners say such estimates are unrealistically high. Lord Ashley, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary disablement group, said yesterday that he intended to introduce his own bill in the Lords. The government's proposals were 'belated, limited and inadequate', he said. Radar - the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation - said the consultation document's proposals on which the bill would be based were half measures. Radar added: 'They will not ensure that disabled people have equality of opportunity in all aspects of their lives, nor will they give disabled people the right to legal redress against unfair discrimination.' Campaigners in the UK are encouraged by an apparent change of attitude towards the wide-ranging Americans With Disabilities Act in the US. Although the act was originally opposed by employers because of similar cost concerns to those advanced in the UK, there is now evidence of greater acceptance and support. The disability lobby in the UK, however, does not have the political strength of its US counterpart. Public alarm about murders and other violent offences committed by people with serious mental disorders has prompted tighter controls in a mental health bill. The bill will introduce new powers of supervised discharge from hospital, and extend from six months to 12 months the period during which released patients can be recalled. Mental health charities will oppose the proposals. They say that better-funded community care is required, rather than changes in the law that will stigmatise mentally ill people.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPAQ INTRODUCES 2 COMPUTER SYSTEMS  </P> <P> Accompanied by indoor fireworks, laser lights and booming synthesizer music,  Compaq Computer Corp. on Monday unveiled two computer systems, including one  that it is touting as the world's most powerful desktop personal computer.  </P> <P> The personal computer, to be known as the Deskpro 486-25, uses an Intel Corp.  486 microprocessor as its heart and has three times the computing speed of its  predecessor, which used a 386 chip.  </P> <P> "Our new product offers true general-purpose flexibility . . . meaning it will  not become obsolete," Compaq President Rod Canion said.  </P> <P> "You could compare it to the IBM PS-2, Model 80, which is a floor-standing  unit," he said. "But the Deskpro 486-25 has more expansion capability even  though it sits on a desk."  </P> <P> The Compaq announcement came one day before rival computer maker NCR Corp. was  to unveil its 486-based personal computer. Unlike Compaq's, however, NCR will  use a system similar to the IBM Personal System-2 line of personal computers.  </P> <P> IBM has not introduced a personal computer built on the 486 chip yet, but it  did come out with a card that lets users plug the 486 chip into their existing  personal computers.  </P> <P> The 486 chip is so powerful that it will allow personal computers to do certain  jobs now done by engineering work stations, minicomputers and even mainframes.  </P> <P> Compaq detected some minor problems with the chip last month and informed  Intel, which has said it would begin shipping a fixed version of the chip by  the end of this month.  </P> <P> The uncertainty about the new chip, combined with slowing sales in the American  market, prompted Compaq last week to announce that its fourth-quarter earnings  would be below those of a year ago. That announcement triggered a 15% plunge in  the price of Compaq stock.  </P> <P> Compaq's stock jumped 75 cents a share Monday in consolidated New York Stock  Exchange trading, closing at $89.25.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, Canion and other Compaq executives were upbeat, telling  about 1,000 dealers and computer experts who attended the lavish introduction  that the new computer, along with a new Systempro personal computer system,  represented another Compaq milestone in the industry.  </P> <P> The Systempro system is designed for network and multi-user situations. It fits  under a desk, yet has the computing power of minicomputers that require racks  of equipment, according to Compaq.  </P> <P> The Houston-based company's phenomenal growth came as it made computers that  followed the IBM standard. Compaq, however, refused to follow IBM in 1987 when  IBM brought out its Personal System-2 line, which use a new data pathway known  as micro channel.  </P> <P> Compaq and eight other personal computer makers deny IBM's assertion that micro  channel is the way of the future and say they have found a way to extend the  life of the old data pathway, which they call extended industry standard  architecture, or EISA.  </P> <P> The new Deskpro 486 will be offered in three models, ranging in price from  $13,999 to $20,499, with first shipments expected at Compaq dealers by late  December or January.  </P> <P> The Systempro system, also in three versions, ranges from $15,999 to $25,999,  with shipments to begin in December.  </P></p>

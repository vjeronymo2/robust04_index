However, it cannot accept  that some media sources allow themselves, in the name of this  freedom, to commit all sorts of excesses and fail to observe the  ethics required by this freedom.    This is stressed by a responsible source in the Foreign  Ministry in the wake of the 22 March statements by a French  Foreign Ministry spokesman regarding the Tunisian authorities'  decision to ban the distribution of LE MONDE newspaper in  Tunisia.    The source added that Tunisia adopted this measure with  great  regret against a newspaper published in a friendly country.  However, Tunisia did not just want to express this regret, but  also to highlight and condemn what cannot be ignored, which is  this newspaper continuing its hostile and slanderous stance  toward a country that is known for its tolerance, and whose  media landscape remains among the most open landscapes. It is  also the country to which neutral observers certify great  achievements in all sectors.    The same source adds that these infringements on a sovereign  country's dignity and this repeated failure to observe the rules  and ethics of the trade are matters that are unacceptable in  nature. He recalled that LE MONDE did not content itself by  spreading wrong or totally distorted news and commentaries  filled with false accusations, but, contrary to common practice,  it also often refused Tunisia the right of reply.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters suggested that &sect;488.307(b) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed to provide that HCFA shall identify successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling methods, distribute them, then monitor State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency performance, taking corrective action when necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter thought that the way the provision was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written, an agency gets constructive suggestions about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling surveys only after the surveys have been done and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time of a review of its procedures. Two other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested it would be helpful if HCFA could put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Regional Office Manual the successful methods it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified that assure that surveys are unannounced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with these comments suggesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HCFA specify in regulations that it will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful scheduling methods because we believe the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are better able than we are to identify successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling methods which may differ from one locality or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region to another. Each State uses the methods that work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best for it to schedule surveys within the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timeframes. We believe that the controls in place at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.307, which provide that all standard surveys must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unannounced, and that we will review each State's scheduling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures on an annual basis, are sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked what the term ``any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual'' means in reference to penalizing someone who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifies a facility that a survey is scheduled. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that individuals other than an employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Federal and State government should be held harmless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from fine if he or she notifies a facility that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled to be surveyed. This commenter further suggests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that any individual who is fined for notifying a facility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have the right to contest the fine in a formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act, in sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(g)(2)(A)(i), is clear that ``any individual'' who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifies a nursing home of the time and date of a standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey is subject to a civil money penalty. We, therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagree that only employees of the Federal and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments should be held responsible for notifying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility that it is scheduled to be surveyed; any individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who knowingly advises a facility that a standard survey is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled will be held accountable, according to the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any individual who is fined for notifying a facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled to the appeals mechanisms specified at section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1128A of the Act. The administrative appeals policy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalties imposed against an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcing a standard survey is not established by HCFA but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

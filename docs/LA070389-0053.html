			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH KOREAN STEEL FIRM SET TO BUY U.S., CANADA MILLS  </P> <P> In a move heralding an emerging South Korean role in overseas investment, Sammi  Special Steel Corp. is about to become the first Korean firm to buy American  factories.  </P> <P> Moreover, $180 million of the $220-million deal will be financed by an  international syndicate of banks led by a South Korean bank, a sign of South  Korea's growing financial strength. South Korea, once deeply in debt, will  enter the ranks of net creditors this year, Kim Kun, a Bank of Korea governor,  said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> The governments of Canada, the United States and South Korea must authorize  Sammi's purchase, but approval is expected "in the very near future," according  to Jin Byung Hwa, overseas investment director at the Ministry of Finance.  </P> <P> Sammi, South Korea's largest specialty steel firm, will purchase three  specialty steel-producing divisions of Rio Algom of Toronto, a mining and  resource exploration firm that is a subsidiary of the London-based RTZ Corp.  The divisions are Atlas Stainless Steel, situated in Tracy, Quebec; Atlas  Speciality Steel, in Welland, Ontario, and AL Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of  Dunkirk, N.Y.  </P> <P> The Dunkirk division operates specialty steel mills in both Dunkirk and  Watervliet, N.Y.  </P> <P> Together the four plants produce about 500,000 tons of specialty steel a year.  Last year, they registered an operating profit of $63.8 million on sales of  $582.4 million.  </P> <P> South Korea's largest integrated steelmaker, Pohang Steel Corp., has invested  in a joint-venture steel mill with USX, and such electronics giants as Samsung  and Gold Star have built manufacturing plants in the United States. But Sammi's  purchase represents the first takeover by a Korean firm of existing American  plants.  </P> <P> Four years ago South Korea's foreign debt peaked at $47 billion. But with the  emergence of trade surpluses, rising wages and the appreciation of South Korean  currency, South Korean manufacturers have begun investing overseas. Net  overseas assets are expected to surpass claims against the country by the end  of this year, making South Korea a net creditor, and the government has been  loosening controls on foreign investment and Korean banks' overseas activities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rare' Korean-Led Loan  </P> <P> Jin, the Finance Ministry official, said a Korean-led loan for an overseas  manufacturing purchase "is rare." Korea First Bank has arranged the loan, in  which two Korean state-run banks and eight foreign banks will participate.  </P> <P> At the end of April, total Korean overseas investment amounted to $1.1 billion,  with $362 million of it in manufacturing projects, Jin said. In the United  States, investment had reached $358 million, with $179 million of it in  manufacturing.  </P> <P> In contrast, cumulative foreign investment in South Korea amounted to about $4  billion at the end of last year.  </P> <P> Delegations from Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States are making  increasingly frequent visits to Seoul seeking private Korean investment.  </P> <P> To date, overseas investment has been led by three of South Korea's largest  electronics firms, Gold Star, Samsung and Daewoo. By the end of this year, the  three firms will be operating 21 plants overseas. Footwear and textile firms  are also getting into operations abroad.  </P> <P> Hwang Cheol Kyu, a Sammi spokesman, said the company will retain all the  employees at all three of the Rio Algom divisions it is buying. It will send  Korean representatives to each, but has not yet decided how many.  </P> <P> Although Sammi plans to complete a new plant, expanding its annual capacity to  1 million tons from 385,000 tons, the company will still lack the ability to  produce hot coil specialty steel and plans to import that product from its new  North American plants, Hwang said. Currently, 70% of its imports of 180,000  tons a year comes from Japan.  </P> <P> The acquisition will give South Korea a new assured source of supply of hot  coil steel, Jin said. Hot coil is processed into stainless sheet for use in  automobile manufacturing.  </P> <P> "Sammi has a history of only 20 years in specialty steel," Hwang said. "AL Tech  has a history of more than 100 years, and our acquisition of it will enhance  our technology."  </P> <P> The purchase will bring Sammi's total production capacity to 1.5 million tons,  making it one of the largest specialty steel firms in the world. The purchase  will ensure that South Korea, for the first time, becomes self-sufficient in  specialty steel other than hot coil.  </P></p>

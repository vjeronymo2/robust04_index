			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Time for a long overdue change Sir, Once again we have put our clocks back to British winter time and face darker evenings, more road accidents involving children and time disalignment with the rest of Europe. With rising commuter fares and falling transport infrastructure investment, this appears to be another government attempt to erode London's standing as Europe's main financial centre. Has the time not come for our clocks to be permanently aligned with those of almost all of western Europe, namely central European time?

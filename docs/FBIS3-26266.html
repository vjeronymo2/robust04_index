In this connection, Wang Maolin,  secretary of the provincial party committee, wrote a few days  ago to Cai Lulun, president of the Hunan provincial branch of  the People's Bank of China, to express his full appreciation of  the performance of the banking sector.    The banking sector of Hunan province was faced with an  unprecedentedly difficult situation early last year, as the  amount of deposits was decreasing drastically, loans were being  reduced, and a lot of problems persisted, such as arbitrary  fund-raising, interbank loan lending in violation of  regulations, and unreasonable interest rates. The provincial  branch of the People's Bank adopted a series of resolute and  effective measures to further intensify macroeconomic regulation  and control, and comprehensively straighten out financial order,  thus promptly alleviating the shortage of credit funds. By the  end of last year, banking institutions in the province  registered a net increase of 12.5 billion yuan in the amount of  deposits of general categories, a record increase in the  province. While the amount of deposits was increasing, the  amount of loans extended also increased, with the combination of  loan categories optimized. By the end of last year, the balance  of loans of all categories lent by banking institutions in the  province totaled 95.5 billion yuan. The newly granted loans  basically went to key financing projects. As far as the  procurement of agricultural and sideline products is concerned,  not only those IOU's left over from the previous year were paid  off, but no more IOU's were issued last year. Meanwhile, the  issue of delay in payment of postal orders which had caused much  trouble for a while was basically solved. Last year, the  proportion of actually granted loans to the total loan amount  applied for to finance key projects was the highest, as compared  with the figures in previous years. Ninety percent of the loans  granted to the industrial sector were used to support large- and  medium-sized enterprises.    While banking services were improved, financial order was  also gradually improved in the province. In the latter half of  last year, more than 2.6 billion yuan was recovered as return of  loans that had been granted in violation of regulations;  branches of the People's Bank at all levels in the province  investigated and handled 52 cases of violation of the interest  rate policy, and 632 cases of violation of financial discipline  regarding account settlement. Meanwhile, branches of the  People's Bank, other specialized banks, and insurance companies  carried out a consolidation operation to conscientiously rectify  companies that they had established and operated on their own.</p>

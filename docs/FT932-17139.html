			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Outline US budget passed by Congress BOTH houses of the US Congress completed work on President Bill Clinton's outline budget yesterday, passing a blueprint for trimming the federal budget deficit to about Dollars 192bn by 1997. This was evidence of a display of legislative muscle that few US presidents have been able to match in recent years. Even so, the resolution provides only a budget outline, and the hard work of passing individual taxation and spending measures is only just beginning. A detailed bill is expected to make its way through Congress over the summer. This would include the increases in top income tax rates and in corporate tax rates, as well as the new energy tax that Mr Clinton has proposed. Details are to be sent to Congress in a fuller budget next week. The outline projects a Dollars 273bn increase in taxes during the next five years over the baseline budget published by President George Bush shortly before he left office in January, coupled with cuts of Dollars 106bn in defence spending and Dollars 117bn in other spending areas. Some of Mr Clinton's supporters worry that he may have opened the door to a breakdown in Democratic party solidarity by concessions he made this week to senators in western and farm states so as to win their backing for the budget measure. The Senate has so far provided President Clinton with his toughest challenges. It is now delaying the Dollars 16bn package of short-term stimulus to spending that the president wants in order to accompany his longer-term economic plan. Mr Charles Cook, a veteran political analyst, observes that a good number of Democrats in the Senate not only see themselves as more worthy of the presidency than Mr Clinton, but honestly (and, in most cases, inaccurately) believe that, if they had run last year, they would now be in the White House. The Clinton budget proposals, and the relatively warm reaction in Congress, have encouraged financial markets to believe that the federal government may be making at last a serious attempt to deal with its deficit, bringing long-term interest rates sharply lower. However, the administration's hopes of bringing the deficit under more lasting control hinge on its plans to reform the US health care system, expected to be unveiled next month.</p>

A spokesman for the police strikers,  Sgt H J Hewana, said on Tuesday [22 March] night that Ciskei  leader Brig Oupa Gqozo had ordered his troops to cordon off the  Ciskei police college, comandeered earlier by the strikers, but  they had refused. He also said soldiers had informed strikers  they would hand over the commissioner of police, Maj Gen M  Noqayi.    He was apparently in the homeland's state house and the  military said they would wait until he came out and then take  him captive.    The striking policemen earlier said they wanted to arrest  Gen  Noqayi in connection with corruption charges. They have also  taken 15 Ciskei police officers hostage.    At 8pm the strikers sent an armed delegation to fetch Gen  Noqayi. A member of a delegation that met Brig Gqozo said the  Ciskei ruler gave the assurance that none of the strikers would  be arrested.    At 7.45PM one of the protest leaders, W/O [Warrant Officer]  A  K Mfene, asked his colleagues in the college hall to stand up as  a token of respect for "all the unnecessary lives" they had  taken.    Sgt Hewana said he had heard second-hand reports that SA  transitional adminstrators would be appointed to govern Ciskei.  He said strikers would not believe this until they heard it from  senior political figures in the Border/Kei region.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday night  decided that Brig Gqozo should be replaced by two administrators  appointed by the TEC and the South African Government.    African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa  said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately to relieve  Brig Gqozo of his post.    Government TEC representative Roelf Meyer said a South  Africa's Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans should be  dispatched to the homeland.    The Ciskei's Mickey Webb said it was not a hostile takeover.  He said Brig Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he  wanted to save lives and prevent destruction of property.</p>

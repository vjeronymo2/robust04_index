			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Hambros chief in list of new peers Mr Charles Hambro, chairman of Hambros and Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance, is to become a 'working' Conservative peer, Downing Street announced yesterday. Mr Hambro, a Conservative party treasurer since April last year, is one of five Tories in a list of 10 peers nominated by the three main parties. The others are Sir Christopher Prout, who led the party's delegation to the European parliament until he lost his seat in the June elections, Ms Patricia Rawlings, the former Euro-MP for Essex South West, Sir Peter Blaker, a former foreign and defence minister, and Sir Michael Shaw, a Yorkshire MP for 32 years until 1992. Labour nominated three peers: Mrs Josephine Farrington, chairman of the Association of County Councils, Mr Alf Dubs, a former home affairs spokesman, and Mr Derek Gladwin, a former official of the GMB general union and TUC general council member. The Liberal Democrat presence in the Lords will be boosted by two peers: Ms Susan Thomas, vice-chairman of Surrey county council, and Mr Graham Tope, leader of Sutton council and a Liberal by-election winner at Sutton and Cheam in 1972. Mr Tope lost his Commons seat in 1974. The government has suffered a series of embarrassing defeats in the Lords - most noticeably on the police and magistrates courts bill and the criminal justice bill - and the five Conservatives will help boost Tory morale. Working peers are expected to play a full part in the chamber's main role of reviewing legislation. Labour does not recommend party members for peerages in the annual Queen's birthday and New Year honours lists, but participates in the working peers list to maintain the effectiveness of the Lords as a debating chamber.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMISTS AGREE O.C. BETTER DUCK THIS RECESSION SEASON;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE: A PANELIST SAYS PLUMMETING CONSTRUCTION WILL DRAG THE COUNTY DOWN  DEEPER THAN THE REST OF THE STATE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR ROLE BUILDERS  PLAY IN LOCAL ECONOMY.  </P> <P> The nation's economy will slide into a mild recession by early next year -- if  one hasn't already begun -- and the rebound will be sluggish at best, three  economists said Friday.  </P> <P> And Orange County, which nearly missed the last mild recession in 1980 because  of its vigorous economy -- is likely to be hit hard this time around, warned  one member of the panel addressing the annual Orange County Economic Outlook  Conference.  </P> <P> "The county is not recession-resistant," said James Doti, a Chapman College  economist who specializes in local economic forecasts.  </P> <P> He said plummeting construction activity will drag the county deeper into  recession next year than most other areas of the state because of the major  role construction still plays in this economy.  </P> <P> Doti and economists Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. and Norman Mains of the Los  Angeles investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., agreed that the  recession they and other economists predict will be relatively short -- lasting  three to five quarters.  </P> <P> While the recession of 1973-75 was preceded by a quadrupling of world oil  prices, and the recession of 1981-82 was triggered by inflation and spiraling  interest rates, there has been no one significant national or worldwide event  feeding the current slump, Mains said.  </P> <P> The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 caused oil prices to double, but because  the United States is much less dependent on foreign oil now than during the  1973-75 recession, the impact was lessened, he said.  </P> <P> And interest rates and inflation both remain relatively tame, said Sinai,  adding that he does expect inflation to exceed 6.5% in 1991, up from about 5%  this year.  </P> <P> Those factors suggest a shallow recession, Sinai said, but also indicate a less  vigorous recovery.  </P> <P> Sinai also cautioned that any economic predictions are subject to changes in  the Middle East situation.  </P> <P> While none of the economists speculated on the political climate, former  Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told the nearly 800 county business  executives attending that the likelihood of a military conflict is increasing.  </P> <P> Carlucci, who used his luncheon speech for a ringing defense of the Reagan  Administration's arms policies, warned that congressional moves to trim  military spending are premature, despite the diminished threat from the  economically troubled Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But if the Bush Administration succeeds in removing Iraqi troops from Kuwait  without an economy-shattering war, Sinai said, the domestic economic situation  still seems headed for "a protracted period of anemic, sub-par, punky, lousy,  crummy economic performance."  </P> <P> All three economists suggested that a recession has already begun and that the  gross national product -- the official measuring stick of the economy -- will  decline in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Economists define a recession as two or more consecutive quarters of actual  decline in the GNP.  </P> <P> Doti said the county's annual economy of nearly $70 billion is in recession  when there are two or more consecutive quarters in which employment levels are  lower than in the same period of the prior year.  </P> <P> While the county's total employment at the end of August remained slightly  higher than at the end of August, 1989 -- 1.22 million versus 1.2 million --  the total has dropped each month since June.  </P> <P> Doti said his calculations show that the nation will be dragged into recession  largely because of the construction slump.  </P> <P> He added that the resulting job losses in the county will not be fully felt  until early next year.  </P> <P> "The nose-dive in construction, nationally and locally, is the culprit," Doti  said, "and right now we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg."  </P> <P> "The drop in activity started in the third quarter, and it takes from one to  five quarters for all of the employment impact to hit."  </P> <P> Doti said he expects construction activity to "continue plummeting," with a  12-month loss to the economy of about $3 billion when the total impact is  tallied.  </P> <P> "That is about 5% of our total county product," he said, "and that is a pretty  big hit."  </P> <P> "If it weren't for these building permit statistics, there would be no  significant signs of a serious downturn for the county" Doti said in an  interview before his remarks Friday.  </P> <P> County manufacturers say "things are weak but that there is no sign of a big  drop-off," he said. "But there is just not enough going on in manufacturing and  other sectors of the local economy to compensate for such a heavy hit from the  construction slump."  </P></p>

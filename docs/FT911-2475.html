			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Singapore press group up 30% against trend SINGAPORE Press Holdings (SPH) succeeded in lifting both profits and turnover in the first half, resisting the downward trend set by many publishing and newspaper groups worldwide. Group turnover for the half-year to February of SDollars 274.5m (USDollars 157.2m) was 8.5 per cent higher, while group pre-tax profits jumped 30 per centto SDollars 110.4m from SDollars 85m. The improvement came on the back of higher advertising revenue in the first quarter, rationalisation of group operations and cost containment, and lower depreciation charges. Although investment income of SDollars 9.4m was pegged at the February 1990 level, provisions for a reduction inthe value of investments of SDollars 1.1m last time turned into a writeback of SDollars 3.2m this half-year. This was due to higher market values. A writeback of similar provisions for long-term investments boosted extraordinary profits by SDollars 5.4m. This was part of a SDollars 12.8m provision made for SPH's 5 per cent stake in The South China Morning Post acquired from Mr Rupert Murdoch. The move helped offset further losses incurred by an associated company, amounting to SDollars 2.6m. Group attributable profits were consequently lifted 43.4 per cent, from SDollars 57.2m to SDollars 82.1m in February, while earnings per share rose from 23.3 to 31.2 cents. The directors forecast that, with the end of the Gulf war, operating results for the second half year are expected to remain satisfactory. The g roup's performance was in line with the forecasts of analysts, who expect advertising revenue to increase as the local economy picks up. An interim dividend of 8 cents per share was declared.</p>

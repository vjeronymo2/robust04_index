			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 1 (XINHUA) -- Ford, a leading U.S.  motor company, has gradually carried out its development plan in  China by seeking opportunities to set up joint ventures  producing auto components, a top manager of the company said.    "We are satisfied with our achievement in China over past  decade, and we still have lots to do here," said James Paulsen,  president of the Ford China operation, in a recent interview  with XINHUA.    In the past year, Ford exported to China 6200 vehicles,  double the 1992 figure, and sales service is now available in  China's 10 major cities.    Besides, Ford and China's Natural Science Foundation have  signed an agreement last October to establish a fund to finance  China's research in advanced auto components and technology, and  on April 28 this year, 19 Chinese universities and institutes  were awarded 25 scientific research grants.    The company's next step is to set up a joint venture with  China to manufacture auto components to meet the demands of all  kinds of China-made vehicles, Paulsen said.    "Ford's long-term objective in China is to assemble vehicles  after helping China to develop its auto components manufacturing  base," said the newly-appointed president.    To achieve the aim, the company established Ford China  operation last March to coordinate its business with China,  including components manufacturing, technology licensing and  joint scientific and technology research.    Meanwhile, Ford and China's five biggest auto producers  co-established a research and development center for auto  components last year. It marks the first time Ford has made  such cooperation with foreign companies.</p>

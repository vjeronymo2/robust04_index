			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / German recycling bill draws criticism GERMANY'S plan to force industrial producers to recycle their consumer goods could run into the ground in the face of growing criticism from industry lobbyists and parliamentarians. The plan, drafted into a bill last month, is unlikely to receive parliamentary support in its present form, following a review this week by a parliamentary committee in charge of environmental affairs. Opposition Social Democrats and the Free Democrats, the junior party in the coalition, say the bill allows too much state intervention in the economy and could be detrimental to the environment in the long-run. 'Price signals are more efficient than legal standards in driving enterprises to find efficient recycling methods for their products,' Ms Birgit Homburger, a liberal MP said. Their arguments are similar to those of the German industry federation which has been campaigning fiercely against the government plan. The federation has particularly been warning against the additional costs the law would bring on German enterprises. 'The prevention of waste must be left to individual enterprises which know about the complicated manufacturing processes. General legal instructions can instead lead to short-term and wrong solutions,' the federation said in a statement on Monday. The bill, the first of its kind in Europe, makes industrial manufacturers responsible for collecting and recycling the goods they sell. The Environment Ministry hopes the law will force industry to create goods which can be recycled and reduce the increasing amount of industrial waste it produces. Striking engineering workers said yesterday they would resume talks with employers tomorrow that could end a controversial nine-day-old strike in eastern Germany, Reuter adds. But the powerful IG Metall union was preparing for mass demonstrations in the west today to support the strikers, who have been pressing employers to resolve a dispute over broken management wage promises.</p>

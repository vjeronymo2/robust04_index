			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Abdulah Cvikanovic from Kalesija] </F>   [Text] The aggressor continued his barbaric attacks at the  free Kalesija territory yesterday and last night. About 200 most  destructive projectiles were fired and there was fire from  tanks, howitzers, mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, and  antiaircraft guns. All chetnik strongholds were in operation and  the targets were, apart from the defense lines, Tuzla airport  and the settlements of Vukovije, Medjas, Kalesija Center, and  Zukici. There was huge material damage, particularly on family  and economic buildings, and the town industrial zone has been  almost razed.    The aggressor is continuing his fierce artillery attacks as  I  report. The defenders are energetically responding and virtual  artillery duels are being carried out.</p>

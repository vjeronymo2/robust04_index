			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> In reading the excerpts from "Freedom Made Flesh," by Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria  (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 21), one feels compelled to ask, which is most evil in El  Salvador, the left-leaning rebels (communists to us), the militarists running  the country, or the Roman Catholic Church? Sadly, the answer is that all are  equally culpable and will have the blood of the people on their hands for many  years to come.  </P> <P> The now deceased Rev. Ellacuria saw "good violence" mandated by his  interpretation of the Bible, as something which was liberating, a kind of  rightful wrath. Shame on all who think this way. No good reasons can be  advanced to support murder and destruction. It is no surprise that he died at  the hand of violence, it seems clear that he called it on himself.  </P> <P> What solace may have been possible for the El Salvadorans by their church and  its clergy has clearly disappeared. History has shown repeatedly that when  religious institutions are actively a part of the political process or attempt  to usurp it, substituting one hierarchical model of violent authority for  another, democratic processes are overwhelmed and government by consensus  becomes impossible.  </P> <P> JAMES BLOCK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

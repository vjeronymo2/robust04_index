			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Arts: Donizetti Variations - Ballet Any evening that shows us Balanchine's Donizetti Variations comes to us smiling - and we smile back. And any triple bill as well planned as London City Ballet's on Monday night is also to be greeted with pleasure. (I had thought the art of programme-planning, of composing an evening that, like a serious meal, has shape and conscious progression, was lost to British ballet.) LCB began with the Donizetti, which is Balanchine's 1960 response to the ballet music from Don Sebastian. Nothing could be prettier, more fleet or more featly done. A ballerina, Eva Evdokimova, and her cavalier, Paul Thrussell, three trios (one man, two girls), and a bubble of steps that are quick, bouncy, Bournonvillian, are the components. Balanchine knew all there was to know about ballet music in operas: Diaghilev, engaging him in 1924, asked 'Can you make opera ballets, fast?' 'Yes', said Balanchine, who had never made one in his life, 'very fast', and went on to make dozens for the Monte Carlo opera seasons. Such music spoke a language he enjoyed - he used it irresistibly in several works - and to the delicious tunes from Don Sebastian he produced a series of ebullient and taxing entries that LCB show off with enthusiasm. Evdokimova, at the piece's heart, is in radiant form: grand enough to give the piece a focus, and quick-footed and responsive to the fioriture of the writing. It is a wholly irresistible ballet, and in it LCB looks bright, willing, well-mannered. The meaty centre of the evening was a revival of Jack Carter's Witch Boy. This is very much of its time (the mid-1950s) in manner and dramatics - magic and mayhem in the Smokey Mountains - but it is surely made, and in the past has held audiences by its dramatic energy. I do not think LCB's casting is quite right. The memory of John Gilpin's mysterious passion haunts the title role for those of us fortunate to have seen him, and none of the present players seems to find the absolute clarity of feeling and movement that the piece requires to bring it off. It is, though, a useful acquisition to LCB's repertory, and worth seeing. The evening ended with that nicest of iced puddings, Les Patineurs. Ashton choreography is difficult for artists not reared in the Royal Ballet's traditions - and, alas, difficult nowadays for those who are. LCB's dancers push certain effects unnecessarily (the characterisations are in the steps and need no external prodding with 'charm'), but the performance was sound, and Ashton was recognisable. In sum, a well-conceived and well-executed evening: LCB has never looked better. London City Ballet is at Sadler's Wells with varied programmes - check with theatre listings - until January 2. 'Witchboy' is sponsored by Bankers Trust Company. 'Les Patineurs' is sponsored by John and Olivia Hughes</p>

Cost Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Total capital and annualized control costs (third quarter 1990 dollars), including recovery credits, have been estimated for both existing and new sources. The control costs of the proposed regulation at existing facilities is estimated to require a total capital investment of $93 million, with an annualized cost of $8.4 million per year. The implementation costs of the proposed regulation will be lower for new facilities than for existing facilities primarily due to the smaller estimated number of new facilities (26 percent of the total number, encompassing both subcategories) and because new storage tanks are regulated by an existing NSPS standard and require no additional retrofit under the proposed standards. As a consequence, the control costs of the proposed regulation at new facilities is estimated to result in a total capital investment of $32 million, with annualized costs of approximately $7.4 million per year. Additional implementation costs for the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under the proposed rule are estimated to be 4 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards were analyzed with regard to their impact on gasoline price and consumption, facility closures, and declines in employment. While the proposed standards require additional control only at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations, facilities downstream from terminals and breakout stations might be affected by the regulation due to higher gasoline wholesale prices and reduced consumption. The national average base year increase in the price of retail motor gasoline as a result of the proposed standards is estimated at $0.001 per gallon. The national base year decline in gasoline consumption is estimated at less than 100 million gallons (0.08 percent). The base year facility closure estimate is nearly 650, more than 90 percent of which is projected for the service station sector. While the number of service station closures is estimated to be in the hundreds, it should be noted that a total of over 380,000 stations is projected in the base year, so that the number of facilities that might close constitutes less than 0.2 percent. Furthermore, due to a consumption-spurred projection of modest industry growth from 1993 to 1998, some closures due to the regulation may be more accurately interpreted as reductions in new facility openings rather than closures of existing facilities. Employment reductions due to reduced consumption and facility closures are estimated at just over 1,100 jobs, 70 percent of which are projected for the service station sector. However, this constitutes only around 0.05 percent of the base year service station sector employment. For the same reason given for facility closures, some employment reductions may be more accurately interpreted as reductions in industry job opportunities rather than losses of existing jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Decision Process for Setting the NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authority for Development of the NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title III of the 1990 amendments was enacted to help reduce the increasing amount of nationwide air toxics emissions. Under Title III, section 112 was amended to give the Agency the authority to establish national standards to reduce air toxic emissions from sources that emit one or more HAP's. Section 112(b) contains a list of HAP's, which are the specific air toxics to be regulated by the standards developed under section 112. Section 112(c) directs the Agency to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of source categories for which the NESHAP will be developed. The Agency must list all known categories and subcategories of ``major sources'' defined earlier as those sources that emit 10 tons/yr or greater of individual HAP's or 25 tons/yr or greater of any combination of HAP's. Area source categories selected by the Agency for the NESHAP development will be based on the Administrator's judgment that the sources in a category, individually or in aggregate, pose a ``threat of adverse effects to health and the environment.'' The initial list of source categories was published on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Criteria for Development of the NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions from both new and existing sources pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act. The Act requires the standards to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP's achievable for new or existing sources. Each NESHAP must reflect consideration of the cost of achieving the emission reduction, any non-air quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. The emission reduction may be accomplished through application of measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques including, but not limited to, measures that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Pain of new taxes mixed with deficit pleasures - US Business US BUSINESS leaders appeared divided yesterday in their initial assessment of the Clinton economic package. Many expressed concern that it could damp the fragile recovery but others voiced support for its goals of creating jobs and reducing the country's budget deficit. Among the new financial burdens for business are an increase in the top corporate tax from 34 to 36 per cent, a slashing from 80 to 50 per cent of the deductions that may be taken for meals and entertainment, and a cancelling of deductions for executive pay of more than Dollars 1m, for club dues and for lobbying expenses. Tax credits for the purchase of new equipment were also part of the proposal. The three main carmakers in Detroit offered conditional support for Mr Clinton's proposals. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, called it 'a tough package' but said this was needed in view of the size of the deficit. Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, noted that no one liked tax increases because they could have a serious effect on economic recovery. But he thought Americans might be willing to make the sacrifice for a period of time. General Motors stressed that the package should be analysed in its entirety rather than in terms of how it affected individuals. The computer and electronics sector was also divided. The most prominent support from any US business leader came from Mr John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer and a self-professed Republican voter who sat next to Ms Hillary Clinton during the president's speech and applauded before the television cameras. Mr George Fisher, chairman of Motorola, said that while he was 'quite willing to pay more taxes' on a personal level, the increases in corporate taxation were 'very shortsighted'. Mr Craig Barrett, chief operating officer at Intel, hoped the higher corporate taxes would not wipe out the benefits of investment tax credits. Mr Bryan Little, director of government relations for the US Business and Industrial Council, said 'the tax increases Clinton proposes will stifle this economy and serve only to shut down small businesses and put people out of work'. The American Farm Bureau applauded the president for tackling the deficit, but said US farmers and ranchers were disappointed that the package relied so heavily on tax increases rather than spending cuts. In Chicago, Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the Board of Trade, endorsed the energy tax rises, but said he was concerned at new charges on futures transactions and would lobby against it. The view of small business was summed up by Mr Jackson Farris, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business. He said the package would do more harm than good to small businessmen because of taxes, paperwork and regulatory burdens that could stifle the economic recovery. As Clinton administration officials fanned out across the US to help sell the package, Mr Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs who is chairman of the National Economic Council, went to Wall Street yesterday for a lunch meeting with chief executives from 20 top banking groups. Mr James Harmon, chairman of Wertheim Schroder and one of Mr Rubin's guests, termed the package 'bold and courageous' and predicted that it would eventually be approved by Congress. Mr Harmon called the increase in corporate tax rates 'not so serious' and added he did not think the overall package would dampen the US recovery. Support for Mr Clinton's proposals also came from several trade union leaders. Mr John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO union that represents one million workers in the service sector, praised Mr Clinton for coming forward 'with an economic plan that puts working people and their futures first and sets the priorities of this nation straight again'.</p>

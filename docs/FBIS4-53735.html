			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand and the United States are to hold a second  round of aviation talks in Bangkok next month following the  success of their first meeting in Washington last April,  according to a source at the Ministry of Transport and  Communications.    The meeting, which will be held at the Transport and  Communications Ministry in the fourth week of June, is a  positive sign, and the two countries may be able to reach a new  aviation agreement soon, the source said.    "The meeting shows that this time we're getting closer to  key  points of the agreement, especially on seat and cargo  capacities, but Thailand will maintain its position on the equal  capacity principle," the source said.    Thailand and the U.S. aviation industry have been deadlocked  for three years because they differ on the allocation of cabin  and load factors. The United States supports an "open skies"  policy while Thailand holds to the principle of "capacity  pre-determination."    The Thai delegation will be led by Transport Permanent  Secretary Mahidon Chantharangkun while the U.S. team will be  headed by Carl Candiff the State Department's head of special  negotiations for transport affairs.    The source said the United States wants to increase flights  to Bangkok after the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam.  Washington envisages more US tourists and businessmen  travelling to Vietnam via Bangkok.    Thai Airways International [THAI] has no plans to increase  flights to the United States in the short term. THAI flies to  the United States four times a week on the Bangkok-Los Angeles  route. U.S. airlines Delta, Northwest, and United Airlines  operate a total of 21 flights a week to Bangkok.    Last week Thailand and Vietnam signed an aviation agreement  to increase their seat capacities. According to the  Director-General of the Civil Aviation Department, Dr. Sisuk  Chantharangsu, the agreement will create a new destination for  THAI at Danang besides Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh, which the airline  currently services.    The agreement increases the seating capacity for both  countries from 2,350 seats per week by an additional 620 seats,  Mr Sisuk said.    THAI flies to Ho Chi Minh City seven times a week and to  Hanoi three times a week. Vietnam operates seven flights a week  on the Hanoi-Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh-Bangkok routes.</p>

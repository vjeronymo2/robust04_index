			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O'CONNOR SEEKS A PEACE THAT ISN'T THERE  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the abortion decision, when the Supreme Court opinions had  deteriorated into talk-show shouting matches, I began to have a strange feeling  that I had missed something. Or someone. Where was Sandra Day O'Connor in all  this?  </P> <P> For months, it was widely assumed that the lone female justice on the bench  would be pivotal in the Webster case. More than one brief was written directly  to her ambivalence. More than one argument was pitched on her wavelength.  </P> <P> In the final count, she was indeed a formidable fifth. She went with one  majority in favor of restrictive regulations against abortion. She went with  another majority that refrained from overturning Roe vs. Wade. But if her vote  was powerful, her voice could barely be heard.  </P> <P> Harry Blackmun wrote a stunning, emotional opinion that he read from the bench.  Silent Sandra wrote a dry, highly specific, unmemorable, unquotable opinion,  and then skipped court the day the case was handed down.  </P> <P> What happened to the one soprano in the chorus of eight baritones? The only  justice who had ever actually been pregnant? It is entirely possible that  O'Connor went low-key on the abortion decision precisely because she is the  only woman. Any "only woman" knows what it's like to be in the room when a  "woman's issue" comes up and every man turns to her. If she took a step back,  if she deliberately chose to opt out of this high-decibel exchange, there is a  lot of precedent for that.  </P> <P> But when I went back to search for the shade of O'Connor, and reread the  opinion, I found another odd and perhaps highly female caste to it. O'Connor  comes across in this opinion as the court's mediating figure, in search of the  middle. She is the justice of the peace, trying to reduce conflict between her  colleagues and, perhaps, the opposing forces in the country. Even when it means  denying conflict.  </P> <P> Does this remind you of anyone you know? Mom, perhaps?  </P> <P> The Webster case came at the end of a remarkably contentious session. If the  justices are ever to have a cup of coffee together, they may need a mediator.  Justice O'Connor begins as if she is talking directly to her warring  colleagues. Says Harvard Law School's Martha Minow: "She uses every possible  gesture to say, 'Hey, you guys don't really disagree,' and 'Hey, there really  isn't a problem here.' "  </P> <P> Non-problem 1: The preamble to the Missouri law states that life begins at  conception. But O'Connor agreed to uphold this piece of the law because, she  said, it's "too hypothetical" to have any real-life effect. No conflict, no  problem.  </P> <P> Non-problem 2:. The state of Missouri requires doctors to perform tests on  20-week-old fetuses to prove their viability. But O'Connor said the state  didn't really mean that doctors should do such tests if they were unnecessary.  No conflict. No problem.  </P> <P> Non-problem 3: What about using this case to overturn Roe? O'Connor said that  the Webster decision didn't actually, really, truly, absolutely challenge Roe.  No conflict and no problem.  </P> <P> Justice Antonin Scalia, no slouch in the confrontation department, countered  with two full pages calling O'Connor a hypocrite. He said that her efforts to  write away conflict between the court rulings of 1973 and those of 1989 "cannot  be taken seriously." (Dear Antonin, there must be another way to put that.  Can't a woman ever be taken seriously, even on the Supreme Court?)  </P> <P> I would hate O'Connor to drop her conciliatory role and join the anti-abortion  quartet. But the tone that infuses this and other O'Connor decisions raises  some interesting questions about women and judgments -- in and out of the  court.  </P> <P> Many who talk about the need for a "female" perspective in law or government or  business value women as peacemakers, mediators, compromisers. It is women who  frequently translate their children -- uh, colleagues -- to each other.  </P> <P> But there can be a downside to this value. It's the other model of mom standing  over the fighting kids, insisting, "I don't care who's right, I just want peace  and quiet." Prof. Minow describes this downside as "a reluctance to face up to  conflicts that are there, to use a strategy of avoidance. And it's a failure to  state in clear and certain terms the large governing principles for the  future."  </P> <P> In a series of decisions, Justice O'Connor has tried to stake out common  ground, a valuable piece of turf in this society. But you can't always find it.  And you can't always create it.  </P> <P> On the statues that grace our courtrooms, the image of Justice is a woman. But  not necessarily a mom.  </P></p>

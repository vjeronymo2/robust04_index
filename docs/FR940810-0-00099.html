			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A review of the comments and evidence demonstrates that there is a high degree of prevalence of asbestos-containing flooring and that there are diagnostic difficulties in identifying asbestos fibers in flooring material. Consequently, OSHA is changing its approach and the final standard provides that the employers shall assume in removing flooring that it contains asbestos and take the specific precautions unless the employer demonstrates that the flooring materials are not asbestos-containing. Such a showing must be based on analysis which is likely to reveal the asbestos content of the flooring material, the backing and the mastic. No one protocol for analysis is specified, but the standard requires that a certified industrial hygienist (CIH) or project designer certify the analytical results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that the final standard's provisions relating to flooring removal are more comprehensive and protective than the proposal's. There, an exemption for flooring removals from the NPE requirement was conditioned merely on compliance with certain work practices recommended by the Resilient Floor Covering Institute (RFCI). These practices included a prohibition of sanding of floor or backing, use of a HEPA vacuum cleaner before and after removal, prohibition of dry sweeping, application of new material over old tiles without removal if possible, wet removal of residual felt, and bagging and disposal of waste in 6 mil plastic containers. The new final provisions allow removal to be performed by these methods, but also allow various heating methods to be used, or any other means of loosening floor tiles, without breakage. Unlike the proposal, an employer cannot proceed without negative air or critical barriers, merely using non-aggressive work practices and wet methods, unless his pre-job evaluation shows that similar floor removals (in the same building or of the same materials and mastics) were successfully completed by work crews with adequate training and experience in working under these conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA noted in the proposal that data provided by RFCI showed that where jobs followed their recommended practices, mean exposures to workers were between 0.0045 and 0.03 f/cc for workers performing floor tile removal, removal of resilient sheet flooring, or removal of cutback adhesive. During the rulemaking, additional data were submitted showing exposure levels during flooring removals. David Kirby, OSHA witness from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) said that he has used the RFCI work practices successfully, maintaining personal sampling fiber levels at an average of 0.0075 f/cc (range 0.001 to 0.029) (Tr. 99). When asked what additional precautions were taken at his facilities during these operations, he replied that ``we do use regulated areas in the sense that we don't allow anyone in the area as we're doing the work, and we also require workers to wear respiratory protection as they're doing this activity, but yet we don't feel like there is *&blank;*&blank;* a need for negative pressure enclosures.'' (Tr. 124).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD, in its post-hearing brief argued that the RFCI methods specifically, and ``non-aggressive'' flooring removal methods generally, do not always result in exposure levels which are acceptable (Ex. 143). It cited various studies or project results submitted to the record. Some of these results were given in terms of structures per square centimeter, a convention of TEM. For example, Richard Kelly of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory objected to allowing the use of RFCI methods to control asbestos exposure during removal of asbestos containing mastic (Ex. 11,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22). He reported that during removals in which only the mastic contained asbestos, he had measured (by TEM) fiber levels of 33 s/cc during dry power chipping of VAT and 0.9  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s/cc during wet hand removal in what he called a ``real-world application of the RFCI procedures.'' He noted that the floor was not pre-vacuumed nor was a heat gun used as described in the recommended practices. Under its AHERA rule, EPA defines ``structure'' as a microscopic bundle, cluster, fiber or matrix which may contain asbestos. OSHA notes that such structures may be smaller and/or thinner than the asbestos fibers required to be counted under the OSHA reference method. A general summary of the results of these studies shows that most of the exposure levels were below the proposed PELs when measured using the OSHA reference method (e. g., Gobbell, 1991, exposure range, 0.01 to 0.035: AT &amp;T, 1990, non-detected to 0.019).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: 'Comprehensive' economists table excludes most accurate Sir, It is very surprising that in the evaluation of economic forecasters contained in the Financial Times (October 30) no mention whatsoever is made of Prof Wynne Godley. This evaluation is described as 'the most comprehensive effort since the recession started to rank economists according to the accuracy of their growth projections'. Your tabulation puts the actual change in GDP at -2.4 per cent in 1991 and  0.9 per cent in 1992, making -3.3 per cent in all. In a survey of forecasts published in the FT on May 7 1991, Prof Godley's forecasts were almost exactly right, being -2.7 per cent for 1991 followed by -0.9 per cent for 1992, making -3.6 per cent in total. All the other forecasts, without exception, covered by your assessment show an increase in GDP in 1992 and in the two years 1991 and 1992 combined. I find it mystifying that Peter Marsh should remark in his commentary: 'Although even the top-ranked forecasters were some way out in their projections, the analysis provides insights into who was on the right track.' Instead of being completely ignored, Wynne Godley should be put at the head of the list. I realise that your survey covers forecasters in operation regularly since the beginning of 1990. This arbitrary criterion excludes Prof Godley because his articulated forecasts have been published regularly only since the beginning of 1991. But this is no excuse for ignoring Godley when, as the author of your survey must know, his forecasts have been so much better than those you do include and praise.

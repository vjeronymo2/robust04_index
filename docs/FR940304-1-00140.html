			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another possible area of concern regarding this proposed standard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether heat pump water heaters are physically able to be installed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing space in the replacement market. The heat pump itself will require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some additional space, and as was discussed in the product specific comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding classes for water heaters, the Department assumed a sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume would be available to allow air circulation for the proper operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heat pump. The Department believes that medium and larger sizes of water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater installations would typically have sufficient space, being usually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed in areas such as basements or garages. For space-restricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications DOE believes that technical solutions, such as heat pumps with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for ducting air flow, are available as well as integrated space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioning and water heating heat pumps, which are already on the market,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and could be used if and when the central heat pump system is replaced. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very small size installations, such as under-the-counter types, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient space for a heat pump may not be readily available or where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economics of a heat pump may not be justified because the water heating loads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are well below average, the use of electric instantaneous water heaters would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be an effective alternate. A lower limit on the size of electric storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters that the proposed standard would cover may also be a way of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimizing the space and low load concerns. The Department believes there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical solutions to require the use of heat pump water heaters wherever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric storage water heaters are now used and required. This view was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported at the Hot Water Heat Pump Workshop held in Breckenridge, Colorado  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on June 30 through July 2, 1993. The proceedings of the workshop are made a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the record of this notice and are available from the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Freedom of Information Reading Room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Other issues that may warrant further DOE analysis include consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptance of possible increased noise from heat pump water heaters and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated increases in maintenance requirements in comparison to electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance water heaters. DOE is soliciting public comment on these issues,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together with additional data or other information that might assist DOE in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better assessing the impacts of this proposed standard on consumers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Because the Department has little information on the space constraints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for replacement water heaters or the frequency with which small water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience low annual water heating loads, the cost-effectiveness analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standard does not explicitly consider these factors. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes the analysis is sufficient but would attempt to expand it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include any information on these or other related factors that becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available during the public comment period. Based on this possible revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, DOE would consider modifying either the proposed standard level for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric water heaters or the definition of the class of water heaters covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the standard. If the analysis warrants, DOE may establish different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes for two or more sizes of electric water heaters. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically invites public comment on this expanded analysis and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. Direct Heating Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department examined a range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of standard levels for direct heating equipment. In reviewing the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel utilization factor, does not include electrical consumption. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, design options such as adding an induced draft fan improve thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiencies with little or no net energy savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards, in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure to determine this energy descriptor is contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously mentioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4&hyph;5 presents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five efficiency levels selected for analysis for the 16 classes of direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating equipment. Level 5 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tech, considered in the engineering analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

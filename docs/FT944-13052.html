			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Lottery bets on a hitch in live trials: The build-up to a network of 10,000 terminals going on-line / The National Lottery The National Lottery comes a step closer today with the first of a series of 'play days' - live dress rehearsals leading up to the launch of the real thing on November 19. In more than 10,000 retail outlets in every local authority area in the UK staff will 'buy' their Pounds 1 tickets, choose six numbers out of 49 and have them verified by the lottery terminals linked to a complex, high-security network. On Tuesday the numbers will be drawn as if for real although the prize will be a weekend for two in Paris for the retailer who makes fewest mistakes, rather than what will become the usual Pounds 2m or more jackpot. The only certainty about the dress rehearsal is that something is bound to go wrong, Mr David Rigg, communications director of Camelot, the lottery operator, conceded. But whatever flaws are found, Camelot has already achieved a great deal  - operating a live national network for the largest single lottery to be launched in less than 25 weeks. Already ICL, a member of the Camelot consortium, has manufactured and installed the specially designed lottery terminals for the launch. Peritas, ICL's training subsidiary, will have completed the lottery terminal training for more than 35,000 people in the space of six weeks. The training was was carried out at more than 220 locations throughout the UK, usually at hotels. It was unable to begin training the targeted three staff from each of the 10,000 or so retailers - which can range from petrol stations and independent newsagents to J. Sainsbury and Tesco stores - before September 19. There was no point in training people before terminals were installed or too far before that launch. 'I cannot conceive that anything like it has happened before, not in such a concentrated period,' said Mr Tim Holley, chief executive of Camelot, who, like all the 500 Camelot staff, has taken the three-and-a-half-hour course. 'All the Camelot staff are going to be trained. I want them to understand in responding to retailers exactly what is involved,' Mr Holley added. Mr Stuart Kearns, Peritas manager of the Camelot training project, looked at lotteries in other parts of the world before designing the programme. One key thing to avoid was what happened in the Texas lottery where 28 per cent of those supposed to come for training were 'no shows'. This led to the decision to have such a large number of venues around the country so that no one should have to travel for more than half an hour to get there. The course covered everything from an introduction to the lottery and the five 'good causes' which will benefit - possibly to the extent of Pounds 9bn over seven years - to how to operate the lottery terminals. There was also a quiz at the end to check knowledge. 'If people really haven't coped, we take steps to ensure that they really will be all right,' Mr Holley said. The training contract will represent a multi-million pound deal for Peritas by the time the full complement of more than 40,000 retailers have been trained by the end of 1996. After the November 19 launch there will be a pause to draw breath before the programme of installing on-line lottery terminals rolls on. There will be another pause in the spring when scratch cards will be launched in addition to the multi-million jackpot draw. As the final countdown gets under way there was encouraging market research for Camelot. Thirty per cent of people said they would play the National Lottery every week and as many as 80 per cent said they would buy tickets occasionally.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / The unkindest cut: The future of the UK's pay review bodies Have Britain's pay review bodies outlived their usefulness? The five bodies - which recommend annual pay rises for one-third of Britain's 5m public sector workers - find themselves in an increasingly uncomfortable position as a result of the government's attempts to hold down public sector pay. If the recommendations they are working on for next year's pay rises are too high, the government is likely to set them aside. If they fall into line with the pay bill freeze and recommend close to a zero rise their independent judgement will be questioned - not least by the leaders of the 550,000 nurses who this week lodged a claim for an 8.3 per cent rise. The five bodies were set up in two waves. In the early 1970s, three were set up for leading groups of state employees (mainly men) who did not strike or collectively bargain: top civil servants and judges; doctors and dentists; and the armed forces. The second wave (mainly covering women) followed industrial unrest - the nurses review body in 1984 and the teachers in 1991. The review bodies are in some ways a hangover from a time when much of public life was arranged by committees of the great and good. The two largest - the teachers and the nurses - are run by, respectively, Mr John Gardiner, chairman of the Laird Group, and Mr Mike Bett, a deputy chairman of BT. These chairmen have a large influence in choosing seven colleagues who - if they pass government vetting - usually sit on the review body for two or three years. They include retired civil servants, such as Dame Anne Mueller, the former Treasury mandarin, who sits on the nurses review body. There is a sprinkling of experts such as Mr Philip Halsey of the teachers review body who is former head of the now-defunct Schools Examination and Assessment Council. There are also private-sector outsiders, such as Mrs Julia Cuthbertson, news editor of the Financial Times, who is also on the teachers' review body. The members of review bodies may be unpaid volunteers, but they take on a heavy workload. In September, they start hearing evidence from unions, government and other parties, making their recommendations to the government in January. Throughout the year they commission studies on aspects of pay and performance from their secretariat, the Office of Manpower Economics. Their reports do more than merely recommend a headline annual pay increase for, say, all nurses or soldiers. They include recommendations on matters such as hours and grading. The problems arise when their recommendations are incompatible with the government's pay policy. In 1993-94, the government imposed a 1.5 per cent rise throughout the public sector. The pay review bodies' were asked not to make recommendations, amid grumbling. This year was the first in the three-year public sector pay-bill freeze imposed in the last Budget. The review body's recommendations for the current year have managed to co-exist with the freeze, although the 2.9 per cent rise for teachers and 3 per cent for nurses were accepted with reluctance by the government. However, it will get harder as the pay-bill freeze continues. Similar rises early next year or in early 1996 may severely hurt services or lead to a large number of compulsory redundancies if implemented in full. The pay review bodies are aware of the restraints they are working under but at the same time insist that it is their job to come to an independent judgement about their particular group of employees. That judgement has been more generous than the government would like. The privileged public-sector workers covered by the review bodies have seen their pay rise 156 per cent between 1981 and 1993, in line with the private sector. The rest of the public sector - mainly civil servants and local government workers - have lagged behind with rises of 123 per cent over the same period. Most review body members are strong believers in setting pay at a rate no higher than that sufficient to recruit and retain the staff required. But inevitably, they sometimes sympathise with those whose pay they set. 'If the government decides it does not like our judgement that is fine, but it should not expect a group of public-spirited people who have given up a lot of time and energy coming to that judgement to shrug and carry on,' says one pay review body member. A full-scale rejection of a recommendation early next year might cause a walk-out, though slightly reducing a recommendation by phasing it in would be unlikely to do so. Most members of the pay review bodies belong to the establishment and believe that they do an important job. 'We are more subtle and flexible than the annual pay rise figure makes us seem, and we would want to argue from the inside,' says one member. One of the government's options for keeping them on side would be to wean the review bodies off the nationwide headline increase. As public sector pay setting is increasingly devolved to local level, particularly in health and teaching, they could be encouraged to concentrate more on the details of how pay is determined and distributed. Mr Michael Portillo, one of the cabinet hawks on public spending, made this point earlier this year to the Treasury Select Committee. Asked if the pay review bodies were now pointless, he replied that they were not but needed to understand the reality of the pay-bill freeze. He added: 'They do a great deal more than arrive at a global figure; they also make useful recommendations about distribution.' This is something that review bodies used to do, but have largely abandoned in recent years. Another option, aired in this year's nurses review body report, would be to ask them to review the pay of nursing staff as a whole, but confine any recommendations to minimum levels only. The review bodies could, therefore, become a bit like the wages councils that used to set minimum rates in parts of the private sector before abolition last year. Such a role would continue to recognise the peculiarities of the public-sector labour market but remove the review bodies from confrontation with the government. The alternatives look less attractive: a return to collective bargaining; the introduction of more pay formulae as enjoyed by the police and fire service; or simple imposition of pay increases by managers at local or national level. And if the government wants to keep open the option of restricting strikes in essential services, now is not the time to abolish a pay review system that has proved popular and credible.</p>

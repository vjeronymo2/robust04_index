			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Search for Times editor promptsshake-up of top newspaper jobs THE SEARCH for a new editor of The Times has triggered a surprise shake-up at the top of three leading British newspapers. New editors will take over at the Daily Mail, the London Evening Standard and the Mail on Sunday - all owned by Associated Newspapers - and Mr Simon Jenkins, editor of The Times, yesterday announced that he would step down when a replacement was found. The round of editorial musical chairs was prompted earlier this week when Mr Paul Dacre, editor of the Evening Standard, was twice offered - and turned down - the editorship of The Times, one of the most illustrious jobs in British journalism. Instead, Mr Dacre, who became editor of the Evening Standard last year, was appointed editor of the Daily Mail, taking over from Sir David English, who held the post for just over 21 years. Sir David will become chairman of Associated Newspapers as well as remaining group editor-in-chief. Mr Jonathan Holborow, deputy editor of the Daily Mail, becomes editor of the Mail on Sunday, and Mr Stewart Steven, currently editor of the Mail on Sunday, takes over the Evening Standard. Viscount Rothermere, Associated's proprietor, gives up his chairmanship of the newspaper subsidiary but remains chairman of its holding group, the Daily Mail and General Trust. The saga began in London some weeks ago when Mr Dacre was interviewed by Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corporation, and Mr Andrew Knight, executive chairman of News International, its UK subsidiary which owns five national newspapers, including The Times. The interview was followed this week by the two formal offers of the job. The offers precipitated the changes at Associated, which was keen to keep Mr Dacre, but according to one senior executive only brought forward by a couple of months what was likely to happen anyway. Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said last night that the changes would release tremendous energy. Mr Jenkins, who has edited The Times since March 1990, told his editorial staff yesterday afternoon that he would be giving up the editorship of The Times before next March. He said he had always made it clear he was a short-term editor and that he wanted to resume his writing career within two years. He had agreed to stay for a third year - until March 1993 - to enable a new editor to be found.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / US industrial production up by 4.3% US INDUSTRIAL activity continued to grow at a strong pace last month as inflation remained steady, feeding hopes of a sustained economic recovery. The US Federal Reserve Board said industrial production rose by 0.4 per cent in February, the fifth month in succession in which it has increased. Output showed a 4.3 per cent gain over the past 12 months, the Fed reported. Despite a dip in output of motor vehicles, production of consumer goods rose 0.6 per cent in the month to a level 5.3 per cent higher than a year ago, while a 0.3 per cent monthly gain left production of business equipment 8.2 per cent up over the past 12 months. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, output of consumer goods rose 0.8 per cent in February and output of business equipment 0.5 per cent. Factories and plants operated at 79.9 per cent of capacity in February, the highest rate for 18 months, the Fed said. At the same time, the Commerce Department said the consumer price index climbed by 0.3 per cent in February, taking the year-on-year inflation rate a notch lower to 3.2 per cent. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, prices increased by 0.5 per cent, taking this core rate of inflation higher to 3.6 per cent year-on-year and prompting some concern about a revival of inflationary pressures. But economists said much of the rise was attributable to a predictable increase after seasonal adjustment in clothes prices, caused by retailers starting their sales much earlier than usual and having little room left to offer further discounts, as they would usually do in February. 'We believe overall material costs remain moderate. Overall, we expect inflation to average just 2.8 per cent in 1993 compared to 3.0 per cent in 1992,' said Wall Street brokerage company Merrill Lynch. The twin towers of the World Trade Centre, shut by a bomb that destroyed communications and safety systems, will start to reopen today ahead of schedule, officials announced yesterday, Reuter reports from New York. New York state Governor Mario Cuomo, who has an office in the building, will today be the first tenant to return. Others will return tomorrow, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the complex, said. The Authority had previously set an April 1 target for reopening the towers. The bomb blast in a car park on February 26 killed six people. Lex, Page 14</p>

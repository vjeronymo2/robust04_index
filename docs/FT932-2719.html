			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Graystone The rights issue by Graystone was taken up as to 11.93 per cent of the fully underwritten issue. The balance will be subscribed at the 8p price by the sub-underwriters. Graystone, formerly Ptarmigan Holdings, launched the rights, originally planned as a placing, to raise Pounds 5m towards the Pounds 8m cost of acquiring FKI Cableform, which makes numbering machines, lighting products and electrical controls. This follows the acquisition last November of three engineering companies. It is disposing of its original businesses of making sausage casings, artificial flowers and ribbons, publishing cookery and crafts books, and running three small country hotels. The directors said the fund raising would give the company a much broader spread of institutional holders. The issue was underwritten by Chemical Investment Bank.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] It has been disclosed that Juan Blau, general  manager of the Interoceanic Region Authority [ARI], could be  preparing to resign. The likelihood of Mr. Blau's resignation  has prompted several meetings and concern among the other ARI  directors.    ARI adviser Adolfo Obarrio commented to "Telemetro Reports"  on the possibility of the resignation of the current ARI general  manager.    [Begin Obarrio recording] All I can say is that we have been  working normally and have even progressed significantly. I am  not aware of anything out of the ordinary taking place at this  time. I am aware, however, of the reports that have been  circulating through the media. It would seem that there is a  report that speculates that Mr. Blau could be thinking of  resigning. Why? I do not know since I have not yet spoken to  the other ARI directors. Therefore, I am not aware of any  specific reason that could prompt such a decision. [end  recording]    Mr. Blau's replacement is an issue the ARI Board of  Directors  will have to evaluate.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] If Mr. Blau did  decide to resign, who would replace him?    [Obarrio] That is a good question because at this time there  is no deputy general manager. I am not a lawyer and would not  like to get involved in an area that is out of my competence.  Nevertheless, I understand that no government official can  resign from his post if there is no replacement. I also  understand that the law requires that a replacement be selected  from among several candidates. Therefore, Mr. Blau would have to  remain in his position until the new general manager is  selected. [end recording]</p>

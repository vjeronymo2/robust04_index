			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORMS POUND OWENS VALLEY FOR THIRD DAY  </P> <P> Powerful thunderstorms battered the Owens Valley for the third straight day  Thursday, undermining the Los Angeles Aqueduct -- already buried under more  than 100,000 cubic yards of flash-flood debris -- cutting U.S. 395 and flooding  a town in Mono County.  </P> <P> The downpours were spawned by a massive subtropical weather system that has  been lashing the deserts of California, Arizona and Nevada since Tuesday with  torrential, wind-whipped rains.  </P> <P> Forecasters said the rains are expected to continue today, especially in  Imperial and Riverside counties, bringing the threat of additional flooding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Communities Flooded  </P> <P> On Tuesday and Wednesday, the storms flooded riverfront residential and  business communities in the Yuma, Ariz., area, generated gusts of close to 100  m.p.h. that caused about $14 million in damage in Las Vegas and buried a  two-mile stretch of the Los Angeles Aqueduct -- which provides 75% of Los  Angeles' water -- under an avalanche of sand, mud and rock.  </P> <P> At noon Thursday, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power crews had to  abandon their aqueduct cleanup efforts near Olancha as a vast mass of  thunderclouds stalled over the area, dumping rain along a 120-mile stretch of  the eastern High Sierra. The cloudbursts continued unabated throughout the  afternoon.  </P> <P> The downpours triggered new flash floods that raced through the small community  of Chalfant Valley, about 15 miles north of Bishop on California 6. The  floodwaters invaded at least 29 homes, forcing evacuation of most of the town's  residents. California 6 and California 120 remained closed by water and debris  for the second day.  </P> <P> About 100 miles to the south, cloudbursts driven by 60 m.p.h. winds gouged out  the underpinnings of the aqueduct near Cartago and cut U.S. 395 for the second  time in three days, closing a 63-mile stretch of the road between Lone Pine and  the junction of California 14, near Inyokern. U.S. 395 is the principal route  between Southern California and the eastern Sierra resort areas.  </P> <P> The Inyo County sheriff's office said its officers were evacuating motorists  who were stranded by the floodwaters, and additional officers were standing by  in case the towns of Olancha and Cartago -- about five miles apart on U.S. 395,  on the shores of usually dry Owens Lake -- began to flood.  </P> <P> A deputy sheriff burst in the door of the Hitching Post cafe in Olancha about  4:30 p.m. and warned the patrons to get moving.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Aqueduct Could Break'  </P> <P> "The aqueduct could break and a wall of water could come down right here," he  said. "Get in your cars and head south."  </P> <P> The rains stopped, at least temporarily, about 5 p.m. Portions of U.S. 395 were  reopened and Department of Water and Power crews moved back in to survey the  new damage to the aqueduct. However, the National Weather Service said  additional thunderstorms were expected to hit the area during the night.  </P> <P> Terry Hampton, who has lived in Olancha 17 years, said she came into town  Thursday afternoon to buy gas "and found a river flowing down the highway. I  just about got swept away. I was lucky to get out of here. I've never seen  anything like this."  </P> <P> At Vicky's Mobil station at the south end of town, Bob Smith, 15, said he spent  the day helping a neighbor shovel mud piled up around her home and helped  evacuate her 10 horses.  </P> <P> "At one time the sheriff told us we might have to get out of here," said Mary  Lou Smith, Bob's mother. "Up there by (California) 190 it was knee deep and  moving real fast."  </P> <P> The flooding had a silver lining for the service station where the Smiths work:  "The store was super, super busy," Mary Lou Smith said.  </P> <P> People whose cars were lined up on the highway "came in to buy goodies while  they were waiting," she said.  </P> <P> Although the aqueduct cleanup is expected to take another two weeks or more,  the DWP said Los Angeles will continue to receive an adequate supply of water  from down-channel reservoirs and through purchases from the Metropolitan Water  District, which draws on other sources. None of the DWP's major  power-generating facilities were shut down by the flooding.  </P> <P> In Yuma, Mayor Jim Buster said Thursday that 500 to 1,000 homes had been  damaged by floodwaters that raced through the Colorado River community during a  three-hour downpour that dropped 4.8 inches of rain -- almost twice the normal  annual total -- late Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "We've got several main roads closed, water pipes busted, you name it," he  said. "The south side of town has no water pressure in case of a fire. . . .  The storm drains are maxed out. There's no place to pump the water."  </P> <P> Buster said that with floodwaters as deep as four feet in some residential  areas, "some of the people had to swim out."  </P> <P> "The magnitude of the storm was so great that we could not get our people in to  evacuate people," said Roger Gingrich, Yuma's assistant director of public  services. "I ended up almost flipping my four-wheel-drive vehicle and having to  abandon it on my way to help a pregnant lady. They were finally able to get to  her with fire apparatus."  </P> <P> Bobbie O'Neill, a Yuma resident, said thrill seekers in four-wheel-drive  vehicles caused some hard feelings at the height of the storm.  </P> <P> "What happened was that a lot of idiots went wheeling up and down the streets .  . . and caused waves that got into people's homes," O'Neill said. "Well, the  homeowners didn't like that and they were out there with baseball bats hitting  windshields before the police arrived."  </P> <P> Mayor Buster said officers were ticketing four-wheelers who were causing the  trouble.  </P> <P> With floodwaters still standing in some low-lying areas Thursday night, a  number of residents were being housed at local schools and a National Guard  armory.  </P> <P> Across the river, in the Imperial County community of Winterhaven, residents  said water was still standing "neck deep" in some areas Thursday night.  </P> <P> In Indio, hit by flash-flooding Wednesday night, one of the westbound lanes of  Interstate 10 remained closed by debris Thursday evening.  </P> <P> Officials said a Riverside County sheriff's deputy and a California Highway  Patrol officer waded into a flooded wash near Indio on Wednesday night to pull  two girls to safety after their car overturned while fording the stream.  </P></p>

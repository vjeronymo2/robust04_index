			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Takeda ahead at halfway stage - Pharmaceuticals JAPAN's leading drug companies managed to sustain earnings for the first half to September, due to firm sales of drugs with wide profit margins and aggressive cost-cutting efforts. Takeda Chemical Industries, the industry leader, said its profits grew on brisk sales of new drugs, although pharmaceutical sales remained almost flat. Healthcare items, including its wide variety of 'pep' drinks, fell 10.2 per cent due to the cold summer, while sales at its chemicals division were hit by a fall in demand from the electronics and car industries, declining 4.5 per cent. For the full year to March, Takeda expects unconsolidated sales to remain flat at Y565bn (Dollars 5bn), and pre-tax profits to fall 3.2 per cent to Y75bn. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical said pre-tax profits for the first half fell due to the fall in interest income as interest rates declined. However, operating profits were up 4.5 per cent to Y26.7bn due to brisk sales of its ulcer drug and a new diuretic compound. The company expects full year non-consolidated pre-tax profits to rise 0.6 per cent to Y57.5bn on a 6.7 per cent increase in sales to Y260bn. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical posted firm non-consolidated pre-tax profits, but on an after-tax level saw a 44.9 per cent plunge to Y1.8bn due to an extraordinary loss on shareholdings of its unprofitable US subsidiary. However, the company said firm sales of antibiotics helped overall sales. For the year to March, Fujisawa expects parent company pre-tax profits to rise 1.1 per cent to Y236bn and sales to remain flat at Y236bn. After-tax profits are expected to increase by 2.2 times to Y3bn. The company revised up its consolidated forecast for the year, due to a pickup in earnings at Fujisawa USA. The company expects a 28.5 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y18bn instead of an initial forecast of a 7.1 per cent fall to Y13bn. Shionogi said its cost-cutting efforts lifted unconsolidated operating profits by 23.7 per cent to Y9.2bn. Although it saw increased sales of its allergy formula, overall sales remained flat due to sluggish revenue of its antibiotics. For the full year, it expects a 11.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y24bn on a 0.4 per cent increase in sales to Y239bn. Eizai saw a 4.2 per cent rise in its pharmaceutical division thanks to firm sales of its ulcer drug. Full year pre-tax profits for the parent company are expected to rise 2 per cent to Y32bn on a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y224bn. Daiichi Pharmaceutical said it will raise its interim dividend by Y1 per share to Y7 and annual dividend by Y2 to Y14 as it pledged to raise its payout ratio on its bond issuance last April. The company saw a jump in sales of its antibacterial drug and antihypertensive compound. However, the yen's appreciation caused a foreign exchange loss of Y900m. For the year to March, Daiichi sees unconsolidated pre-tax profits rising 1.8 per cent to Y38.5bn on a 4.3 per cent sales increase to Y210bn.  ------------------------------------------------           JAPANESE DRUGS COMPANIES              Interim results 1993  ------------------------------------------------              Sales   Change     Pre-tax   Change             Y (bn)      %    prof.

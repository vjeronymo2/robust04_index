			<p>BFN     [Text] Today in Jurmala, groups of experts of the Latvian-  Russian interstate talks completed the coordination of an  additional protocol to the agreement on social guarantees for  the discharged Russian military that was submitted by Latvia.  With this, there are no obstacles now to the delegations  signing the package of documents on the withdrawal of the  Russian Army, Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation,  believes.    Aivars Vovers, deputy head of the Latvian delegation, also  admitted that there are no obstacles now for a meeting between  the Latvian and Russian presidents, from the point of view of  the readiness of the agreements. The protocol provides for  several ways to tackle the issues related to emigration to  Russia or other states by the Russian officers discharged in  Latvia, if they wish to do so.    It is envisaged to tackle the issue of the amount of payment  for rent of the Skrunda radar station at the presidents'  meeting.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Big UK companies back PM's stance BRITAIN'S biggest companies yesterday gave near-unanimous backing to the government's pro-Maastricht stance and warned that the country faced continuing recession and deepening isolation if its political commitment to Europe faltered. More than 50 of the country's biggest corporations contacted by the Financial Times on the eve of the critical Commons debate said a No vote risked leaving Britain as a 'semi-detached' member of the Community, powerless to influence events. There is evident impatience at the uncertainty surrounding Britain's future role in Europe and a desire to see an end to a period of mounting confusion. Many companies voiced fears that Britain's ability to exploit fully the single market would be seriously undermined if it were not to ratify the treaty and that inward investment into Britain would be badly hit if the country appeared to be increasingly isolated within the EC. Though many companies want the government to clarify elements of the treaty, they believe its ratification remains an inevitable step in Europe's political and economic development. Most chief executives say that, whatever the doubts over Maastricht, the vote will send an important message to Britain's EC partners and that it must be positive. Britain's smallest companies appear most hesitant about the implications of integration. The Federation of Small Businesses said it supported a referendum on Maastricht, claiming the treaty offered 'threats and promises'. It feared the negative aspects would hit smaller companies. A more widespread view was put by Mr Barry Stephens, chairman and chief executive of Siebe, the engineering group, who said a No vote would seriously damage Britain's trading and manufacturing prospects. 'I believe the penalty will be profound - in one word isolation.' Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, said Britain had to demonstrate political commitment to reap the full advantages of the single market. 'Now is the time to move forward from a decade of half-hearted commitment to Europe to a real commitment.' Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury, the grocery group, said: 'We cannot keep pretending that we are half-in half-out. To be out would be disastrous but to be constantly debating whether we are in or not seems to me to be equally ludicrous.' Support for Major, Page 10</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Hu Angang and Kang </F> Xiaoguang, researchers with the National Situation Study Group  of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: "Corruption Chokes Growth,  Say Experts"]    [Text] Corruption still occurs in China despite periodic  campaigns to eliminate it.    And it is not only restricted to government and Party  officials-- shortcomings within the economic system have also  encouraged others to resort to dishonesty.    In order to stamp out corruption, the country's economic and  managerial systems should be restructured. This is more  effective than launching moral crusades.    Government and military departments should be banned from  running businesses. They should have their administrations  streamlined and their staff should be paid higher wages.    And banks should not be made to impose loan quotas and  discriminatory interest rates on private businesses. Instead,  their criteria for lending should be based on the performance of  the debtor.    And the government should see to it that all businesses,  regardless of their ownership and organization, compete on an  equal footing. They should have equal access to foreign  exchange, foreign trade rights and other resources.    The dual pricing system which exists for certain raw  materials, capital and labour at the moment invites abuse of the  system.    The government's protection of some businesses, the monopoly  status it grants to some industries, its excessive customs  tariffs and import quotas and its preferential treatment of  certain departments and regions, have all aided unfair  competition and led to corruption.    The absence of a sound legal system and a lack of checks and  balances within the government have also furthered corruption.    For a while malpractices were checked, only to raise their  heads again once the pressure was off.    The most effective anticorruption drive would be a gradual  reform of the unfair allocation system.    Capital is the most important element in any society. Until  now, the government has secured a low interest rate for  State-owned enterprises while adopting a much higher,  market-dictated interest rate for the private sector.    In addition to this, the government has adopted a loan quota  system to guarantee loans for state-run firms. As a result some  banks demand bribes from private companies that are eager for a  loan.    The government should unify interest rates and float them so  that they are set by market demand. It needs to allow non-State  and foreign banks to compete in the financial market and at the  same time it should subsidize loans for such sectors as  agriculture, communications and energy production.    To ensure fair competition, the government should also slash  tariffs, cancel the monopoly status it has given to  import-export firms, lift controls on foreign exchange and  reduce the restrictions on foreign businesses involved in the  service industry.    Except in the case of a few essential public services such  as  electricity, water and gas supplies, postal services and  military production, there is little reason for retaining  government monopolies. Moreover, the government should break  down all regional trade barriers to ensure the free flow of  resources and it should abolish preferential tax reductions.    The existing salary levels for government officials don't  help. Civil servants with high political positions often only  enjoy low economic status. The sense of not being paid for what  they do leads many bureaucrats to run their own businesses or  exchange favours for bribes.    If the size of the present administration is cut by  one-third, the salary of bureaucrats should be raised to at  least that of the average worker. Meanwhile, housing, medical  and transport subsidies for officials should be abolished and  their gross incomes should be made public.    The government is also not spending enough on defence. To  make up the shortfall, the Chinese army is now engaging in  business activities to make money. Some of which have led to  corruption.    For the long-term stability of the country, the government  should increase its military spending substantially to ensure  that the income of soldiers and officers is higher than that of  the national average.</p>

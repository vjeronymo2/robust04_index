A compromise plan is gaining ground among the seven-party  coaltion after coalition party representatives failed to narrow  the gap over whether to offset the proposed income tax reduction  with a hike in the consumption tax, the official said. Under  the plan, the government would issue a statement that would say  the government should reach within a year a final decision on  basic tax reform policy including revision of the ratio of  direct to indirect taxes in the total tax revenues.    The plan also calls for the establishment of a special forum  within the coalition to discuss the problem.    The government failed to reach an agreement on the issue due  mainly to opposition by the Social Democratic Party to raising  the consumption tax from the current 3 percent to finance the  planned tax cuts.    The forthcoming package of economic stimulus measures will  include income and resident tax cuts worth over 7 trillion yen,  the Shinseito official said.</p>

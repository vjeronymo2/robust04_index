			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Germany heads for calmer waters - A fall in bund yields is expected in 1995 After a stormy year, German government bonds are likely to enter calmer waters in 1995. However, the new year will not be all plain sailing, with economic expansion gathering speed and expectations of interest rate increases growing. Indeed, although most market analysts predict a decline in bund yields during the year, many expect them to be little changed at the end of 1995 from their current levels. German government bonds, or bunds, began 1994 in a buoyant mood, boosted by hopes of further interest rate cuts which had underpinned the market throughout 1993. Amid this climate of optimism, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bund reached its lowest point at 5.5 per cent in early January. Then things turned sour. First, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in February, fuelling fears of inflation and monetary tightening even in those countries whose economies were clearly behind the US cycle. This was followed by a rapid unwinding of speculative positions by leveraged bond market players, most of whom had bet on a continuation of the previous year's bull run. In Germany, alarming money supply numbers - with January M3 data, released on March 2, showing a growth rate of 20.6 per cent - sent further shudders through the market on fears that, far from continuing its rate-cutting campaign, the Bundesbank would start raising rates. By early October, the yield on the 10-year benchmark reached its year's high of 7.77 per cent. Although bunds recovered some of their losses in the final months of the year, helped by a more stable US Treasury market and a resumption of bund purchases by domestic retail and institutional investors, they remain vulnerable to weakness in the US market and fears of reviving inflationary pressures. While Bundesbank officials have been emitting a stream of cryptic statements indicating that they are keeping their options open on the future direction of monetary policy, most observers now feel that, although both inflation and M3 money supply growth are near or at the Bundesbank's stated targets, the only way for German official interest rates is up. 'In the face of stronger 1994 growth and the higher inflation risk in 1995 and 1996 associated with that growth, we now feel that there is no scope or necessity for the Bundesbank to ease headline rates further in this cycle,' said Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at UBS in Frankfurt. Inflation in December stood at 2.7 per cent, compared with the central bank's 2 per cent goal, and M3 in November fell to 6 per cent, the top of its 4 - 6 per cent target range. But although inflation is expected to decline further in the first half of 1995 - helped by a substantial base effect improvement in January - and M3 may remain in its target range after overshooting it for most of the last three years, there is evidence to suggest that inflation pressures are rising. 'The output gap is virtually closed, capacity utilisation and pipeline inflation measures are rising and economic growth is strong,' warn analysts at IBJ International. Moreover, recent positive M3 numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt, dis-torted as they are by Germany's new money market funds. Some DM19.5bn has flowed into these funds between August and November; if this money had remained in the banking system, November M3 would have been around 6.9 per cent, rather than the reported 6 per cent. However, while few expect another cut in official rates, many say the first increase may not materialise until the second half - and some say the final quarter - of the year. 'The picture is of sustained but not runaway growth,' argues Mr Reid. 'We feel the market's expectation of imminent and extensive rate rises is too pessimistic.' Early in the year, the 1995 wage round may prompt market jitters amid fears that the Bundesbank could fire a pre-emptive monetary 'warning shot'. However, most expect the wage round to be relatively smooth, with trade unions' concerns about unemployment and employers' continued drive to cut costs indicating wage settlements of around 3 per cent. On the fiscal front, bunds are likely to derive support from continued budget consolidation, helped by the rise in tax revenues resulting from economic recovery and the reduction in transfer payments by the federal government to the eastern German states. The federal budget deficit is projected at some DM59bn in 1995, little changed from this year. Mr Rutger Teuscher at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt estimates that Germany's total public-sector deficit will amount to DM107bn, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product, in 1995. That compares with DM142bn (4.3 per cent of GDP) in 1994 and DM179bn (5.8 per cent of GDP) in 1993. Meanwhile, politics could act as a sporadic irritant for the market. Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl won his fourth election last October, his majority in the upper house of parliament is sharply reduced and rifts in his fragile centre-right coalition could unnerve the market. However, bunds - often seen as Europe's 'safe haven' - could benefit from political uncertainty in other European countries, such as France, Italy, Spain and the UK, where imminent elections or political upheaval may scare bond investors away. Most forecasters expect the German yield curve to flatten substantially next year. Ten-year bunds are seen trading in a rough range of 7.25-7.75 per cent, to end the year around 7.5 per cent (up from 7.65 per cent at present), while three-month money rates are seen rising to around 6-6.25 per cent by year-end (up from 5.30 per cent currently). 'It will be largely a year of consolidation,' says one senior bund dealer in Frankfurt. 'After being overbought in 1993 and oversold in 1994, bunds could do with a period of relative calm.'</p>

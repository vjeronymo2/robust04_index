			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Brazil ends curbs on gold market BRAZIL has allowed the first official gold exports by a private institution in what appears to be a step towards opening up its foreign exchange system. Although Brazilian financial institutions have been permitted to trade in gold since 1989, only the central bank was able to sell overseas. On Monday new legislation came into force completely freeing the gold market and allowing private entities to export gold for the first time. The first Brazilian company to take advantage of the change was Banco Cindam, a merchant bank and the country's largest buyer and refiner of gold from garimpeiros, or wildcat miners. The business community hopes the next step will be to allow the free movement of dollars.</p>

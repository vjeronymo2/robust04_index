			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG plans 50% stake in Lihir gold project THE GOVERNMENT of Papua New Guinea (PNG) yesterday said it would take a half share in the USDollars 760m Lihir Island gold project unless RTZ Corporation and Niugini Mining, the joint venture partners, find a third partner within a month. The announcement comes only days after the government said it would increase its proposed stake in Lihir from 20 per cent to 30 per cent to achieve parity with the Australian-run Porgera gold project. Mr Paias Wingti, prime minister, said after a cabinet meeting in Port Moresby that the government had decided to take a 50 per cent shareholding to make sure the project was not delayed. He said the joint venture partners had indicated the project faced 'financing difficulties." The announcement appeared to surprise the joint venture partners. Niugini Mining, which owns 20 per cent of the project, said it had received no official notification of the proposal. The Lihir Joint Venture (LJV), which represents both companies, said it was considering its response and hoped 'to continue discussions with the PNG government in the near future." The government was expected to pay USDollars 37.5m, equivalent to 30 per cent of the project's sunk costs, for a 30 per cent stake which would reduce Niugini's shareholding from 20 per cent to 14 per cent, and RTZ's from 80 per cent to 56 per cent. Lac Minerals of Canada, one of the companies RTZ talked to about taking a shareholding, withdrew from the project last year, and the development has been delayed by RTZ's failure to find a fresh taker for a 15 per cent stake.</p>

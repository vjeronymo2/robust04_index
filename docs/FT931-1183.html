			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Wellcome down to earth It seems uncharitable to slice 8 per cent from Wellcome's share price in response to a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. But having smartly outperformed Glaxo for the last three months, Wellcome was already vulnerable. Stripping out currency movements from yesterday's interim figures shows it to be far from immune from tough market conditions. Volume growth of its two largest drugs, Zovirax and Retrovir, has slowed markedly. Drug prices fell in Europe as the German and other governments introduced stern regulations. There are signs that the steady margin improvement of recent years may not have much further to go. Like Glaxo, Wellcome must also plan for the patent expiry of its biggest selling drug. Zovirax, like Glaxo's Zantac, may find a new lease of life as an over-the-counter medicine. Since Wellcome already sells cold remedies through chemists shops and supermarkets, it might be better placed than Glaxo to manage the transition. But developing an OTC version of Zovirax will require heavy marketing outlays. That would squeeze Wellcome's margins. An OTC business based on a small range of products would also be vulnerable to competition. The odds on success in OTC medicines will certainly improve if Wellcome can agree a joint venture with a credible international partner. That might help justify the price-earnings premium to Glaxo remaining after yesterday's slide in the shares. But the magic ingredient supporting Wellcome since last summer's international share offering was not evident from yesterday's figures. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that either Glaxo has been over-sold or Wellcome has further to fall.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (4): European Union horizons draw closer - Fresh calls for a 'market-driven revolution' in voice telephony services / The sceptics over European liberalisation are now in fast retreat When, after much anguish, the European Union's telecommunications ministers finally agreed in June 1993 to liberalise the EU's voice telephony market, full competition in Europe's telecommunications services market still seemed a distant prospect. The date agreed by the ministers for the liberalisation of basic voice services - January 1 1998 - was still nearly five years away. Five of the EU's 12 member-states gained exemptions allowing them to keep out competition for longer still - Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland until 2003, and Luxembourg until 2000. And, with regulatory structures and inter-connection regimes non-existent across most of the EU, many believed that a few years could be added to those dates before effective competition would be a reality. The sceptics and far-distance gazers are now in fast retreat. Although little has formally changed since the ministerial agreement, it appears increasingly likely that liberalisation will come sooner rather than later and that effective competition will follow hard on its heels. It is not just the passage of time which has changed perceptions. Other forces are serving to accelerate the pace of liberalisation and intensify the commitment of EU member governments to the cause of early competition in telecoms services. The three strongest forces are the European Commission, the impact of existing liberalisation on unliberalised sectors, and the rise of international alliances between telecoms operators. The three are complementary and mutually reinforcing. The commission has been forcefully promoting telecoms liberalisation - in public and by stealth. Trans-European networks featured prominently in the Maastricht Treaty. And from Jacques Delors downwards, the commission has spent the last few years warning of the damage to European competitiveness if Europe fails to construct telecoms 'superhighways' to match those being developed in the US and Japan. Initially, such rhetoric was often accompanied by suggestions that significant public investment - either by the EU or member-states - should be devoted to upgrading telecoms networks. The commission soon saw that such a statist approach was neither necessary nor desirable. It was unnecessary because the telecoms industry is itself awash with funds to devote to commercial projects; and undesirable because leading analysts and some operators - notably the main US telecoms operators and British Telecommunications, the privatised UK operator - convinced policy-makers that a far better way of boosting the development and take-up of new services was to abolish monopolies and allow competition to exert strong downward pressure on prices. A mature statement of this new approach is encapsulated in the 'global information society' report of the EU-wide industry group chaired by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner. Published in May, and broadly endorsed by EU heads of government shortly afterwards, the Bangemann report put superhighways at the heart of Europe's future competitiveness. It called for a 'market-driven revolution' to make them a reality; and to precipitate the revolution it recommended that EU governments 'accelerate the ongoing process of telecoms liberalisation'. The Bangemann report highlighted telecoms infrastructure, not just services, as ripe for liberalisation, citing such liberalisation as part of the 'urgent action' needed to reduce high cross-border tariffs. With a head of steam behind the Bangemann report, the commission has lost no time in pressing forward. In July it published an 'action plan'. The title of the first chapter - 'Towards a Competitive Environment' - sums up the action envisaged. The rest of the paper listed the regulatory and legal obstacles remaining to be overcome, and a framework for addressing them. The next key stage is a Green Paper on infrastructure competition, expected next month, which appears likely to recommend liberalisation on a rolling basis so that competing systems can be opened at the same time as the services to be carried over them are opened to competition. In practice, this means infrastructure competition across most of the sector by 1998, with investments targeted at private corporate networks permissible at once. The commission is also drafting a directive on inter-connection, likely to be published early next year, and is putting its weight behind other practical initiatives such as a 'one-stop shop' for companies seeking operating licences across the EU. It will not be a smooth transition. Just as they opposed services liberalisation, several EU governments - notably Spain's - are fighting hard to delay infrastructure liberalisation. Their only plausible argument is that decisions on infrastructure should not be taken before the precise terms of services competition are agreed. But even that line has infuriated Mr Karel Van Miert, EU commissioner responsible for competition policy, who has hinted darkly about using 'special powers' to promote infrastructure competition if agreement is not reached at the telecoms ministers' council in November. By stealth, the Commission has been doing its best to broaden the scope of competition allowed within existing rules. For instance, it has given strong encouragement to the EVUA, a grouping of more than 30 multinationals which is contracting jointly for a Europe-wide 'private' network to secure cheaper prices and enhanced functionality. Some operators question whether the EVUA network counts as 'private', but the Commission has voiced no doubts. Most of the leading telecoms European operators bid for the contract, and the EVUA estimates that the trial contracts awarded so far could offer savings of up to 40 per cent on existing pan-European tariffs. The EU's operators are fast waking up to the implications. Although most of them remain state-owned monopolies, they realise that they must either adapt to competition or lose significant segments of their business within a short period. Their experience in the cellular mobile field, where competeting providers are now entrenched over much of the EU, has been a salutary warning to them. The prospect of privatisation, now sweeping across the continent, is underlining it. As the more reflective of the PTT chiefs realise, privatisation is a body blow to monopoly. The government immediately switches from being owner to being regulator, radically changing its relationship with the PTT; and since private monopolies are harder to defend than public monopolies, it also increases the pressure for rapid liberalisation in the run-up to any sell-off, or in the wake of it. In the Netherlands, the privatisation of KPN, the state operator, earlier this year appears set to be followed by the licensing of a competitor long before the EU's 1998 deadline. Furthermore, 'private' contracts such as that placed by the EVUA, and the rise of big transatlantic alliances between telecoms operators, have alerted most of Europe's PTT's to the dangers of isolation. The larger PTTs have all signed up to one or other of the three emerging alliances, while the smaller PTTs are scrambling to get on board. The alliances do not in themselves necessitate domestic liberalisation; but since their raison d'etre is to compete in other markets, they increase the pressure on operators and their governments to concede open access at home. Telefonica, the Spanish semi-state operator, is an object lesson in this regard. Barely a year ago the company was fighting tooth and nail against any EU deadline obliging it to face competition in the Spanish public voice market. Then Banco Santander, one of the largest Spanish banks, signed a deal with British Telecom to develop a national private network selling private and value-added services to the Spanish corporate sector. And Telefonica suddenly realised it was the largest of the EU's operators to be outside one of the emerging international alliances. Telefonica is now a full member of Unisource, the alliance of the Dutch, Swiss and Swedish operators, which has also linked up with AT&amp;T of the US. And the Spanish government, with Telefonica's acquiescence, has agreed to forego its five-year extension to the 1998 competition deadline. It is not the last such volte face we are likely to see before 1998. Battle for liberalisation in the US: see page six</p>

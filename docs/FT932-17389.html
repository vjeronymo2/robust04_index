He welcomed progress in reforming the common agricultural policy, but warned that unless further action was taken there was a danger that spending would exceed the guideline set for next year. Mr Gummer insisted: 'any increase in the guideline remains out of the question'. He described the price fixing proposals so far made by the European Commission as 'disappointing', identifying wine, beef, fruit and vegetables, olive oil and rice among the products which should be subject to reduced expenditure. Mr Gummer stressed: 'We need to bring spending under control otherwise decisions made later will be much tougher and difficult'. Underlining the improvements that had already taken place in farmers' incomes, Mr Gummer said changes to the CAP had reduced the uncertainty which had hung over agriculture so that the prospects for Britain's farmers were brighter than they had been for a number of years. Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, branded the CAP a 'disaster', saying it was not reforms which gave farmers more hope but the rise in support prices to them after the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to secure adequate reform of the common agricultural policy to prevent exorbitant costs to taxpayers was defeated by 96 votes (209-113).</p>

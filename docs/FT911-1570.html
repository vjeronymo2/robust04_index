			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: TV and parallels with poll tax Sir, As Mr Bescoby (letters, April 27) rightly points out, anyone with a television is compelled to help pay for the BBC. He might have added that everyone who buys goods advertised on TV - even if they do not have a set - is compelled to help pay for ITV and Channel 4 (although the economic analysis is more complex). Luckily, this is less problematic in practice than in principle. Almost everyone has a television, watches it a lot, and rightly regards the cost as pretty trivial. We could replace the licence fee with subscription. research shows that most of us would subscribe to both BBC channels, but it would cost us a lot more (because of higher collection and other costs) and we would lose BBC Radio.

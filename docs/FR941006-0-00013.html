			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Income Eligibles.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State agency's estimate of WIC income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible persons is based on data from the 1990 Decennial Census,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which reflects population characteristics as of 1989. Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Census data provides the most current State-by-State information,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department recognizes that data which describe a population at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fixed point in the past may not accurately reflect recent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future socioeconomic and demographic trends. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is currently exploring other potential data sources for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the state-level income eligibles estimates. The proposed rule did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not establish or define the exact source of the eligibles database  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to allow for the use of the most timely and reliable data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as it becomes available. This was supported by the majority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters who commented on the eligibles data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, fair share funding allocations would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on estimates of the State agency's eligible population at or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below 185 percent of poverty rather than estimates of the fully- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible population (persons income eligible and at nutritional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk). Unlike the national estimate of eligibles, State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations are not adjusted for an estimate of fully eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons as nutritional risk standards vary by State agency and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of a ``national'' estimate would serve no useful purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for funding allocation purposes. The State level income-eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates were used to determine each State's proportion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national total of WIC income-eligibles. Funding allocations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> proportion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _not on the absolute number of estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income eligibles in each State. Each State agency's fair share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation thus depends on both its proportion of income eligibles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the total amount of funds available nationally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters stated that they concur with the proposed ``fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share'' concept, but that more timely updates of eligibles data are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical. Commenters consistently stated that the current data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriously under counts the number of WIC eligibles and they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strongly encourage FNS to continue working on obtaining new and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better estimates. However, two commenters stated that FNS should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw the current proposal until better data is obtained. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter maintained that Medicaid participants should be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the estimates. One commenter proposed an alternative approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to fair share using a ``full funding'' concept. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after much consideration of this particular alternative, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that it would impede under fair share State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies progress in moving towards full funding. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will retain the fair share principle as proposed, using the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available indicators to determine each State agency's population of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income eligibles. At the same time, the Department continues its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to develop more timely and accurate estimates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibles to be used in the WIC food funding formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Health Indicators. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the current formula, the calculation of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's eligible WIC population, used to compute its fair share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation, includes an adjustment for certain health indicators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (infant mortality and low birth weight rates) in the food funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population targeted by the health indicators is now largely served.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, as service to the highest risk participants has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased, the overall impact of the health indicators on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of food funds received by States has become negligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the inclusion of the health indicators unduly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicates and reduces understanding of the food funding formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department proposed to eliminate the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health indicator adjustments. All commenters who commented on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision were supportive of removing the health indicators from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the formula. Therefore, this final rule retains the provision as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustments for Higher Cost Areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current growth component also makes an adjustment for the higher food costs of four specific State agencies located outside of the continental United States (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian State agencies located within their borders). These State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies currently are Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Islands. The Department proposed to retain this adjustment, but to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow more flexibility than the current regulation. The majority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of commenters supported the proposed provision. However, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters misinterpreted this provision to mean that State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies or portions of State agencies (urban areas, rural areas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian Tribal organizations) within the continental United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., within the 48 contiguous States and the District of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia) that can document higher food costs should receive an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment. Other commenters specifically stated that Puerto Rico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be considered as an outlying State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

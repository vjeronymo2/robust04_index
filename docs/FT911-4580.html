			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour publishes plan for rates - Poll Tax LABOUR maintained its pressure on the government over the poll tax yesterday by publishing its bill to abolish the tax and replace it with a return to the rates next year. The cabinet is due to confirm today the decision to replace the poll tax with a property-based tax with discounts for single-person households, but the new tax is unlikely to come into effect until 1993-94 at the earliest. A statement on the consultation document is expected early next week. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, told a local election campaign press conference that unless the government accepted Labour's bill there would be perhaps three years in which local councils would face high administration costs and rising non-payment, 'three years of completely un-necessary pain and anguish'. Mr David Blunkett, the opposition local government spokesman, said that even before the government's announcement it was clear the new tax would not be fair as it would give an automatic discount to a high-earner living alone, compared with a pensioner couple who, he claimed, would have to pay the full amount. The Liberal Democrats said yesterday their approach of targeting areas where they were well-placed would increase the councils where their party was in control or had significant influ-ence, whatever the overall number of seats held nation-ally. Mr Archy Kirkwood, chairman of the Liberal Democrat local election campaign, admitted that the party was under more pressure 'in areas where we are less established', but insisted that the areas where the party had a strong base 'will produce positive results'. The party is fielding candidates in about one-third of the 12,000-plus seats up for election - 1,000 fewer than in 1987.</p>

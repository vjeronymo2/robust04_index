			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Tories drop schools pledge THE government has gone back on a commitment in its general election manifesto to give popular state schools in England resources to expand - provoking protests from church schools wanting to increase their intake. In February Mr Kenneth Clarke, then education secretary, issued a consultation paper on proposals to give extra funds to popular schools, with about Pounds 20m allocated to the initiative for next year. The Conservative manifesto included the commitment: 'Popular schools which are over-subscribed will be given the resources to expand.' It emerged yesterday, however, that no funds will be made available to popular schools in local authorities with surplus places. Since there are 1.5m surplus places across England, and it will take several years to remove most of them, in effect the government is reneging on its commitment. The decision will anger many on the Conservative right who believe that market forces - not reorganisations from above - should play a larger role in determining school provision. The Department of Education said yesterday that removing surplus places was the government's 'main priority', and that Mr John Patten, the new education secretary, gave a higher priority to that than to allowing existing schools to expand. At present the closure of 'surplus' schools is often a long and controversial process, but the department said that legislation to be introduced next year would 'accelerate' it by allowing the government to introduce its own closure proposals. It added: 'Popular schools will benefit, since they will gain the extra pupils and resources currently going to the under-subscribed schools.' Mr David Lankshear, schools officer for the Church of England Board of Education, said schools would be 'angry' at the news. The Catholic Education Council said it was 'disappointed'. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the move was typical of the government's chopping and changing in education. 'Ministers have left some schools high and dry after foolishly promising them extra cash,' she said. 'I shed no tears at the cutting of the Popular Schools Initiative, but fear it is a sign of serious cuts to come with a secretary of state who will be unable to fight his corner against the Treasury.'</p>

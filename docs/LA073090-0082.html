			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;  </P> <P> FAMILY OF 3 CAN'T COME HOME AGAIN;  </P> <P> A SINGLE MOTHER WHO LEFT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH HER SONS TO EARN A MASTER'S  DEGREE TRIED TO RETURN LATER AND FOUND THE COST OF LIVING HAD CLOSED THE DOOR  ON HER FAMILY.  </P> <P> Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine we would leave Southern California  again and return to Utah State University in Logan, Utah, where I had graduated  in 1971. Going backward felt uncomfortable. But I wanted to earn a master's  degree in communications and knew, as a single parent paying $630-a-month rent,  it would have been impossible to do at home.  </P> <P> So I accepted a graduate teaching assistantship at USU. The job paid $400 a  month plus tuition and I was told we could find a furnished two-bedroom  apartment for about $275. Student loans would also help. The boys, then 9 and  12, helped move all our belongings into storage and we headed out of Orange  County east on the Riverside Freeway toward the Intermountain West -- where the  living was cheaper and easier.  </P> <P> The three of us looked forward to our new adventure. We were a little  battle-weary of the chaotic Southern California lifestyle: the bumper-to-bumper  traffic, the smog, the crowds. But like many native Californians it was our  home, and we knew we would be back in a few years.  </P> <P> Utah State University lies in beautiful Cache Valley surrounded on three sides  by the majestic Wasatch mountains.  </P> <P> For two years we enjoyed the simplicity and the beauty of this lovely  university town. School became my whole life. The boys were content in their  new, safe environment.  </P> <P> When I finally graduated, I felt a sense of pride in my accomplishment, and the  boys were proud of me too. We were ready to return home, find a new place to  live in Orange County and reap the financial rewards commensurate with my  degree.  </P> <P> To my complete and naive surprise, I found it wouldn't be quite that simple.  </P> <P> First of all, professional communications jobs in Orange County are highly  competitive. I applied for a public relations position in Newport Beach that  pulled in 300 applications. Though I made the top 16 who were given interviews,  I did not make the final cut.  </P> <P> I was offered a full-time reporter's job on a weekly newspaper for $9,600 a  year and a technical writing job at a computer company for $16,000 a year.  </P> <P> How could anyone survive in Orange County on salaries like those, unless they  were still living at home with parents? Housing costs had gone sky high in the  two years we had been away.  </P> <P> Without realizing it, I had let the door to Southern California quietly close  behind us.  </P> <P> We've been gone five years now and I still don't see any way in the near future  of getting back. Let's face it, even if I were to find an opening in my field,  the salary would probably not cover the high cost of living.  </P> <P> In Utah, we've been able to maintain a fairly decent lifestyle. As director of  public relations at Logan Regional Hospital, my career is blossoming.  Financially we are getting back on our feet.  </P> <P> But not without regrets. No matter how hard we try, Utah doesn't feel like  home. Perhaps if I knew then what I know now about the difficulties of  returning, we might never have left Southern California. I don't know. But I do  know that no matter what the developers do to it, or how crowded, frenzied or  expensive it becomes, the energy, the diversity that makes California special,  also makes it home.  </P></p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Forte disappoints with Pounds 37m halfway FORTE, the hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits at the bottom end of expectations and said conditions remained depressed in both the UK and continental Europe. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 37m for the six months to July 31 compared with a restated Pounds 19m. But most analysts had been looking for recovery in its hotels business to show through more strongly. Forte also disappointed some in the City who had been hoping for an announcement on the sale of the Harvester restaurant chain. The share price fell 10p to 227p. Sales were down to Pounds 1.1bn from Pounds 1.36bn. The previous figure, however, included Pounds 416m from the Gardner Merchant contract catering business, sold at the end of 1992. London hotels provided one bright spot, with sales up 9 per cent and profits up 28 per cent. Visitor numbers from mainland Europe fell, but Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said there had been a 20 per cent increase in US visitors. Provincial UK hotels raised profits on static sales as a result of cost savings. Continental European hotels deteriorated, however, as recession took hold. In the US, the Travelodge chain saw occupancy rise by 2 per cent and room rates by 3 per cent. This was offset by a poor performance from luxury hotels in New York. Worldwide hotel profits were up 8 per cent to Pounds 43m on sales up 7 per cent to Pounds 456m. The Relais autoroute restaurant chain in France, acquired last December, was another strong performer. Forte said sales had increased 6 per cent, despite the impact of recession. Mr Forte said the group had improved Relais' performance by adding sales points during peak summer periods. In the UK, higher profits from the Welcome Break, Happy Eater and Little Chef roadside chains came despite a 4 per cent fall in total UK motor traffic in the first quarter of 1993 and a 3 per cent fall in the second quarter. This was offset by the poor performance of city centre restaurants. With net debt at Pounds 1.3bn, Forte's gearing rose to 50 per cent compared with 44 per cent a year ago. Borrowings have been restructured, however, so that 48 per cent is now repayable within five years, compared with 83 per cent last January. The interim dividend was maintained at 2.75p, just covered by earnings per share of 2.8p, compared with 1p. Lex, Page 20</p>

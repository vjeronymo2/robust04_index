			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / People: Bodies politic The Royal National Institute for Deaf People, one of Britain's leading welfare charities, yesterday gained its first deaf chief executive. Doug Alker, 54, the RNID's research and development director, was appointed following a powerful campaign mounted within the charity for the top post to go to someone suffering from deafness. The new chief executive is profoundly deaf - British sign language is his first language. Alker went to the RNID in 1987 following a career in industry. He was for nearly 20 years an experimental officer at ICI, and before that an analytical chemist with Pilkington. Other activities have included being a semi-professional football manager. There are 7.5m deaf, deaf-blind and hard of hearing people in the UK, and Alker says his vision for the millennium is 'a country where deaf people are no longer treated as second class citizens, have full access and are able to participate fully in society'. The RNID chief executive post became vacant with the appointment of Stuart Etherington to be director of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations. Alker and Etherington share the distinction, still relatively rare among voluntary sector managers, of holding MBAs.</p>

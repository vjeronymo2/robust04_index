			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Chancellor vows to push through aged care plan CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday threw his political weight behind a plan to create a new arm of the German social welfare system, just as negotiations to curb the rest of social spending get under way. He declared his determination to see a scheme for residential nursing care for the old and handicapped made law by the autumn, in spite of fierce business and union opposition. A campaign to sell the scheme, financed by increased insurance contributions from workers and employers, was launched yesterday by the federal Labour Ministry. The main business lobbies say it makes no sense to introduce a new pillar of the social welfare system in the depths of recession. The campaign is part of an effort by Mr Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union to preserve its caring image for next year's election campaign, in spite of the overwhelming need to cut back on social welfare spending in other fields. It also fits with Mr Kohl's determination not to reduce spending affecting the elderly, when unemployment benefits and child allowances are likely to be reduced under a DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) package of cuts proposed by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, to control the deficit. But in order to gain the support of the Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the ruling coalition, Mr Kohl has agreed that the financial burden on industry should be offset by making the first two days of sick leave unpaid. That has infuriated the unions and the opposition SPD, whose social affairs spokesman, Mr Rudolf Dressler, says any care scheme financed by cancelled sick pay will be rejected by his party outright. The DGB trade union federation yesterday described the plan as 'politically and legally crazy' and warned of a 'long, hot summer' of protests.</p>

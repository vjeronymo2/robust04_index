			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After its victory in the European elections and  spectacular rise in Andalusia, the leadership of the People's  Party [PP] believes that nothing will be the same from now on  and that a period has begun when it will be necessary to take  the PP into account before taking important decisions for the  country.    The satisfaction of the PP's leadership was evident this  evening when analyzing yesterday's results. The PP leadership  applauded Jose Maria Aznar, Abel Matutues, and Javier Arenas.  Estrella Moreno reports:    [Moreno] At the meeting of the executive committee, the PP  chairman said that from now on the government cannot take any  important decision without taking the PP into account. In this  connection Aznar added that Felipe Gonzalez has to respect the  ballot box. Further, the PP leader has asked members of the  executive committee not to sit on their laurels but on the  contrary to analyze what have been their shortcomings to date so  that they can be overcome. This party also says that at the  moment they are not euphoric but just satisfied. [passage  omitted]</p>

According to  government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the chancellor, with applause  from the cabinet members, thanked Federal Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel and his staff for the great commitment they had displayed  in the talks.    According to Kohl, the entry into the European Union of the  new countries will go down as a major event in European history.  The Federal Government has a vital interest in the fact that  the group of member countries is now increased by Austria and  the Scandinavian countries. The close cooperation between the  FRG and the new member states will have a positive effect for  Germany, in particular.</p>

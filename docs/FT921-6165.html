			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BA/KLM It is obviously disappointing that British Airways has not played the orange card. But while it and KLM appear to have been well apart on terms for a merger, the airline alliance could yet have its day. KLM does not have a credible alternative; BA is unlikely to receive a better proposal and can bide its time. Competitive pressures might just bring the two together again a year from now.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: PROCESS FRUIT TO AVOID SPREADING MEDFLIES  </P> <P> Fruit now ripening in Los Angeles area back yards presents a potential hazard.  According to the media information office of the Cooperative Medfly Project,  the most frequent way Medfly infestations spread is when contaminated produce  is shared with friends and relatives outside a quarantined area.  </P> <P> Although a homeowner may not be able to see any evidence, Medfly eggs can still  be present in fruit. In the early stages, the eggs are frequently visible only  by a microscope.  </P> <P> "It's imperative that those living in the quarantine zone process back yard  fruit before it is moved or given away," said project spokesman Larry Cooper.  To make it safe, fruit must be canned, frozen, dried, baked or made into jam or  jelly.  </P> <P> Consumers unable to use all their back yard fruit are urged to wrap the excess  in a sturdy plastic bag, tie it shut and put it out for garbage pick-up. If the  thought of destroying food concerns you, however, one alternative is to turn  the fruit into leather.  </P> <P> Almost any type of fruit may be used, including back yard apricots, peaches,  nectarines, plums and berries. Fruit leathers, also called fruit rolls, make  excellent snacks.  </P> <P> Select ripe or over ripe fruit. Wash and remove the stones or pits (seeds of  berries need not be removed). Peel, if desired.  </P> <P> Cut larger fruit into chunks and process enough in a blender to yield 1 1/4  cups puree (Step 1). Add one tablespoon lemon juice and honey to taste, then  blend again (Step 2).  </P> <P> Pour the mixture onto a 15x10 1/2-inch jellyroll pan lined with parchment paper  or plastic wrap (Step 3). Tilt the tray (Step 4) to distribute the mixture in  an even layer.  </P> <P> Oven Drying  </P> <P> Heat the oven at the lowest setting (140 degrees). Place the tray in the oven,  leaving the door cracked open. The leather will dry in four to five hours.  </P> <P> Dehydrator Drying  </P> <P> Place the tray in a dehydrator. Set the temperature control to 140 degrees. Dry  four to five hours.  </P> <P> Sun Drying  </P> <P> Use this method only when the temperature is above 85 degrees and there is less  than 60% relative humidity. Place the tray in direct sunlight or behind a pane  of glass or Plexiglas to concentrate the heat. The leather should dry in two to  three days. Cover or bring the tray indoors at night if the temperature varies  more than 20 degrees or humidity rises.  </P> <P> When properly dried, leather will be sticky to the touch, but peel easily away  from the parchment (Step 5). To store the leather, place a sheet of plastic  wrap over the top and roll up both (Step 6), jellyroll fashion, into a loose  cylinder. The plastic will prevent the leather from sticking together.  </P></p>

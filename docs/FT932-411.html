			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Master pourer of thick paint - The work of Ian Davenport Those who hold, as so many do, that painting is dead, mean only that for them painting is now all but irrelevant within the context of current avant-garde preoccupation. And for them that is the only context that matters. Neither the actual qualities vested in the work itself, nor the profundity of the personal and general truths that it might propose, are to be summoned up in its justification, but only the degree to which it is currently engage, innovative, idea-led. Ask not: what is it? Ask only: where does it lead, what does it say? There are exceptions, of course, for painters of a certain provenance, who make the right noises, strike the correct attitudes. But how curious it is that so often they turn out to be rather more old-fashioned and backward-looking than their more conventional peers, for all the seriousness and originality of their supposed enquiry. There is no truth like an old truth, and when a way or principle of painting comes round a second time, it comes not full of truth and grace - oh that it had such virtues in the first place - but as mere pastiche and decoration. Ian Davenport is now 27. A product of the Goldsmiths' College, he was taken up on graduation, launched on his international gallery career, nominated for the Turner Prize. And I must say at once, on the evidence of this his second major West End show, that he is a better painter, qua painter, than I had supposed, master of a refined if limited technique. His use of commercial household paints may give his future restorers nightmares, but for the moment what he does with them he does very well. The trouble is that, that said, what comes to mind is Gulley Jimson's remark, when asked by his patron, Lady Beeder, what he thought of her own modest effort, that it is 'rather like farting Annie Laurie through the key-hole - all very clever, but is it worth the trouble?' Davenport, like Jackson Pollock and Morris Louis before him, is a pourer, more Louis than Pollock. But here is nothing of those great, expansive sweeps and rushes of thin, seductive colour that so characterised the effortless 1960s. Davenport is much more methodical than that, his systems and processes clearly laid out, his angles set, his paint thick. Richard Shone, in his catalogue note, tells us how it is done. 'A small scaffold is placed next to the canvas which is positioned at a slight angle to the vertical. The paint is poured from a vessel with an adjustable head to regulate the breadth of each pour. Strict time is kept between the sequence of pours allowing the paint to find its way down and off the canvas . . . Variations in timing establish the overall tempo of each work. Decisions include ground colour, width of run, gauging of overlap, where to begin each pour, choice of colours . . . Broad pours give a firmer, more solid structure . . . slender pours are more fragile . . . and wayward . . .' This is all fairly conventional stuff - the process that declares itself, the image that discovers itself, the therapy that indulges itself. Painting these days, so the rubric has it, has to be about something, and this is painting about painting, about the disciplined accident, contrived intuition, the automatic gesture. This is no mere response to experience, or feeling, or the thing seen, you understand: this is serious study and investigation. And what we have at the end of it is a set of large, uniform canvases on which variegated stripes of thick pigment run from top to bottom, one overlaid upon another, now hidden, now peeping out, now fully on the surface. The colour is arbitrary and uninflected, so this can hardly be painting about colour. And it would be hard to say that it is about the handling of the paint, for there is no handling, the paint all too evidently left to shift for itself. The surface is as dull, or interesting, as commercial paint can make it. It is, as I have said, all very clever. Quite where this leaves Davenport, other than going through the motions, is hard to say. The systematic engagement in the making of art is by now an established and honourable position. I only wish he were less mechanical and worthy in his approach to it, and the work less formulaic and predictable, more open perhaps to the opportunities for development and exploration - delicate, subtle and fleeting as they are - that even now chance puts in his way. Seven British Painters is a summer gallery show from stock that shows the strength of figure-based painting in this country in the generation that has now reached later-middle, indeed in certain cases manifest old age. But age is not the point. Rather it is that at its best, work of this kind has no less claim to be considered engage, advanced, experimental and, if you like, truly avant-garde, than anything of Davenport and his contemporaries. The artists are Bacon, Freud, Andrews, Auerbach, Kossoff, Kitaj and Hockney. Two or three substantial works by each artist are shown, some early, some more recent. There are things to recommend of each of them, but the earlier the more intriguing, and the less familiar the better. A Bacon study for a Pope of 1957, a highly wrought, deathly pale and sleeping nude by Freud of 1950, a Kitaj conversation-piece of 1974 are all remarkable. My own particular favourite in this company is the Michael Andrews of 1962, his first version of 'The Colony Room' in Soho, with the writer, Bruce Bernard, in conversation with Francis Bacon and the formidable proprietress, Muriel Belcher, with Lucian Freud staring fixedly out at us, from the centre of the canvas. Unqualified by any photographic reference, it reminds us just how vigorous a painter of the figure composition, in the good old-fashioned sense, Andrews once was.

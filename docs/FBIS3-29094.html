The meeting was attended by representatives of more than 20  political parties and forces.    The director of the International Affairs Department of the  Communist Party of Syria who is member of the Political Bureau  in his speech said international solidarity should be extended  to Korea which stands with dignity against the United States  which tries to force it to open its military sites.    Just is the stand of Korea that it can never concede its  sovereignty and not open its military sites, he stressed.    He said the United States must come out again to talks with  Korea and, by responding to the demand of Korea that the double  standard be discarded and the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula be solved comprehensively, it should help to secure  stability in this region and realise a peaceful reunification of  Korea.    A solidarity message to the great leader President Kim  Il-song was adopted at the meeting.    The meeting adopted letters to the U.S. president, the U.N.  secretary general and the board of governors of the  International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

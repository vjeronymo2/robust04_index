Verkhivker, professor, and A.S. Pindeyev </F> and V.V. Kapliyenko, engineers, Odessa Polytechnic Institute;  UDC 621.187]    [Abstract] The operating reliability of the high-pressure  heaters of K-1000-60/1500 turbine systems has been demonstrated  to be inadequate inasmuch as the said heaters fail about every  3-4 years. The internal erosion of the heaters' spiral tube  coils, which are made of carbon steel, and the resultant  increased feedwater flow rates are among the main reasons for  the heaters' high failure rates. In view of these facts, the  following ways of improving the high-pressure heaters' operating  reliability were compared in a technical and economic analysis:  bypass part of the feedwater past the high-pressure heaters;  replace the entire heat exchange surface of all high-pressure  heaters every 3-4 years; replace the heat exchange surface of  all high-pressure heaters with one made of stainless steel after  the first four years of the heaters' operation; and install  three parallel groups of three high-pressure heaters in all  newly constructed units. According to the calculations  performed, using a bypass for part of the feedwater past the  high-pressure heaters to reduce the feedwater's flow rate is  nearly 1.36-1.6 times less expensive than replacing the entire  carbon steel heat exchange surface every 4 years. Switching to a  stainless steel heat exchange surface is nearly twice as  expensive as complete replacement of a carbon steel tube surface  after every 4 years of a unit's operation. In the case of units  that are in the process of being constructed, it is economically  feasible to replace six high-pressure heaters with nine  high-pressure heaters with a carbon steel heat exchange surface.

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: HOPE SEEMS INSPIRED IN SEAPORT PLAN  </P> <P> This city has been arched, peach-stuccoed and tiled to death in the quest for  the elusive "regional style." Awkward combinations of these elements are  marching across the county like so many Stepford wives.  </P> <P> The planned expansion of Seaport Village could rise above it.  </P> <P> Designed by San Diego's Hope Architects &amp; Engineers, this new cousin of the  existing Disneyland-style tourist mall will take its cues from the old police  station on Market Street, a large part of which will form the heart of the new  project.  </P> <P> Completed in the late 1930s, the station was one of the last projects from the  offices of Quayle Brothers &amp; Treganza. Some of its ornate Spanish Colonial  details -- especially on two entry arches and a tower -- make it one of the  finer remaining San Diego buildings from the latter end of a romantic period in  local architecture that began in 1915 with the richly detailed buildings in  Balboa Park.  </P> <P> The big question is this: Can we trust the Seaport Village developers, led by  M. B. Taubman and Lee Stein, to come through with the commitment the project  deserves?  </P> <P> Such a commitment will mean dollars, probably tens of thousands, to give the  project the detailing it needs. Otherwise, it will join the ranks of the local  Stepford family, just another drone.  </P> <P> Hope, one of the biggest local firms, isn't an obvious choice for the project.  Its work, spanning 60 years in San Diego, has generally tended in recent years  toward large, often disappointing corporate build  </P> <P> ings. First National Bank, formerly Columbia Centre, at Columbia and B Streets,  is one example. Its greatest single shortcoming is its failure to involve  pedestrians at the street level, a problem that would be even more intolerable  at people-oriented Seaport Village.  </P> <P> But, with the Seaport addition, the firm made a conscious decision to steer  clear of a slick, easy solution.  </P> <P> At Hope's downtown offices recently, project architect Bruce Green brought out  the firm's initial design, an attempt to contrast, rather than work with, the  police station.  </P> <P> "Originally, I thought we needed a glass pavilion or something out front, like  I. M. Pei added to the Louvre," Green said, pointing out just such a bauble.  But, during four years of design work, the approach shifted to one of  harmonizing with the police buildings.  </P> <P> The project looks inviting. Arched police station entries to be preserved on  Market and Pacific Highway will send a romantic call to pedestrians. A new  entry on Kettner Boulevard near Market (soon to become the realigned Harbor  Drive) appears to mirror the existing architecture in scale and form, but Green  said the detailing has not yet been selected.  </P> <P> You get the feeling that Green, who has historic-preservation background, would  love to see authentic plaster-cast details applied. But such quality is rare in  1988.  </P> <P> As for the inside of the project, it will emphasize shops and restaurants  grouped around a large L-shaped courtyard the developers call their "Night  Court." For one cover charge, patrons can do justice to a variety of  restaurants and night spots, including a "jazz and blues club."  </P> <P> Like the exterior decoration, the design details of the interior shop facades  are still up for grabs. A soon-to-be-hired consultant will work with Hope on  guidelines here. Inappropriate materials such as large commercial aluminum  windows should be written out of the project.  </P> <P> Compliments go to the developers for including people-oriented elements in  their project, such as a 300-seat open-air amphitheater, a new water's-edge  Ferris wheel and the wonderful 1890 Looff carrousel, to be moved to a central  location next to a new, man-made pond.  </P> <P> What's happening along the waterfront has as much to do with the spaces between  buildings as with the buildings themselves.  </P> <P> The realignment of Harbor Drive is just part of waterfront plans that also  include the potentially stunning "linear park," now being created by landscape  designers Peter Walker and Martha Schwartz, with local architects Austin Hansen  Fehlman Group.  </P> <P> In fact, this long, narrow strip of landscaping and art, which will tie  pedestrian, auto and trolley circulation neatly together, will extend down the  new Harbor Drive nearly to the edge of the Seaport addition.  </P> <P> Green said thick landscaping placed to camouflage the new parking garage and an  extra-wide pedestrian strip at this corner will help relate Seaport Village to  the linear park.  </P> <P> Water figures prominently in the expansion. Taubman, founder and chairman of  Seaport Village, has called the theme "water, water everywhere," including  fountains and the new central pond by the carrousel.  </P> <P> As for tying the project to the existing Seaport Village, the older complex  doesn't have a thing to do with this '80s Spanish Colonial revisited, and it's  a bit too theme-park-oriented anyhow. So scale, not style, will link the new  Seaport to the old. The back of the addition will include smaller-massed  buildings that open onto the pedestrian space behind it.  </P> <P> Several fine old palms ring the police station, both singles and impressive  clusters. Landscape architects ONA Inc. have recommended keeping them, which  makes both historic and economic sense. According to Green, replacement  groupings of six or so mature trees could cost $50,000.  </P> <P> There are several good signs here. With this project, Hope has a chance to set  an example for the other giant San Diego architectural firms. If the architects  are sticklers for detail, and the developers don't balk at spending for  quality, the project's completion sometime in 1992 could prove that it is  possible for corporate-size architecture machines to turn out sensitive,  human-scale projects.  </P></p>

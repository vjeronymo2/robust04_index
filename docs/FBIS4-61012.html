			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik once again  stressed his firm commitment not to make concessions to Russia  in the issue of the retired military and criticized the  country's attempts to apply provisions in Russian-Latvian  agreement also to its draft agreement with Estonia.    "We consider unconstructive the attempts by the Russian part  to apply provisions in Latvian-Russian agreements to  Estonian-Russian draft agreements," Luik said on commenting  Latvian-Russian agreements signed in Moscow on Saturday [30  April].    Such attempts make it impossible to make any progress at  negotiations, because Estonia and Russia must find their own  solutions corresponding to specific relations between the two  countries, Luik said.    Luik considered positive the agreement on Russian troop  pullout from Latvia while stressing the importance of troop  withdrawal timetable presented by Russia.    "Russia has a unique possibility," Luik said while adding  that troop pullout from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August deadline  would eliminate a major issue of dispute between Russia and the  Western countries opening the doors to the country's accession  to the Council of Europe.    On commenting other agreements signed between the two  countries, Luik said "Estonia does not accept binding troop  pullout to any additional conditions."    "A protocol later added to the agreement on retired military  does not give the Latvian Government the right to control  issuing residence permits to the retired military," Luik said.  "...Estonia is not going to give up that right," he added.    It was very important that Boris Yeltsin denounced crimes  committed in Latvia by the Stalinist regime, Luik said while  adding that Estonian people could appreciate a similar gesture  towards Estonia.</p>

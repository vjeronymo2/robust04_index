			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A diplomatic question Being a foreigner on a diplomatic assignment in the UK I do not pay income tax here. I am considering buying a flat in England. If I decide to let the flat after I leave the UK, will I have to pay income tax on the rental payments I receive? Will I be entitled to the personal allowance of Pounds 3,445? I am living with an English lady who has her own job. Will she be able to have any claims in relation to the flat? Would the situation change if we got married in the UK? Yes the rental income will be taxable (after you cease to be entitled to diplomatic immunity). Whether you will be entitled to a personal allowance depends on your nationality and which country you will be living in; it is a pity that you did not tell us more about yourself. If the rent is paid to you the tenant will have to deduct 25 per cent tax; you will then have to claim repayment of any excess tax, or pay any additional tax, as the case may be. If the rent is collected by an agent (professional or private), the tenant will be able to pay the rent in full; the agent will be assessed to tax on your behalf, paying an estimated tax bill at the beginning of January each year, with an adjustment after the end of each tax year (April 5). Write to the Inland Revenue public inquiry room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, and ask for pamphlets IR20 (Residents and nonresidents: liability to tax in the UK) and IR87 (Rooms to let: income from letting property). Talk to your solicitor about your partner's potential claim. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa ignores interest rate fears Johannesburg registered strong gains in steady trade as it reacted to gold price strength and firmer world equity markets. The overall index added 39 at 5,897, industrials were 33 better at 6,650 and golds rose 39 to 2,284, up 1.7 per cent. Dealers said that sharply weaker local bonds had very little effect on equities, in spite of earlier fears that negative sentiment could spill over into shares. The new listing, Housewares, rallied to a 300 cent high before settling back to close 10 cents higher at 290 cents. It was issued at 200 cents on Monday. Among gold shares, Vaal Reefs added R5 at R419 and Kloof rose R1.50 to R67.50.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A ROUTINE WORKDAY FOR EDBERG  </P> <P> Saturday was merely another day at the office for Stefan Edberg.  </P> <P> "When I woke up this morning, I said to myself, 'It's back to work again,' "  Edberg said after beating Andres Gomez, 7-5, 6-3, to advance to the final of  the $1.3-million ATP championship at Mason, Ohio.  </P> <P> Edberg passed Ivan Lendl and moved into the top spot on the ATP computer with a  victory over Michael Chang Friday in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> In today's final, Edberg, a 24-year-old Swede, will meet Brad Gilbert in a  rematch of last year's ATP final won by Gilbert, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).  </P> <P> Gilbert beat Scott Davis, 6-3, 6-4, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Gomez, ranked fifth in the world and seeded third, suffered a service break  when he hit a forehand long at 5-5 and 30-40 in the first set. Edberg held  serve to win the set.  </P> <P> Edberg told himself to be patient.  </P> <P> "What I was waiting for was for him to make one or two mistakes," Edberg said.  "I was trying to get in whenever I had a chance."  </P> <P> At 3-3 in the second set, Edberg broke again when Gomez netted a drop shot.  Edberg held serve before breaking Gomez again to clinch the match.  </P> <P> "I think now he's probably mentally tougher than he was before," Gomez said.  "He knew coming in here that if he had a good tournament he could overtake Ivan  for No. 1. He's going to have a mental edge heading into the (U.S.) Open if it  remains the same."  </P> <P> Said Edberg: "It doesn't feel a whole lot different. But it's in your mind, you  think about it," Edberg said. "It sort of gives you a little bit of confidence.  You think about it when you're out there on the court and it helps you."  </P> <P> Top-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia survived a three-set battle at the  net to beat third-seeded Anne Smith, 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5, and advance to the  final of a $150,000 women's hardcourt tournament at Albuquerque, N.M.  </P> <P> Novotna will play second-seeded Laura Gildemeister of Peru. Gildemeister beat  Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Gildemeister beat Novotna earlier this year in Florida.  </P></p>

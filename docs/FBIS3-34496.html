The leader president has received a cable of congratulations  from Baha'-al-Din Ahmad, speaker of the Legislative Council of  the Kurdistan Autonomous Region. The cable reads as follows:  On the 31st anniversary of the glorious 8 February revolution,  I would like to extend, in my name and on behalf of the  Legislative Council members and all noble Kurds, my heartfelt  congratulations to Your Excellency the president. I beseech  Almighty God to grant you continued good health, and to help our  steadfast people, under your wise leadership, achieve complete  victory over the evil aggressors, consummate the march of  reconstruction and jihad, and break the unfair embargo imposed  on great Iraq.    Leader president: The will of our people, be they Arabs,  Kurds, or other minorities, will remain strong and unbeatable,  regardless of the savagery of the aggression and its evil  chapters. Our Kurdish people, whose dreams have come true and  whose rights have been restored under your wise and historic  leadership, are opposed to the imperialist-Zionist-reactionary  presence on Kurdish territory. They would like to underscore  their unwavering faith in inevitable victory over the hateful  enemies, who are now gathered in a treacherous and atheistic  alliance to harm great Iraq and starve their militant people.    For his part, Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim al-Barazanji, chairman of  the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous region, has  sent a similar cable to the leader president, saying: On the  occasion of our Iraqi people's celebrations marking the blessed  8 February revolution, allow me, leader president, to extend to  you, in my name and on behalf of the Executive Council members  and all sincere Kurds, my heartfelt congratulations. We pledge  to Your Excellency to remain loyal soldiers under your wise  leadership to defeat the 30-state aggression, consummate the  reconstruction and jihad drive, and break the unfair embargo  imposed on Iraq.    Leader President: Our people, under your courageous  leadership, are bound to win the war. They will humiliate all  enemies and cause them to suffer certain defeat and  disappointment. On the anniversary of the glorious 8 February  revolution, our people will derive strength and determination  from your strength and resolve to defeat the evildoers and  achieve victory. They will forge ahead with all confidence and  resolve behind your historic leadership to build new Iraq and  uphold the lofty banner of God is great.    Mujahid President: May you live long as a historic leader  for Iraq, the home of Arabs, Kurds, and minorities, and as a  shining symbol of our hopes, aspirations, and reconstruction  drive.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Soundtracs shares up as new products show Shares in Soundtracs rose 7p to 80p yesterday after the USM-traded professional electronic audio equipment and loudspeaker group announced a 76 per cent jump in annual pre-tax profits as it benefited from the introduction of new products. Mr Todd Wells, chairman, said the increase - from Pounds 350,385 to Pounds 615,587 - was achieved despite the market remaining 'highly competitive, fragmented and difficult in such key territories as Japan and central Europe'. Research and development expenditure, written off as it incurs, now accounts for some 6.7 per cent of revenue. Three new mixing consoles are scheduled for the current year. Turnover for the 12 months to November 6 improved 34 per cent to Pounds 5.51m (Pounds 4.11m). Earnings per share emerged at 4.09p (2.45p) and a proposed fiinal dividend of 1.48p brings the total for the year to 2.4p (2.2p).</p>

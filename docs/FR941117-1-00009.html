Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Medicaid is the Federally assisted State program authorized under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) to provide funding for medical care provided to certain needy aged, blind and disabled persons, families with dependent children, and low-income pregnant women and children. Each State determines the scope of its program, within limitations and guidelines established by the law and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR chapter IV, subchapter C. Each State submits a State plan that, when approved by HCFA, provides the basis for granting Federal funds to cover part of the expenditures incurred by the State for medical assistance and the administration of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(a) of the Act specifies the eligibility requirements that individuals must meet in order to receive Medicaid. Other sections of the Act describe the eligibility groups in detail and specify limitations on what may be paid for as ``medical assistance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory and Regulatory History_Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services Benefit for Individuals Under Age 21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92&hyph;603) amended the Medicaid statute to, among other things, allow States the option of covering inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21. In this preamble, we will refer to inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21 as the ``psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit.'' Originally the statute required that the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit be provided by psychiatric hospitals that were accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. This organization is now called the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. We will refer to this organization as the ``Joint Commission.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan informed China, South  Korea and other Asian nations that Shigeto Nagano retracted his  earlier statements on Japan's wartime actions and that he has  resigned as justice minister, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko  Saito said Monday [9 May].    Saito told a press conference that the Japanese Government  told the countries on Saturday about the contents of a news  conference by Nagano in which he retracted earlier remarks that  the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication.    Japan also informed the countries of the contents of a  separate press conference in Brussels by Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata in which the premier said he regretted Nagano's statements,  he said.    Nagano resigned on Saturday.    The Japanese Government is currently considering whether  further diplomatic measures are necessary to cope with criticism  by Asian nations, Saito said.    Saito said that Nagano's remarks were regrettable because it  may result, even temporarily, in misunderstandings by other  nations of Japan's position on its wartime activities.    Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered a frank  apology for Japan's wartime aggression last August when he  assumed the premiership.    Nagano said last week that the Nanjing incident was a  fabrication and that he still thinks it wrong to define the war  as a war of aggression. His remarks touched off a wave of  protest from Asian nations.</p>

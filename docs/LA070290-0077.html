			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NO CHICKEN FEED: KENTUCKY FRIED IS BEHIND IN THE PECKING  ORDER  </P> <P> Return of the Colonel. Or: It's hard to keep a good chicken down.  </P> <P> When last we left Kentucky Fried Chicken, the poultry-peddling outlet on Santa  Fe Drive in Encinitas was voluntarily closing its doors.  </P> <P> A decision had been made by corporate headquarters in Louisville, Ky., to  surrender the venerable site so nearby Scripps Memorial Hospital could expand.  </P> <P> The hospital vetoed my suggestion that it show its gratitude by dedicating a  Kentucky Fried Chicken Wing.  </P> <P> For 17 years the Kentucky Fried on Santa Fe Drive had beckoned the hungry and  tired from Interstate 5 with its big bucket in the sky. Then it was gone, and  Encinitas was the less.  </P> <P> The buzzword for Encinitas is "affluent." But can a town without Kentucky Fried  Chicken truly be said to have everything?  </P> <P> Fifty-eight countries (7,945 outlets) have Kentucky Fried, including countries  where a picture of the current dictator hangs next to that of Colonel Sanders.  But not Encinitas.  </P> <P> Not to worry.  </P> <P> Tonight, an Encinitas planning advisory board will consider a Kentucky Fried  request to take over the former Long John Silver fish restaurant on El Camino  Real, a juicy spot between Carl's Jr. and The Wherehouse.  </P> <P> Kentucky Fried hopes to open by the end of August, nearly a year to the day  since the last buttermilk biscuit was served on Santa Fe Drive.  </P> <P> "We've been trying desperately to find a suitable replacement," said Kentucky  Fried construction engineer Jack Rose. "We've got to get back in there to  protect our market."  </P> <P> One spur: the opening last year of an El Pollo Loco on El Camino Real.  </P> <P> To make its return, Kentucky Fried will have to make compromises.  </P> <P> The exterior will have to match the surrounding red-tile fake-Spanish motif.  And forget the outdoor bucket on a pole.  </P> <P> A small price to pay for cultural restoration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keeping the Lid On  </P> <P> And another thing (or two).  </P> <P>  * Rumor: San Diego City Manager John Lockwood is on the verge of announcing  his retirement.  </P> <P>  Truth: Soon, maybe, but not quite yet.  </P> <P>  Lockwood, 59, says he won't make any decision until after he accompanies a  Chamber of Commerce trade mission -- at his own expense -- to Eastern Europe in  September.  </P> <P> He adds that he thought of the manager's job as a five-year capper to his city  career when he accepted it nearly four years ago: October, 1986.  </P> <P> One piece of evidence that Lockwood is thinking of life after city government  is that he just bought a Buick Reatta after a dozen years of driving a blah  city-issued vehicle.  </P> <P> The Reatta is sportier (bucket seats) than a city car and doesn't have any  restrictions on how far it can be driven from City Hall.  </P> <P> * A pen-and-ink street scene by French Impressionist Camille Pisarro has failed  to sell at an auction by the San Francisco-Los Angeles auction house  Butterfield &amp; Butterfield.  </P> <P> Appraisal price was $7,000 to $10,000.  </P> <P> The six-inch-square drawing was once shown at the San Diego Museum of Art. At  the time, it was owned by Richard T. Silberman.  </P> <P> Silberman's wife, Supervisor Susan Golding, says Silberman told her that he is  no longer the owner.  </P> <P> Butterfield &amp; Butterfield won't confirm, deny or comment at all about  current ownership: "The owner was very explicit: 'No publicity.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advertising Their Losses  </P> <P> Seen and heard.  </P> <P> * A Del Mar couple is posting flyers offering a $500 reward for their lost cat.  </P> <P> The flyers are the work of a San Jose firm that specializes in lost pets:  Sherlock Bones Inc. Just call 1-800-940-BONES.  </P> <P> * How impoverished are enlisted Marines?  </P> <P> Take that pickup truck in Vista with a Marine Corps decal in the back window.  </P> <P> It also had a bumper sticker: Don't Worry, There's Always Welfare.  </P></p>

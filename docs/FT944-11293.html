			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Company News (this Week): Sharp recovery for insurance sector BT and Cable and Wireless - Other Companies Analysts predict BT second-quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 750m to Pounds 800m, after about Pounds 100m in redundancy charges but before a Pounds 75m repurchase of bonds. That compares with Pounds 743m last year after redundancy charges, giving underlying profits growth at mid-point of about 4.5 per cent. Interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 550m (Dollars 902m) to Pounds 580m are forecast for C&amp;W, which at mid-point is about 11 per cent up on last year's Pounds 509m. Continued strong growth at Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest profit earner, will be offset by slower growth at Mercury, its UK subsidiary, which is fighting rising competition.</p>

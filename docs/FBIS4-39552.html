			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn June 8 TASS -- Commenting on the recent  statement by the commander of the Estonian defence forces,  General Einseln, on the readiness of the troops loyal to him to  use force, if ordered, in the event of Russia's failure to  withdraw its troops by August 31, spokesman for the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vitaliy Churkin said today that his  country judged about Estonia's position by "responsible  statements of responsible officials" and was sure that Estonia,  just as Russia, favoured political solutions to all problems.    Churkin was speaking after a two-day meeting with his  Estonian counterpart Raul Malk, which was held in pursuance of  the accord reached during Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev's recent meeting in Tallinn with Estonian President  Lennart Meri.    Churkin said the problem of the Russian military pensioners  residing in Estonia remained in the centre of negotiations  between Estonia and Russia, and expressed the hope that "a new  page, and probably even a new chapter" will open in  Russian-Estonian relations thanks to this and other forthcoming  contacts.    Churkin said his talks in Tallinn centered around the  withdrawal of Russian troops and the dismantling of Russian  atomic reactors in the training centre for Russian submarine  power plant operators in Paldiski. Churkin expressed confidence  that the sides would reach an agreement which would be  "realistic and rule out any tension in relations between the two  countries".    As concerns the Russian military pensioners residing in the  republic, Churkin expressed the confidence that the agreement on  their fate will "also be realistic and meet the world's highest  standards in the field of human rights".</p>

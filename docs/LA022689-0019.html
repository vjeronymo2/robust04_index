			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: ROSSINI ROCKS  </P> <P> Maverick film maker Robert Altman will go to Italy this fall to shoot his next  project, a biography of 19th-Century Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini, whom  Altman calls "the Mick Jagger of his day."  </P> <P> "He was enormously successful, popular and sexy," Altman told us. "Yet, in his  mid-30s, he decided to stop writing music and travel and experience life."  Altman will focus his English-language film on that period, he said.  </P> <P> Enrico Roseo is producing, and "there's not one penny of American money in it,"  Altman added. Leonard Klady  </P></p>

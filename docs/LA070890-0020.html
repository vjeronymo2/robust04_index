			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISASTER RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES  </P> <P> Throughout my 16 years as a firefighter/paramedic, I have witnessed many  horrible incidents. The recent destructive fires are among those experiences.  </P> <P> I am amazed at the difficulty we have passing laws which ban wood roofs or the  difficulty we have getting compliance from homeowners in clearing flammable  brush from around their homes.  </P> <P> The California State Firemen's Assn. and many other fire service organizations  have pushed for a ban on wood roofs in new construction, pushed to ban the  private use of fireworks, pushed for laws to require the installation of  residential sprinklers in new construction, pushed for laws which protect your  lives and property; how successful do you feel we have been?  </P> <P> I can assure you that the effort will continue at the state and local levels,  yet we need your voice. We are having difficulty getting two legislative bills  passed as we wrote them; AB 2666 by Assemblywoman Bev Hansen and SB 1830 by  Sen. Cecil Green, which would have permitted local governments to pass building  standards more restrictive than state law, have been significantly amended to  our dissatisfaction and to the detriment of local control and fire safety.  </P> <P> You can help by writing to the Senate Housing Committee, Chairman Leroy Greene,  2205 State Capitol, Sacramento 95814, and asking him to see that these bills  are passed to our satisfaction.  </P> <P> DAN COFFMAN  </P> <P> President Pro-Tem  </P> <P> California State Firemen's Assn.  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Off-field activities help Man United to double Manchester United yesterday announced a sharp increase in full year profits as the Premiership champions benefited from increasingly lucrative non-footballing activities. The FA Cup holders saw pre-tax profits more than double to Pounds 10.78m (Pounds 4.2m) as the contribution from gate receipts, its staple income, was overtaken by off-the-field businesses such as merchandising, sponsorship and catering. Those activities helped lift profits before transfer fees from Pounds 8.19m to Pounds 11.45m, on turnover ahead 74 per cent at Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 25.2m) in the year to July 31. Although the figures were flattered by relatively low spending on new players and capacity constraints last year, Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, said the improvement had persuaded the club to draw up plans to expand Old Trafford by more than 22 per cent. The club wants to increase its stadium capacity to about 54,000, enabling it to exploit excess demand for match tickets. While negotiating possible land purchases around the stadium, Mr Edwards also signalled an increasing drive to tap merchandise sales, which almost trebled from Pounds 5m to Pounds 14.2m. 'Most of the growth has come from wholesaling,' he added. 'We've signed an overseas marketing deal in Japan for our products and other countries are lining up.' The balance sheet, meanwhile, was strengthened by a Pounds 2.75m increase in the transfer fee reserve to Pounds 4m, the facility which allows the club to set aside a proportion of profits to cover future player acquisitions and a possible fall in gate receipts should the team falter in league and cup competitions. Earnings per share rose from 24.3p to 61.1p before switching funds to the transfer reserve, and 38.5p (32.5p) after. The final dividend is lifted to 14.5p (13.5p) for a total of 21p (19.5p). Mr Robin Launders, finance director, also announced a 4-for-1 share split to improve the marketability of the shares, which rose 9p to 694p. COMMENT The Reds appear to have scored a hat-trick with on-field goals, retail sales and rampant ticket demand. Increased sponsorship and a possible Pounds 7m windfall from the European Cup makes the prospects look rosey. But the figures are untypical. They have been distorted by smaller crowds in 1993, a year when the club spent Pounds 4m on players. To ensure success in Europe, the club will have to spend more on English players - denting future profits. Payments to such players last year pushed staff costs up to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 7.59m), a figure likely to increase. Profits this year, therefore, could fall to around Pounds 7.5m. On a forward multiple of 16.2, the shares are a must only for long-term investors and diehard fans.</p>

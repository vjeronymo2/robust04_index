			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Found Art Trio: Tom Hartman, Leonard Seagal and Daniel Wheeler are three local  young sculptors who share a gift for making mundane found objects intriguing.  Hartman is the stand-up comedian of the group.  </P> <P> His jokey pieces reduce art and art making to self-parodying tools of the  trade. He constructs a swirling spiral from red plastic screw anchors pounded  into the wall or empty picture frames that are simply four carpenter's levels  neatly interlocked. The craft is deft but the objects too quickly become a  series of smart one-liners.  </P> <P> Seagal puts luggage on wheels and stacks gray rocks in it. There are metal  forms held by cables that take a good-natured approach to the mysterious.  Playfulness enlivens the pieces -- particularly "Pico Pica," a strange  installation of three empty "shells" mounted in front of a stylized painting of  a flaming wall. It would delight any hot-rod aficionado.  </P> <P> Wheeler's sculptures and installation prove the most involving. He uses old  pails, whisk brushes, bent rods and wooden stools in a search for clues to the  teetering experience of being human. The works have a quasi-religious quality.  "Ecce Homo," a tormented and seductive installation, seems to marry a voting  booth to a confessional. The smart, sensitive piece asks troubling questions  about personal vulnerability and social responsibility. (Glenn Dash Gallery,  962 N. La Brea Ave., to March 17.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

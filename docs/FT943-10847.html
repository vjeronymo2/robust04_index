			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Abandoned to the sharks: The bloody fate of a treasury lawyer When the great white sharks of Washington, otherwise known as US senators, scent blood, restraint goes out of the window. Mr Roger Altman, deputy secretary of the treasury, is a meal worth consuming. Ms Jean Hanson, general counsel to the treasury, is just chum bait. On Monday night the Senate banking committee chewed up Ms Hanson and spat her out. Not that the lawyer from Minnesota, via Wall Street and with a husband who was a Republican until recently, did not kick, fight, stick to her guns and tell senator after senator that they did not understand what she had said and why she did what she did. But the real curiosity of a long and bitter night of interrogation was not that she was under constant fire from all the predictable Republican attack voices - the Brooklyn whine of Al D'Amato from New York, the basso profundo of Kit Bond from Missouri, the chainsaw howl of Phil Gramm of Texas and the unctuous tones of Robert Bennett from Utah, one-time exculpator of Watergate. The sad fact was Ms Hanson was also abandoned by Democrats - not just every Democrat but the two women on the committee who might have been expected to have offered her at least a degree of protection and sympathy. Barbara Boxer of California seemed to have clenched only one thing between her perfect white teeth. Regardless of whatever Ms Hanson responded, she found it incredulous that anybody in the administration should ever have been motivated by fear of press leaks: and this in a town where colanders have five-feet-wide holes to accommodate documents. Nor could Senator Boxer understand - or consider even remotely defensible - Ms Hanson's remarkably frank admission that she might have erred when Mr Altman was testifying to the committee on February 24 in not leaping up to advise him that he had not disclosed the full details about contacts between the treasury and White House. It was purely legalistic, Senator Boxer insisted from hour one to hour six, to argue that the record could subsequently be corrected, though in Washington such amplifications are routine. When Ms Hanson tried to respond, Ms Boxer talked over her, which, had she been in the Senate in 1991, she never would have done to Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas supreme court nomination hearings. Nor was Senator Carol Mosely-Braun from Illinois any help either. Her questioning seemed to have only one purpose - not to elicit hard answers but to extract from Ms Hanson an admission that, if she had to do it all over again, she would have done it differently. Prepared testimony and hours of careful, if sometimes laboured, answers were never referred to by the senator. The committee chairman, Mr Don Riegle of Michigan, simply let Ms Hanson have it. But then he knows what it is like to be under the ethics gun, having been reprimanded by Congress for accepting payments from another notorious savings and loan operator. He is retiring this year in any case and thus cannot have felt the impulsion displayed last week by congressman Henry Gonzalez, who gavelled the House counterpart committee into submission every five minutes. Even the stauncher Democrats, John Kerry of Massachussetts and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, fed off her flesh because she had not insisted on correcting Mr Altman's testimony. They sensed, perhaps, that no one in this administration would come to her rescue. With friends like these, there was nothing the Republicans needed to do to harm Ms Hanson, who was never their prime target anyway. Had she broken down and implicated Mr Altman they would have packed up, gone home to dinner and prepared for the morrow. But she only allowed that her 'recollections' of certain meetings differed from those of her immediate superior and a few minutes before midnight even apologised for being 'argumentative'. It was not, by any standards, an edifying experience. But as a window on the way Washington can work it was perversely instructive. If bright lawyers all over America were watching, 99 out of 100 must have concluded that government service was strictly for the birds, especially when this sort of grief comes with an 80 per cent salary cut.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Senior Lieutenant Sergey Kolesnikov and Senior </F> Lieutenant Andrey Rodnov of Russian MVD Internal Troops Press  Center: "ODON Simply an `Excellent Division'"]    [Text] The Separate Operational Division [Otdelnaya  diviziya operativnogo naznacheniya -- ODON] of the Russian MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Internal Troops has celebrated  its 70th anniversary. Russian President Boris Yeltsin  participated in the festivities.    This was the second visit to the combined unit in the past  year by the supreme commander in chief of the Russian Federation  Armed Forces. It is not hard to notice that at critical moments  the country's leadership turns precisely to this division. This  time, too, the president's itinerary had evidently not been  chosen by chance. The country has been overwhelmed by crime  whose scale is frightening people, but at all stages of its  existence the elite combined unit of internal troops has been a  stabilizing factor in Russian reality and a weighty guarantor of  citizens' safety. According to Boris Yeltsin, crime in the  country has reached a dangerous level and is reducing to naught  the results of many transformations, and effective protection  against the criminal onslaught is needed. The country's  leadership sees just this as the main task of the combined unit  and of the internal troops as a whole.    It should be pointed out that the division has already  repeatedly justified its purpose not only in Moscow but also far  outside it. Since 1988 the combined unit's servicemen have been  involved in ensuring the state of emergency regime in various  parts of the former Union and of the present Russia. Sumgait,  Stepanakert, Kubatly, Fergana, Sukhumi -- this is a far from  complete list of the "hot spots" where the soldiers of law and  order have had to operate. Today the North Caucasus, where  territorial disputes between Ossetians and Ingush are  persisting, has become the division's second stationing  location. State awards have been conferred upon almost every  second serviceman for courage displayed in the fulfillment of  peacemaking tasks. Seven people have been awarded the title  Hero of the Russian Federation.    The president was pleased with the professional training of  ODON servicemen. But he pointed out that the question of  enhancing the mobility of special subunits remains acute today.  The crime growth rate has prompted the country's leadership to  resolve the question of increasing the strength of internal  troop operational units by 52,000 men.    Army General Viktor Yerin awarded the ODON the pennant of  the  Russian Federation minister of internal affairs. "An excellent  division!" -- this was how Boris Yeltsin voiced his attitude  toward the combined unit.</p>

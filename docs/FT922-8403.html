			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Council swaps case is settled out of court THE HIGH COURT action in which Hammersmith and Fulham Council in London faced a Pounds 2.94m claim by the US Chemical Bank over two interest rate swap transactions was settled out of court on undisclosed terms yesterday. A deal was agreed after only two days of what was expected to be a seven-week Commercial Court hearing. Opening the case for Chemical Bank last week, Mr Richard Southwell QC had said that the bank's policy was not to deal with rate-capped authorities. It would not have entered into the 1988 swaps deals with Hammersmith if it had known the council was trading for profit and acting as an intermediary for two capped authorities in London - Haringey and Camden. The case was the fifth of six test case actions to be settled out of court. A hearing has been fixed to decide whether new lead actions should be chosen to determine key issues in the swaps litigation between banks and local authorities. Mr Justice Hirst is to hear argument on June 8 as to whether further cases should be selected and, if so, which ones. In July last year, six lead actions were chosen with the aim of deciding key points and enabling the remainder to be resolved without recourse to the courts. Five of these settled and the sixth, between NationsBank, of North Carolina, and Hammersmith and Fulham Council, began last week and is still being heard. Mr Justice Hirst said there were still 196 live actions involving several dozen banks and a much larger number of local authorities.</p>

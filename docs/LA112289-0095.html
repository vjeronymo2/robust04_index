			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> KLA Instruments Trims Work Force: KLA Instruments Corp. said it has  consolidated operations of several divisions resulting in a roughly 7% decrease  in its worldwide work force of 1,100. The Santa Clara-based maker of industrial  image automation systems said the cuts reflect continuing efforts to keep  operations as efficient as possible, "especially in uncertain economic  periods." The firm said it does not expect the consolidations to have a  significant effect on second-quarter financial results.  </P></p>

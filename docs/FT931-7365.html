			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Russia's love affair with west ends in disappointment: Moscow is counting the cost in foreign policy terms of trying to live up to western expectations though not dramatically - from the solidly pro-western stance that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is no longer a matter of loving everyone. Finally, even belatedly, foreign policy is governed by the national interest and nationalist pressures. There is now a clear effort to define the national interest of a state struggling with economic crisis, with a vast land mass straddling Europe and Asia, and with a larger inheritance from the Soviet Union than first thought  -of debt, alliances, and trade links. Both President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, have been concerned to emphasise the 'Eurasian' identity of Russia - a concept borrowed from those who last year opposed what they felt was the uniquely pro-western drift of policy. Mr Yeltsin's most recent state visits have been to China and India and the trade and political agreements he signed there were represented as great successes. However, he took care, especially in India where arms sales have been publicly frowned on in the west, to assert Russia's independence, especially from US tutelage. Ministers are now making more clear the costs of their pro-western stance. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic relations, has told foreign officials that Iraq has informed Russia that if the latter drops its support for sanctions, Baghdad will begin to pay the billions of dollars it owes for arms. For a country as desperate for hard currency as Russia, this is, as Mr Shokhin stressed, not easy to dismiss. Nor is it an offer that a future government of Russia, lacking the convictions of Mr Shokhin's, would dismiss. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia also increasingly shows the strains and limits of Russia's new consensual approach. Mr Kozyrev says that Moscow would want to drop sanctions against the fellow Slav state of Serbia as soon as it became clear that its leadership was genuinely trying to seek a peaceful solution: it also would press for sanctions against Croatia if it continued aggressive action. This runs counter - though not directly so - to the early indications from the Clinton camp that harsher action would be taken against the Serbs. But it has won Mr Kozyrev grudging agreement from Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, the formerly critical chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs. The most acute 'foreign' problems and tensions facing Russia at the moment are those with the fellow former states of the Soviet Union and now of the Commonwealth of Independent States. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, said yesterday in an interview in Izvestia that while Russia had no enemies in the world, it had to strengthen its border security, particularly with the Caucasian states: not surprisingly, since the only state in the world which regularly claims to be at war with Russia is Georgia, which suspects Moscow of aiding the separatists in the north-western province of Abkhazia. Gen Grachev also stated, flatly, that Russian troops would not be taken out of Abkhazia - that is, of Georgia - because 'otherwise we would lose the Black Sea'. This automatic assumption of the continuing need to project military power into other countries to secure what were Soviet, or even Tsarist, borders is common, and more commonly voiced. The quarrel developing once more between Russia and Ukraine over energy supplies, spreading to include the gamut of territorial and military points of conflict between them, is actually a threat to world peace - since both are nuclear powers. Though they have always stepped back from the brink, the underlying tensions are not solved and their situations are worsening. This closing in on itself, a concentration on problems in the 'near abroad', comes at a time when distrust, or at least disappointment, in the performance of the west is high. The International Monetary Fund strategy that would have brought Dollars 24bn (Pounds 16.9bn) into the country is seen to be stillborn. Western investors have not come in large numbers and it is clear there is no relief from the new friends. This makes many question whether they are really friends; and even pro-western politicians, like Mr Kozyrev, are cautious. Mr Kozyrev seems to prefer an ad hoc, increasingly moderated, liberalism to the enunciation of a defined policy line. This approach has allowed him, so far successfully, to defuse the issue of the 25m Russians living in other former Soviet republics through a series of bilateral talks and agreements. If he has had to shift to accommodate the nationalist pressures, he has so far been able to confine it to minimal movements. This will be a hard line to retain. Indeed, Mr Kozyrev himself, more unpopular than most ministers, may be hard to keep within the government. In part, Russia's size, interests, and present poverty dictate a retreat from the cuddly idealism of its first position. However, the harder spirits are winning out in some areas of policy, and may have further victories yet.</p>

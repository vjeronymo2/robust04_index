			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer Adrian Steed] Back to Bophuthatswana. Our  reporter on the scene, Nan Roux, has been in the thick of things  in Mmabatho today and witnessed a great deal of what you saw  earlier. She is on the line to us from the Mmabatho Sun Hotel.  Nan, give us an update on the situation at the moment, please.    [Roux] Well, the situation in the town Megacity, where most  of the action took place earlier this evening, is quiet, There  is a Bophuthatswana Defense Force presence, but apparently the  looting has stopped and the people have left the area.    However a news team came in from the Zeerust road and  noticed  approximately 30 cars. They said they looked like right-wing  cars, farmers' vehicles, bakkies [pickup trucks]. Apparently 30  of these cars turned off onto the Jagersfontein road. The two  reporters trailed them for about 10 km. They spotted men on the  back of one of the bakkies. They thought they had balaclavas  on. The cars turned round and the men returned. So there is a  massing of some kind outside town. We've just not had  confirmation of who exactly it is. Then we've also had reports  of problems in several prisons. A prison warden from a prison  just outside Mmabatho phoned to say that apparently they have  seven casualties. They have been attacked by Bophuthatswana  police and Bophuthatswana Defense Force. This hasn't been  confirmed yet, but there are problems in prisons across the  country. But in Mmabatho it's quiet, and yes, we'll keep you  updated.    [Steed] Nan, thank you very much. Good night, and take great  care.    [Roux] I will. Thank you.</p>

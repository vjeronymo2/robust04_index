			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aiming for Midas' touch in software - Combined ACT/BIS group will have annual sales over Pounds 250m THE RUBBER plants outside the offices of Mr Roger Graham, chairman and chief executive of BIS Group, have a weary air. They bely the resilience of one of the UK's oldest computing services companies, newly acquired by ACT, the Birmingham based computer group, for Pounds 93.5m. Together they will form an international company with annual sales of more than Pounds 250m and a range of financial software packages that few can equal. Since 1987, BIS has prospered only fitfully under the benevolent but somewhat detached management of Nynex Corporation of the US. Last year it returned to the black, reporting an operating profit of Pounds 8.7m after a Pounds 1m loss in 1991, the first in its history. Its acquisition by ACT should signal a renaissance for BIS and for indigenously owned computing services companies in the UK. ACT and BIS together will offer a range of financial software packages that few, if any, computing services companies can equal and with little overlap between them. The list includes Midas, BIS's venerable but well regarded modular banking systems, and Bankmaster, a banking system developed by one of ACT's more recent acquisitions, the Irish software company Kindle. Midas is a product for mature markets; Bankmaster suited to the financial systems of emerging nations. Founded in 1964 as a market research and training business, BIS quickly diversified into computer consultancy. It is best known, however, for the Midas package, which it has developed over the years into the most successful piece of packaged applications software ever developed by a UK company. BIS Banking Systems now has more than 500 banking clients in 70 countries and employs more than 600 people. Although Midas is over 20 years old, it has gone through repeated facelifts to keep it up to date and was sold to 45 new clients last year alone. Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman, said yesterday that he was committed to supporting and developing Midas for well into the next century. Nynex, one of the US 'Baby Bells', bought BIS for Pounds 75m at a time when it was fashionable for telecommunications companies to spread their interests through the acquisition of computing companies. More recently Nynex has decided to concentrate on its core business worldwide and on its substantial investments in cable in the UK. Mr Graham said that Nynex had been a good parent but: 'now we need a long-term shareholder prepared to make substantial investments'. The search for a new partner had been going on for about a year. Lazards, Nynex's merchant bankers, made the introduction to ACT; Nynex was attracted by the fact that the Birmingham company was prepared to do the deal quickly and the final papers were signed just before 8am yesterday. ACT - which made profits before tax of Pounds 20.5m on sales of Pounds 153m last year - is another of the UK's long established computing services companies. A flirtation with computer hardware ended with the sale of its workstation business to Mitsubishi Electric in 1990, since when it has concentrated on developing its principal divisions: ACT Financial Services, ACT Logsys, dealing with computing services for government departments and utilities, ACT Medisys, dealing with medical systems, ACT Computer Support, the maintenance arm, ACT Cablestream, concerned with networking, and ACT Kindle. It has grown rapidly, especially in financial services.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> COURT LETS RULING STAND IN PARENTS' CUSTODY DISPUTE  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Wednesday let stand an appeal court's ruling that  said a Ventura County judge could not settle a custody dispute by forcing the  mother to move closer to the father.  </P> <P> The court refused to review a ruling issued in July by the 2nd District Court  of Appeal. The appeal court found that Ventura County Superior Court Judge  Charles R. McGrath exceeded his authority when he forced Pamela Besser Theroux  to move from San Francisco to Ventura County so her son, Joshua, would not have  to commute between his parents' homes.  </P> <P> Theroux and Joshua's father, Michael Fingert, lived in Ventura when they were  divorced in 1981. She was awarded 75% custody, which eventually meant that  Joshua spent three weeks with his mother followed by one week with his father.  Fingert lives in Moorpark, Theroux eventually settled in San Francisco and  Joshua flew back and forth.  </P> <P> In September, 1988, McGrath decided that having both parents in the same area  would reduce the psychological stress on Joshua, who was attending two schools  and spending one week with his father for every three weeks with his mother.  </P> <P> The appeal court ruled in July, however, that McGrath's order violated the  mother's right to travel, guaranteed by the California and U.S. constitutions.  </P> <P> American Civil Liberties Union attorney Jon Davidson said he did not expect an  appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Neither Fingert nor his attorney, Richard L. Taylor, could be reached Wednesday  for comment.  </P> <P> Theroux said she still wants to return to Northern California but the timing is  uncertain. Her ex-husband has asked Ventura County Superior Court for 50% or  full custody, Davidson said. The court will hear that case in late October.  </P> <P> "Until we work out a schedule that works out best for Josh, we're just going to  stay put," Theroux said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (3) The inventory shall be taken in consultation with local redevelopment authority officials. If no local redevelopment authority exists, consultation shall be offered to the local government in whose jurisdiction the installation is wholly located, or a local government agency or State government agency designated for the purpose of such consultation by the chief executive officer of the State. Based on these consultations, the base commander is responsible for determining the items or category of items potentially enhancing the reuse of the real property and needed to support the redevelopment plan. When the inventory is completed, base personnel shall offer a ``walkthrough'' with representatives of the local redevelopment authority so that they can see the type and condition of the property available for reuse. Disagreements should be resolved within the chain-of-command, with final authority on resolving personal property issues resting with the Secretary of the Military Department or Defense Agency Director responsible for the real property. This authority may be further delegated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Military Departments should make every reasonable effort to assist affected communities in obtaining the personal property needed to convert the bases into economically-viable enterprises. Personal property not subject to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall remain at a closing or realigning base until one of the following time periods expire (whichever comes first): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) One week after the date on which the redevelopment plan is submitted to the applicable Military Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The date on which the local redevelopment authority notifies the applicable Military Department that a plan will not be submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Twenty-four months after the dates referred to in paragraph (h)(2) of this section which for 1988, 1991 and 1993 base closures and realignments is November 30, 1995, or 24 months after the date of approval of the 1995 closures and realignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Ninety days before the date of the closure or realignment of the installation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Personal property may be removed without regard to these time periods upon approval of the base commander, or higher authority within the Military Department, and after notice to the local redevelopment authority, if the property: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Is required for the operation of a unit, function, component, weapon, or weapon system transferring to another installation. A transferring unit or function may take with it any property needed to function properly as soon as it arrives, provided that suitable replacement equipment will not be readily obtainable there and moving it is cost-effective. In addition to this authority for the transferring unit or function to remove personal property, the major command having jurisdiction over the installation (e.g., the Army's Forces Command or the Air Force's Air Combat Command), or the major claimant having jurisdiction over the installation (e.g., the Navy's U.S. Atlantic Fleet) also may remove property that is needed immediately and is indispensable to an organization under its jurisdiction at another installation for carrying out the organization's primary mission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Is uniquely military in character, and is likely to have no civilian use (other than use for its material content or as a source of commonly used components). Classified items; nuclear, biological, chemical items; weapons and munitions; museum property or items of significant historic value that are maintained or displayed on loan; and similar military items fit this exception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Is not required for the reutilization or redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the Military Department concerned and the redevelopment authority). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Is stored at the installation for distribution (including spare parts or stock items). This exception includes materials or parts used in a manufacturing or repair function but does not include maintenance spares for equipment to be left in place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Meets known requirements of an authorized program of another Federal Department or Agency for which expenditures for similar property would be necessary, and is the subject of a written request received from the head of the Department or Agency. In this context, ``expenditures'' means the Federal Department or Agency intends to obligate funds in the current quarter or next six fiscal quarters. The Federal Department or Agency must pay packing, crating, handling, and transportation charges associated with such transfers of personal property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Belongs to nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI). NAFI property may be removed at the Military Departments' discretion, because NAFI property belongs to the Service members collectively and is not government property. Therefore, it may not be transferred to the local redevelopment authority under this section. Separate arrangements for communities to purchase NAFI property are possible and may be negotiated with the Military Department concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

(Nissan Motor). Increasingly promising lately is  the potential for N60, the molecule consisting of 60 nitrogen  atoms bonded in a soccer-ball shape, to be used as rocket fuel  capable of generating the world's highest thrust. Supercomputer  simulation confirmed the existence of N60 as the ``nitrogen  version'' of the newly emerging promising material, C60, made of  60 carbon atoms. Although a ``considerable amount of time is  required for synthesizing N60,'' its development has already  begun.    NIMCR's Chief Researcher Takehiro Matsunaga, who proposed  the  N60 concept, says this: ``When I saw the crystalline structure  of C60, I immediately sensed that the world's most powerful  explosive could be made if the same structure could be applied  to nitrogen atoms.''    NIMCR and Nissan Motor are jointly developing the  next-generation rocket fuel. The joint team has been in search  of a compound capable of generating a sufficiently powerful  thrust to propel heavy rockets faster and farther.    Although nitrogen exists as a stable gas, its compounds can  become powerful explosives. TNT, today's most widely used  explosive, is also a nitrogen-containing compound.    Compared with oxygen and hydrogen, the atomic bonding force  in nitrogen is greater, and therefore, when the bond is  destroyed, larger energy is released. In other words, if a  compound can be synthesized from nitrogen atoms only, the  compound can be a powerful explosive.    From that standpoint, the crystalline structure of the  soccer-ball-like C60 was the ideal shape for explosive  researchers. The joint group of NIMCR and Nissan Motor computed  the atomic radius and the molecular bonding energy and confirmed  the existence of N60, consisting of 60 nitrogen atoms, and N70,  consisting of 70 nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, the group computed  the magnitude of thrust when these molecules are used as rocket  fuel.    The currently most advanced propulsion technology involving  the reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen is to be  used for space shuttles and the next Japanese-made large rocket  H2, which is scheduled to be launched in February 1994 by the  National Space Development Agency. The technology makes use of  the heat that is released when oxygen and hydrogen react.    Specific impulse, an index of a rocket's efficiency, for H2  is approximately 445 seconds. By computation, the group obtained  a specific impulse of approximately 550 seconds, approximately  20 percent better than the above value, for the predicted N60,  despite the common knowledge that it is almost impossible to  improve specific impulse by even one second with today's fuel  technology.    Another advantage of N60 as rocket fuel is that it is a  solid. By applying high heat or impact, the energy accumulated  in the material is released instantaneously. The liquid fuel to  be used for H2 is difficult to handle and has a potential for  leaking. It has been reported that the U.S. National Aerospace  Agency has experienced more than 5,000 accidents in the area of  engine development. Chief Researcher Matsunaga says, ``There is  no doubt in my mind that the new nitrogen compound, if  synthesized, will be the new rocket fuel.''    There seems to be no clue to the synthesis method for the  compound. It took five years for the synthesis method for C60 to  be found after the computer prediction had been made for the  existence of the molecule. Actually, the carbon molecule was  isolated from soot produced by the electric discharge between  carbon electrodes. In contrast with the C60 molecule, which is  in the shape of a nearly perfect soccer ball, the N60 molecule  predicted by the joint group has an indentation involving more  than 10 nitrogen atoms. Because of this distorted shape, the N60  molecule is said to be easily destroyed and difficult to  synthesize.    The C60 molecule was synthesized with a systematic approach  by gradually increasing the number of carbon atoms on a molecule  consisting of 12 carbon atoms that was already in existence. On  the other hand, nitrogen molecules containing four, six and 20  atoms showed excessive strain in simulation tests, and their  stable existence was negated.    Section Chief Katsumi Tanigaki of the Exploratory Research  Department, NEC Basic Research Institute, points out that  ``unless an epoch-making synthetic method is found, it will be a  long road before we see the actual N60 molecule.'' He suggests  that the group should ``first check the possibility of  synthesizing a molecule consisting of carbon and nitrogen.''    According to the super-computer simulation, the N60 molecule  is supposed to generate the world's greatest explosive force.  Although a long road of synthesis is ahead, we must hope for the  best for future research. As Section Chief Tanigaki says, we  must ``go for it, as long as its existence has been predicted.''   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-15A>           Synthesized C60 and Predicted N60 </FIG></p>

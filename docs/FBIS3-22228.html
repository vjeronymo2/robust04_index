			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Levandovskyy, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </F> columnist: ``On the German Minister's Commission. Thanks to  Yuriy Kostenko [Ukraine's minister of environmental protection]  and Experts from Saxony-Anhalt, Ukraine Will Not Yet Become a  Dumping Ground for Toxic Waste'']    [Text] For several months, the Ukrainian mass media have  been carrying alarming reports on the uncontrolled dumping of  German toxic waste in Rivne and Nikolayev oblasts. The  ``Greens'' and Ukraine's Greenpeace sounded the alarm. German  officials kept silent for a long time.    Finally, in November [1993], at the request of Ukrainian  Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to his  German colleague Klaus Toepfer, a group of experts headed by Dr.  Andre Radde [names as transliterated] arrived in Kiev.    For a week, the FRG specialists conducted identifications of  toxic substances and investigated the circumstances of their  delivery to Ukraine. In Rivne Oblast, between 50 and 70 tonnes  of various substances were revealed (dyes, varnishes, putty,  wax, tallow, and laboratory chemicals, including mercury), as  well as 100 tonnes of slag, which are stored under the guard of  chemical troops.    In Nikolayev Oblast, between 40 and 50 tonnes of such  substances are also stored under proper conditions. There does  not seem to be any acute danger for the population, but, of  course, there exists a certain threat to the environment.    What part of the imported waste may be processed and what is  to be done with the remaining substances will only be determined  in Germany after an evaluation of the results of the inspection.  The results will be reported to Saxony-Anhalt institutions,  which, within the framework of their jurisdiction, are presently  conducting a criminal and administrative investigation of German  firms under suspicion that they have violated the Law on Waste  Disposal.    The thing is, in the FRG lands, private contracts between  firms (including foreign ones) are not controlled by federal  organs of power. Economic ties are established directly. That  is why competent bodies alone may determine the degree of  responsibility of the entrepreneurs.    Unfortunately, the absence of a similar law in Ukraine makes  it possible to import waste (secondary raw materials) on a  perfectly legal basis. Smart dealers take advantage of this and  fill their pockets under the pretext of saturating the market  with raw materials, which are in short supply. It is impossible  to rely solely upon the vigilance of the ``Greens'' or the  enthusiasm of members of the Ukrainian Greenpeace Organization.    Ukraine's Supreme Council, by its decree of 17 November  1993,  already made the first step, having authorized the Cabinet of  Ministers to adopt a list of groups of substances and materials  belonging to the category of those dangerous waste materials,  whose import to the territory of Ukraine is prohibited, and the  Procedure for Issuing Licenses for Importing (Transit) of  Secondary Raw Materials and Relevant Waste to the Territory of  Ukraine.    It only remains to make the second step -- to fill in the  blank spaces in the legislation, lest impudent entrepreneurs  should make dangerous attempts to bring highly toxic substances  to Ukraine.    I must point out, as a positive development, the meeting of  the German experts with Ukrainian and foreign correspondents at  the German Embassy in Ukraine. It is my impression that  [German] Ambassador Alexander Arnot is particularly active in  trying to help our state overcome various hardships in its  present critical situation.</p>

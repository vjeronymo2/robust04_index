			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. G. Krasilenko, T. B. Martynyuk, N. I. </F> Zabolotnaya, V. N. Dubchak; UDC 681.325.2+681.327.68:778.38]    [Abstract] A feasibility of developing a digital  optoelectronic processor of multi-level images employing an  algebraic addition of sign changing matrices is examined. This  study is based on a stack coding concept. With stack coding the  number is being coded by a stack in K plane image matrices,  while the least significant bit is fixed in the first matrix,  the next significant bit in the second matrix, etc. Thus, all  the initial numbers, as well as the results of processing can be  represented by K digits, i.e. by K representations with  dimensions NxM, each containing digit shears NxM of binary  numbers. A space-continuous arithmetic-logic device is developed  for synthesis of algebraic additions of sign-changing matrices.  The multi-input arithmetic- logic device for processing binary  images is a fundamental operating unit for expanding the  functional capacity and speed of processing.

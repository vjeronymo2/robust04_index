			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: A revaluation, not devaluation Sir, The chancellor ('Ingredients for recovery are in place', December 31), was quite right, of course, to set his face against a sterling devaluation and its consequences. 'Never again]' should be Britain's watchword. But how about a revaluation of the D-Mark against all other currencies, sterling included, none of which would therefore be singled out for special treatment and be made to feel humiliated? The consequences here, by both helping the D-Mark to regain price stability (after the added strains of German monetary union) and taking some of the pressure off its partners, could be beneficial to all concerned. Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley, London N3 3AN</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Absorbing the bounce English Architectural Glazing has developed a blast-resistant glazed cladding system, providing extra protection against bomb attack, writes Richard Lapper. EAG's glass cladding is designed to bend rather than fracture with the force of a blast - like a tennis racket hit by a ball. The system uses frames of a special aluminium alloy. Transoms and mullions are marginally wider than those used in conventional building design, helping keep the glass in its frame. But Norman Sheldrake, managing director, says they are narrower than in other blast-proof cladding systems. The EAG system differs little in appearance or cost from standard claddings.

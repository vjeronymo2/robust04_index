			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Health chief is dismissed The chairman of a Welsh health authority has been sacked for his repeated failure to act on complaints, a committee of MPs was told yesterday. Mr Brynn Davies, who for 16 years was chairman of Mid Glamorgan Health Authority, the biggest in Wales, will not have his contract renewed when it expires this summer, the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner for administration (the ombudsman) was told. The decision was made by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary. Mr John Wyn Owen, a member of the National Health Service management executive for Wales, told the committee yesterday that action was being taken to improve matters. Mr Davies has appeared before a Commons committee twice in three years - the last time six weeks ago when MPs discussed a report on the way the authority handled complaints about the death of a 62-year-old man. The authority has previously caused controversy by failing to tell patients that a doctor died of Aids until five months after his death, and allegations that consultants at Merthyr had charged patients for using NHS facilities. In January Mr Davies apologised to the committee for the treatment of relatives of patients who had tried in vain to see a consultant for 18 months.</p>

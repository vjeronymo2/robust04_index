			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> THE PRINCE by R.M. Koster (W.W. Norton: $8.95) R. M. Koster received a National  Book Award nomination for the first volume of his trilogy set in the fictional  Central American country of Tinieblas. Narrated by the son of a former  president of Tinieblas, this darkly compelling tale of political intrigue is as  complex as the history of any real nation.  </P> <P> Although his body was crippled in a botched assassination attempt during his  own presidential campaign, Kiki Sancudo's mind remains venomously intact.  Imprisoned in his ruined flesh, he contemplates revenge and reflects on his  country's curious past, with its numerous elections, coups, dictators, scandals  and American interventions. Koster's tendency toward hyperbole weakens his  effort to depict the extremes of Latin American politics: Kiki has been an  Olympic athlete, a stellar actor, a successful gun runner, a charismatic  politician, a tireless lover (or satyr; Kiki loves no one but himself) and a  champion card player with a psychic ability to read the deck, all with a  minimum of effort. His single-minded devotion to vengeance suggests the  discipline necessary for his myriad endeavors, but there's no hint of the  requisite labor. "The Prince" is an ambitious book, but one whose excesses  sometimes cloak its very real strengths. Charles Solomon  </P></p>

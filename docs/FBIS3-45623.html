			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten left Hong Kong last night for  London, taking a parting swipe at China's conduct in the row  over the territory's political and economic future. Intending  to conduct strategy talks in London with British Prime Minister  John Major and senior cabinet ministers, Mr Patten reiterated a  stern warning to China not to mix politics and economics.    He intimated China might have more to lose than Britain if  it  did so. "China has pretty well a two-to-one trade surplus with  the United Kingdom," Mr Patten said. "China has attempted to  join the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), an  application which has the United Kingdom's and, of course, the  Hong Kong Government's enthusiastic support. And countries  which join Gatt don't behave in the sort of way that has been  suggested by one or two Chinese officials."    Since the Sino-British negotiations broke down, Mr Patten's  relations with Beijing have been strained and acrimonious.    Britain has now embarked on unilateral constitutional reform  in Hong Kong, but he stressed that the door to negotiations on  the contentious issues surrounding the final elections under  British rule was still open. With the first part of his  constitutional reform package now before the legislature Mr  Patten has made it clear the remainder will not be introduced  until after that bill is approved. The bill needs to be  approved by the end of the month, leaving the way clear for the  remainder of the constitutional reform package to be introduced  in March.    Mr Patten will seek cabinet backing to take this course of  action when he meets senior ministers in London on Monday. "I  don't think you should expect any dramatic announcements," he  said. "The position is one I think the community well  understands. We want to go on talking to Chinese officials  about the three outstanding contentious issues (surrounding the  1995 Legislative Council elections). "We're happy to go on  talking until that moment when we have to begin legislating on  the remaining matters which have to be resolved for the 1995  elections. We hope that the talks can be resumed, and if that's  not the case we will have to try with the Legislative Council to  put in place arrangements which are acceptable to Hong Kong," Mr  Patten said.    Today, he will begin his strategy talks with the British  Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, and the minister  responsible for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina will begin a diplomatic offensive "seeking to  reinsert Cuba into Latin America." The tour will start in  Montevideo on 4 April. New Cuban Ambassador to Uruguay Manuel  Aguilera de la Paz made this announcement during an interview  with EFE.    Robaina will be in Montevideo from the morning of 4 April to  the afternoon of 6 April and will meet with the country's main  political leaders. Robaina will visit Quito [Ecuador], Lima  [Peru], Asuncion [Paraguay], and Buenos Aires [Argentina]. Its  "priority is to explain our policies in favor of Latin American  integration, which includes economic as well as political  integration," Aguilera de la Paz told EFE. During his meetings  with Uruguayan politicians, Robaina will discuss the latest  Cuban Government measures to legalize private economic  activities and his country's willingness to receive investments  from Latin American entrepreneurs.    While visiting the Latin American capitals, Robaina will  discuss arrangements for the next Ibero-American summit to be  held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) next June. Aguilera de la  Paz said Cuba believes it is important for this summit to  reiterate its condemnation of the embargo on trade against Cuba  maintained by the United States. The previous Ibero-American  summit held in Salvador, Bahia, (Brazil) last year condemned  this embargo, but in a very tenuous manner.    The Cuban ambassador added: "Latin American support against  the embargo may be becoming stronger. It will foster Cuba's  political and economic integration into the hemisphere." He  added: "Second, as a bloc, it will exert pressure on the U.S.  Government, convincing it that the embargo is an obsolete policy  that will lead nowhere."    Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle will receive the  Cuban foreign minister, who will also meet with left-wing  leaders from the Broad Front, namely Montevideo Mayor Tabare  Vasquez -- his party's presidential candidate -- and the  renowned General Liber Seregni. Aguilera de la Paz pointed out  that Robaina will not be able to meet former President Julio  Maria Sanguinetti -- who is the social democratic Colorado  Party's presidential candidate in this year's election -- as he  will not be in the country at that time.    Robaina's visit to Latin America will be followed by another  tour of other countries in the hemisphere, about which he  declined to comment. This is part of an overall diplomatic  offensive launched by Cuba, which has recently taken the foreign  minister to Asia and which will take him to other European  nations, including Spain.    Aguilera de la Paz explained that Robaina, 38, "has given  greater impetus to Cuban foreign policy" since he assumed the  foreign affairs portfolio last year. Aguilera de la Paz, like  Robaina, comes from the communist youth. He entered the  diplomatic service under the new foreign minister.    Asked if Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's accession to  the  OAS General Secretariat would favor Cuba's rejoining this  organization, Aguilera de la Paz replied that "Cuba is not eager  to return to the OAS." He said: "We maintain, to a certain  extent, a passive attitude on this issue. We have not asked to  rejoin the OAS but we are sure that it will happen although we  do not know how long it will take."</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CANAL RESUMES 24-HOUR SERVICE  </P> <P> The Panama Canal returned to normal 24-hour operations today and 38 ships were  scheduled to pass through the strategic Atlantic-Pacific waterway, its  Washington headquarters said.  </P> <P> "We are back to normal operations. . . . Things are beginning to fall into  place and efficiency at the canal will pick up," said Michael Rhode, secretary  of the Panama Canal Commission.  </P> <P> The canal was closed for the first time in its 75-year history for other than  landslides after U.S. forces invaded Panama last week to capture military  strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The waterway was later reopened on a  limited basis.  </P> <P> There were 135 ships waiting to transit at midnight Wednesday with 42 more  vessels expected to arrive today, Rhode said.  </P> <P> "The work force is returning and we expect normal operations unless something  unforeseen happens," he added.  </P></p>

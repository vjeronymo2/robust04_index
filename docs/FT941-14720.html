			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Finns on a limb - Finland's forestry industry is taking a beating over its management methods Finland's forestry and paper industry has been shaken by accusations from abroad that its forest management methods are destructive and its paper mills environmentally unfriendly. Last November, an article in Der Spiegel, the German news weekly, entitled 'Plunderers in the north' sent shock waves through the business community and the government. It suggested that Finland, Canada, Alaska and Russia were ravaging their ancient forests with mechanical tree harvesters. Finland's forestry industry, not surprisingly, has rejected the accusations against it. And there are mutterings in Helsinki about 'environmental imperialism' by countries which seek to impose standards on others. Finland, people point out, has had a forestry conservation law on its statute books for decades. But Finns also have enough experience of the suddenness and force of environmental campaigns to know that their largest industry - wood, pulp and paper products account for 36 per cent of Finnish exports - would be in serious danger if these claims gained strength, particularly since they affect every stage of the paper-making process. 'The market pressures are driven by feelings, not facts,' says Heikki Sara, senior vice-president of United Paper Mills, one of the country's biggest paper companies. 'It is very important for us to have equal and predictable regulation. This is a very capital intensive business and it takes years to change.' The tremors have reached Jyvaskyla, a forestry town in central Finland where, as in most of the country, the bulk of the forest is owned by private individuals, but where unemployment is 20 per cent, making any attack on forestry a threatening prospect. Kaj Karlsson, director of the woodlands department of Metsaliitto, a large forestry co-operative, says it is pointless for foreign critics to demand that Finland protect its ancient forests. 'There is hardly any original forest left in Finland,' he says. 'That was cut down long ago. What we have now is new growth forest.' Pauli Ahola, a private farmer who owns 360 hectares, fears foreign pressures will lead to a ban on clearcutting. The alternative - harvesting by thinning  -would be much more laborious and would render his business uneconomical, particularly with timber prices at their current depressed levels. Even so, the government recently extended protection to 23,000 hectares of state-owned old growth forest. But it cannot afford to extend this to private farms because there is no money to compensate the owners for lost production. A point laboured by the Finnish forestry industry is that the replanting rate exceeds the annual harvest by a large margin, and that Finland now has more forest than at any time in its recorded history. But Tony Juniper, habitats campaigner at Friends of the Earth, says it is not sufficient to look at sustainability only in terms of whether the forest stock is growing. Finland's forest management methods, with their replacement of the original growth with trees for industrial use, have threatened species and reduced bio-diversity, he says. Down the road from Ahola's farm, at the large Kangas paper mill, Pasi Ahonen, the customer service manager, is anxious to keep his share of the German market, where environmentalists have demonstrated outside publishing houses suspected of using non-environmental paper. His company has invested heavily in cleaning up its plant and reducing the use of chlorine as a bleaching agent to meet foreign demands. 'To get into the German market, you have to be totally chlorine-free,' he says. 'But that adds 5 to 10 per cent to the cost.' Until recently, chlorine-free paper commanded a price premium in the central European market. But recession has wiped that out. But while production methods have been attacked, they can, at least, be remedied. A more deadly threat to Finland's paper industry comes from foreign pressure to raise the share of recycled paper. For example, the European Union recently agreed recycling targets, and Belgium is introducing an eco-tax to promote re-use of waste products. This not only threatens to undercut Finland's leading export product - virgin pulp paper - but also challenges it to get hold of enough recycled paper to plough back into production to meet other countries' content requirements. With a population of only 5m, but enough paper production to supply a country eight times its size, locally generated waste paper meets only a fraction of industry needs. Ironically, therefore, Finland now imports waste paper from abroad. One Finnish company, the state-owned Enso-Gutzeit, has even built a recycled newsprint plant in Germany in order to be closer to the supply of waste paper. Pertti Laine, the vice-president for industrial and environmental policy at the Finnish Forest Industries Federation, says that recycling is now the biggest economic issue for the industry. He is supporting a campaign to promote incineration as an acceptable alternative to recycling or landfilling. Frequent recycling quickly wears out pulp fibres and adds to costs - and you are still left with a waste problem, he says. On his desk is a brown-grey block of what looks like rubber. It is compressed paper, the product of a technology to transform waste paper into a usable fuel. Paper has almost the same calorific value as coal, he says, and produces carbon to grow more trees. 'The Finnish plan is not cradle to grave, but cradle to cradle,' he says, using the environmentalist's product life cycle terminology. Finland claims to be one of the few countries in the world which absorbs nearly all the carbon it produces. However, the industry's attempts to rebut criticism have yet to convince the sceptics. Heidi Hautula, one of the 10 Green Party members of parliament, says the Spiegel article gave a much-needed impetus for change. 'Up to now, the industry was only concerned with its image. Now it sees a need for action,' she says. She also wants action from the government: a redrafting of the forestry law to cover leisure uses and protect bio-diversity, limitations on the use of ploughing and pesticides, and so on. Her position is sensitive because such measures would add to the industry's cost and regulatory burden at this difficult period.</p>

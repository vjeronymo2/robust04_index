			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Deadline for QE2 repair bids set CUNARD has set a deadline of tomorrow for bids from US and European shipyards to carry out substantial repairs to the company's flagship, the Queen Elizabeth 2, which ran aground off the US coast near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 12 days ago. Further details showing the scale of damage sustained by the liner emerged yesterday. Cunard has said that it expects the earliest resumption of service to be September 29, but marine experts now believe that the damage could put the liner out of service until at least the middle of October, as well as adding substantially to insurance costs. Mr William Coughlin, for General Ship Corporation, in whose Boston shipyard the QE2 is docked, said last night the damage included 400ft of punctures and cracks along the keel, and fractured fuel and ballast tanks. He added: 'The damage is much more extensive than we first thought.' General Ship Corporation is one of several shipyards believed to have bid for the repair work. Cunard and Commercial Union, its lead insurer, said last night that the size of the eventual insurance claim would depend on further assessments of the repair costs and of the lost passenger revenue. Cunard has so far had to reschedule eight Atlantic crossings and two cruises. Passengers are being offered a total refund or fresh bookings.</p>

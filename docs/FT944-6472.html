			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gengold plans Oryx scale-down South African mining producer Gengold has said that it plans to scale down underground mining operations at its troubled Oryx gold mine pending further investigation of the reef. This follows the announcement earlier this year that the mine would probably need R950m (Pounds 150m) in new capital on top of the R2bn already invested if it were to become commercially viable. According to the company, preliminary sampling has revealed unusual variability in the grade of the reef. In consequence, the mine will require an additional 2,000m of reef development to explore the area further and determine whether there is in fact an exploitable high grade channel within the main ore body. This development is expected to be completed by December 1995. As a result of the move, the mine's workforce will be scaled down from 3,200 to 1,200 although Gengold plans to offer most of the workers alternative employment on other mines in the group. Gencor, Gengold's parent company, has agreed to underwrite the additional exploration at the cost of R12m a month. However this excludes financing costs and Gengold says it will seek further consultation with Oryx's bankers. Meanwhile, Gengold says that the initial R979m in interest-free loans provided by the mine's major shareholders - Gencor, mining house Anglo-American, investment group Genbel and financial group Sanlam - will be capitalised in the near future.</p>

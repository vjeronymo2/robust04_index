			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: NEGLECTED APPLIANCES A SERIOUS THREAT TO HOME SAFETY  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here is a safety tip to share with all your readers.  </P> <P> We are frequently reminded not to leave small appliances, like hair dryers and  toaster ovens, plugged in when we are finished using them. I had become  careless about this and left the toaster oven plugged in after making toast for  breakfast.  </P> <P> There must have been some problem with the electric power one day, and when I  returned home from work I found that the roll of paper towels I had left on top  of the oven (another careless error) was very warm. Any delay in coming home  might have allowed a fire to begin in the kitchen. Since I live in a mobile  home, you can readily see that, in a very brief time, I would have had no home  to come home to.  </P> <P> I have been ever alert to the danger of fire in my home.  </P> <P>  -- W. M., Arden, N.C.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My family is trying to eat nutritiously, so once a week we have  salad for a meal. I decided that I would make a mini salad bar on the table. I  have three muffin tins and in each cup I place different salad ingredients like  sliced mushrooms, sliced carrots, chick peas, kidney beans, sliced beets,  sliced celery, chopped green onions, sprouts and radishes.  </P> <P> Then in a large bowl in the center I place bite-size pieces of lettuce and  other greens. I also place dressings and salad toppers there.  </P> <P> Now everyone enjoys putting their own salad together and eating a healthy meal.  </P> <P>  -- SALLY, Salt Lake City  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: For hard-to-open small jars and bottles I use a heavy, wide  rubber band for a gripper.  </P> <P> The bands come from the produce department where they are used in packaging  broccoli. Just slip the band around the stubborn top, and it's so easy to open.  </P> <P>  -- RUTH, Rapid City, S.D.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I bake cupcakes in flat-bottomed ice-cream cones. I place the  cones in a muffin tin, fill them halfway with batter and then bake according to  cupcake directions. After they have cooled, I add frosting and colored  sprinkles. They are the hit of a party.  </P> <P>  -- MARGE, Carmichael, Penn.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Have you ever deviled eggs and then wanted more filling so you  could make the halves fuller?  </P> <P> Well, you can solve that by adding some low-fat cottage cheese to the yolks. I  add about 1/3 cup to six eggs.  </P> <P> Mash the egg yolks and the cheese together and season as usual. Dare anyone to  say it's not all egg. They are delicious and no one is the wiser.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. E. G., Fort Myers, Fla.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My mother-in-law has always told me not to store apples and  carrots together. Why is this?  </P> <P>  -- LENORA, Mount Dora, Fla.  </P> <P> DEAR LENORA: Apples shouldn't be kept in the same crisper drawer as unwrapped  carrots, since they give off ethylene gas, which can make the carrots bitter.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: To avoid freezer burn, I double-wrap meat packages with freezer  wrap. Then, so I don't have to hunt through the freezer for a package of meat,  I tie a piece of red string on each package and can tell meat at a glance.  </P> <P>  -- LOLLY, La Crescenta  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have found a way to make setting the table easier for my  daughter. She never could remember which side the silverware went on. I was  constantly moving the knives, forks and spoons to the correct position.  </P> <P> Then I figured this little reminder for her. I told her that the fork goes on  the left and the words fork and left both have four letters. The knife and the  spoon go on the right and the words knife, spoon and right all have five  letters.  </P> <P> This has made setting the table a snap for her. She simply remembers our little  saying.  </P> <P>  -- BETTY, Des Moines  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Every time I turn on my microwave, it interferes with my  television. Also, if I am on the telephone I can hear a definite buzzing when  the microwave is on. Is there anything I can do?  </P> <P>  -- BELINDA, Marion, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR BELINDA: It's not uncommon to have microwave interference with television,  radios and even some types of telephones.  </P> <P> If you hear buzzing in the telephone when it and the microwave are being used  at the same time, try moving the telephone closer to the microwave or the  microwave closer to the telephone or facing it toward or away from the  telephone. If this affects the interference, it could be related to some  leaching, which always occurs from microwaves.  </P> <P> However, not to worry. Federal standards limit the amount of leaching from  microwave ovens, and unless the microwave was purchased more than 15 years ago,  you are not likely to be in danger, says the Assn. of Home Appliance  Manufacturers.  </P> <P> Older microwaves have metal-to-metal contact that may allow some leakage, but  for the past 15 years or so, microwaves have had choke doors that meet federal  standards for leaching.  </P> <P> If you have an older microwave or are concerned about excess microwave  leaching, AHAM says some local health departments offer free checkups for  microwave leakage. You can also have it checked by a professional repair  service, but it won't be free.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P></p>

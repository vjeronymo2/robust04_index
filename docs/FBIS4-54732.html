			<p>BFN     [Textz] Warsaw, May 4 -- Strikes, especially those in the  strategic industries, also pose a danger to the country,  President Lech Walesa on Wednesday told the cabinet members that  meet to discuss security problems.    According to the president, the fact that not everybody is  on  strike and not everybody should pay for strikes should be  established through negotiations and by a social agreement so  that the trade unions are not suprised. Walesa stressed that it  should not be allowed that the strategic elements of the economy  be paralysed since it also is dangerous for the country.</p>

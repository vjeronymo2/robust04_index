			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: RJR in the black with Dollars 5m RJR NABISCO, the tobacco and food group which was subject to the biggest leveraged buyout in the US two years ago, yesterday reported a small after-tax profit of Dollars 5m in the first quarter of 1991. It is the first time RJR has made a profit after interest and tax since the massive Dollars 25bn takeover masterminded by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the investment banking business. In the first quarter of 1990, RJR reported a net loss of Dollars 222m. News of the surplus seemed to surprise some Wall Street analysts, who greeted the figures warmly. 'It's positive - we were expecting a small loss,' commented one high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers. On the stock market, RJR shares rose in morning trading in New York by 3/8 to Dollars 11 7/8 , while its junk bonds also advanced on the profit news. The company has just completed the latest in a series of refinancing exercises aimed at reducing the cost of its outstanding debt. The most recent restructuring involved the issue of 115m new shares, to raise Dollars 1.29bn, plus a Dollars 1.5bn tranche of new junk bonds. During the first quarter, RJR's operating profits rose to Dollars 647m, 7 per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, with 'cash earnings' - that is, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - marginally improved at Dollars 940m against Dollars 923m. Sales overall were 8 per cent higher at Dollars 3.47bn. Of the two main business divisions, food showed the more marked advance. Sales rose from Dollars 1.34bn to Dollars 1.51bn, while operating profits (ahead of amortisation charges) were 21 per cent higher at Dollars 171m. On the tobacco side, sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 1.96bn, while profits edged 2 per cent higher at Dollars 648m. The company reported 'significant volume gains' overseas, but said its domestic volumes were still falling by more than the market generally - the latter figure standing at around 3 per cent a year. The flow of debt refinancings has helped to push down interest costs. In the first quarter, cash interest expense was Dollars 307m from Dollars 388m.</p>

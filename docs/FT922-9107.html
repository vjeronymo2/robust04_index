			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fried. Krupp forecasts decline FRIED. KRUPP, the German steel, engineering and trading group shortly to be merged with Hoesch, its former rival, is expecting a drop in both sales and profits this year despite a 4 per cent increase in orders in the first quarter, Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman, said yesterday. An expected strike among members of the IG Metall metal-working union will also take its toll, mainly in the machinery divisions, he added. Confirming a 2 per cent increase in sales last year to DM15bn (Dollars 9bn) and a 2 per cent drop in orders, he said pre-tax profits for last year totalled DM417m. Net earnings rose DM88m to DM305m. Mr Cromme, who claimed that 'restructuring and rehabilitation' of the group, started in 1988, was virtually completed last year, also warned of unspecified 'pruning' in addition to the 1,800 job losses directly related to the Hoesch merger. Early orders, totalling DM3.6bn in the first quarter, could not be read as a reliable indicator of overall prospects. 'The steel sector is confronted with a difficult situation with prices for some products at 1980 levels,' he said. 'This price slump cannot be offset even by the extensive rationalisation of recent years and the ongoing structural measures.'

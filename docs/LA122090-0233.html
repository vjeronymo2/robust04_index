			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: ARTIST-HISTORIAN TURNS TO CITY OF ORANGE ARCHITECTURE  </P> <P> In 1987, Karen Wilson Turnbull wrote and illustrated "The Cottages and Castles  of Laguna," a large-format paperback book featuring 80 pen-and-ink drawings of  Laguna's melange of architectural styles.  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach artist-historian followed that up with "The Rustic Charm of  Old Orange County," a 1988 book of drawings and descriptions of Orange County's  remaining "old buildings and places."  </P> <P> And now Turnbull is out with "A Place Called Home: Orange's Architectural  Legacy," co-authored by Orange historian Phil Brigandi.  </P> <P> Like her previous two paperback books, the new one was published by Turnbull  herself.  </P> <P> "So I guess," she says with a laugh, "I'm sort of a cottage industry now."  </P> <P> "A Place Called Home" features 70 detailed pen-and-ink drawings of houses and  other structures built between 1874 and World War II. (Included are three  commercial buildings and two churches.) The architectural styles include  everything from Victorian and Mediterranean to Craftsman and Italianate. The  book's text, written by Brigandi, provides a brief history of each structure.  </P> <P> When Turnbull was casting about for her next book project two years ago, Orange  seemed the most logical choice.  </P> <P> "It's the only city left in Orange County, besides San Juan Capistrano, that  has a historic district where the old houses haven't been bulldozed," said  Turnbull, 40.  </P> <P> "A Place Called Home," Turnbull said, "is very much a celebration of Orange's  old architecture."  </P> <P> In contrast to Laguna, where her book was intended to make people aware of the  city's historic architecture, she said, "In Orange, the awareness is there."  Despite that appreciation of the city's past, she added, "nothing had ever been  done before on the homes. We just thought it really needed to be done."  </P> <P> Turnbull contacted Brigandi, who has written three Orange history books, in  early 1989.  </P> <P> "I had thought of doing a book on the downtown business buildings, but never on  the houses," said Brigandi, 31, who has since moved from Orange to Hemet where  he serves as museum curator for the Ramona Pageant Assn.  </P> <P> Brigandi quickly agreed to collaborate.  </P> <P> "This was a good year-and-a-half-long project," he said, adding: "It was  basically done on a handshake the way these things should be."  </P> <P> Turnbull and Brigandi together selected the houses and buildings featured in  the book and then, while Brigandi began researching the history of each house,  Turnbull began drawing.  </P> <P> The fourth-generation Lagunan, who lives in a rented, 63-year-old beach house  above Paradise Cove, worked from enlarged black and white photographs that she  took of each house. Each drawing took her several days because, the mother of  two said, "I can only work late in the evening when the children are asleep."  </P> <P> Brigandi said he and Turnbull never intended "A Place Called Home" to be a  chronicle of the "top" 70 historic houses in Orange. Instead, he said, their  goal was "to make people aware of the historical richness that surrounds them."  </P> <P> So instead of just focusing on houses in the city's historic downtown district,  they took a much broader sweep: They included houses in one-time separate  residential areas such as Olive, El Modena, McPherson and West Orange, which  have since been swallowed up by the City of Orange. They also put in a street  map showing the locations of the houses featured in the book.  </P> <P> The earliest home is "the Shaffer House" at 221 N. Orange St. Built in 1874, it  is also the oldest surviving building in Orange.  </P> <P> "It's been totally added onto and changed over the years," Brigandi said. "But  I like to joke that it has additions on it that are older than many of the  historic houses in town."  </P> <P> Brigandi said they also included a vintage 1880 drawing of the Shaffer House,  "so you can see what it looked like when it was intact."  </P> <P> "A Place Called Home" ($15) is available at Watson Drug in Orange's downtown  plaza, 116 E. Chapman Ave. It also can be purchased by writing to Phil  Brigandi, 675 S. San Jacinto, No. 2, Hemet, Calif. 92343. (Include an  additional $1.50 for postage and handling.)  </P> <P> Bilingual Cookbook: Sarah Bruck of Newport Beach and Norma Soleno-DeVaney of  Orange have co-authored what they believe is the first comprehensive bilingual  (Spanish-English) cookbook.  </P> <P> The book, "Cooking Maid Easy," is designed to help bridge the communication gap  in the kitchen that affects women who rely on Spanish-speaking housekeepers.  </P> <P> Included in the three-ring-binder cookbook are 100 recipes of "classic family  fare," ranging from Oven Fried Chicken (Pollo Frito al Horno) to Apple Pie  (Pastel de Manzana).  </P> <P> Says Soleno-DeVaney, a certified public accountant who was born in Baja  California: "No recipe has more than six steps, all dishes appeal to both  adults and children, and ingredients can easily be found in the cupboard or  local supermarket."  </P> <P> The idea for the book came from what she and Bruck say is a growing need for  bilingual domestic instruction.  </P> <P> "Because we both speak fluent Spanish, many of our friends have relied on us to  provide Spanish translations for housekeeping tasks," says Bruck, an attorney.  "And while bilingual literature for housekeeping tasks is available, two  extremely neglected areas for bilingual communications are the kitchen and the  nursery."  </P> <P> "Cooking Maid Easy" ($30) is available in fine gift and cookware stores and by  mail order.

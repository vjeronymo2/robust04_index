			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAR VOGUERS HIT RUNWAY AND DAZZLE AFICIONADOS  </P> <P> For vogue-ing fans in Los Angeles, this was the summer of our discontent. The  East Coast dance craze never found a home here. Or a house.  </P> <P> Houses are groups of voguers under the leadership of a fashion designer  usually, like "House of Chanel" or "House of Patricia Fields." In New York,  there are dozens of houses. On the runways in Paris and Milan, vogue-ing is the  ne plus ultra touch that has made the collections of Jean-Paul Gaultier,  Thierry Mugler and Patrick Kelly something to watch. Voguers spin, dip, dance,  pose, sneer, whirl down runways, wearing the latest designs.  </P> <P> Vogue-ing hit Los Angeles in early July, and, by August, there must have been  about six people who still wanted to learn how to vogue. By September, there  appeared to be two: Club owners April La Rue and Christian Farrow still  featured vogue-ing at the Love Machine.  </P> <P> Is vogue-ing dead in Los Angeles? Is Los Angeles not cool? Not fashionable?  </P> <P> "Vogue, vogue, vogue, vogue," the crowd in the VIP mezzanine of the Hollywood  Palladium was shouting at the empty stage Saturday night. Rock impresario  Malcolm McLaren had gathered up some of Europe's and New York's top voguers to  perform his new album, "Waltz Darling."  </P> <P> The event, a benefit for the Rainforest Foundation, featured the fashions of  L.A. designers Michele Lamy, Squarewear, Richard Tyler, Modern Objects, Rozae,  Body Glove and Pepito Albert. It was nearly sold out. The crowd, about 5,000,  was dying to see how the professionals do it.  </P> <P> How do they do it?  </P> <P> Well. And certainly better than anything we've seen in Los Angeles so far. Star  voguer Willy Ninja left the VIP mezzanine screaming for more. The screamers  included Madonna, Billy Idol, actors Billy Wirth and Steve Antin, the Fashion  Patrol (fashion photographers Matthew Rolston and Paul Jasmin commenting on  each and every ensemble), designers Jocelyn Winship, Diana Hammro and Jef  Huereque, restaurateur Mario Tamayo, stylist to the stars Raymond Lee, and  make-up maven Gale Hayman.  </P></p>

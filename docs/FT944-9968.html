			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Hair ornaments and the art of seduction - Jane Mulvagh suggests that exotic Chinese jewellery, with a past, could be used to add sparkle to that little black dress If a Chinese concubine from the Qing Dynasty court of the Forbidden City were to survey the social scene in Britain today, she would assume that we are also subject to strict sumptuary laws. For every woman at a party would seem to her to be dressed the same: in a little black dress. She would sympathise because depending on her rank (first, second, or lower-ranked concubine), she too was subjected to complex rulings on dress and make-up, policed by unforgiving eunuchs. Confined to modest green robes in the spring and summer, and dark brown or violet for the autumn and winter, her only means of expressing coquetry in order to catch her emperor's eye - amid thousands of rival beauties - and perchance win even one night with him, was to employ the seductive charms of hair ornaments. Made from metal, sometimes silver, the basis of the ornament was gilded by the Imperial Workshops in the Department of the Privy Purse. They are typically in the shape of an Oriental peach, basket, dragonfly, phoenix, plum blossom or orchid. To this frame the master craftsman added filigree work filled in with the feathers of the Common Kingfisher which, according to the Natural History Museum, became extinct at the beginning of this century. But the luminescent turquoise alone, radiating out against their shiny black hair, flawless white complexions and vermillion lips, was not enough in the face of fierce sexual competition at The Palace of Beauty. So trembling wire spirals were added to support lambent Peking glass beads, coral, rock crystal, pearls and tiny jade and garnet ornaments, that glittered and shuddered with promise. These ornaments, worn by the thousands of concubines, wives, actresses and ladies-in-waiting, were either pinned as single elements straight into the hair or were sewn on to black felt coiffes or headcovers. The pursuit of allure was a full-time occupation for these slaves to beauty and it was encouraged by the Empress who 'regarded us as her jewels'. In her Memoires as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Cixi at the Forbidden City, He Rong Er explains: 'We were expected to glow like jade objects whose luminescence revealed their true and intrinsic beauty and preciousness, as opposed to mere glass ornaments and gewgaws which would shine with a superficial brightness.' These kingfisher fripperies were worn widely in the 18th and 19th centuries. An impressive collection can be seen at the Palace Museum in The Forbidden City in Beijing, but most were burnt - along with books, furniture and other household artefacts - during the Cultural Revolution, despised as wicked relics of the capitalist old world. Some were kept hidden by retired courtiers or commoners who bought them as souvenirs of a city they had never been permitted to enter. Today they fetch between Pounds 150 and Pounds 700 (for a pair). Deploying some Ancien regime allure this season will add twinkle against the fashionable black backdrop. And these collector's items, whether worn or displayed on your lover's desk to remind him of your charms, may even bring you good fortune in the New Year, for when Emperor Ch'ien-lung ordered ornaments to be made for the New Year, the workshops made several which invited the wish: 'May You Have As Much Good Fortune as the Eastern Ocean Hairpin, the Glorious Spring Hairpin, the Peace in the Four Seas Hairpin, and the Happiness of Seeing Red Plum Blossom Hairpin.' Exhibition of Kingfisher Feather Hair Ornaments and Jewellery from the Qing Dynasty, Jehanne de Biolley Oriental Art, 29 Conduit Street London, W1. Tel: 071-495 4257. November 22 to December 22. Also at the exhibition will be copies of Tessa Traeger's photographs.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSTA RICA CLARIFICATION  </P> <P> On behalf of the Costa Rica National Tourist Bureau I wish to express our  gratitude for Geri Massion's article on Costa Rica ("Volcano Adds Touch of  Drama to Costa Rica Trip," May 21). I do, however, wish to clarify the  statement: "Eco Tours, an agency of the Costa Rica Tourist Board . . . "  </P> <P> The Costa Rica Tourist Board is an Institution of the Government of Costa Rica  and, as such, is responsible for tourism development and promotion of the  country. It is totally untrue that Eco Tours is an agency of the Tourist Board,  since we do not have (such an agency) and are expressly prohibited from doing  so by our government. Our responsibilities lie in dealing impartially with all  wholesalers who promote the country.  </P> <P> LAUDENCIO CASTRO  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Costa Rica National Tourist Bureau  </P></p>

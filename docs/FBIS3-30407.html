Negotiations on European Union's proposal to proclaim Mostar  an open city under the protectorate of one of the European  states lasted for several days in the UNPROFOR base in  Medjugorje, and they were attended by Owen and Stoltenberg's  special envoy.    Klaric informed General Cot yesterday that the delegation of  the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] demanded that Mostar be the  capital of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna offering that the  European Union protectorate only be in the part of the city  currently controlled by the Bosnia-Herzegovina army.    The Muslims could not accept this Croat proposal and the  negotiations broke down, Klaric informed Gen. Cot.</p>

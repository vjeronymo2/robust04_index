			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Three nations to build warship France, Italy and Britain have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop and produce a new warship, writes Daniel Green. The common new generation frigate will be the first big maritime collaboration between the three nations and aims to reduce each country's budget by sharing costs. The frigate, which should be in service within seven years, is intended to replace the Royal Navy's Type 42 air-defence destroyers.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAPER RECYCLING IN NEWPORT BEACH  </P> <P> Most all Newport residents put out their old newspapers regularly for city  collection and recycling. All proceeds go to the city.  </P> <P> If the city would dedicate the profits realized from that collection to the  purchase of different colored trash bags and distribute them free to all  residents for the separation of waste glass, aluminum and tin cans, Newport  Beach would find the residents putting out twice the amount of paper and  cooperating fully with environmental aims and goals -- all with larger net cash  returns to the city treasury.  </P> <P> HENRY BURKE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

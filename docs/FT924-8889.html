			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Economics: Anxious markets look to No 11 BRITAIN is back in the news with financial markets anxiously awaiting Thursday when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will produce his Autumn Statement and a package of measures to stimulate the economy against an increasingly gloomy international background.

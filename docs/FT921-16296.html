			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Cookery: Carrots to cleanse one's conscience THE DAY of reckoning is nigh, I mean the 12th day of Christmas when most of us feel a little fat and queasy. This is the season when health farms and spas rake in the bookings. Half the population of France will be murmuring 'mon pauvre petit foie' while on the British side of the channel the sales of Alka Seltzer and Rennies must reach a peak. I love the architecture of Bath, I enjoyed L'Annee Derniere a Marienbad, and I once had a a strange encounter with a News of the World type of vicar in a little known Scottish spa, but the idea of actually taking the waters, like visiting a health farm, jogging and pumping iron, is alien to me. I prefer the notion of a brief cleansing spell of meals majoring on carrots, lettuce and spring water taken in the privacy of my own home. Carrots and spring water sound horribly abstemious, and I am sure they could prove a penance, but there is no reason why their consumption should not be pleasurable. Health considerations and pretty designer labels apart, bottled water usually tastes better than tap, which, in my area, seems to be dosed with Olympic swimming pool-quantities of chlorine. As for the carrot, it may be one of our commonest and cheapest vegetables but it is also one of the best gastronomically at this time of year - colourful, richly flavoured and sweet - and of course full of healthy virtues (bursting with fibre and vitamins A C and E). The carrot dish that sounds ideally suited for serving now in this low-key New Year resolutions week is Carottes a la Vichy. The spa kitchen title suggests an austere little recipe designed to cleanse, purify and tone the body, mind and spirit, and the method does indeed call for cooking the carrots in spring water. But there is more to it than that. A king size nugget of butter and a spoonful of sugar also go into the pot, and it is their presence, reduced to a syrupy glaze at the end, that give the dish its delectable character. If you are serious about making up a little for extravagant eating over Christmas you would do better to tuck into the no-fat crunch of a grated carrot salad simply dressed with the juice of an orange and a pinch of zest. As it happens I relish a plain salad like this but if it strikes you as too rabbit food for words, try adding a grating of ginger and a scattering of seedless white grapes, or a bulb of Florentine fennel cut into slivers, or a handful of fresh chopped herbs. A mixture of mint, lemon thyme and parsley is good. Add wild rice, burgul or couscous for a more substantial bite, or offer something bready on the side. Good choices for non weight watchers might be hoummus with strips of hot pitta bread, rounds of tapenade-topped ciabatta, and wholemeal toast spread with crushed sardines. Also to be recommended is a hot carrot puree soup, particularly if it is spiked with orange and bay or elusively-scented cardamom. But my favourite carrot dish of the moment, one that exudes a hint of opulence rather than budget-beating penance, is a Turkish-inspired pilav. Do not expect to lose weight by eating it. CARROT AND CARDAMOM PILAV (serves 5-6) This is one of those relatively rare dishes made without meat that makes me think, briefly at any rate, that I would be happy to stop being a carnivore. Having said that, I must admit that it is not only worth eating as a dish in its own right, but it also makes an unusually good accompaniment to roast pheasant, guinea fowl and quail, in which case the quantities given here will serve many more people, of course. 1 lb carrots, scraped and coarsely grated;  3/4 lb rice, thoroughly rinsed under a cold running tap to wash away some of the starch; the seeds from 15 cardamom pods, crushed with pestle and mortar; 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 4 shallots, chopped; the finely grated zest of 2 oranges; 2 rounded teaspoons honey; 1 1/4 pt good stock; 3-4 oz split and well toasted almonds. Warm the oil in a large flameproof casserole and soften the shallots for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the crushed cardamom and the well drained rice and cook gently for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots, orange zest and a good grinding of black pepper and stir continuously over medium-low heat for two minutes to warm the carrots and anoint them with fat. Add the honey, hot stock and a good pinch of salt. Stir to mix and bring quickly to the boil. Cover tightly and simmer over the lowest possible flame for 12 minutes or until the rice is cooked to your liking. Drive off surplus liquid at the end if the pilav is sloppy, or moisten with a splash of hot stock enriched with an extra spoonful of oil if the mixture is too dry. Check seasoning, stir in the well-toasted nuts and serve with a salad on the side. Chicory and orange go particularly well - and tidily use up the flesh of the fruit whose zest has gone into the pilav.</p>

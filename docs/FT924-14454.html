			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Ultra-violet light shines on bacteria Well-proven ultra-violet technology is being put to a new use by a UK company in a range of water disinfection systems which kill more than 99.9 per cent of micro-organisms without using chemicals. The system, developed by Dorking-based Ultraviolet Technology, generates UV light at 254 nanometres to provide the optimum 'kill rate', and is designed so that unabsorbed UV light bounces back into the water to ensure maximum disinfection. The system is unique in using Teflon tubes which offer a number of advantages over quartz equivalents that are brittle and prone to fouling. Disinfection takes from three to five seconds, compared with 20-25 minutes for chlorine. According to the company, the savings on chemical purchases can cover the installation cost within one to two years. Ultraviolet Technology: UK, 0306 712636.</p>

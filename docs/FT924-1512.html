			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Money Markets: French rate rise FRANCE'S national banks raised their main lending rates yesterday, amid worsening sentiment towards the French franc on financial markets, writes James Blitz. The leading state-owned banks said they were increasing French base lending rates to 10 per cent from 9.45 per cent. The move is effective from today, and came in the wake of the recent sharp rises in money market rates. In the German cash market, call money eased slightly to around 8.95 per cent as market activity normalised in the wake of the Bundesbank's securities repurchase tender. However, sentiment persists that the Bundesbank is unlikely to reduce its official rates until well into the spring, a factor which will continue to keep pressure on the French franc high. The rise in French base rates followed this week's rise in cash market rates, which commercial banks have found incompatible with the rate structure in the retail sector. French three-month money climbed again yesterday, to 11 1/2 per cent from a previous close of 11 3/8 per cent. French franc futures fell back again: the March contract was down 15 basis points at a close of 90.40. Miss Joanne Perez, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said the decision to lift base rates reflected general disappointment in France's banking sector that there was no reduction in German official rates last week. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, suggested that French monetary policy may have to be tightened even further today. She believes that the Bank of France will be forced to raise the rate in the 5 to 10-day lending window today in order to support the franc. One reason for this is that French call money, which closed yesterday at around 9 15/16 per cent, is virtually touching the current 5 to 10-day lending rate of 10 per cent. Miss Cottrell also said that the Bundesbank has sent strong signals in recent weeks that it will be prepared to defend the franc only if the French central bank plays by the rules of the European exchange rate mechanism. 'The message being sent to the French is that if they want the Bundesbank to come into the market and intervene to support the franc, they must first show a willingness to raise rates,' she said.</p>

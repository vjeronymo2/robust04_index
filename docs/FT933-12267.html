			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Home is the sailor, right by the sea - A selection of berths on land for those who like to mess about in boats FOR THOSE whose passion is messing about in boats, and have the money, buying a house or flat close to their vessel can make good sense. But avoid marinas if you are a sailor who prefers to be alone. For the clubby, however, Moriconium Quay, a new development around a yacht basin at Poole, Dorset - which Savills is marketing - could be ideal. The first stage sold quickly and the second-stage apartments come to market in September (although some have gone already). Prices are Pounds 129,000 or Pounds 135,000 for 125-year leaseholds but, unlike the houses in the first stage, do not include berths. These (also leasehold) cost Pounds 35,000 for a boat of 11 metres (36ft) or Pounds 40,000 for 13 metres (42.5ft), which is good value when spread over several years. A similar project in Dorset is Priory Quay at Christchurch, near Bournemouth; there are two units left at Pounds 235,000 - but these do include a berth (with an annual service charge of around Pounds 800). Black Horse is selling them on behalf of the developer, Portman Homes. At Sandbanks, overlooking Poole harbour, the two-year-old Beach House has an unusual design and a private beach. Three agents (Fox, Norris &amp; Owen, and Black Horse - Canford Cliffs office) offer it at Pounds 495,000. In Sussex, Jackson-Stops at Chichester is asking Pounds 385,000 for Moonrakers, a 1934 house at Bosham, on Chichester harbour, with slipway and jetty. At Brighton Marina, Fox, in Haywards Heath, is selling units at Roedean House for Pounds 375,000. This is new on the market and all buyers get a 40ft mooring for Pounds 1,224 a year - which they must pay even if they do not keep a boat. If a marina is too communal, Bar House on the Helford river in Cornwall is the antithesis. The seven-bedroomed property, which includes a small beach and boathouse with slipway, once belonged to Claude Worth, a pioneer of modern small-boat cruising who wrote Yacht Cruising (1910) and Yacht Navigation and Voyaging (1927). Jackson-Stops in Exeter is seeking Pounds 600,000-plus. Another Cornish property with boathouse and slipway is at Restronguet Point on the Fal estuary. Called The Boathouse, it is priced at Pounds 420,000 from Miller. Five houses along, Carrick Cottage is Pounds 20,000 cheaper; it has a slipway but no boathouse. A further Boat House (with slipway) is available in the village of Portloe for around Pounds 270,000, while 3 Mulberry Quay, on the inner harbour of Falmouth, offers use of the private quay and dinghy davit; price: Pounds 165,000. Both are from Miller. In south Devon, Stratton Creber is selling the white-painted Rock Cottage in Newton Ferrers; it has a garden with 120ft frontage to the Yealm estuary and steps down to the foreshore, where the dinghy can be beached. Price: Pounds 175,000. Gales can be a problem around the south coast, of course, but they are not usually a worry on canals. At Bradford on Avon, eight miles from Bath, Logis Homes has developed St Katherine's Quay to offer a base on the Kennet and Avon canal for Pounds 49,950 to Pounds 129,950 (through Gratton Palmer Snell). At Braunston, near Daventry in Northamptonshire, Stepnells is developing Brindley Quays. The basin has plenty of space for berthing narrow boats (around Pounds 1,200 a year for a typical 50-footer) while a 1792 dry dock remains in use. Houses will be ready later in the year for Pounds 129,750 (through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley). Somewhere between canalside and seaside is the Georgian Red House on a tributary of the river Great Ouse at Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire. This red-brick property has many bedrooms, a boathouse and a riverside studio. Price: Pounds 245,000 (from Carter Jonas). The Landmark Trust, meanwhile, is asking Pounds 1.25m for The Limes, an imposing house built in 1720 and overlooking the Thames from Mortlake High Street, west London. Turner painted the house twice in 1827; both pictures are in the US. The trust bought the property as an investment and has refurbished it. It now wants to find a sympathetic buyer in order to raise money for saving other buildings. Three agents are handling the sale: DTZ Debenham Thorpe, Hamptons and Martin Campbell.

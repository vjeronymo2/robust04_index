			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The talks between British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Prague today and yesterday  have shown the closeness of opinion that exists between the  Czech Republic and Great Britain, Hurd told a press conference  today at the end of his meeting with Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec.    Both countries were sharing in the unification of Europe, he  emphasized -- in the ensuring of security, in political dialogue  and in the development of trade. The Czech Republic was an  important part of this process, Hurd said. As far as its  journey to the "European family" was concerned, the Czech  Republic was cooperating with its neighbors, but when it came to  membership of NATO and the European Union, it was proceeding  individually, he added.    Hurd said that his talks with Zieleniec and Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus has shown that the two countries had similar  opinions on the future development and shape of the European  Union. Both of them believed in free trade leading to improved  living standards, and in the identity of nation states, not in  the subjugation of national identities to some sort of "European  superstate."    There had been progress in trade between the Czech Republic  and Britain, Hurd said, but "it was not enough." He believed  that British trade and investments in the Czech Republic had to  be supported.    Zieleniec praised Britain's role in promoting the  integration  of Central Europe into the European Union, and above all Hurd's  personal efforts. There had been much discussion between him  and Hurd of the significance of free trade in European  integration, Zieleniec said. They had agreed that the  liberalization of world trade was valuable in itself, and that  new protectionism could not be camouflaged with fictions about  social dumping and so on.    Zieleniec also expressed his pleasure at the British support  of Czech membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD). "For us becoming part of an organization  which unites the developed countries of the West is of not only  practical, but also symbolic significance," Zieleniec said.</p>

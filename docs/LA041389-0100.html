			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Industry spewed at least 22.5 billion pounds of toxic and cancer-causing  chemicals into the nation's air, land and water in 1987, the government said in  an unprecedented report that officials called "startling." In releasing the  first nationwide summary of toxic emissions, a top Environmental Protection  Agency official said the enormous amount of chemicals released was  "unacceptably high" and that the report underlined the need for industry to  reduce toxic pollution. Worse, EPA officials said the figure of 22.5 billion  pounds undoubtedly underestimates the actual amount of toxic materials  released, since the report does not cover all chemicals nor does it include  emissions from smaller companies and certain industries. The EPA report is the  compilation of more than 75,000 annual toxic release disclosure forms filed  with the government by about 17,500 factories and industrial facilities across  the nation. The reports were required under the "community right-to-know"  provisions of the 1986 Superfund reauthorization law.  </P></p>

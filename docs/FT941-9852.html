			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / IMF support for Jordan hangs on controversial tax reform vote Jordan's government this weekend embarks on a final attempt to implement a controversial sales tax after more than a year of postponements. The tax is the last move in the kingdom's economic restructuring programme, sponsored by the International Monetary Fund. Its implementation is essential for continued IMF support and further debt-rescheduling talks with the country's creditors. The tax, supposed to be a first step towards full value added tax, aims to spread the burden of indirect taxes to make way for an eventual reduction in the kingdom's high custom tariffs and protectionism. For the moment though, it is to replace and expand the current consumption tax. The draft, to be presented today to parliament, has three rates: 10 per cent for most goods, 20 per cent for luxury items, and zero for food and medicine. This will supplant a cumbersome eleven-rate consumption tax which is levied on a limited list of consumer goods. The government is trying to sell the reform as a 'neutral' tax which will raise neither prices nor government revenues. But the private sector is not convinced. Having successfully lobbied for its postponement throughout 1993, it is appealing to parliament to block the sales tax altogether. One MP, Mrs Toujan Feisal, had already called on the public to take to the streets in opposition to the tax. Local businessmen say they are already taxed heavily and the implementation of a sales tax will hinder economic growth. The Chambers of Industry and Commerce are pushing hard for a reduction in the general rate to 5 per cent among other things. 'My concern is that the tax will increase the burden on the citizens and have a negative effect on the economy as a whole,' argues Mr Khaldum Abu Hassan of the Amman Chamber of Industry. However, Mr Sami Gammoh, the finance minister, says the reform is necessary to make Jordan more self-dependent. 'The whole philosophy of the sales tax is that a wider base will allow government revenues to grow as the economy grows,' he says. Jordan suffers from a budget deficit of 13 per cent of gross domestic product, or a projected JD465m for 1994, which is mostly covered by foreign aid. A prime objective of the IMF reform programme is to reduce this to less than 3 per cent of GDP. The government is nervous that a rejection of the sales tax would send the wrong signal to the kingdom's creditors. Jordan's external debt of Dollars 6.8bn (Pounds 4.65bn) has one of the highest foreign debt-to-GDP ratios in the world (129 per cent) and it is essential for the government to push the tax through if it is to receive further assistance to support its fragile economy. The sales tax is the first of a number of economic reforms on the government's agenda this year. The foreign investment law is also due to be amended, or least made more transparent, in the next few months. This will help facilitate non-Arab investment in the Amman stock exchange. There are also plans to press on with privatisation. The national airline Royal Jordanian is expected to announce this year a timetable for its sale. The reform plans come amid the prospect of peace in the region and eventual collaboration with a Palestinian entity and Israel. A recent World Bank report concluded that Jordan would lose out unless it embarked on a concerted effort of reform to reduce bureaucracy, loosen trade regulations, and improve the climate for investment. But the sales-tax saga demonstrates that such reforms will not be easy to push through.</p>

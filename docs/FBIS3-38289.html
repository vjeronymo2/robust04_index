The signing  ceremony which took place in the NATO Council room was attended  by NATO Assistant Secretary General Amedeo de Franchis and by  the permanent representatives to the North Atlantic Council of  the 16 member countries.    Due to this political act, which succeeds the acceptance of  the invitation to the Partnership for Peace expressed by  Romanian President Ion Iliescu in a statement on January 11,  Romania has become officially the first country to be engaged in  the new cooperation pattern with the NATO.    At the signing ceremony, Amedeo de Franchis and Teodor  Melescanu read out brief speeches stressing the political  significance of the moment and expressing hope that the  Partnership for Peace would contribute to the consolidation of  the security and stability in whole Europe. Romanian Foreign  Minister Melescanu underlined that Romania committed itself with  all faith and responsibility to the new relation with NATO and  with the NATO member countries, a relation considered by Romania  as a preliminary and preparatory stage to Romania's future  membership to NATO's political and military structures.    Previous to the signing ceremony, the Romanian minister of  foreign affairs had an interview with Amedeo de Franchis and met  also with the permanent representatives to the North Atlantic  Council of the 16 NATO member countries.    The NATO Assistant Secretary General Amedeo de Franchis  saluted the "historic moment" when Romania became the first  "cooperation partner" of the alliance, through the signing the  framework document of the Partnership for Peace.    In a speech on Wednesday in Brussels, in the presence of  Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, the NATO assistant  secretary general praised the courage and decision proven by the  Romanian people in his fight for liberty. Today, Romania  experiences a difficult process of political and economic reform  in the interior but, at the same time, it works for the creation  of new security relations in the exterior, said Amedeo de  Franchis.</p>

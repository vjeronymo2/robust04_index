			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herta Scharsach: "The Economy Is Picking Up"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Following export successes during the  first quarter and rising employment, the reviving economy now  finally seems to have an effect on tax revenues: During the  first five months of 1994 gross revenues rose by 10.6 percent to  212.1 billion schillings. After transfers to provinces and  localities, and spending, the federal government was left with  139.9 billion schillings, which is 22.4 percent more than during  the same quarter in 1993.    This "record increase" in revenues is, however, deceptive:  It only came about because the dates on which taxes are due  were shifted from June to May and because deductible import  turnover tax soared as a result of of rising imports. However,  according to financial experts, now "prospects are better that  we will get closer to the forecasts." Thus, this year tax  losses will probably be lower than the feared 5 billion  shillings. "It is at least true that we are not losing any  more, but the improvement is weak," Wifo [Economic Research  Institute] tax expert Gerhard Lehner says.  <H5>  Boom in Imports </H5>   In the wake of tax reform, payroll tax revenues were rather  weak with 52.5 billion schillings (minus 6.1 percent); on the  other hand, value-added tax revenues increased by 13.4 percent,  to 80.3 billion schillings. An Austrian buying spree is  indicated by imports, which increased by 9.5 percent to 148.2  billion schillings during the first quarter. However, in view  of the advance burdens associated with potential EU membership,  in particular for agriculture, an "explosion" of the net deficit  (80.7 billion schillings) can be prevented only if the federal  government receives the planned billions in revenues from  various sales (such as the federal share in Vienna airport, the  Creditanstalt bank or Bank Austria).    Unemployment remains high (6 percent of 4.5 percent  according  to the seasonally adjusted OECD model). The OECD is discussing  this problem in Paris today. According to a Wifo study, the  economy would have to grow by 2 percent to maintain the current  number of jobs.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Letter: DTI changes that raise hopes of greater support for exporters (1) Sir, The professional exporting community welcomes Mr Michael Heseltine's decision to restore the title president of the board of trade (Observer, April 21). For far too long in recent history the 'trade' element of the Department of Trade and Industry has been treated as the Cinderella sector. International trade is vital to the UK's economy. Unless we reverse the current disastrous balance of payments deficit, sterling's weakness and high interest rates will persist indefinitely. We hope that the new president's clearly expressed ideas on appropriate levels of government support will assist Britain's hardworking (and often unsung) exporters to improve on our 8 per cent share of world trade. To achieve this he will have to cut a broad swathe through the ideological jungle of myopia Treasuriensis. Perhaps this is an ideal job for Tarzan? Ian J Campbell, director general, The Institute of Export, Export House, 64 Clifton Street, London EC2A 4HB</p>

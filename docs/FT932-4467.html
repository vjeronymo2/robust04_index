			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Perhaps television is growing up. Until recently if you had suggested to those who run BBC2's access slot Open Space that the Duke of Westminster should have the platform you could have expected a chant of 'Plutocrats - Out] Out] Out]' to echo around Shepherd's Bush. Yet here he is at 7.40 with 30 minutes to tell the world about 'The Last Straw'. The programme builds on a report by the duke called 'The Problems In Rural Areas', it seems that one farm in five loses money, each day 13 farmers give up the job, and every week four commit suicide. If you really feel that Britain's main problem is crime and punishment you are in luck: we are offered several programmes every day on the subject. Just Desserts (8.10 BBC2) asks whether there is a cure for crime and traces the history of punishment. What fun. Inside Story (9.30 BBC1) is concerned with 'Children Who Kill'. How jolly. There are two worthwhile repeats. The Fall Of Squirrel Nutkin (8.30 C4) investigates the decline of the red squirrel. The Insurance Man (9.00 BBC2) is Alan Bennett's drama about Franz Kafka and government by bureaucracy.</p>

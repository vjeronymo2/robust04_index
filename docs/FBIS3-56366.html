I want to express my opinion that this  visit has been extremely successful. It has demonstrated once  again that we must indeed be partners and must deepen that  partnership. We must indeed live together on this small planet  and try to ensure peace and security, not only in our two  countries but throughout the world.    I thank you, Mr. President, for taking advantage of the  opportunity and for getting to know the people of Russia, the  people of Moscow--in the streets, in shops, at Ostankino, and in  other places--and for seeing for yourself that the people want  reform and for seeing that the people want freedom and democracy.    I think that you have obtained a better knowledge of the  people of Russia during the visit, and the people of Russia now  have a better idea of the President of the United States of  America.    I want to wish you bon voyage on your return journey,  happiness to your families, and prosperity to America and the  American people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told Friday  Ukrainian journalists that from the end of May US ballistic  missiles would not be targeted at the republic. He said he  obtained the information from U.S. officials.    Kravchuk said that for its part, Ukraine would also observe  the three-partite statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the  United States and Russia and continue deactivation of the  strategic missiles situated on its territory.    Kravchuk said that all 46 SS-24 strategic missiles have been  deactivated in Ukraine. All in all, there are 176 strategic  missiles on the territory of the republic.    Kravchuk said that earlier Ukrainian warheads "were targeted  at the United States, but we did not control them".    According to statements by the republic's leaders, Ukraine  is  unable technically to change the flight tasks for the missiles  being deployed by Russia. But they could be launched from the  territory of Ukraine only with consent of the republic's  president.    According to US Ambassador in Kiev, William Green Miller,  Ukrainian officials confirmed to him that all strategic missiles  on the republic's territory are not targeted at the United  States.</p>

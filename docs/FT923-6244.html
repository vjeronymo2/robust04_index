			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Australian budget gives cold comfort to equities - A weak economic recovery and international trade fears have depressed sentiment Hopes of a budget-led rally in Australian shares have been disappointed this week as the Australian Stock Exchange All Ordinaries Index once again slipped back towards 1,500. For investors, it was a disappointing response to the Labor government's ninth budget, delivered on August 18, which outlined plans to pump an ADollars 4.6bn (USDollars 3.3bn) stimulus into the economy over the next two years. Instead of rising on the news, the All Ordinaries fell from 1,549 ruling immediately before the announcement to a 14-month low of 1,517.3 by last night, suggesting the proposed spending was fully reflected in pre-budget share prices. The nervousness in the market reflects concern over Australia's weak recovery from recession, together with the effects of bad economic news in the US, the UK and Japan, which tend to set the tone for the Australian market. Sentiment has also been depressed by the apparently increasing risk of failure in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which could seriously damage Australia's important rural industries. These factors have combined to cut short three promising rallies over the last 12 months, culminating in the last peak in May, when the All Ordinaries climbed to within a few points of the psychologically important 1,700 barrier. Many brokers continue to believe that substantial upside potential exists in the market, given that the index remains some 34 per cent below its high of 2,300, reached just before the global stock markets crash in October 1987. However, much will depend on the current results season, when investors will be looking for signs of an end to the recessionary squeeze on profits which caused a flood of red ink in the previous two results periods. Early indications have been encouraging. Mining companies such as Placer Pacific and Newcrest have reported improved earnings, Alcan Australia, the aluminium group, said it had reduced losses, and Coca-Cola Amatil, the soft drinks and food manufacturer, raised net profits by a solid 19 per cent. Most attention, however, will be on the results of bigger companies which suffered reverses at this stage last year. These include Brambles and TNT, the transport groups, CRA, Western Mining and other miners, Broken Hill Proprietary, the mining, energy and steel group, Pacific Dunlop, the diversified industrial concern, CSR, the sugar and building products group, Burns Philp, the diversified food producer and trader, and Foster's, the world's fourth largest brewer. In particular, the market will be looking closely at the results of the four quoted banks, all of which reported lower profits last year. Investors will be hoping for signs of an end to the series of property writedowns which have dogged the banks since 1990. Over the longer term, the market will be watching for evidence that the substantial stimulus administered to the economy by the government is helping to expand the economy in line with the relatively conservative budget forecast of 3 per cent over the 12 months to next July. Growth in gross domestic product was a disappointing 0.6 per cent in the three months to the end of March, but most of the indicators are now pointing in the right direction, and most economists believe that activity picked up further in the quarter to the end of June. The rural sector will also benefit from the continued decline of the Australian dollar, which fell to nearly 70 US cents earlier this week before being pushed back above 71 cents by intervention from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Nevertheless, confidence remains in short supply, and is likely to be further weakened if the All Ordinaries Index slips below 1,500 in the coming weeks. As in most of the previous 12 months, Australia remains a market for the brave.</p>

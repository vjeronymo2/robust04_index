			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Observer: Unsafe seats Businessmen beware. Being chairman of a big quango is one way to collect a knighthood. But it can also damage your reputation if the quango misbehaves. Is the risk worth taking? Both the Welsh Development Agency and the West Midlands Regional Health Authority are seeking new figureheads after government watchdogs reprimanded them for sloppy financial behaviour. The agency's chairman, Gwyn Jones, is hanging on until a successor is found, but Sir James Ackers has resigned after 10 years as chairman of the country's largest regional health authority following growing disquiet about its money management. Ackers's decision to quit is a cautionary tale for other business folk. Perhaps he should have spent more time keeping an eye on the family truck-rental business, a casualty of the recession, than collecting his various quangoships. At various times he has been on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the National Economic Development Council, the National Training Task Force, and the Committee of Inquiry into Civil Service Pay, not to mention the body representing regional health chairmen, which he chaired. A diehard Tory, he is the sort of businessman that the government has come to rely upon in its efforts to make the public sector more efficient. Alas, the fact that he has been temporarily replaced by Sir Donald Wilson, a 70-year-old Cheshire farmer already heading the Mersey Health Authority, suggests ministers are now finding top-flight younger businessmen hard to attract.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BITES : RAT DEATHS FUEL PEPPER FEARS!  </P> <P> Lab rats die of respiratory failure if fed large enough doses of Louisiana hot  sauce, reports the scientific journal Toxicon. The lethal dose works out to  half a cup of sauce per 10 pounds of body weight, so play it safe, OK? If you  weigh 140 pounds, don't drink more than a quart and a half of straight Tabasco  at one sitting.  </P> <P> You should probably stay away from those chug-a-lug contests altogether. Note,  however, that these figures are for drinking hot sauce. It would take less --  maybe as little as four cups of Tabasco -- to kill a 140-pound individual if it  was injected with a hypodermic needle. If anybody suggests "shooting up a quart  of red" . . . Just Say No.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unloaded Garlic  </P> <P> Dr. Kotaro Sakai, a Japanese soil researcher, has patented a way of pickling  garlic said to leave all the flavor while preventing "garlic breath." The Wall  Street Journal reports that a company in Strausstown, Penn., markets Dr. Sakai  Garlic made according to his recipe at $1.50 per two-bulb package. There is  debate, however, as to how effective the pickling process is, both from the  flavor and the breath angles.  </P> <P> But here's one question nobody's been asking: How do we know odorless garlic is  any good against vampires? Do we want to wake up some night to the sound of  scratching at our windowpanes and reach for a clove of garlic, only to find  it's unloaded?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sparkling Moo  </P> <P> Ranjit S. Kadan, an Agriculture Department food researcher, claims to have  perfected carbonated milk. "One reason people don't like milk," he says, "is  that it has a very bland taste and the milk protein coats your tongue and  leaves a blah taste." His solution involves adding not only the perky  refreshment of bubbles but the allure of fruit flavors to make a sort of canned  soda. A year from now, he predicts, carbonated milk could be in the markets on  the same shelves as Coke and Pepsi.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sprays to Savor  </P> <P> Now there are flavored Pam-type frying pan sprays. Creative's Naturally Light  sprays, which contain only 6% saturated fat (as against 52% for rendered beef  tallow), come in the following flavors: Real Butter Flavor with canola oil,  Real Garlic with olive oil, and Canola with canola oil, which might be going  too far.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Paws That Refresh  </P> <P> Coca-Cola has been called the American vin de pays, and many people cook with  it just as if it were wine -- there are Coke-spiked recipes for gingerbread,  sweet and sour cabbage, meatloaf and so on. Add one more to the list. From  Taiwan comes a recipe for Fried Frog Legs with Sweet Bean Paste that includes a  teaspoon of Coke per pair of legs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frozen Breakfast News  </P> <P> Last year sales of frozen waffles were up 16% by tonnage. This year Quaker Oats  is trying out a microwavable breakfast in New England; Aunt Jemima Lite  Breakfast consists of four lite pancakes and two lite sausage links.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Highland Cookie News  </P> <P> Walkers Bakery of Aberlour-on-Spey, Scotland, just about redefines the concept  of hitting all the bases with its two new products: a 24 1/2-ounce gift tin of  mixed cookies commemorating the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth's mother, and  a line of certified kosher shortbread.

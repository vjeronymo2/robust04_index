			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Luis Castillejos] </F>   [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said Central America will  present joint proposals at the Fourth Ibero-American summit.  The proposals will deal with sustained development, ecological  defense, and the review of the Cuban and Haitian cases.    The Central American countries "are taking a joint proposal  on the urgent need to form an alliance for sustained development  in the region and ecological defense, which we hope the rest of  the Ibero-American nations will join," De Leon Carpio said.    The president traveled to San Jose, Costa Rica, at 1430  [2030  GMT] to meet with his Central American counterparts to adopt a  united position on these topics. De Leon expressed optimism  about the positive results of the Ibero-American Summit to be  held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June.    He added that the meeting of government leaders from Belize,  Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and  Panama, which begins today and ends tomorrow in San Jose, has  the primary objective of establishing a "common front" for the  defense of the region's interests.    Guatemalan Foreign Ministry sources told NOTIMEX that during  the Cartagena summit the presidents will sign a document on the  importance that greater trade integration has for the  hemisphere's economies. A diplomat indicated that during the  Ibero-American Summit the Central American presidents want to  meet with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Venezuelan  President Rafael Caldera to discuss a free trade agreement  between those two countries and Central America. [passage  omitted]    De Leon also said the Central American presidents will  propose the review of the current crises in Haiti and Cuba. The  Guatemalan president said that in Cuba's case, the island's  return to the OAS must be conditioned on respect for human  rights.    The president expressed concerned over the Haitian  situation,  indicating that the current economic blockade has been  insufficient to restore a democratic regime and that, in  addition, the threat of a military invasion is looming over  Haiti. The violence in the Haitian capital due to the  international sanctions against General Raoul Cedras' regime  "greatly worries us, and we must seek effective solutions," De  Leon added.</p>

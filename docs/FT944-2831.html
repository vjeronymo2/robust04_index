			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / British Gas may cut shop staff pay British Gas yesterday warned of possible pay cuts for staff in high-street showrooms as part of its programme to improve competitiveness, Robert Corzine writes. A letter to showroom staff said that pay levels in British Gas shops were well above those for similar retailers, such as Comet and Rumbelows. The letter was sent just weeks after the company announced a controversial 75 per cent rise for Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive. Earlier this year British Gas announced a big closure programme among its high-street shops, which form one of the least profitable parts of its operations.</p>

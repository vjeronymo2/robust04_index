			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unfair view of who was attacking the Somalis Sir, Your headline, 'Many killed in US attack on Somalis' (September 10) follows the rest of the English press in yet another slur against the US. Had a Royal Air Force helicopter been involved, would the headline refer to a 'UK attack' on Somalis? Perhaps in that case you would be more inclined to an even-handed 'UN attack' or heroic 'UK rescue of UN troops'. Thomas B Siebens, 2 Brunswick Gardens, London W8 4AJ</p>

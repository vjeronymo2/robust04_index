			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Kevin Maxwell wins court order MR KEVIN MAXWELL, faced with an income-tax demand which he says he is unable to meet, was yesterday granted an interim High Court order that temporarily stops creditors bringing civil proceedings against him. At a private hearing before a Chancery Court registrar, Mr Maxwell, son of the late Robert Maxwell, won an order under Section 252 of the 1986 Insolvency Act allowing him time to seek an 'individual voluntary arrangement' with his creditors. Mr George Auger, of accountants Stoy Hayward, was appointed to act as his nominee in seeking the arrangement. The order 'stays' all existing or pending civil proceedings against Mr Maxwell for 14 days to allow him to prepare voluntary settlement proposals for consideration by his nominee.</p>

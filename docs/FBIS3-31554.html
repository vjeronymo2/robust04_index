			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Presidency member Ejup Ganic by </F> Midhat Kulender in the studio -- live]    [Text] [Kulender] Mr. Ganic, we heard the report from the  news conference. It is now 2221, has there been anything new,  any new reports since the news conference this evening?    [Ganic] No. The fact is that the task has not been carried  out the way the NATO ultimatum demanded. UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] troops are still trying to get the job done,  but I personally believe they are far from achieving the  objective. The task has, therefore, not been achieved in  accordance with the NATO declaration.    [Kulender] Our state has fulfilled all conditions contained  in the NATO declaration?    [Ganic] Of course. I would like to tell the listeners that  many traps were set for our state in the process of the adoption  and implementation of the declaration. The day NATO held their  session in Brussels an urgent meeting of military  representatives was convened at the airport here in Sarajevo  under great pressure from the Belgrade regime. The Serb side  offered an ostensibly extremely flexible agreement on the  withdrawal of weapons, but an overly vague, imprecise agreement.  They insisted that the agreement be signed by 1500 at the  latest.    President Izetbegovic and I were at the Presidency and we  withdrew our delegation for consultations and gave them  instructions. We quickly saw through the game. The Belgrade  regime's objective was that a report be promptly sent to  Brussels from the meeting at Sarajevo airport saying that an  agreement had been achieved on some withdrawal or other of the  heavy weaponry so that NATO would not pass a specific  resolution, that is, an ultimatum. We avoided that first trap.    After the declaration was passed, UNPROFOR, that is those  who  in a certain way control UNPROFOR, insisted that several  commissions and subcommissions be formed to implement the NATO  declaration and the ultimatum. President Izetbegovic then formed  a crisis headquarters whose members are known -- I am the head  of the crisis headquarters -- and whose task was to cooperate  with UNPROFOR and find a way to avoid all traps set in order to  prevent the implementation of the declaration.    What was the aggressor's aim and, I must say, the aim of  some  states who have their troops within UNPROFOR forces? Their aim  was to drag us into some negotiations, futile negotiations at  the airport, into signing several kinds of agreements in order  to make it look -- when the ultimatum deadline expires -- as if  we could not agree with the Serb side on the positions, on the  details, and on the timing of the withdrawal and make it look  like both sides were to blame for the failure to implement the  resolution.    We adopted a very clear strategy. We said that we understood  the NATO declaration perfectly well; we wish to maintain contact  with UNPROFOR on a strictly written basis -- we shall go on  meeting but, prior to each meeting, we insist that we have  written material, questions in writing, and that everything be  meticulously documented. This used to drive them insane, but it  helped resolve all the problems between us and UNPROFOR. It  helped us observe the resolution, and we left it up to them to  haggle with the Serb side.    Naturally, they failed to accomplish anything with the Serb  side over this eight-day period. They have been working on the  implementation of the NATO declaration for only two days, which  is why this whole crisis broke out. UNPROFOR made a mistake, a  serious blunder -- this is yet to be elucidated -- because it  used the NATO declaration, the NATO ultimatum, as working  material for negotiations with the Serb side. In other words,  they fell into the trap set by Belgrade's diplomacy, which has  been pulling the strings all along. This was the result --  UNPROFOR's people scattered all over the hills over the past two  days discovering weapons and, in a way, trying to collect what  could be collected and, to a certain extent, I feel that General  Rose -- who has a brilliant resume -- is slowly sinking into the  same quagmire and making the same mistakes as his predecessors.  The outcome of all this, and this was confirmed by Mr. Akashi  who said that 20 percent of the weapons are not under control,  is that the approximate locations are known but the percentage  of uncontrolled weapons is much higher. Therefore, the NATO  resolution has not been respected by the aggressor.    We did our job professionally and consistently, and this is  a  diplomatic victory for us. The Western countries should now  decide whether they wish to keep their promises and, of course,  whether they wish to base their future policies on the strength  of their promises.    [Kulender] The Russian troops that are supposed to be part  of  the UN force arrived in Pale this evening.    [Ganic] Yes, they have arrived. I believe, you know, the  United Nations rallies most of the world. The Russian troops  are part of the UN force, we shall keep that in mind. Russia  did not take part, it did not cooperate, it did not even assist  in drawing up this NATO declaration. Naturally, this caused a  certain degree of wariness, not only here in Bosnia but in the  democratic world at large. However, these troops are under Gen.  Rose's command and their deployment will compensate for the  expectations of the Pale regime [as heard].</p>

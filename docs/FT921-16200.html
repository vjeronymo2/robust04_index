			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Swiss reopen embassy THE SWISS embassy in Tehran, the Iranian capital, reopened yesterday after being closed for a week following a diplomatic row between the two countries, AP reports from Berne. Mr Walter Haffner, Swiss charge d'affaires in Tehran, said the visa and foreign interests sections were operating normally. Switzerland shut the embassy on December 29 after Iranian authorities temporarily confiscated the passport of a Swiss diplomat as she was about to leave on honeymoon. Movements of other officials were restricted. Tensions rose before Christmas when Swiss police arrested an Iranian national on charges of involvement in the murder in France of Mr Shahpour Bakhtiar, the Shah of Iran's last prime minister.</p>

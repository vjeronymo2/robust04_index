			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Christmas Food and Drink: The magic of Milroy's many malts - Giles MacDonogh meets a man with a nose for a good dram and enough stock to keep all his customers happy With between 350 and 375 different labels on sale at any given time, Milroy's - in Soho's Greek Street - is London's best address for malt whisky. It is run by Jack Milroy, a big, hairy, fire-eating Scotsman of the old school. Jack comes from Dumfriesshire and his local malt is the lately-mothballed Bladnoch (which he describes as 'not a bad aperitif'). Jack's brother is Wallace Milroy, one of Britain's greatest authorities on malt and the author of the Malt Whisky Almanac (Neil Wilson, Pounds 6.99). About 70 per cent of his customers are dedicated whisky buffs, but many are foreigners lured by the publicity he gets from articles in life-style magazines. Japanese come directly from the airport and ask for one of everything. Some people like to buy two bottles: one to keep and one to drink, or occasionally a mixed dozen. I mentioned a coIleague of a friend who plays in one of the world's great orchestras. This colleague wants to own a bottle of every malt made because his wife will not let him drink any until he has the whole lot. 'He comes in here,' said one of Jack's assistants. A Japanese woman came in recently with a young girl. She wanted a bottle of 55-year-old Macallan for the girl's wedding: it cost her Pounds 5,000. A Latvian bought a bottle of 1938 Macallan for Pounds 1,500 and came back for some Royal Lochnagar 60-year-old Reserve at Pounds 159. It is good to know that capitalism is making such swift progress in the Baltic states. One of Jack's best customers is a Brazilian who has more than 2,000 bottles of malt and has has built a special wing on his house to accomodate them. But Jack points out that it is not so hard to be a collector once you have bought the basic collection. There are probably no more than a dozen new releases every year. Jack is not happy with the standard strength of 40 per cent. For this reason, he is not a great fan of Gordon and MacPhail, which distributes the largest range of single malts from its headquarters in Elgin. Pointing to one whisky at around 60 per cent, he declares: 'You are getting almost half as much again]' He feels the ideal strength for bottling should be around 50 per cent - 43 at the very least but, preferably, 46. Jack says the process of chill filtering, practised by almost all distillers, takes out some of the whisky's goodness. It is done to prevent a haze developing in the bottle when it is cold - or, indeed, when you add water. 'The Japanese and the Americans don't like the haze,' he says, although it does not affect the flavour in any way. I asked Jack to recommend some of his own favourites. He pointed out various bottles: a Mortlach 21-year-old, a Pittyvaich I2-year-old, a Glenlivet 15-year-old (priced keenly at Pounds 25); and a Talisker he calls an 'early-evening malt'. He has a 1955 at Pounds 115. Another recommendation is Glenfarclas on Speyside. He is no longer so keen on the 105 (60 per cent) as John Grant has removed the age statement, and prefers the 15-year-old. Another great Speyside is Longmorn: the 15-year-old sells for Pounds 24.50. 'It doesn't need much water, it's so smooth,' Jack enthuses. He has a 1963, too, for Pounds 45. There are also special whiskies from Islay. He thinks Caoli1a under-valued, especially now that Laphroaig is not, in his view, what it was. 'They have polished it right down. It is not as interesting as it used to be.' He has a 1979 from the closed distillery at Port Ellen (Pounds 26) but, not surprisingly, he waxes lyrical over the 18-year-old, cask strength Ardbeg (54 per cent) at Pounds 43. The other day, he ate some pepper steaks which had been flambeed in it. 'They were sensational.' He has some kind words for the blended whiskies, too. He surprised me when he said the Johnnie Walker Blue Label had its admirers (at Pounds 120) and recommended the Islay Mist (it contains a lot of Laphroaig) at Pounds 17.50. On the other hand, 'Johnnie Walker Black Label is hard to beat'. He drinks it in Chinese restaurants when he cannot find any acceptable wine on the list. We opened a few bottles. A 21-year-old Glen Grant did not please me much; despite all those aromas of honeycomb and heather, it was still rather one dimensional. A Dailuaine 16-year-old combined the smell of sherry with something animal, like a wet sheep. So we moved on to some whiskies Jack is bottling himself. First was a 16-year-old, 1978 Glenlivet which he will break down to 46 per cent and sell for Pounds 25. This will make it better value than the Gordon and MacPhail 15 (40 per cent) at Pounds 29. It was a classic Speyside with a lot of rich sherry and toffee tastes - a great, warming dram. Sensational, however, was Milroy's 29-year-old Springbank (46 per cent) at Pounds 59. This might seem a bit steep, but the distillery's 30-year-old sells for Pounds 165. There was a lot of honey on the nose and a beautiful, lemony tang. Jack called it 'a kiss from a beautiful virgin'. He does a lot of business with Springbank. Although he has no Longrow at present, he has the rare Burnside, distilled occasionally on a special still. He also sells new casks for Pounds 900. The price includes 10 years' free storage and bottling at whatever strength you choose. Our final whisky was a 15-year-old Lagavulin at 64.6, which sells for Pounds 40. It was notably pale, with no sherry treatment and an obvious peat-reek which had me thinking of log fires and ash-trays. It is one of Jack's best-sellers. Indeed, he says males over 40 prefer Islay malts because they 'sort the men out from the boys'. It was a comment that gave me cause for reflection as I staggered out into Greek Street. Milroy's, 3 Greek Street, London W1, tel: 071-437 0893. This autumn yields three new books by Michael Jackson, the beer and whisky guru. The Malt Whisky Companion (Dorling Kindersley, Pounds I2.99) is now bang up to date and includes descriptions (and scores) for the whiskies released this year. Mitchell Beazley has published his Cocktail Book (Pounds 9.99), a nicely-illustrated compendium of recipes ideal for use in either a busy bar or the home. The same publisher has re-issued the Pocket Beer Book in which he reveals his latest discoveries (Pounds 6.99). Mmeanwhile, there is a new edition of the Good Beer Guide on sale. It is published by the Campaign for Real Ale (Pounds 9.99) which, among other things, is campaigning to have the level of UK duty on beer reduced drastically to bring it into line with continental Europe.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Yorklyde 30% ahead at Pounds 1.4m Profits of Yorklyde, the cloth and rug maker, improved from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 1.37m pre-tax for the six months ended July 31. The 30 per cent improvement was scored on the back of a 24 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 7.37m, against Pounds 5.92m. Earnings emerged at 18.8p (14.1p) and the interim dividend has been maintained at 4p. The directors said full time working was continuing at all group factories and added that the withdrawal from the ERM had helped to maintain a 'healthy level of inquiry' for the new season.</p>

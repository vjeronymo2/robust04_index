			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: 'Sterling was being sold like water running out of a tap' IF THERE was a moment when Norman Lamont knew that his economic policy was in ruins, it came a few seconds after 11am last Wednesday. As sunshine streamed into Parliament Square, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer rose from his desk in the Treasury, and stepped into his richly-panelled outer office. Half an hour earlier he had called John Major at the Old Admiralty building in Whitehall where the prime minister was temporarily housed while repairs were being undertaken to Number 10 Downing Street. Could he raise raise interest rates by 2 percentage points? Yes, said Major over the secure telephone line. Devaluation had to be avoided. The government's credibility was at stake. The announcement was to be released to the news agencies on the stroke of 11am. It would come as hammer-blow to a nation battered by recession. A small group of advisers, the chancellor at their centre, gathered round the Reuters news agency screen outside his inner sanctum. All morning the Bank of England had been fighting a desperate battle to save the pound from collapsing against the D-Mark and dropping through its agreed floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. Billions of pounds were used to try to stem the tide. Sterling revived briefly, then dropped back. As Big Ben struck 11, Lamont and his team remained transfixed by the numbers on the screen which monitored the currency markets. The chimes stopped and still the pound was sinking. A minute passed. The chancellor broke the silence. 'It is not moving,' he said. The government would fight a desperate, rearguard action but the battle was already lost. The extraordinary events of this week which have engulfed the pound, shattered the British government's economic policy and shaken the ERM to its core began in earnest two weekends ago in the elegant city of Bath. European finance officials, under Lamont's chairmanship, met to prepare, among other things, for the possibility of a No vote when the French deliver their verdict on the Maastricht Treaty on European union tomorrow. There would be turmoil on the markets. They would need to be united. But the cracks were beginning to appear. The Germans argued that the weaker currencies in the ERM, such as the pound and the lira, were out of line with the rest. Germany's partners responded that the Bundesbank was keeping interest rates too high and stifling growth. Despite subsequent denials that this had ever been mooted, the German delegation, led by Theo Waigel, the finance minister, and Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger, offered to reduce their interest rates. The price: a wide-ranging realignment of the mechanism  - one which, by definition, would involve the pound. 'In the event, the others weren't ready for it,' said one German official later. In his statement after the meeting Lamont presented the outcome as a victory for Britain. He had secured from the mighty Bundesbank a promise not to raise interest rates. The following morning German interest rates were cut by a grudging quarter of a percentage point and Britain's Tory tabloids took up the theme. The Bundesbank was portrayed as buckling to political pressure, its cherished independence compromised. The Bundesbank's president later confided that he was so angry at the conduct of the meeting that, at one point, he nearly walked out. When Schlesinger set the record straight the next day, the private disagreements became public. The markets began to smell blood. After that, the markets began seriously to test the ERM's resolve. Currency dealers sold Italian lire, the ERM's weakest link. By last weekend they had sold more than Pounds 8.5bn worth of lire for D-Marks. Last weekend increasingly worried finance officials across Europe hurriedly conferred and cobbled together a deal: Italy would devalue the lira by 7 per cent. In return the Italians would support a broader realignment. The British contin-ued to resist. The Bank of England had plenty of ammunition to fight the speculators should they turn on the pound, or so it thought. Its Dollars 44.4bn (Pounds 25bn) in reserves at the end of August had been supplemented by a more recent Pounds 7.27bn borrowing in foreign currencies. Shortly before lunchtime on Tuesday the lira began to sink. For sterling the die was cast. Traders were beginning to believe that one devaluation was not enough. 'As the lira fell, we started to notice that there was a big pick-up in trading in sterling against the D-Mark,' said Mark Austin of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. By Tuesday afternoon, the currency again heading towards DM2.80. By late on Tuesday, traders reckoned the Bank of England had bought around Pounds 3bn  -but the pound was not responding. 'What are the British doing?' asked one French dealer. 'If the franc were in this situation, we would have overnight rates up at 40 per cent.' But Britain is in the grip of a deep recession. Raising interest rates was political anathema. By Tuesday night the pound closed in London just a fifth of a pfennig above its ERM floor of DM2.778, its lowest ever in the mechanism. There was a growing feeling in Whitehall that the currency could be tipped over the edge unless something was done. The Treasury called a crisis meeting in Lamont's office with senior Bank of England officials. Beneath two glittering chandeliers, the details of the following day's tactics were plotted around a large oaken table. Besides the chancellor, the key actors who were to shape tactics on Black Wednesday were there: Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury's gritty permanent secretary ('keep smiling' is one of his aphorisms); his right-hand man, economist Alan Budd; Andrew Turnbull, in charge of monetary policy; Bill Robinson, the chancellor's special political adviser; and Sir Nigel Wicks, the Treasury's laconic second permanent secretary in charge of international affairs. The Bank group included: Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the aristocratic governor; Eddie George, deputy governor and the man in overall charge of market operations; Ian Plenderleith, associate director in charge of markets; Tony Coleby, director of monetary affairs; and Andrew Crockett, international director. George, known in the City as Hard Eddie, outlined the strategy: take each part of the battle as it comes; escalate the defence in discrete stages. First there would be large and overt Bank intervention. A rise in interest rates would be held in reserve for later in the day. One official pondered as he left the room at about 8pm: 'I wonder if it will be enough.' Elsewhere, events were already conspiring to thwart their plans. Five hours earlier in Frankfurt, seat of the Bundesbank, two journalists, one from Germany's principal business newspaper, Handelsblatt, and one from the Wall Street Journal, were interviewing Schlesinger. They released a summary to the news agencies. Schlesinger was reported as saying that a more wide-ranging realignment of the ERM than the devaluation of the lira, agreed at the weekend, could have reduced turbulence in the currency markets. This was code for saying that the Germans believed a sterling devaluation was necessary. The story was later denied. But what Schlesinger was quoted as saying was too close to the known views of many top officials in the central bank  - including his own. It was dynamite. When the FT called the Bank of England and the Treasury to seek reaction, near panic ensued in Whitehall and Threadneedle Street. Lamont was with his wife Rosemary for dinner at the Regent's Park home of the US ambassador, Mr Ray Seitz. Treasury officials called him with the news as they fought desperately to lessen the impact of the story. Leigh Pemberton twice called Schlesinger at his home near Frankfurt to try to clarify the report. The academic Mr Schlesinger  - who years ago told a Bundesbank colleague: 'the markets do not interest me'  - appeared bemused by the news that his quoted comments were creating havoc on the foreign exchange markets. 'The interview has not been authorised,' he twice told the Bank of England governor, referring to the fact that both correspondents had promised to check their text with him before publication. He appeared 'puzzled' by the confusion, said a British official. Throughout the night, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Japan supported sterling. By 7.30am on Wednesday, a team of eight foreign exchange dealers assembled in Eddie George's room in Threadneedle Street, hunched over their screens to buy pounds. Plenderleith ordered them to spend about Pounds 2bn in three separate interventions. By 8am the pound was pinned to its floor. Dealers were baffled by the Bank of England's actions. Said David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank at about 10am. 'Why aren't interest rates going up? Can we really be sure that the government is that committed?' By 8.30, the Treasury crisis group re-assembled in the chancellor's room. The mood was sombre. Plenderleith called Lamont over a secure hot line. The Chancellor, having spoken to the prime minister earlier, ordered more intervention from the Bank's foreign currency reserves. Leigh-Pemberton and George were smuggled into the meeting through a side entrance to avoid photographers. As the heavy artillery in the City began sterling's day long pounding, Major took his armour-plated Jaguar the two-minute drive down Whitehall to the Admiralty for a long-scheduled 9am meeting with Michael Heseltine, Douglas Hurd, Kenneth Clarke, Richard Ryder, the chief whip, and Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman. The subject was supposed to be Maastricht  -but the meeting became a de facto war cabinet. By 10.30am, the call everyone was dreading from the chancellor came through. Major left the meeting to take it. Hearing that the pound was sinking he calmly approved the two percentage point interest rate hike to 12 per cent. The prime minister made certain that this core group of ministers would convene for the key decisions  - an insurance policy that the law of 'collective responsibility' would be invoked in full. At 11am, the move was announced. The chancellor's group was aghast as the pound barely moved. One member of the group thought to himself: 'It's all over.' The currency market was coming to the same conclusion. Lamont made a statement to explain his move: 'As the current extraordinary pressures and uncertainties abate, I hope it will be possible to bring interest rates back down.' The markets were less than impressed. According to one analyst at the time: 'This may be what the public wants to hear, but it isn't nearly enough.' By noon, Lamont ordered more intervention. He would say, later, that it was like trying to stop a whirlwind. There followed a short discussion about whether suspension from the ERM would be in the Treasury's best interests. At 1pm. sandwiches were called in to the war room. Many were left untouched. When US markets opened at around 1.30 in London, US fund managers dealt in huge sums. As one dealer put it: 'Sterling was being sold like water running out of a tap. At 2:15, the Bank fired its best shot, raising interest rates to 15 per cent, the first time in history it had raised rates twice in a day  - both since rescinded. The stock market's reaction was telling: it rallied because traders believed even this would not stop the run on the pound. Sterling would have to be devalued. Total central bank intervention on Wednesday alone may have exceeded Pounds 15bn. One senior minister commented afterwards: 'We were buying every single pound in the foreign exchange markets. The reserves were haemorrhaging.' Major began making plans for sterling's withdrawal from the ERM. He called Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Kohl of Germany. Just before 4pm, the Bank of England organised a conference call with fellow central banks and told them sterling was being suspended from the ERM. Faced with the full scale of the defeat, Major once again summoned his cabinet colleagues at 5pm, this time with Lamont and Leigh Pemberton. The prime minister and chancellor spelled out their drastic solution. One Whitehall insider says that while Treasury and Bank officials appeared close to panic, Major remained calm. Retreat from the ERM was formally agreed. Just over two hours later, with the twilight fading in the Treasury's neo-classical courtyard, Lamont adjusted his tie and began to speak to the forest of microphones and cameras. 'Today,' he began,' has been an extremely difficult and turbulent day ...' That night he worked till 3am. Civil servants said the next morning he returned to his office with a smile on his face and a spring in his step. 'I have had an excellent night's sleep and I feel fine,' he told them. 'For the first time in a long while I haven't had to worry about the pound.'</p>

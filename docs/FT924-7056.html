			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse considers sell-offs to relieve exposure to property WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the embattled US conglomerate, is considering more rapid and comprehensive solutions to the troubles of its financial services business, which might mean further substantial reserves and force it to sell off one or more of its businesses. Westinghouse, with interests ranging from broadcasting to power generation, has been plagued for more than two years by the problems of Westinghouse Financial Services, which has a heavy exposure to poor investments in the depressed US property market. Westinghouse took a pre-tax Dollars 1.68bn provision in the third quarter of last year, mainly for property problems, on top of a Dollars 975m charge to sort out the financial services unit at the start of 1991. The company said it had been pursuing a strategy of reducing the financial service unit's portfolios over five years. However, it was now conducting a comprehensive review of alternative strategies, due to be completed in the fourth quarter or shortly afterwards, in the light of factors such as continuing adverse economic conditions and declining margins and yields in the Westinghouse portfolio. The review might lead to the sale or liquidation as soon as possible of some or all of the portfolios, involving another substantial reserve. That, in turn, would require the sale of one or more of the group's businesses. Mr Paul Lego, Westinghouse's chairman, said the group would not be stampeded into premature decisions. If businesses were sold, it would try to optimise its return and find strategic buyers who would serve the int-erests of employees and customers. Last month, Mr Lego had to issue a press statement reassuring investors that rumours the group was about to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy were 'preposterous'. Westinghouse's management is expected to be the subject of numerous hostile resolutions from shareholder activist groups at next year's annual meeting because of the group's poor recent performance.</p>

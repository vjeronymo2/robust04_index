			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad al-Jalabi, president of the Executive </F> Council of the opposition Iraqi National Conference by Salim  Badawi; date and place not given; from "The Event"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jalabi] With Saddam still in office, the  sanctions cannot be lifted. Relief for the Iraqi people lies in  the implementation of Resolutions 706 and 712. The  international community has no confidence in the Iraqi regime or  its compliance with resolutions.    [Badawi] Don't you agree, though, that the only party being  hurt is the Iraqi people, of which you are a part, rather than  the regime? Do you continue to hold that retaining the  sanctions will topple the regime?    [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi people will not benefit from lifting  the sanctions. The regime will use the ensuing income to  purchase weapons and new tools of repression. Only the regime  will benefit from lifting the sanctions.    [Badawi] There has been a relative and limited shift in the  positions of certain major powers like France and Russia toward  the Baghdad regime. How do you feel about that?    [Al-Jalabi] France and Russia seem to be misreading the  situation. Russia seems to think that scrapping the sanctions  will bring in money Iraq can use to pay the huge military debt  it owes Moscow. As for France, important commercial interests  there want drilling concessions in the Majnun oil field. These  interests think extending support to Saddam at this point will  help him survive, and then they will be in a position to clinch  the oil drilling contracts. They are influencing their  government. We think their influence is extremely limited.    [Badawi] If the Iraqi regime can capitalize on some positive  shifts by certain world powers, you, as an opposition, will  benefit as well. There are reports you receive financial  support from abroad, especially from regional powers opposed to  the Iraqi regime. Don't you think such an attitude makes you  less credible as a patriotic opposition?    [Al-Jalabi] Saddam [words indistinct] and destroyed the  Iraqi people's independent movement. We set up offices and we  are working from inside Iraq. We have moved the opposition from  exile onto Iraqi territory, where we are engaged in real,  democratic, and open political action. We believe our  credibility with the Iraqi people is strong. As for the reports  about financial backing, I have no comment, you are not being  specific.    [Badawi] In light of the present situation in Iraq, how do  you see the country's political landscape developing?    [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi regime is now progressively losing all  the requirements of a proper state. The regime is abdicating  state functions, like securing food, protection and safety for  the population. Thefts are rife, as are murders. The regime is  doing nothing about them. The regime is growing weaker and  weaker, and the people are poised to pounce on it. We are now  mobilizing our resources to promote that end.    [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. al-Jalabi.    [Al-Jalabi] Thank you.</p>

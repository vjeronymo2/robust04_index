			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viorel Salagean, Romanian National Unity </F> Party senator, by Simona Popescu; place and date not given:  "For the Time Being PUNR Appears in the Political Arena as an  Extremist Party"]    [Text] [Popescu] Mr. Gheorghe Funar [president of the  Romanian National Unity Party -- PUNR] affirms that your recent  declarations stem from the fact that you have not been chosen to  participate in negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy  Party of Romania] or for the meeting at Cotroceni....    [Salagean] Mr. Funar makes many affirmations and all of them  in his characteristic style that he always uses in public.  However, I believe that this time he has been misinformed. In  any event, he cannot be correctly informed about my activity  because he is in Cluj and I am in Bucharest.    [Popescu] President Funar explains your statements by saying  that you have been sick for a few months.    [Salagean] We are not talking about statements that might be  connected to a situation when I was allegedly annoyed for some  reason. There is only one thing that really upsets me and that  is stupidity. And when stupidity crosses my path and I cannot  avoid it, then I try to push it forcefully aside. Let me  explain this. There was no question of my being excluded from  those negotiations. I must draw the attention of Mr. Funar and  of those who believe in the words spread by him to the  following: The first discussions that I held on the PUNR's  participation in the government took place at the beginning of  September 1993 and three people participated in them, namely,  [PUNR Vice President] Ioan Gavra, [PUNR Deputy] Valeriu Tabara,  and myself. The talks were held in the the prime minister's  office. After we had presented him with certain aspects of our  policy and also named a few ministries that we were interested  in, he suggested that the discussions should not continue at  that stage with the government but should rather be transferred  to the two parties. Thus, the discussions continued with the  FDSN [Democratic National Salvation Front, now the PDSN]  leaders. Therefore, I participated in the initial stage of  these negotiations. As far as my alleged annoyance about the  nonparticipation in the Cotroceni talks is concerned, such  rumors are no novelty. There was no question of annoyance  whatsoever. I stated that I did not want to participate in  those talks with the president in Mr. Funar's presence, because  I do not want to blush when I hear original political  fabrications uttered in front of the country's president. I  have respect for that institution.    [Popescu] As far as we know, until recently, even the  Cotroceni itself imposed an embargo on PUNR President Funar.    [Salagean] I do not know what his relations are with the  Cotroceni. However I know that when I participate in  negotiations, I do not want to blush in shame for statements  that I hear uttered by my colleagues in the talks. This time  the PUNR's Bureau probably took into consideration this past  principle of mine to refuse to participate in PUNR meetings at  the presidency when Mr. Funar is present. This is the true  story. Certainly I would have liked, exceptionally, to  participate in the latest meeting because I had something to say  in front of the president, namely, to tell him not to commit the  error that has already been circulated and that has started to  take shape, that is, discussing PUNR participation in the  government. Such a political act could disrupt all the  political forces in our country in the present circumstances. I  shared these thoughts with some of my colleagues and that may be  the explanation of why I was not included in the talks.    [Popescu] It seems that the PDSR and the PUNR have already  established the latest details.    [Salagean] Unfortunately, I notice with the greatest  surprise that the discussions between the PDSR and the PUNR are  being kept very secret, mainly from certain senators and  deputies. However, they are not being kept secret from the  press and other parties. I have learned from the press what the  PUNR's demands are. They have named four or five ministries and  I was surprised to see this, as I know that we have no adequate  people for any of those ministries. Our offers -- and please do  not ask me to name names because I will not do so -- were  circulated in the press and I suppose that these are indeed the  ones, but I do not want you to hear them from me. Those people  are below the level of being able to compete with those who  currently occupy these positions, that is, the ministerial  portfolios. Thus, this is the major reason why I think that the  offer of the PUNR is frail, very weak, and lacking in  consistency.    [Popescu] In this case, the PUNR's request to participate in  the government was mainly based on vanity?    [Salagean] I believe that currently -- to use the familiar  phrases -- there are a few PUNR people who want to be in the  government, having already entered the Senate and the Chamber of  Deputies, or becoming prefects, subprefects, or I do not even  know what kind of important post, such as general directors in  certain ministries or secretaries of state. They want by any  means possible to see themselves, at least for a week or two, a  month, or perhaps even a year as a minister. Certainly, we are  talking here more about vanity than the desire or the power to  do anything useful for the country. In addition, you should not  forget that accepting the PUNR in government or establishing a  biparty government structure -- I believe -- would be a real  danger, a very bad signal sent toward Europe. No matter what we  want to do, no matter how we want to change our image, for the  time being the PUNR appears in the political arena to be an  extremist party. However, I refuse to believe that the PUNR is  in its structures an extremist party. But, through its leaders  and through the attitude of those leaders -- and in this respect  I am primarily thinking of Mr. Funar -- through many of his  willful and irresponsible attitudes and hasty gestures and  actions, the PUNR is burdened with this label of an extremist  party.    [Popescu] How representative is the current PUNR  leadership?    [Salagean] I would like to believe that for the spirit of  the PUNR, Mr. Funar is not in the least representative. His  declarations and actions, at least the most recent ones, are  either made on his own behalf, or by a furious person, or they  are those of the mayor of Cluj. Many senators whom I know very  well distance themselves from those declarations as soon as they  are uttered. It is absolutely necessary to make changes in the  PUNR leadership. Otherwise, there is the danger that the PUNR  will join and discredit this government, which can hardly stand  upright. But, there is also the danger that the PUNR will be  continuously discredited by Mr. Funar's willful attitude. I  believe that we should not now unnecessarily stir up nationalism.    [Popescu] What will you do if Mr. Funar's removal from the  PUNR's leadership is not successful? Will you resign?    [Salagean] I am not one to give up a fight. I feel capable  of fighting, and I am not ill as Mr. Funar has implied with his  characteristic cynicism. In any event, he may not know it, but  a heart attack has nothing to do with mental disease, from which  many of the current leaders of this party suffer. I believe  that Mr. Funar will understand the current danger that faces the  PUNR mainly because of his willful and hasty gestures and he  himself will find the solutions. One of these would be to  resign and to devote himself to his mayor's office in Cluj.  Another might be to convene an extraordinary congress of the  party and to discuss all the issues openly, without arrangements  of the type made at the time when Mr. Radu Ceontea [former PUNR  leader], who was one of the founders of the party -- and he  certainly had his own failings -- was removed from the political  scene of the PUNR and a person like Mr. Funar, who has brought  much, very much disrepute onto the party, should be kept at the  helm. Common sense would compel us to make a decision in this  respect.    [Popescu] According to your information, are there many  members of your party who share your ideas?    [Salagean] I have never carried out an opinion poll in this  respect, but, knowing very many PUNR members, I believe that  common sense will force them to move to my side and support the  idea of changes within the PUNR.    [Popescu] Recently we were informed that President Iliescu  wants to use you to eliminate the PUNR from the negotiations.  Similarly, it is known that the PDSR at one point set conditions  for the continuation of the negotiations, namely the removal of  Mr. Funar.    [Salagean] This is an interesting interpretation; I have  never thought of this. I would like to state very clearly that  I have held no discussions whatsoever in the past year with any  person connected with the Cotroceni. Such an interpretation  would certainly be a forced one and I deny it because I had no  contacts whatsoever, not even with Mr. Adrian Nastase. On the  contrary, I would like to say that, the most violent attack on  Mr. Nastase, when he made those statements about the behavior of  certain PUNR leaders and suggested the need for a change of  mentalities within the PUNR, which was aimed at controlling Mr.  Funar, and even suggested his removal, may have been from me  when I intervened most forcefully at the news conference, saying  that we do not accept anybody interfering in our affairs. There  I defended the idea of the independence of a party. We rejected  the idea of making little signs to signal that "it is not good  what you are doing." But it is certain that we basically agreed  with Mr. Adrian Nastase! Changes can start within the PUNR only  through an internal impetus, not an external one. I can state  categorically that such an interpretation is completely  erroneous. I also have many fundamental criticisms of President  Iliescu. One of them is connected with current events. I have  understood that President Iliescu is separating two elements  that should complement each other concerning the negotiations at  the Cotroceni, the move toward a political pact and the move  toward a new government. These two things cannot be separated.  Otherwise, it means nothing more than a dialogue between the  deaf.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- "Constructive relations are  shaping up between the Russian Government and the State Duma.  This is very important for the Cabinet of Ministers," Russian  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said during the opening of today's  meeting of the Russian Government's Presidium, assessing the  Duma's approval of the 1944 federal budget in first reading.    "We met with the Duma's understanding and I believe this was  due to our common realisation that the fate of the country was  being decided," Chernomyrdin stressed. "We shall base the joint  budgetary work of ministers and lawmakers on methods of  conviction," he added. According to Chernomyrdin, the Duma's  preliminary approval of the budget laid the beginning for  "concrete, painstaking work, in which the government will  persistently uphold its viewpoint after taking into account  everything that it had missed or overlooked".    The head of the Russian Government said that the budget  financing of the defence complex was a most important problem.  "Be what it may, we shall back the military-industrial complex  and this refers to all its ministries and departments, including  the Russian military science. As to the defence order, it is  necessary to balance it out, after seeing what we have on hand  this year and without exaggerating or hushing up problems,"  Chernomyrdin noted.</p>

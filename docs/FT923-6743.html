			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Low growth in GDP forecast for Spain THE Bank of Spain yesterday forecast gross domestic product growth this year of below 2 per cent, the country's lowest rate since 1984. The central bank's report on the first six months confirmed independent estimates of a deteriorating domestic economy marked by a sharp fall in consumption and a widening public sector deficit. The report said the construction sector was in 'a clear recession' - official tenders for civil works had fallen by 47.9 per cent in the first six months of the year - and that the public sector deficit had increased by 40.4 per cent over the first half of last year. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez reiterated yesterday that the government would introduce a restrictive budget for 1993 and said the bank's report justified the introduction of the fiscal package a month ago that raised taxes and implemented spending cuts. Spain's GDP growth fell from 3.8 to 2.4 per cent last year, a rate the government had hoped to maintain this year.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Cuba hard line under fire: Democrats and Republicans criticise Clinton The Clinton administration yesterday faced growing opposition from both Republicans and Democrats over its refusal to talk with Cuban President Fidel Castro about the growing number of Cuban refugees seeking entry to the US. Senator Chris Dodd, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, said 'some open negotiation with Castro makes sense. It's anachronistic not to do it'. His view was echoed by senior Republican Senator Richard Lugar who said 'the administration is going to have to deal with Fidel Castro. . . in the same hard-nosed way that we've tried to deal with Kim Il-sung and his successor over in North Korea, or with the Chinese, or with other people we don't care for'. Mexico announced yesterday that it had formally offered to mediate between Washington and Havana in an effort to reduce tensions over the developing crisis in the Caribbean island, and had decided to accept a limited number of Cuban refugees. Panama's incoming government also signalled it would be prepared to accept US requests for the provision of temporary shelter for boat people. The US reiterated its refusal to begin comprehensive talks with Cuba, in spite of President Castro's proposal of direct negotiations. In a speech broadcast in both Cuba and the US on Wednesday night, Mr Castro blamed US policies on Cuba, especially the trade embargo, for the refugees. He proposed broad talks, including discussions of the trade embargo and the US presence at Guantanamo Bay, to solve the migration problem. Mr Peter Tarnoff, US undersecretary for state, said: 'Castro is trying to make the US part of the problem and part of the solution. . . The problem lies in Cuba. It's a result of direct mismanagement over the last 35 years, (and) reluctance to reform.' The US State Department continues to hope the numbers of Cubans attempting to come to the US by boat will drop in response to the new immigration policy announced last week which says Cuban refugees will never be processed for entry into the US, but will be held in third-country detention camps until they can be repatriated. Bad weather came to its aid yesterday by stopping the flotilla of boats crossing the Straits of Florida.</p>

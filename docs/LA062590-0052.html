			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVIVORS GATHER REMNANTS OF THEIR PAST;  </P> <P> IRAN: FAMILIES SHED THE SHOCK AND GRIEF OF THE DISASTER AND BEGIN TO THINK  ABOUT THE FUTURE.  </P> <P> An old wire tray, a broken chandelier and some twisted blue window blinds.  That's not much for a new start. But atop a heap of bricks and plaster that was  a home, those objects had been set aside by a surviving family of Iran's killer  earthquake.  </P> <P> In the shattered city of Manjil in hard-hit Gilan province, families were  shedding the shock and grief of the past three days and beginning Sunday to  think about their future. The dead have been buried in a low hillside outside  the city and the seriously injured taken to hospitals in Tehran.  </P> <P> Scoops, shovels and men with picks and spades were sifting through the rubble  for personal belongings -- furniture, carpets, kitchenware -- no longer with  the care that followed Thursday's massive earthquake when the people of Manjil  were searching for survivors. They now know their family losses in dead and  injured.  </P> <P> Talking to visiting reporters half an hour after another aftershock rocked the  agricultural city overlooking Safid Reservoir, the townspeople showed little  apprehension; there was work to be done. A pile of new yellow bricks sat by a  curb, ready for rebuilding when the site is cleared.  </P> <P> Iraj Behnia, a 57-year-old teacher, said his was one of the few families in  Manjil to escape death. "But I can't feel happy," said the stocky Iranian in a  black felt cap. "All the other families have suffered. Their problem is my  problem."  </P> <P> Others felt the same. Dr. Mohammed Hussein Dehjhany bused up to Manjil from the  central city of Esfahan with his students, 13 male nurses, all, like the  doctor, in white medical coats, to help out. "We are doing what we can,  whatever the people want," he explained.  </P> <P> Earthquakes are fickle. Three houses in a row will be squashed like old tin  cans and the fourth will be standing. But Thursday's quake stomped Manjil. An  estimated 80% to 90% of the homes were destroyed. The death toll among the  100,000 citizens was uncertain, but one relief worker estimated that more than  60% of the populace was killed or injured.  </P> <P> But the quake didn't crush the people's spirit. The work went on Sunday with  neighbors helping neighbors, along with shovel-bearing detachments of uniformed  soldiers. At other sites, some men worked alone, pulling back the sheets of  tar-paper roofs to see what might be found underneath.  </P> <P> Alijan Mustfada, a shopkeeper who helped other men dig through the rubble of  his home, said he would live nowhere else. "Our memories are here," he said.  Mustfada lost two sons in the quake.  </P> <P> An old woman in a light-blue chador was making tea for her remaining family in  a military tent on the side of the road when reporters approached. She spoke a  few words of English, enough to get her point across without an interpreter.  There were 16 deaths in her extended family, five in the badly damaged city of  Roudbar nearby and the rest in Manjil.  </P> <P> "I worry (about it)," she explained, "but I'm not upset. It happened. It  happened." Her house was demolished, her car -- "German," she lamented -- was  crushed, and she's living in the street. But life goes on.  </P> <P> Other women were not so stoic, telling reporters in the Farsi language, which  the Westerners could not understand, and in mime, which they did, what happened  on Thursday. They threw arms up for the explosion of the quake and down for the  fate of their city.  </P> <P> It's hard to deal with the immensity of the casualties in a disaster of this  dimension, perhaps 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands injured in Gilan and  Zanjan provinces in the hilly country west of the Caspian Sea.  </P> <P> Flying over the region in an Iranian air force Chinook helicopter, reporters  saw the scars in village after village. A huddle of 30 or 40 mud-brick homes  had a hole punched in the middle, but the houses on the perimeter appeared  untouched. The city of Roudbar looked as if it had been shelled into rubble.  </P> <P> Fifty thousand lives lost in two provinces having nearly 3 million population  is believable, but the towns and cities are scattered, and the countryside  seems tranquil until you see the wrecked structures.  </P> <P> At a stop in the village of Tarem, there was nothing to see but shambles. The  people are Kurds, who were moved from their homes in the northeastern corner of  Iran 16 years ago by the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to suppress trouble  between the Kurds and his government.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the colorfully dressed women were chanting in grief for their dead.  They sat on a ridge at the edge of the village, which looked like an upturned  box of matches. Tarem lies beside a river, and the houses were made in part of  timber and reeds. The children flocked barefoot to see the helicopter set down  in a field of thorn bushes.  </P> <P> Children, however frightened they were by the quake and the aftershocks,  provide the laughter in the stricken region.  </P> <P> In Manjil, a small boy, his head helmeted in bandages, popped out of the  family's tent and snapped a sharp salute to the touring foreign press, a little  soldier in a scene of tragedy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE TO SEND AID  </P> <P>  Here are some of the agencies accepting donations for Iranian earthquake  victims:  </P> <P> Adventist Development and Relief Agency  </P> <P> 12501 Old Columbia Pike  </P> <P> Silver Spring, Md. 20904  </P> <P> (301) 680-6380  </P> <P> American Jewish World Service  </P> <P> 1290 Avenue of the Americas  </P> <P> 11th Floor  </P> <P> New York, N.Y. 10104  </P> <P> American Network for Service and Relief  </P> <P> c/o Muslim Public Affairs Council  </P> <P> 3010 Wilshire Blvd., No 217  </P> <P> Los Angeles, Calif. 90010  </P> <P> (213) 383-3443  </P> <P> American Red Cross  </P> <P> Iran Earthquake Disaster  </P> <P> P.O.

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> The board of the Escondido Union High School District unanimously approved a  contract Tuesday to hire a replacement for its much-maligned superintendent,  John Cooper.  </P> <P> Jane Gawronski, superintendent of the West Covina Union School District, will  take the helm of the 5,700-student school district July 16, replacing Cooper,  whom the school board asked to resign late last year after complaints about his  management style.  </P> <P> Gawronski, whose three-year contract calls for a starting salary of $85,000 a  year, has been superintendent at West Covina since 1987, bringing the district  back from the brink of insolvency.  </P> <P> "There are challenges in Escondido, too," Gawronski said. "But the primary  challenge is a people one, not a fiscal one. Both problems require process  solutions, because it takes people to provide solutions."  </P> <P> Cooper, who still had one year left on his contract, will vacate his post June  30.  </P></p>

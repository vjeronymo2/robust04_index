			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Restructured Andrews Sykes jumps to Pounds 0.8m PRE-TAX profits at Andrews Sykes Group, the specialist industrial services company, grew to Pounds 802,000 in the six months to September 30 compared with Pounds 519,000. Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the results represented 'significant progress' given that the poor summer weather and lower air conditioning hire revenues had exacerbated underlying weak demand from the group's traditional construction industry customer base. Turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 27.7m (28.1m) and the profits gain mainly reflected the group's efforts to contain costs and a reduction in interest costs, which fell to Pounds 992,000 (Pounds 1.16m), offsetting redundancy costs of Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 6,000). The group has undertaken a substantial restructuring in the past two years, aimed at reducing overheads and improving productivity. The number of depots has been cut from more than 50 to 35, and staffing has been reduced by 25 per cent resulting in a Pounds 3m pa saving on overheads. Earnings per share in the latest period were 1.7p (nil) out of which the group is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 1.4p per share. Mr Hubbard said the company was 'encouraged by the results for the first half and are confident that actions to improve productivity will continue to benefit the group.' However, he added, 'we do not foresee any early upturn in demand'. Two months ago the company rebuffed an attempt by Mr Jacques Murray, the dissident shareholder who holds a 29.2 per cent stake in the group, to unseat Mr David Hubbard and take control of the board.</p>

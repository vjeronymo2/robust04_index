			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Gatt May Help Bring On Deficits"] </F>   [Text] Access to the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (Gatt) could be a double-edged sword for China's exports,  a senior trade expert said.    While helping balance the richer east and poorer west  (because GATT calls for trade policies to be applied uniformly  across the country) among other merits, the access could well  cause trade deficits for China for a long time, said Wang  Xinkui, deputy director and professor of the Shanghai Foreign  Trade Institute.    The trade balance could deteriorate (on the basis of the  level observed before the access) in the immediate future, he  added.    "For, in general, it will be easier for foreign businesses  to  enter into the Chinese market than for Chinese companies to  enter into foreign ones, as soon as China assumes a freer trade  policy upon access to Gatt," he explained.    Soaring imports could emerge as China switches from a  planned  economy to a market-based one.    During the transitional period, imports are expected to run  out of control to a certain extent when trade is deregulated.    This situation is set to be aggravated if domestic  enterprises go for imports in a blind way as the national  economy continues to expand in the fast lane.    "Moreover, a huge demand for foreign consumer goods by  ordinary people will be a potential stimulus to new rounds of  imports," Wang said.    But he admitted that re-entering Gatt will provide China  with  an opportunity to readjust its foreign trade pattern which  developed in the 1980s.    The pattern is characterised by a favourable tilt towards  the  country's coastal regions, labour-intensive industries and a  narrow export market concentrated on the United States, Japan  and Hong Kong.    The pattern has produced three major problems for China's  foreign trade, Wang said.    First comes the worrisome export growth momentum, which is  maintained by the supply of more export goods whose prices have  been drifting downward most the time.    China's overall export price level in 1990 dropped by 12.4  per cent over that in 1981, although the annual trade volume  grew by 12.3 per cent from 1981-90.    "The bottom reason for the worsened export efficiency is  that  China failed to establish new money-spinning industries (such as  machinery processing) when the costs of labour and raw materials  soared up to hamper the competitiveness of the labour-intensive  industries, like textiles," Wang said.    Second comes the imbalanced development between the east and  the west.    The third is that China's exports are unduly focused on a  few  markets.    Statistics show that exports to the US, Japan, Hong Kong and  Macao accounted for 68.3 percent of China's total in l991, up  from 53.1 per cent in 1980.    To break the undesired pattern Wang said China must lose no  time in bolstering a cluster of new technology-intensive  industries, which will be the mainstay of the national economy  in the next century.    Priorities should include the heavy chemical, machinery,  electronics and telecommunications sectors.    These sectors have been a weak link in the Chinese economy,  which in the 1980s favoured labour-intensive sectors, such as  textiles industry.    "China should take advantage of its treatment as a  low-income  nation after rejoining Gatt to protect these new industries by  resorting to tariff and non-tariff measures on a selective  basis." Wang said.    These industries should establish systems that promote  large-scale production via corporate alliances and annexations,  he added.    China should also take advantage of easier access to more  overseas markets, which will apply lower tariffs to China after  its re-entry into Gatt, to cultivate more export markets other  than just the few mentioned above.    The biggest headache for China's exports is that there are  no  powerful transnational companies that can compete effectively in  the world market.    He urged the government to further wean itself from meddling  in the business operation of large and medium-sized State  enterprises, so that they will be more competitive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Farabundo Marti National </F> Liberation Front Party National Council, read by Jorge Shafik  Handal, general party coordinator, at party headquarters in San  Salvador -- live]    [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  National Council, during its regular afternoon and evening  meeting on 9 May, discussed as the agenda's main point the  FMLN's participation in the Legislative Assembly. The FMLN  adopted the following conclusions and agreements:    1. The FNLN's legislative programs and plans were made known  and approved. These define the goals and tasks that will be our  deputies' work in the struggle for democracy and social justice.  The Council agreed to publish and make known this document of  guidelines and actions to be undertaken that constitutes a  commitment to the Salvadoran people. In this way, we place it  at the disposal of the diverse peoples and national sectors for  debate and enrichment.    2. In keeping with Article 30, Paragraph 1, of our by-laws,  Comrade Deputy Manuel Orlando Quinteros Aguilar, alias Gerzon  Martinez, has been appointed leader of our legislative faction.    3. Regarding the events that occurred during the 1 May  installation of the Legislative Assembly and the events that  followed, the National Council:    A. Ratifies and supports the decision by the Political  Commission not to participate in the Legislative Assembly's  Board of Directors. ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has  turned this Board into a tool of its hegemony and antidemocratic  actions through the surprising and illegal last-minute reform of  its internal regulations. Under these conditions, the  Assembly's Board of Directors does not reflect the proportional  composition that resulted from the 20 March elections and  exacerbates the internal regulation that requires deep reform  for democratizing the Legislative Assembly's actions.    The Council reaffirms that the FMLN's participation in the  Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors depends on democratic  reform of the regulations.    B. It ratifies and supports the contents and terms of the  communique issued by the FMLN's general coordinator on 3 May  regarding this event.    C. It censures the action of seven deputies who, having been  appointed candidates by the FMLN, which is committed to the  struggle for democracy, bowed to ARENA's maneuver by  participating in the Board of Directors' election and by  accepting posts on the board. It also censures Joaquin  Villalobos, who without being a deputy has played an important  role as instigator of this action.    The National Council believes that the behavior of these  eight comrades during and after 1 May constitute a persistent  divisive action that violates the norms that rule the FMLN's  endeavors and that undermine the foundation of its unity  agreement. This is undoubtedly a serious transgression against  our party's principles, goals, and by-laws and a harsh blow to  the hopes that hundreds of thousands Salvadorans have placed in  the FMLN.    D. Before and after 1 May, the eight mentioned comrades have  had the chance to participate, with all the rights that the  by-laws grant to FMLN members, in the debates and the  decisionmaking. Nevertheless, they did not openly present to the  Political Commission their intentions nor did they attend this  National Council meeting to present and debate their opinions  and positions. The by-laws approved and signed by all state:  Taking into consideration the significant value of party unity,  and within the framework of free discussion of ideas, it is  required that decisions be adopted by consensus. If this is not  achieved, the minority will respect the decisions of the  majority. Article 8 of the by-laws.    The National Council point outs that the argument that  within  the FMLN there is systematic confrontation of three against two  is false. It does not correspond to the reality in innumerable  cases of unanimous and consensus votes of four to one and  diverse compositions of three to two.    E. Given the above reasons, the National Council agrees to:    E.1. De-authorize as FMLN representatives Deputies Eduardo  Sancho, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, Juan Ramon Medrano, Fidel  Recinos, Eli Avileo Diaz, Sonia Aguinada Carranza, Francisco  Mena Sandoval, and Joaquin Villalobos.    E.2. Suspend all these comrades from the posts to which they  have been assigned by the National Council. Ask the National  Resistance and the People's Revitalizing Expression to correct  the conduct that has given way to this situation and to propose  substitutes for approval by the Council to participate in the  continuing internal debate and in the task of party management.    E.3. Convene a special national convention in June -- after  canvassing the opinion of the party's rank and file -- to ratify  these National Council agreements and to adopt the corresponding  decisions to normalize the situation and foster the FMLN's  struggle and development. In light of the special national  convention, the National Council asks the party's diverse  district and sectoral structures to hold a broad consultative  debate.    [Issued in] San Salvador    [Dated] 10 May 1994    [Signed] Regular National Council</p>

They uncovered three opium manufacturing  laboratories and confiscated 150 kg of poppy haulms, almost 1.5  liters of opium solution, and a Kalashnikov rifle. The  operatives discovered the largest haul at a house on Kerch  Street: A certain Gubanov was found in possession of 97 kg of  poppy haulms.    But it was detectives from the regional administration for  combating organized crime who provided the high point of the  operation. They basically brought to an end the "high" enjoyed  by a Georgian criminal community resident in the "Rossiyanochka"  Hotel on Leninskiy Prospekt. Seven addicts were caught  red-handed.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / G7 ministers look for sustainable growth: Peter Norman studies the agenda for today's talks in Washington THE elusive goal of sustained non-inflationary growth for the world economy will be at the centre of today's talks in Washington among finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. After a week in which the International Monetary Fund has downgraded its forecasts for growth in the industrial countries this year and next, the ministers from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada are fully aware of the risks to economic recovery. The US hosts of the meeting will press for more measures to boost global growth. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, and Mr Larry Summers, treasury undersecretary for international affairs, are concerned about a lack of any convincing upturn in continental Europe and doubts about whether the recent fiscal package and this week's sharper than expected cut in Japan's discount rate will suffice to prevent full-blown recession in Japan. Mr Bentsen called this week for more interest rate cuts in Europe and intimated that he would like to see tax cuts in Japan. But today's meeting will end without an economic policy communique - partly to allow time to discuss developments in Russia with finance minister Boris Fyodorov. 'Don't look for us to pull any rabbits out of hats,' Mr Bentsen said on Thursday. Differences are sure to emerge between the US and Germany on their perceptions of economic growth. The German government has rejected as too pessimistic IMF forecasts of a 1.6 per cent decline in German gross domestic product this year and growth of only 1.2 per cent in 1994. Bonn officials say the economic recession has bottomed out and output will drop by only 1 per cent this year to be followed by 1.5 per cent growth in 1994. The German delegation, led by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, will counter demands for faster cuts in interest rates with assurances that measures to cut the budget deficit should create room for further monetary easing. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, may find himself in a hotter seat. France's reluctance to cut rates decisively since the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism's fluctuation margins early in August has disturbed other G7 countries. In addition, France's obstruction of progress towards a conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks is viewed as a serious threat to the world economy. Mr Bentsen made clear this week that the US would not tolerate a reopening or renegotiation of the Blair House agreement to reduce subsidies in agricultural trade. Although Mr Alphandery is not a trade negotiator, he will be given a clear message to send to Paris from the US and the other G7 countries. It is through such lobbying and persuasion that the G7 finance ministers hope to influence the world economy. And Mr Bentsen, who has breathed new life into the group as treasury secretary, is pleased with progress so far this year. The past six months have seen significant policy changes in the G7 countries. The US has adopted a Dollars 500bn (Pounds 325bn) deficit reduction programme. Japan has begun deregulating its economy in addition to its economic stimulation packages. While there have been complaints about the pace of interest rate reduction, borrowing costs have come down in all G7 countries. It is likely that such steps would have been taken in the absence of the finance ministers' meetings. But it is possible to argue, as did a senior US treasury official this week, that the discussions among the G7 ministers have had a catalytic effect that has speeded policy change.</p>

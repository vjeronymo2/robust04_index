			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: How the LSO played off its debt - Antony Thorncroft talks to cellist-turned-manager, Clive Gillinson, about the orchestra's change of fortune Ten years ago the London Symphony Orchestra was facing disaster. The house orchestra of the recently opened Barbican Centre seemed unable to put a foot right. Its ambitious festivals of the music of Webern and Tippett were attracting audiences of 50 per cent or less. Its policy, imported from the US, of selling tickets by subscription and repeating programmes, was just not working in a city with no shortage of alternative concerts. One financial backer, the City of London, was restive; another, the Arts Council, was specific: unless the orchestra eliminated its swiftly accumulated deficit of Pounds 430,000 within three years funding would cease. Managerial heads rolled at the LSO and the board looked around for a new chief executive. In the meantime Clive Gillinson, a cellist in the orchestra, was given the job of managing the LSO for three months. A decade later he is still there. He surveys a typical London musical scene where all the major orchestras have problems of one sort or another, especially financial, except one. The LSO has around Pounds 100,000 in the bank; the loyal support of the Arts Council and the City, who between them have raised their annual subsidy to Pounds 2.1m; a turnover which has doubled during the decade, to Pounds 7.7m this year; audiences in 1994 of almost 90 per cent capacity; and a secure future. No wonder Gillinson is picking up awards and taking calls from head hunters. He is staying put for the next five years (he has just signed the deal) but lets loose that there are two other jobs which intrigue him. Watch out the National Trust and the National Theatre. The change-around was not a pretty sound. Gillinson admits that for a year or so the LSO sold itself blatantly to pay off the overdraft. Rehearsals were cut and popular programmes played. Any rich egoist who could offer private or corporate money got the chance to conduct the LSO. One was so inadequate that the only way a particularly tricky scherzo could be recorded was by asking him to listen while the orchestra played it under the baton of its leader. This was the take that made the final recording. Luckily most of the self-delusionists wanted to play pop classics and the undiscriminating audience did not notice the cracks. But it was very disillusioning for the musicians. By playing 700 sessions a year (as against 500 now) the LSO managed to play off the debt. But its confidence was shattered, and in 1985 Gillinson was preparing to pull the plug on a series of concerts of Mahler and Viennese music under Claudio Abbado, which would help to raise the reputation of the LSO but could backfire financially. Gillinson flew to the maestro to discuss the project and was persuaded to press ahead. Sponsorship money was found and the series was a great artistic and critical success. This was a turning point. The reviving reputation of the LSO was consolidated by the courtship and seduction two years later of the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who was looking for concerts to celebrate his 60th birthday. LSO saw off the competition from other orchestras and he has remained a loyal supporter. As he won over the critics Gillinson was also changing the way the LSO performed. The original three, monthly, seasons a year at the Barbican were jettisoned for Thursday and Sunday concerts throughout the year. The workload was reduced from 100 concerts to 85. When the City and the Arts Council were persuaded to raise their backing, the LSO recruited joint string principals to beef up what had always been the weakest aspect of its playing. It also concentrated on booking only top flight conductors and soloists. The changes were not universally welcomed. Gillinson is a tough disciplinarian and many LSO musicians left for a more easy going life-style. If you stayed with the LSO you got the chance to play interesting programmes to wide acclaim but you had to turn up for virtually every concert: the audience expected to recognise each musician in their appointed seat. Fixed holidays were brought in, and short-term pay offs were replaced by long-term planning: performance fees have been frozen for the last three years. But while the other London orchestras had the agonising experience last year of being forced into a beauty contest before the Hoffmann Committee, which had been asked by the Arts Council to recommend orchestras for the financial chop, the LSO was excused. It enjoys much more subsidy than its rivals (although it plays more London concerts); its audiences are far higher; its reputation sound. It does not entirely escape the malaise that has overtaken London concert making in the past decade. Big name conductors are still reluctant to commit themselves to taking on a London orchestra. This year Sir Colin Davis succeeds Michael Tilson Thomas as principal conductor of the LSO, (which should bring more British music into its repertoire), but, despite his high national standing, Sir Colin has not the international reputation to bring to the LSO lucrative recording contracts. The LSO has still to move from being a great British orchestra to being an outstanding global one. But most things are in place for take off. There is now a commitment to make every concert special, rather than to go for safe Beethoven-Tchaikovsky double bills, which can no longer guarantee an audience anyway. So in the autumn programme you have either a festival theme - all of Mahler's symphonies; or popular performers like Solti and Anne-Sophie Mutter; or starrily cast operas in concert (Idomeneo). Like Simon Rattle in Birmingham the LSO has now gained the confidence of its audience, which will go along for challenging work with some expectation - although a barrage of discounts and special offers helps. The reputations of the London orchestras rise and fall but the LSO, bolstered by the Barbican residency, seems secure enough to see out Gillinson's tenure.</p>

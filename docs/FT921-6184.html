			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Average poll tax rise in districts may be 13.8% - Local Government Finance JUST OVER 100 of the 180 district councils that have set provisional poll tax rates have recommended levels above the government's target of Pounds 257, although only two have breached the government's criteria for 'capping' or limiting expenditure. The Local Government Finance Bill, replacing the community charge with a banded council tax, cleared its Lords' stages last night and returns to the Commons for consideration of amendments. MPs are due to debate the changes under a 'guillotine' timetable next Wednesday, leaving time for the bill to return to the Lords and go on for Royal Assent on Friday. The survey, for today's Local Government Chronicle, shows that the unweighted average district poll tax for 1992-93 has gone up by 13.8 per cent - more than three times the rate of inflation. The numbers include some significant figures for 'other adjustments', which are mainly to take account of non-collection. The highest of these so far is Leicester at Pounds 63, while Plymouth's is Pounds 44.53. These may reflect underestimates of expected collection last year, as well as projected collection levels for 1992-93. Among metropolitan boroughs so far, non-collection surcharges are almost all over Pounds 20, with Manchester the highest at Pounds 69.13 followed by Rochdale and Tameside both on Pounds 49. No council has yet set a budget that could see its spending capped. For London so far, with figures for 17 of the 33 boroughs, the non-collection surcharges are generally relatively low. Only five are over Pounds 20. A Labour survey of provisional poll tax levels in London produced an average of Pounds 258, though information from some which might set poll taxes above that is not yet available. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, condemned the 'distortions' in the government grant system and said that if every authority was given the amount of grant per head that Westminster received, then 355 councils could pay dividends to their poll-tax payers - rising to Pounds 823 in East Dorset. He commented that Tory councils so far had produced an average rise of Pounds 22 (11.1 per cent) while the average for Labour councils was Pounds 15 (5.2 per cent). This reflects to some extent how close councils were to spending limits for last year. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, said Mr Gould's analysis was 'bogus'. Though ministers have been encouraged by the relatively low poll taxes so far in London, for example the Pounds 250 set by Hammersmith and Fulham, in political terms even this may be a mixed blessing. Strengthening the capping system means the chances of an election protest against a high-spending Labour council, such as contributed to Labour's loss of Walthamstow in 1987, are greatly reduced. Two counties, Warwickshire and Gloucestershire, have now breached the government's limits on their budgets, but the process of deciding whether they should be capped will not end until after the election if that takes place on April 9. The impact of county spending can be seen in the figures for the districts, with Kent seeing some of the highest percentage increases. Some of these come, however, on bills which were very low last year, though the rises take them over the highly visible benchmark of Pounds 200. Environment ministers have already conceded that the target figure will be overshot as an average, but the government estimates that the excess will be no more than Pounds 10 to Pounds 15. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'Our private polling shows that the government is facing a new electoral backlash over the poll tax. The bills that will arrive during the general election may well seal the government's fate.' But Mrs Gillian Shephard, a Treasury minister, said yesterday that if the average poll tax was higher than Pounds 257, 'people will know whom to blame  -it is the councils' responsibility'. English councils have collected 67 per cent of this year's budgeted poll tax income according to third-quarter collection figures published by the Department of the Environment yesterday. Two councils, Brent and Lewisham, had collected less than half.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ENGLISH DISTRICTS - highest and lowest poll tax Pounds  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            1992        1991    Percent    Other                           -1993       -1992       rise    adjts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Highest % rises  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rochester                 97.92       50.47       94.0     7.69 Gravesham                231.00      152.98       51.0     6.66 Thanet                   242.00      172.00       40.7     2.50 Ashford                  242.00      174.10       39.0     5.18 Shepway                  279.00      201.15       38.7     6.00 Swale                    267.61      193.77       37.8    22.78 Hove                     269.97      197.06       37.0    33.96 Sevenoaks                254.97      189.57       34.5    10.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lowest % rises  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Epsom &amp; Ewell            296.00      327.07       -9.5    21.03 Oxford                   311.57      343.52       -9.3    29.77 Windsor &amp; Maidenhead     262.00      287.00       -8.7     0.00 Cherwell                 233.20      245.21       -4.9    12.00 Elmbridge                330.87      338.66       -2.3    14.88 Preston                  307.17      314.08       -2.2    16.78 Mid-Bedfordshire         260.71      266.03       -2.0     8.47  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Highest absolute levels  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Langbaurgh               376.00      331.86       13.3    35.91 Middlesborough           353.00      309.92       13.9    28.40 Leicester                351.00      319.10       10.0    63.00 Cambridge                349.00      328.63        6.2     4.00 Blackpool                340.00      294.12       15.6    40.54 Blyth Valley             334.90      295.07       13.5    22.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lowest absolute levels  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rochester                 97.92       50.47       94.0     7.69 Wellingborough           145.00      128.89       12.5     3.78 Torbay                   207.00      184.00       12.5    12.68 Chichester               208.20      170.24       22.3     6.92 N.

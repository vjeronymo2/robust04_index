			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the </F> proclaimed presidential council in Aden, by Antoin 'Awn in  London on 26 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Muhammad] The world recognizes what actually  exists. We are the only ones entitled to defend the cause. We  are being attacked, our villages, cities, and institutions are  being occupied, and all we have contributed to the Yemeni unity  and homeland is being destroyed. Whoever started the war should  bear the responsibility for that destruction, for breaking the  constitutional legitimacy, and for what happened to the country.    ['Awn] You said that what actually exists determines world  recognition. What is the reality today?    [Muhammad] The war is entering its fourth week. Whoever said  that this war will be settled within days has miscalculated.  The war will continue for a long time and will give rise to  other options. Hence, we still warn, demand, and raise our  voices with an appeal to all to stop this war.    ['Awn] Aden repeatedly implied that there are Iraqi POW's.  It spoke yesterday about chemical weapons that Sanaa is using.  Is there an Iraqi involvement and what is the official stance  in Aden?    [Muhammad] I regret to say, away from political oneupmanship  or attempts to gain from this or that issue, that Iraq is  involved. The evidence is found in the stance its Arab League  representative has taken and the stance assumed by the Ba'th  Party and represented in the statement the party's national  command in Baghdad has issued. This is a clear sign of full bias  toward the military action and the northern troops' invasion of  the southern and eastern regions of the country.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Czechs approve Mercedes venture THE CZECH government yesterday approved the forging of a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz, the subsidiary of the German vehicle-maker Daimler-Benz, and two local trucks manufacturers, Avia and Liaz. Mercedes had been chosen over Renault of France by the two Czech companies last January, but the deal was pending government approval. Renault, however, recently signed a letter of intent with Karosa, the local bus-maker. The new joint venture, valued at Dollars 250m, will be 31 per cent owned by Mercedes, 49 per cent by Avia and 20 per cent by Liaz. Mercedes has pledged to invest DM350m (Dollars 210m)into the joint venture over the next three years. A further DM100m investment is planned for the three years thereafter. Mercedes plans to increase its ownership stake in the future, according to Mr Vlastmil Devera, Avia's chairman. Avia is Czechoslovakia's third largest truck manufacturer, with 1991 sales reaching Kcs4.1bn (Dollars 136m) Domestic annual sales have averaged 9,000 trucks manufactured under a 1967 Saviem-Renault licence. Mercedes intends to manufacture two versions of its own light and medium trucks in six months' time. Heavy trucks will continue to be manufactured independently by Liaz and by Tatra, Czechoslovakia's third truck-maker, which recently signed a letter of intent with Iveco.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, </F> Yemeni minister of planning and development, in Sanaa, by an  unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani,  minister of planning in fraternal Yemen, we would like to learn  about the situation in your country in light of the escalated  fighting between the north and the south.    [Al-Iryani] First, I would like to state that the media,  which is talking about the struggle between the north and the  south, does not know the nature of the situation. Nevertheless,  I will try to answer this question.    [Correspondent] In other words, do you agree with me that it  is a war between brothers?    [Al-Iryani] A war between brothers, yes certainly, but not a  war between the north and the south. The brothers,  unfortunately, are fighting in one house, in one room. But I  still claim that it is not a war between the north and the  south. The latest developments of the situation have been that  -- and I quote language used by the media -- joint northern and  southern forces are heading toward Hadhramaut to topple the  al-Mukalla republic declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Perhaps this  is an answer to the language used by the media. Joint northern  and southern forces, specific brigades -- and among these  brigades, which the media calls southern, are the 'Abbas Brigade  and the Hunayshan Brigade, as well as some brigades from the  north -- are all advancing jointly toward Hadhramaut to topple  the al-Mukalla republic declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These  are the latest developments in the situation.    [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that the northern  forces have stopped advancing toward Aden?    [Al-Iryani] No, no. The situation in Aden is unique and  needs special consideration. The Aden Governorate has over  400,000 innocent citizens: women, children, elderly, and men.  The fighters there number only in the hundreds. We do not want  these few hundred to be the cause of thousands of Aden  residents' death. This is why the Aden front needs special  consideration. Our advance to Hadhramaut is taking place with  joint forces -- as I said earlier quoting the media, northern  and southern forces -- to topple the al- Mukalla republic. They  will start at Saywun and then head toward al-Mukalla.    [Correspondent] But so far, the fighting has targeted  civilians. We have learned that a missile fell on Sanaa  yesterday and that a number of civilians died in it.    [Al-Iryani] First, I wish to confirm that the number of  deaths in the capital, Sanaa, is three times more than the  number in Aden Governorate.    [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that ...    [Al-Iryani interrupting] There is a great deal of  speculation in the number of deaths in Aden. Not a single  civilian district of Aden was targeted.    [Correspondent] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, do we understand from  what you have just said that there is no intention on the part  of northern troops to strike at Aden with Scud missiles?    [Al-Iryani] I assure you that this will not happen. Three  missiles with a range shorter than a Scud were fired at Aden  airport. We cannot shell innocent people in Aden with a  missile, a cannon, or a tank. The criminal secessionists,  however, insist on hitting the civilians, particularly in Sanaa,  so as to give the impression that a civil war is afoot and that  civilians are paying the price.    [Correspondent] We would like you to update us on the  situation from your side. Do you plan any political moves? We  know that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has sent messages to a  number of Arab and foreign leaders.    [Al-Iryani] Let me tell you that the secessionists have only  a handful of supporters on the outskirts of the Aden  Governorate. They have no military power. There are no front  lines in any part of Yemen, except for the handful of supporters  who have dug their heels on the outskirts of Aden.    [Correspondent] This is the military situation as you see  it?    [Al-Iryani] I assure you that this is the true military  situation. You journalists used to talk about northern and  southern troops. There were supposed to be two southern  brigades and three northern ones. All these brigades are now  heading to take over Hadhramaut. This means that all the fronts  have crumbled. There are no military forces in Hadhramaut. I  assure you, there are no brigades there, because these are the  brigades that were positioned there in the first place. There  is no resistance left except for the remnants entrenched on  Aden's outskirts. As I said, Aden has its special status.    [Correspondent] This means that there are no southern forces  left in Hadhramaut.    [Al-Iryani] Correct. These forces withdrew to Shabwah,  Abyan, and Aden and no longer present a problem. Most of these  forces are now on the side of the legitimacy.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that Aden is no longer a  military target?    [Al-Iryani] As you know, military and political  considerations are linked. We are giving priority right now to  political considerations until we see what happens. But its  elimination as a military target, I think it does not make sense.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that dialogue and a political  solution are possible and that you are ready to seek them?    [Al-Iryani] Yes, yes, yes, yes.    [Correspondent] Even with the secessionists in the south?    [Al-Iryani] Yesterday, the public attorney pressed charges  against 16 Yemeni Socialist Party members. This decision was  followed by a declaration of general amnesty. The others  [southern officials] were called upon to take part in dialogue  in the framework of the Republic of Yemen and its constitution.    [Correspondent] What is your next step in light of the  international reaction to the secession of the south from Yemen?    [Al-Iryani] As we said repeatedly, any dealing or sympathy  with those secessionists will be considered a hostile act  against the Yemeni people.    [Correspondent] Has it not come to your knowledge that a  certain country is about to recognize what has been announced as  southern Yemen?    [Al-Iryani] I assure you that such a step has not been  pondered at all, except by the other wretches in the Republic of  Somaliland.    [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that the Republic  of Yemen is proposing dialogue and political settlement in place  of military option?    [Al-Iryani] The military option ... [pauses] It is possible  (?in the city of Aden). As for the other fronts, there is no  more fighting.    [Correspondent] By other fronts, do you mean Hadhramaut?    [Al-Iryani] I mean the fronts that saw action, in Abyan,  Shabwah, and al-Dali'. For the sake of civilians' safety,  political settlement is an option.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that a political solution is  a  possibility?    [Al-Iryani] Yes, before we are forced to consider the  military option.    [Correspondent] Do you believe that marching on Aden  involves  special considerations that are not ...    [Al-Iryani, interrupting] Yes, and this is what I told you  in  the beginning of this interview. But these special  considerations are not going to last forever. As you know,  military options are not forever. Hours make a difference.    [Correspondent] Why have you taken this position at this  very  moment?    [Al-Iryani] Because we do not want... [pauses] because it is  a populated area, as I told you. The rest of the areas that saw  military clashes were quite distant from populated areas.    [Correspondent] We thought, if you excuse me, that a  military  option was your first priority. Now, it seems that you are  talking about a political option and dialogue.    [Al-Iryani] It is not true that anyone in Sanaa has ever  rejected political dialogue.</p>

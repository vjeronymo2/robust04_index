			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Italian bank said to have approved Iraq loans TWO FORMER executives of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) have claimed that the bank's head office in Rome approved some of the more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of illegal loans to Iraq made during the 1980s by the bank's Atlanta branch. The disclosures contradict the central premise of the US government's fraud case against Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former Atlanta branch manager who may be sent to prison this week by a US federal judge. The Atlanta prosecutors, backed by the Bush administration, argued no one in Italy knew about the Atlanta operation and Mr Drogoul was the sole orchestrator of the loans, which helped to finance President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects. Yet two former senior BNL executives have told the Financial Times there were at least eight different mid-level and senior BNL colleagues in Italy who were involved in the Atlanta loans affair. Mr Arthur Wade, the chief US investigator in the BNL case, admitted under questioning in court last week that the US Department of Justice had halted a visit to conduct interviews with BNL executives in Rome. Mr Wade said no US investigator in the case had travelled to Italy. Both of the former BNL executives who gave the detailed briefings have asked that they should not be named. One executive said that between 1987 and 1989 he directed to Mr Drogoul in Atlanta over five Italian companies seeking BNL loans to back exports to Iraq. He said: 'We knew there was an open line of credit to Iraq that was being run by our Atlanta branch. We were told that the highest levels of BNL wanted us to give privileged treatment to Iraq. 'Baghdad was an important client of the bank. When the exporters came to us in Italy, we arranged for Atlanta to open and confirm letters of credit for exports to Iraq. Some of the loans were returned to Italy and approved and countersigned.' The former BNL executive, now in a senior position at another institution, said there were seven other current and former BNL executives 'who know it is simply not true that Mr Drogoul acted alone'. Two mid-level BNL executives even met Mr Drogoul during visits to Baghdad to work on the restructuring of previous Iraqi debts, which were repaid 50 per cent in dollars and 50 per cent in Iraqi dinars, he claimed. 'BNL was the main payments mechanism for many US and European exports to Iraq. We were told inside the bank not to worry too much about credit risk because a large portion of the farm loans were being guaranteed by the US government. There was also political cover in Rome for the bank,' he said. In Rome three Italian senators have asked for a commission to be set up to investigate the BNL-Atlanta affair. Mr Giampiero Cantoni, the current chairman of BNL, said that once the scandal came to light the bank's board was changed and his new administration had made no attempt to cover up. He described any such suggestions, made in court in Atlanta, as 'totally false'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>   [Text] Oslo 29 April TASS -- Special representative of the  Russian president Vitaliy Churkin met on Friday with Co-Chairmen  of the Coordinating Committee of the International Conference on  Former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen to discuss  the initiative recently proposed by Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev that the heads of the foreign ministries of  Russia, the U.S. and other "key countries" meet and work out a  way to put an end to the crisis in Bosnia.    The meeting between the foreign ministers of Russia, the  U.S., and the other "key countries" is designed to coordinate  the efforts of the world community to end the war in Bosnia, the  diplomats announced at the press conference held after they  approved the Russian initiative. The sides involved in the  Bosnian conflict will not be invited to the conference.    The date and place of the meeting between the foreign  ministers have not been specified as yet, Churkin told ITAR-TASS.    According to him, Russia, the USA and "leading European  countries" will participate in the meeting, which will be "a  special forum" independent of the international conference on  Former Yugoslavia. Participants in the meeting will "make  serious decisions," he said.    Participants in a news conference devoted to the results of  trilateral consultations said on Friday that the forthcoming  meeting between the foreign ministers was to take place "as soon  as possible" and to work out "a coordinated approach, a general  strategy of international community in respect of settling  crisis in Bosnia."    According to them, the foreign ministers will consider  situation in Gorazde and a mechanism of "settling crisis in  Bosnia as a whole." The warring parties in Bosnian conflict  will not be invited to the meeting.    Participants in the news conference emphasized that after  the  situation in Gorazde was relatively normalized, there was a good  chance that the belligerents would agree to a ceasefire in  Bosnia.    They also described criticism levelled at allegedly  ineffective efforts of Stoltenberg and Owen as groundless.    Peace-making process is actually replete with  disappointments  and failures, but it does not mean that no effort is being made,  Stoltenberg said.    The blame for constant foiling peace-making efforts rests  not  with the international community, but with the belligerents who  fail to come to terms, Churkin said in this connection.    We cannot wait for a showdown in the war in Bosnia any  longer, Owen emphasized. Emergency measures are needed now to  stop the war, because violence in Bosnia grows with each passing  day, ethnic cleansing continues. Procrastination on the part of  the international community results in continuation of violence,  he added.    It is extremely important that Russia plays a great role in  stopping the war in Bosnia, Owen stressed.    If the belligerents reach a ceasefire in Bosnia, the Russian  parliament will be advised to consider increasing the number of  the Russian peace-keepers stationed in Bosnia as a part of the  UN Protection Force, Churkin said in this connection.    Churkin and Owen met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Tore  Godal, who fully supported the idea of holding the meeting  between foreign ministers of "the leading countries" with a view  to settling crisis in Bosnia.</p>

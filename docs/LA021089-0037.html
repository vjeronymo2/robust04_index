			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPCARE SAYS IT'S CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING  </P> <P> Comprehensive Care Corp. of Irvine said Thursday that it has appointed a  special committee of directors to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a  possible financial restructuring, asset sale or acquisition by another company.  </P> <P> CompCare, which operates alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs in 193  hospitals nationwide, has suffered declining earnings over the past few years.  For the fiscal year ended May 31, 1988, profits fell 26% to $9 million on  revenue of $212 million.  </P> <P> In a statement, the company said it believed that its stock was selling for  less than its true value, which played a role in the decision by its board to  chart a new business strategy. CompCare stock closed Thursday at $11.75 a  share, up 50 cents.  </P> <P> B. Lee Karns, CompCare's chairman and chief executive, said the 17-year-old  company has reached "a critical point" in its growth.  </P> <P> "We are starting with a blank piece of paper," he said. "We retained  Prudential-Bache to decide what would be in the best interest of our  shareholders and employees."  </P> <P> Karns said he did not know if the company would sell any of its facilities,  including three in Orange County and one in San Diego. Nationwide, he said, the  company owns 23 hospitals and provides services under contract in another 170.  </P> <P> Karns said CompCare's earnings have been depressed for three years by a rapid  expansion program and by continuing repurchases of CompCare stock. In the past  two years, he said, the company has added seven new hospitals and spent $60  million to buy back 5 million shares, leaving it with about 11 million shares  outstanding.  </P></p>

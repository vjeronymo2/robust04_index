			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, March 17 (AFP)--China asserted a hardline  position Thursday [17 March] on the eve of an international  forum expected to condemn Chinese occupation of Tibet and its  alleged violations of human rights there.    Raidi, chairman of the Tibetan People's Congress, the  parliament of the Chinese-governed Tibetan Autonomous Region,  warned that militant Tibetan separatists would be defeated and  dismissed reports that scores of political prisoners were behind  bars.    According to human rights groups, several anti-Chinese  demonstrations erupted last year in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital,  and were brutally repressed by the Chinese authorities, who  carried out hundreds of arrests. Raidi, who is also vice  secretary of the region's communist party, told a press  conference here that "recently some separatists have been  engaged in a lot of activities sabotaging the unity of the  motherland." "Any attempt to undermine the national unity is  doomed to fail," he said.    The press conference was called by members of the Tibetan  region's delegation to the annual session of the National  People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp parliament.    Raidi also said that most of the 106 Tibetans, jailed for  religious or political beliefs, who featured on a list submitted  to China by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, had  already been freed. "I am not sure of the exact number, but  there are no more than eight or 10 still in jail," Raidi said.    The Tibetan authorities had "already received several  similar  lists", adding that "certain people" on them "did not even  exist", he said. "I do not know how they (western and  international organizations) compiled these lists."    As in the past, Raidi reiterated an offer for Tibet's exiled  spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to return home, but "as long  as he renounces Tibetan independence." "The Dalai Lama is  engaged in activities aimed at splitting China," he said.    The Dalai Lama, who heads a government-in-exile in India  that  has not been recognised by any country, accuses China of killing  more than one million Tibetans, arresting and torturing  thousands of his compatriots and threatening Tibetan identity by  settling Chinese in the region, overrun by Chinese troops in  1949. The delegation brushed aside the suggestion that China  had embarked on "massive migration" to Tibet.    Lhasa Mayor Luo Sang Dun Zhu said the capital had a  population of 400,000, of whom 87.21 percent were Tibetan and  11.95 percent ethnic Chinese, although there was a "floating  population" of officials and traders that could reach 200,000.    Tibet's economy is showing annual improvement, the  delegation  said, adding that a growth target had been set of eight percent  per annum over the next few years. The officials added that  Beijing was trying to scale back its military presence in  Tibet, thanks to improving relations with its "neighbours," a  reference to India. They they offered no details.    A hundred members of parliament from some 30 countries are  set to gather in New Delhi on Friday for a three-day conference  to debate China's human rights record in Tibet and its  militarisation of the region.    Dalai Lama recently warned in a statement, issued on the  35th  anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule,  that Tibetans were disappointed with his failure to demand  complete freedom for his homeland.    International interest in Tibet has risen in recent years,  and respect for human rights there has been named by the United  States as a factor in whether to renew China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) status.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Outcry at British Gas charges plan PLANS by British Gas to increase its transportation charges are threatening to drag the company into an embarrassing row with its regulator and competitors just as the inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into its business is drawing to a close. British Gas has proposed raising the fees it charges rival shippers for sending gas through its pipelines, in some cases by as much as 30 per cent. The company says it has been subsidising the transport charges of rivals for the past three years in an effort to encourage competition. Mr John Huggins, director of gas transportation at British Gas, said: 'We reduced our charges to a point where we didn't recover our full costs in order to allow competition to happen.' British Gas is allowed to earn a 4.5 per cent rate of return on its pipelines business, but says it has not been achieving this. In a letter to shippers, Mr Huggins said even the new arrangements involved the company subsidising shippers' transport costs by Pounds 30m next year. Shippers say that British Gas has provided no figures to back its claims. Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, said: 'It's a one-sided conversation. We have no basis on which to judge the returns British Gas is getting from the system.' Ofgas, the regulator, is also sceptical about British Gas's claims. Other shippers suggest that British Gas is trying to maximise profits in its transportation arm because it sees its profits in the domestic market eroded by strong regulation. British Gas says that the new charges have been expected for at least a year and shippers should have seen them coming. The company has deferred for a year further changes to its transport arrangements.</p>

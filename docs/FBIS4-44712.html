			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "Weapons Manufacturers </F> Asked to Scale Back Their Costs"; first paragraph is L'USINE  NOUVELLE introduction]    [Text] The worst has been averted. But since the new  appropriations bill cannot pay for everything, costs will have  to be cut!    The 1995-2000 military appropriations bill, which defense  minister Francois Leotard describes as "99-percent wrapped up,"  is slated for presentation to members of parliament on 20 April.  Though less than enthusiastic, those most concerned by the  package--the chief contractors for military programs--are  visibly relieved. Plans for a 0.5-percent volume increase in  annual equipment spending over the next six years make defense  look relatively spoiled.    But problems remain. Experts are unanimous that funding  programs which are reaching maturity would have required "an  annual 3-percent increase in the volume of appropriations." The  difference will be made up, first of all, by asking weapons  manufacturers to cut costs again. To that end, Francois Leotard  organized a meeting last Thursday with defense company CEOs, who  are prepared to acquiesce in the defense minister's request.  General weapons delegate Henri Conze has targeted productivity  gains of two percent a year. "We should make it," says Daniel  Rapenne, general director of Thomson-CSF. "In the past, the use  of (less expensive) non-military components for certain programs  produced much greater gains." But such a switch presupposes  coordination with the DGA as well as lower performance demands  from the general staffs. Moreover, this type of cost-cutting can  only be implemented for programs whose designs are not yet  finalized, and which have not reached the industrialization  stage. The Tigre and NH 90 (Eurocopter) helicopter programs may  be put on a such a cost-conscious diet.    But that will not be enough to stay within the total package  of some 615 billion French francs [Fr], especially since  geostrategic planning has highlighted other needs in the areas  of conventional equipment and force deployment capability.  <H5>  Inevitable Adjustments </H5>   For instance, the new appropriations bill included the  launch  of a tactical transport plane, the FLA (Future Large Aircraft),  to replace now obsolete Transalls. Germany seems interested in  signing on to the program, which would provide a workload for  Airbus partners, but will require France to invest at least Fr33  billion. Further adjustments of programs in progress, in  addition to those made recently, thus seem inevitable (see  table).    The fact is, France can no longer afford the structural  increase in costs caused by the growing sophistication of modern  weapons systems. For anyone who reads between the lines, the new  appropriations bill will confirm this. The only way out of the  vicious circle is to accelerate the European mergers for which  the DGA (General Weapons Delegation) has been calling and all  manufacturers have been preparing.  <H5>  Uncertainty in the Electronics Industry </H5>   With turnover of Fr36.6 billion in 1993, the electronics  industry, which does 63 percent of its business with the defense  sector, posted its fourth straight decline (12 percent). Total  business has dropped by about 25 percent since 1990. But Jean  Climaud, president of SPER (Trade Union of the Electronics and  Radio Industries), thinks he sees a few breaks in the clouds. A  notable cause is the stabilization of military appropriations in  1994. The new military appropriations bill will not prevent  painful choices, and with that in mind, SPER suggests  concentrating on France's strengths, namely guidance,  communication, and information systems; electronic warfare; and  optronics. Moreover, the need to further boost the industry's  competitiveness will prompt new reductions in staff, which will  have to drop from 44,000 today (50,900 in 1990) to 42,000 in  late 1996.

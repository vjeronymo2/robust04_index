			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Employers' body picks new chief THE Engineering Employers' Federation moved yesterday to fill the gap left by the surprise resignation of its director-general Mr Neil Johnson, who will be leaving at the end of this month. Mr Graham Mackenzie, president, will take on the additional role of chief executive from November 30. The federation said the arrangement would last for up to six months. The forthcoming departure of Mr Johnson had threatened to leave the federation without a leader during a crucial period of discussions with the Confederation of British Industry over a possible link-up. The federation said it remained fully committed to the talks, which will continue - as will consultation on the link with the EEF associations and member companies. The talks are exploring the potential for merging most of the federation's central activities with those of the CBI's National Manufacturing Council, creating the biggest UK lobbying group for manufacturing. A progress report on the talks will be discussed at the next federation meeting on November 17. Significantly, the federation said the work and roles of its 14 autonomous regional associations would not be affected by any possible outcome to the talks. There has been some opposition from association members, particularly in the west Midlands. Mr Johnson strongly supports a deal with the CBI, and is leaving to prevent the possibility of talks becoming bogged down in personality issues. Mr Mackenzie was formerly chief executive of UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings group, but lost his post in September after a reorganisation.</p>

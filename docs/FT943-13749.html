			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Istanbul strives to regulate its recovery  -The Emerging Investor Mr Tuncay Artun, the new chairman of the Istanbul stock exchange, is putting a brave face on Turkey's troubles. 'During strife and plagues, our weaknesses are always exposed,' he says in a colourful phrase, in keeping with the splendid view from his office overlooking the Bosporus. With interest rates edging down, and the lira appreciating there are some who believe that the market may already be through the worst. But the signals are mixed. Last week, Isbankasi, the semi-autonomous state bank, applied to the Capital Markets Board to have its A-type equity fund converted back to a general mutual fund. The move was greeted with consternation, for if Turkey's second largest bank, an institution perceived as close to the government, is seen to be reducing its equity exposure, what choice has the investor but to follow suit and shift funds into fixed interest instruments? Caution remains the byword. The Istanbul roller coaster has been extremely bumpy: in 1993 the index outperformed almost every other emerging market, according to the IFC, the World Bank's private sector lending arm, but so far this year the collapse of the lira has wiped about 50 per cent off share prices in dollar terms. Mr Artun likes to joke that he was 'part of the package', a reference to the austerity measures unveiled by the government on April 5. Certainly, since his appointment, the index has recovered ground, gaining 9.3 per cent in dollar terms since April 14, and 36 per cent since June 14. But the market is still driven more by short-term liquidity considerations than fundamentals. And with the government at one time selling paper at 400 per cent compounded annually, the crowding out effect on equities has been considerable. In one area, Mr Artun seems to be making progress. Last week he announced new trading rules, extending the settlement period and doubling daily trading hours. By next April, all share trading is to be transferred to real-time, a move which is expected to boost volumes. On the regulatory side, moves are under way to change the rules applying to the A-type funds. This is intended to encourage banks and other issuers to bring extra liquidity to the market rather than shuffling equity portfolios and dumping shares of less desirable participants. The recent currency turbulence has not been without casualties: 12 of the 112 brokerage houses are suspended and others are under scrutiny. The authorities have reacted by tightening the rules to prevent the use of repurchase agreements which are not backed by stock. A draft circular has also been prepared to curb the use of short selling, and stock borrowing and lending or margin trading - a problem which Mr Artun describes diplomatically as 'not illegal, but unregulated'. Attention is now focused on the results season due at the end of this month. Operating profits may be badly hit with the sharp contraction in economic activity. However, companies with strong cash flow, which have been able to take advantage of high interest rates to boost financial earnings, should fare better. Much of the recent buying has been by foreigners, taking advantage of the currency correction to accumulate stock before a market re-evaluation. Mr Tom Chadwick of London brokers Smith New Court says there have been 'plenty of good trading opportunities over the summer'. He warns that there may still be some problems in implementing the austerity programme, but believes a recovery in 1996 has not yet been discounted. Ms Radhika Ajmera, who runs the Pounds 40m Turkey Trust, is more cautious. She feels that the market needs some adjustment downwards after heavy buying by retail investors which has pushed the index up. Buying has been particularly heavy in stocks such as Eregli iron and steel (Erdemir), which the government is hoping to privatise. Foreign investors would appear to be the main beneficiaries of the change in the settlement system. Because of time differences, under the old system brokers frequently found that the market closed before their foreign exchange funding requirements were known. With high overnight interest rates, this could be costly if trades failed to settle. There are still some reservations. For example, at the end of the new afternoon session, Turkey's foreign exchange markets are all closed. 'As a foreign currency investor you don't want to carry a Turkish lira position overnight,' says Kaya Didman of Barings Securities. Officials are also worried that extending trading hours may encourage greater share volatility and more margin trading. The daily limit on share movements, for example, is automatically increased to 20 per cent  - which represents a 40 per cent potential price swing within a settlement period. One exchange official estimated that as much as 40 per cent of current volume was due to margin trading. The reforms will help. But over the longer term, Istanbul's prospects will depend on the government's own finances. For only if the government can curb its spending can the market enjoy a sustained recovery.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                 TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                  15/7/94  Week on week change                                  Dollars Stock                  Country    close    dollars   %  --------------------------------------------------------------- Eczacibasi Ilac         Turkey   0.0985    0.0271    37.90 Otosan                  Turkey   2.4233    0.6246    34.73 Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi   Turkey   0.1099    0.0280    34.13 Ege Biracilik           Turkey   3.5541    0.8241    30.19 Turkiye is Bankasi      Turkey   0.1971    0.0413    26.52 Migros                  Turkey   3.3926    0.5983    21.41 Chang Hwa Bank          Taiwan   7.0735    1.0876    18.17 Alarko Holding          Turkey   0.8562    0.1275    17.49 Tanayong              Thailand   2.7455    0.4046    17.28 Good Year Tyres         Turkey   0.4604    0.0670    17.02  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

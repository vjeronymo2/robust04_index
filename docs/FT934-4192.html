			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Pravda faces harsh truths of survival: Can Russia's newspaper adapt? On the front page of a recent copy of Pravda was a photograph of Andrei Sakharov, the late Russian dissident. Beside it a headline read: 'The Second End of Sakharov'. Instead of the cynical piece expected, it regretted his passing, and said his conscience was never more needed to bring to account the present powers in the Kremlin. Viktor Linnik, the new editor of Pravda, is not embarrassed by these new affiliations: on the contrary, he affirms them. Asked in what tradition of socialism he now stands, he eschews communism in favour of 'the tradition of Sakharov - of conscience and diversity'. Here is a turn-up for the history books, and one which is hard to puzzle through: does it mean that Russia's communists now see themselves as a force for freedom of conscience, as inheritors of the mantle of the man they denounced, mocked and hounded into exile? Or is it a mere tactic in the long war which has recently gone badly for Marxism Leninism, but which may yet look up once more? Linnik's promotion to the occupancy of the vast office of a chief editor of Pravda gives some clue. Pravda was closed immediately after the armed uprising by the parliamentary forces (it had been a strong supporter of the parliament). It re-opened after partly fulfilling a list of government demands. There were demands for a change of chief editor and that the paper change its name. However, internal debate was raging when Pravda was closed. Gennady Seleznev, chief editor for the previous two years, was losing out against both Ilyin, one of the deputy editors, and Linnik. Seleznev was seen as too hard line and insufficiently interested in reshaping the paper to cope with an increasingly difficult market. A staff meeting had been called at which the issue of re-election of the editor was to be discussed. But then the closure caused the staff to rally behind Seleznev. So when Ilyin was named as his successor and began talks with the government, he lost much internal support. A staff meeting, faced with a choice between Seleznev, Ilyin and Linnik, narrowed it down to the last two and then chose Linnik - the centrist of the three candidates. He is thus neither a liberal nor a hard-liner. In working out Pravda's new line, he will be guided, he says, by a view of the paper as 'above all an information medium, not strongly tied to any party'. He describes himself as 'a socialist, even a social democrat': his four years in New York put an American twang on his flawless English, and enabled him to make contact with some influential contacts. His largest critique of the government is that 'it is the real inheritor of communism: it is the one which uses Bolshevik methods'. He instances the suppression of some of the opposition press, the bias of TV and radio, the discrimination against far left and right parties. 'This will be our central cause from now on,' he says. Will Pravda survive? It is supported by a Greek millionaire with Communist roots and, paradoxically, it also receives a subsidy from the state which banned it. Costs of producing the paper are huge, largely because it continues to attempt to be a paper of the Soviet Union, with 22 printing plants throughout Russia and the former Soviet states. 'We should get state support: we are an institution, like us or not,' says the new chief editor. And here lies the clue to Linnik's orientation - it is to the state and to the nation, rather than to an ideology. His refurbishment of Sakharov is in order to bring the paper back within the fold of the state and its present leaders - even if he continues to oppose them.</p>

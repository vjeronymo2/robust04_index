			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Businesses slow to see benefit of market reforms: Leyla Boulton reports from Perm, where doubts are growing about the virtues of free enterprise When Pharmacy No 24 in the industrial city of Perm began selling sexual devices instead of medicine, it reflected the gap between the aims of Russian market reforms and their results so far. 'Sexual desire is not an illness and a pharmacy is not a sex-shop,' thundered a front-page article in the local paper. That Pharmacy No 24 finds it more profitable to sell devices for sexual titillation than scarce, subsidised medicines is as much a sign of a half-reformed economy as a failure of the authorities to implement the local equivalent of the trades description act. Not only are the local authorities and enterprise managers short of market skills and funds but the success of reforms depends to a large degree on whether appropriate policies are pursued in Moscow. The enormous protest vote in Russia's parliamentary elections on December 12, spawned by the failure of reforms to deliver rapid benefits, was foreshadowed in Perm by a rising tide of doubts about the virtues of free enterprise. 'We were being somewhat romantic when we thought that privatising shops would quickly provide new services and competition, lower prices and improve standards of service,' says Mr Yevgeny Sapiro, the deputy chief of the Perm regional administration, responsible for economic reform. 'People's psychology is changing only very slowly.' A centre of heavy industry which is also rich in oil, gas and other natural resources, the region of Perm has made considerable progress with privatising the state-owned factories and shops. But, apart from a wide range of expensive goods that have become available since prices and imports were liberalised two years ago, ordinary people have yet to see other benefits of reform. Inflation, now at 15 per cent a month, makes it difficult to start productive businesses; a widening gap between rich and poor is aggravated by the sight of young spivs, factory directors and corrupt officials making fortunes from trading while industry languishes. Mr Victor Gorbunov, the official in charge of privatisation, says it is impossible to expect significant improvements in the performance of privatised enterprises when inflation rates remain so high and ineffective anti-monopoly legislation is failing to promote competition. Although he says shares in more than a third of Perm's industrial enterprises have already been sold to the public as part of the nationwide privatisation programme, the central government has yet to create a secondary market enabling shares to be traded. The banking system can take weeks to transfer money from one Russian town to another. The inflation which makes trading the only profitable activity at present marks reformers' chief dilemma: whether to opt instead for anti-inflation policies that would cut subsidies to unprofitable businesses but cause a big rise in unemployment. Compounding the difficulties, foreign investment, which had been counted on to help overhaul the Russian economy, has been slow in coming, mainly because of the country's political and legal instability. Of the 100 joint ventures created so far, only a few represent an investment of capital and know-how in its ailing enterprises. 'You've got to be either crazy or very rich to invest in Russia now,' says Mr Andrei Klimov, a local businessman. Mr Vladimir Zotin, the local chairman of Democratic Russia, the anti-Communist movement incorporated into Russia's Choice, believes it was reformers' own mistakes that fuelled the backlash against reforms in the parliamentary elections. Mr Zotin cites as an example Mr Gorbunov's decision to allow privatised enterprises in Perm to keep kindergartens on their balance-sheet instead of transferring them to the municipal authorities. The result: factories sold or leased the kindergarten premises to private businesses, while 5,000-6,000 children remain without kindergarten places. 'In a worsening situation it is very difficult to talk convincingly about the delights of the future,' says Mr Ergash Narullayev, head of the Unity and Agreement party. But for all the mistakes, Mr Narullayev believes economic reforms have produced at least one crucial political result. By creating a class of property owners with vested interests in the changes, the rush to switch state-owned enterprises to private ownership has removed the threat of attempts to return to the old state-planning system.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rosy outlook lifts Dow again Wall Street GROWING confidence about the economy continued to feed through into higher share prices on US stock markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.65 at 3,307.33, the high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also finished firmer, up 3.23 at 435.29 at another new record close, while the Amex composite eased 0.59 to 394.36 and the Nasdaq composite added 4.93 at 666.53, its own all-time high. Turnover on the NYSE was 218m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1204 to 651. Although there were no new economic figures out yesterday, share prices made further gains as investors continued to buy stocks in the wake of last week's better-than-expected November employment report, and in anticipation of an improvement in economic growth during 1993. Market sentiment was aided by the reaction of Treasury investors to recent good economic news. Instead of selling bonds, as they would normally do, investors have been buying government securities because they believe that the stronger the recovery, the less chance there is of a new Democratic administration introducing a deficit-widening package of aggressive fiscal measures to stimulate the economy. Investors were also encouraged by the news that president-elect Bill Clinton has chosen senator Lloyd Bentsen to be his new Treasury secretary. Among individual stocks, American Express rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 24 7/8 in turnover of 7.4m shares as investors responded positively to confirmation over the weekend that the company's chairman and chief executive, Mr James Robinson, will resign his post next year after 15 years at the helm of the financial services group. ICN Pharmaceuticals dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 7 1/2 after the group's SPI Pharmaceuticals subsidiary cut its quarterly dividend by more than 20 cents and warned that it would not meet analysts' estimates for the fourth quarter. Gtech Holdings jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 38 on the news that it had won the contract to supply the on-line system for the New York State lottery. Family Dollar Stores fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 on news of a 4.8 per cent fall in same-store sales during November. Other retailers were mixed at the start of what is the second full week of the Christmas shopping season. JC Penney firmed Dollars 1 at Dollars 78 1/8 , Woolworth was up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 33 1/4 , Kmart edged Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 26 5/8 , Federated Department Stores eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 19 and Neiman Marcus slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 19. On the Nasdaq market, Kirschner Medical jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 9 1/2 on the news that Figgie International will buy a 20 per cent stake in the company for Dollars 12 a share as part of a pact that also involves a reciprocal distribution agreement. Figgie fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16 5/8 after the deal was announced. Canada TORONTO share prices ended mixed in uneventful dealings. The TSE 300-stock composite index added 3.67 points or 0.11 per cent to 3,293.09, with advancing issues topping declines 314 to 291. Volume dropped to 37,510,000 shares from 43,310,000 on Friday, and trading value was CDollars 311.1m. The industrial products sub-group posted the largest gain among the sectors, up 1 per cent on index, while consumer products were moderately higher. Financial services, mining and energy ended steady, while golds were off moderately.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN WHO STABBED COUPLE SENTENCED TO 6-YEAR PRISON TERM  </P> <P> A 23-year-old woman was sentenced Monday to six years in state prison for  stabbing a Northridge couple who brought her to their home from a Hollywood  bar.  </P> <P> Aurora Harris of Durham, Calif., pleaded guilty in March to two counts of  assault with a deadly weapon for attacking Edward Todd Hume, 26, and his  girlfriend, Heather Mahoney, 17, in what Superior Court Judge John H. Farrell  called "a frenzy of violence."  </P> <P> Harris punctured Hume's lung with an eight-inch butcher knife and stabbed  Mahoney three times. Harris met the victims when they and two friends, who had  been drinking, picked her up in their rented limousine in front of the Cat  House bar in Hollywood, Hume and Mahoney testified at a preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Her attorney, Public Defender Nelda Barrett, said the Aug. 4 crime was the  "tragic result" of Harris' abuse of prescription drugs. Before the stabbing,  Harris admitted that she took codeine and also had several drinks, court  documents state.  </P> <P> "I have no doubt that she wouldn't be before the court were it not for the  abuse of drugs," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop.  </P> <P> Harris and her mother told court officials before the sentencing that Harris  had planned to move back to Durham, near Redding, and enroll in a drug  treatment program.  </P> <P> Hume and Mahoney brought Harris to their home in the 17700 block of Kinzie  Street because she told them that she had nowhere to spend the night, Barshop  said.  </P> <P> The couple said Harris could sleep on their living room sofa and went upstairs,  court documents said. Hume later went downstairs to investigate after hearing a  refrigerator door open.  </P> <P> Hume said at the preliminary hearing that he found Harris spilling a wine  cooler on the kitchen floor. He tried to push her out of the house and she  stabbed him in the hip with a small kitchen knife, he said. Mahoney testified  that she heard Hume scream, "I'm stabbed!" so she came downstairs and tried to  wrestle the knife out of Harris' hands. Harris stabbed her twice in the arm and  slashed her across the back as she tried to flee, Mahoney said.  </P> <P> Harris then grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed Hume in the chest, Hume said.  She was arrested shortly afterward while sitting in Hume's truck.  </P></p>

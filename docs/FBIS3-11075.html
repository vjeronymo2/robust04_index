This  undoubtedly is positive news, because the trend of such an  important economic indicator remained stable for the second  consecutive month, even though it should be pointed out that a  great effort must be made to lower the cost of living in order  to attain the officially announced annual goal of a maximum 25  percent.    In fact, the average cost of the family basket between  September 1993 and February has not experienced major changes  (only around 0.2 percent), no sudden variations, which  represents a major stabilization achievement when taking into  account that this was during a period when inflation grew  significantly due to seasonal factors, such as the beginning of  the school year and the fact that March is the deadline for tax  payments.    All this is very positive because, despite a series of  political factors such as the specific case of the "Cantuta  Law," the economic and production agents basically show  confidence in the government's economic model.    However, what we consider substantive warnings must be made.    First, inflation during the past two years has experienced  an  invariable percentage of about 2 percent per month. That,  intrinsically speaking, is not bad for a national situation such  as ours. It indicates, however, that one of the needs of the  structural adjustment model is to invigorate the market's  reaction, not only be expediting reforms but also by what is  implicit: reactivate the market.    Through January, according to the INEI [National Institute  of  Statistics and Information Science], the GDP had grown 9.7  percent; the mining industry accounts for a larger percentage of  this growth, which needs to spread to the entire industrial  sector.    This means, therefore, that this year emphasis must be  placed  on increasing competitiveness. The economic reactivation must  spread to all productive sectors by two means: by the  establishment of regulations allowing national industries to  become fully competitive, not only at a national level, but also  at a regional level, because one cannot forget that the  reconversion must unavoidably be projected into large economies.    It also should be taken into account that inflation must be  fought through tax collection. So that Peruvian enterprises can  recover -- and, therefore, reduce their costs and the prices of  goods and services -- it is not only necessary to lower the tax  burden but also expand taxes and tariffs to more goods and  services, thus avoiding illegal trade and contraband.    From another viewpoint, in order to make the struggle  against  inflation successful (and so, in turn, its monthly average  drops) the Economy and Finance Ministry program must widen its  scope so it channels the huge funds being received by the AFP  [Pension Fund Administration Board] and the CTS [Severance Pay  Fund] in a more rapid and effective manner so the financial and  banking systems can make better and faster investments.    It should be pointed out, however, that the accumulation of  resources is not always positive if it is not designed to  accumulate international reserves.    The same goes for the funds being obtained through the  privatization of public enterprises. For example, the money --  which up to a point was unexpected in the case of the sale of  the CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National  Telecommunications Enterprise] -- must be earmarked for adequate  and profitable social projects because if not, we may soon find  that the foreign currency is converted into national currency  with an eventual negative impact on the inflation rate.    An additional aspect is, precisely, that the monetary policy  must continue to be administered with great care. We must not  forget that 80 percent of the primary monetary supply is  expressed and endorsed in dollars. And if the resources are not  used with full guarantees and in a profitable manner in the  short and medium term, we could be faced with inflation  nourished by strictly monetary factors or by an exaggerated  increase of expectations.    Moreover, and it is good to point out, although we are on a  good footing, especially compared to the previous government,  the essential thing in order to avoid a price increase and other  concomitant factors is to avoid new political changes.    When political instability is generated -- 1994 is an  electoral year -- the expectations of the productive and  financial agents may become excessive and cause an increase in  the cost of living that, under current circumstances, would be  extremely negative.    Therefore, in sum, currently Peru is on the right path in  its  struggle against the inflation monster. However, what is  worrisome is the fact that after four years of government, its  economic model, which undoubtedly has its positive aspects,  especially in the market liberalization, continues to follow an  extremely slow pace that must not last much longer.    Regardless of the unchanged indicators for a few months,  reforms must be implemented expeditiously, not only to attain  the 25 percent inflation rate per year, but also to minimize or  eliminate as soon as possible the social cost this will entail  and the threat of recurring inflation.    The average inflation rate considered acceptable in Latin  American countries is established, in acceptable and even  optimum terms, at nine points per year. This must be our goal  in the short term because, becasue we are drawing closer to the  general elections, we must avoid the resurfacing of economic  scourges of the past.</p>

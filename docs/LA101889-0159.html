			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> OC DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, MILITARY UNITS EXTEND HELP  </P> <P> In the wake of the catastrophic earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area  Tuesday, Orange County's disaster preparedness agencies and the military  mobilized today to provide relief to the shattered Northern California  communities.  </P> <P> Among the first to go was the California Army National Guard's 143rd Combat  Support Hospital based in Los Alamitos. At least 11 doctors, nurses and medics,  along with tents, tables and beds, were loaded onto a C-130 transport Tuesday  night bound for Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where the unit will  await further assignment. This morning, helicopters and crews from the 140th  Aviation Battalion at Los Alamitos also was sent to provide medical evacuation  services for the hospital unit set up at Travis Air Force Base.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, more than 10,000 callers swamped 38 telephone lines at the Orange  County Chapter of the American Red Cross in Santa Ana, which is seeking  donations, and local utilities and fire departments have volunteered repair and  emergency crews. Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said 25 lines are being  installed to accommodate callers from throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> This morning, at least 100 volunteers also arrived at Red Cross offices  offering to give blood or help in the relief effort. Stewart said 290 pints of  blood were sent by the Orange County chapter to the Bay Area.  </P> <P>  Stewart said the Red Cross is suggesting that local residents wanting to help  in the relief effort donate money to the national organization's disaster fund,  which was depleted by Hurricane Hugo in September.  </P> <P> Donations can be sent to the American Red Cross, Orange County Chapter, 601 N.  Golden Circle Dr., Santa Ana, Calif., 92711. Contributors should mark  "earthquake" on donation checks. Food and blankets also will be accepted,  Stewart said.  </P> <P> Also on standby is Orange County Fire Department's heavy rescue team, a group  of trained rescue workers and fire engines. It is awaiting word from the state  Office of Emergency Services.  </P> <P> Deputy Fire Chief Ken MacLeod said the department's four-man rescue squad was  dispatched to Mexico City several years ago during that city's major earthquake  to aid in finding survivors amid the wreckage.  </P> <P> Officials of Southern California Edison Co. in Orange County contacted  communities in the Bay Area and offered to provide materials, repair crews and  engineering assistance to help restore power.  </P></p>

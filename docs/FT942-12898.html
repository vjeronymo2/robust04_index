Central bank official Ms Elena Kohutikova said the bank planned a follow-up to last year's Dollars 240m private placement lead-managed by Nomura. Combined borrowing by the Slovak state and the central bank rose to Dollars 1.982bn at the end of 1993, from Dollars 1.625bn at the start of the year. This represented a national debt of Dollars 683 a head, up from Dollars 562 at the start of 1993, and equivalent to 35 per cent of gross domestic product at year-end, against 29 per cent, the official said.</p>

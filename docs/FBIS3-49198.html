To conquer the domineering elevations around this  settlement, the paramilitary formations moved into action on 30  December. On that day, early in the morning, the members of the  505th Knightly Brigade penetrated deep into the territory  controlled by the paramilitary formations and in the region of  (Zboriste), (Cagalica), and (Filarevac) and destroyed the core  of Abdic's forces, a statement by the Press Center of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army emphasized.    In (Zboriste), the forces of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  captured the complete command of the [?1st] Brigade of the  so-called Peoples' Defense, headed by Mirsad Huskic, and over  100 members of Abdic's army, with all their arms and equipment.    From documents seized, it was evident that Abdic's fighters  do not know [words indistinct] that they are poorly informed and  that [passage indistinct]. In such a situation Abdic is relying  on the officers from Zagreb such as Adnan Dulovic, former  colonel [words indistinct], and Albanian [name indistinct], the  statement says.    Abdic is trying to compensate for his powerlessness in the  military domain by numerous inhumane methods and pressures. He  is banning the passage of humanitarian aid convoys to the free  parts of Bihac district and attacking the UN members, the  statement by the Press Center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  emphasizes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Jan Kalvoda by Roman </F> Krasnicky; place and date not given: "I Am Afraid of People's  Apathy"]    [Text] Jan Kalvoda, deputy prime minister and chairman of  the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA], is a politician who, unlike  the prime minister, unequivocally favors the reforms of the  self-administration system. However, Kalvoda is ruling out the  possibility that the coalition could disintegrate because of  those reforms.    [Krasnicky] According to Deputy V. Dobal, the ODA has  reached the conclusion that the government is unreliable in that  respect. This is why they are going to draft a law on nonprofit  organizations. How do you feel as a member of the government  and, at the same time, a member of the party that is criticizing  the government?    [Kalvoda] This reflects tensions between the government and  parliament. This anomaly ensues from the coalition mechanisms.  Yes, I am a member of a party that is stressing the need for a  general adjustment to the nonprofit sector and has a strong idea  about the fact that a law should be drafted that would create  room for civic activity. All government members play this double  role inasmuch as they are dependent on their party and their  sector. The situation, however, has not exceeded tenable limits.    [Krasnicky] The prime minister yesterday signed a schedule  for reforming the public administration. Did you not feel quite  lonely when fighting for this reform? Did other ODA ministers  support you? It might seem that this is a Kalvoda-Klaus personal  dispute....    [Kalvoda] I do not want to divulge any details from  government meetings, but I can say that two ODA ministers, apart  from myself, were of the same opinion. This dispute is not a  dispute between two individuals. If you just look at the ODA  election program, you can see that the self-administration issue  plays a key role. We know that we have to implement this reform  now. Time is important in this case. The thing is that citizens  have to be given, apart from assurances that they have powers, a  new role in that self-administration. If this does not happen  right now, I am afraid that the apathy we observe today will  increase even more.    [Krasnicky] Vaclav Klaus is pointing to the risks ensuing  from territorial and administrative reform. He is afraid, for  example, that the principle of civic solidarity could be  endangered if the new system of local budgets is implemented.  Are you also aware of certain risks?    [Kalvoda] No. This seems to be a misunderstanding to me. It  has been evident since the very beginning--when we signed the  coalition agreement--that a self-administration unit without its  own income is no self-administration unit at all. This is not a  new risk factor. This is a needed feature that any  self-administrative unit must have, as a rack wagon must have  wheels. Documents that I presented to the government over the  summer contain two basic models for financing regions and lands.  We could also redistribute the financial sources through the  state budget, like they are doing in the northern, mostly social  democratic, countries--that is, we could try to set up dozens of  objective criteria, according to which money from the state  budget would flow into self-administrative units. According to  another alternative that I am supporting, the new units could  receive their income from taxes.    [Krasnicky] You have mentioned cooperation within the  coalition several times. What are the reasons for the  misunderstanding? Is prestige sometimes involved?    [Kalvoda] All the issues, whether we want  self-administration or not, whether we want nonprofit  organizations or not, are conceptual issues. As someone who is  present at the negotiations, I cannot objectively say whether  personal views prevail in this dispute. Emotions should not play  any role in politics.</p>

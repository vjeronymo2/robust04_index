			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (4): Flights diverted to Llanwern - The ecology: migrant birds are to be given a new stopover THE FATE OF the birds which have used the tidal estuary of the bay as a staging post on their annual migrations has been one of the most contentious aspects of the barrage. The bay, a site of special scientific interest for its avifauna, is home to thousands of over-wintering birds, which feed principally on the invertebrates living on the large area of mudflats exposed at low tide. These creatures themselves feed partly on sewage, emptying into the bay and carried there from other parts of the Severn estuary by the tide. Up to 40,000 dunlin, 3,650 curlews, 2,000 redshank and 2,300 shelduck feed there, with the winter months between November and March particularly important for them. Other waterfowl and invertebrates also inhabit the area. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Friends of the Earth and others have been unhappy at the consequences of the development on marine life and have fought the proposal to build a barrage tenaciously. The bay's answer has been to find another home for the wildlife. It commissioned Mason Pittendrigh, of Amersham, in conjunction with David Bellamy Associates, and other consultants to produce proposals to overcome the loss of feeding grounds. Their solution is to create a freshwater wetland habitat covering 650 acres to the south of the Llanwern steelworks, some 15 miles along the coast east of Cardiff, and a further 90 acres of saline lagoons nearby. The government has promised to put up the money for the scheme, which could amount to around Pounds 6m. The 500-acre freshwater lake is itself expected to act as a suitable environment for a wide variety of plants, fish and birds. The development corporation has been working with environmental bodies to encourage this, and has designed the banks of the barrage, using vertical stone walls in some places, and gently sloping ground in others, to create different depths of water suited to different species of plant. Three broad categories of plant are expected to grow in and around the lake  -submerged and floating aquatic plants, emergent plants which normally have roots under the water but stems and leaves above, and marginal plants which can occupy saturated land along the edges of freshwater lakes. These plants will themselves attract a range of small fauna. In addition, special areas designed to attract and support birdlife are planned. These could include shallows, small islands or rafts within the body of the lake, and ponds and scrapes on the edge of the lake to attract birds such as curlew and snipe which favour shallow water and exposed mud. The lake will be surrounded by walkways and will be stocked with fresh water fish, such as roach, bream, carp, and tench, all of which are expected to flourish and to play a big part in keeping down the midge population and to maintain water quality. Migratory fish, such as salmon and sea trout will also be encouraged to swim upriver through a fish pass which will be installed in the barrage. A series of related wildlife reserves could also be created in areas adjoining the freshwater environment of the bay itself.</p>

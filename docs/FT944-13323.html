			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Price Waterhouse case ends in HK Price Waterhouse, the international accountancy firm, yesterday settled out of court a HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 158m) civil negligence case brought against it by the liquidators of Carrian Investments (CIL), the Hong Kong shipping and property group that collapsed in 1983 with debts estimated at HKDollars 10bn. Details are being kept confidential. A statement issued on behalf of both parties by the accountancy firm said: 'In agreeing the settlement, Price Waterhouse deny any liability. But in cases of this complexity, it is often in both parties' interest to avoid protracted litigation costs'. The agreement, reached within four weeks of the opening of the Hong Kong High Court hearing, abruptly ends a case it was thought would run six months. The CIL company was once Hong Kong's seventh biggest. Opening the case, Mr Christopher Carr, QC, representing the liquidators, alleged the auditors had failed in their duty to act as independent watchdog. At the end of 1981, he claimed, Price Waterhouse passed accounts stating pre-tax profits surpassed HKDollars 700m, when, the court heard, the reality was a loss of more than HKDollars 270m.</p>

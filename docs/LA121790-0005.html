			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICS  </P> <P> Michael Merrill's call for change in the environmentalists' tactics belongs on  the other side of your opinion page ("When the Pill Is Worse Than the Poison,"  Column Left, Dec. 4). He suggests the victims of pollution must develop  alternatives to economic losses brought on by elimination of toxics in our  water, food, soil and air.  </P> <P> It would be far less difficult to match the funding spent by Big Toxics'  campaigns against efforts to rein in the abuse to the planet. Further, not all  labor unions are opposed to controls on industry's and state and federal  agencies' pollution practices. Else why did Loathsome George find it necessary  to gut Cal-OSHA and load the Farm Labor Board with big farmers?  </P> <P> LOUIS ST. MARTIN, Pomona  </P></p>

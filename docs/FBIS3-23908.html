			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "The Decline of </F> Romanticism: Nomination of Candidates to the City Assembly Ends  Today"]    [Text] The rules of the game set by the mayoralty  made contenders for the mandates face an even more formidable  task than during the elections to the Federal Assembly. Two  thousand signatures for an independent candidate without  guaranteed free advertising--this barrier is very hard to break  through. For electoral coalitions the rules are more lenient.  Having collected 35,000 signatures, they can nominate candidates  in all 50 districts and on top of that reshuffle them until the  last moment, searching for the most winnable district for each.  In addition, there is the opportunity to hold press conferences  to make oneself and one's position known. It is no wonder the  idea of a coalition has become extremely attractive.  Registration applications were received from 38 blocs; 34 of  them were granted the right to enter the electoral race; 24  realistically began signature collection. The big question is  how many will make it to the finish line.    It is already clear, however, that the romanticism of the  elections-90 is a thing of the past. No more boys with fiery  eyes willing to distribute leaflets for free around the clock.  Now agitators ask: How much? I was at the electoral commission  when they received a call from a woman who wanted information on  some bloc needing help. "What kind of bloc?" commission members  asked. "Democratic? Communist?"--"It does not matter. Whoever  pays more." Professional signature collectors get paid 400-500  rubles [R] for each signature. In principle, there is nothing  shameful in this--work has to be paid for. Except that not all  of them can find R17 million.    Directors of major enterprises can also help in signature  collection. Practically all the coalitions vied for their  support and, again, there is nothing shameful here. But suppose  all directors running in the elections suddenly win their  mandates--the future assembly will look suspiciously like a  meeting of party and economic activists.    We have a lot of parties. Good and bad, big and small.    There are some who think that the proposed mechanism of  nominating candidates stimulates the creation of large viable  organizations. Alas, in reality it only stands in the way of  their emergence. Some wanted to find sponsors; others wanted to  expand their electorate; in the end, however, most blocs' lists  resemble a Noah's Arc, with a pair of each creature. And it is  naive to assume that after the elections they will live in peace  and accord, remembering their joint programs. But even during  the period of signature collection the eclectic nature of the  lists has not brought about the desired effect. A politically  aware voter would find a name of one candidate whom for some  reason he did not like and--goodbye. A politically unaware voter  says goodbye much faster and not always politely...    The growing passivity became noticeable back in December.  Today it is manifesting itself to the fullest extent. Most of  the coalitions insisted on--and got--changes in the statute on  elections: They will be conducted in two rounds. This is good,  because it precludes the possibility of splitting the vote  between candidates with similar programs. On the other hand,  sociologists are sounding the alarm: A runoff election may not  take place at all. "Why do we need it, this assembly?" many  people ask. March 1990 was a time of hope. Placing our faith in  the omnipotence of the deputies, we expected of them much more  than they could realistically deliver. Much less is expected of  the current ones.    This is a good time to remember, however, that St.  Petersburg  is a component of the Russian Federation. In keeping with the  Federation Treaty, on a score of vitally important issues the  Russian parliament can only adopt basic legislation, leaving the  regions the opportunity to finalize it with local conditions in  mind. Many matters have been placed completely within the  competence of Federation components, and local laws need to be  adopted on them. In addition, it is necessary to make  adjustments to the existing regulations regarding disposal of  land and municipal property and monitor compliance. There is  also control over execution of the budget. Dozens of sore issues  are awaiting resolution, and the latter depends on who comes to  the assembly.    I hear sometimes: "Well, let the mayoralty do everything and  bear responsibility for everything." These are rather utopian  hopes. As already mentioned, a considerable number of norms and  rules must be established here, in the city. Are we to allow the  executive branch to set them for itself and then oversee itself  on compliance? Or hope that there will be a wise King Solomon on  each committee, who will resolve disputes fairly? The ability to  dispose of property at one's own discretion at best leads to  bias: Whoever they like more will get it. And practically always  the result is a loss for the city budget, which is already full  of holes.    It appears that the traditional Russian maximalism is  raising  its head again. While calling the mean golden, we gravitate to  extremes. One gets the impression that we have perceived the  idea of a democratic reorganization of society as a sort of  revelation that will allow us to build paradise on earth in the  shortest of time. This did not happen--disenchantment sets in.  And there is a real danger that the romantic democratism of the  late 1980's will be replaced by equally romantic  national-authoritarianism... In this sense it is not bad perhaps  that we do not look at our future deputies as saviors: This  makes it probable that we will elect not demagogues but people  who are willing to move toward the goal in small steps, and  engage in painstaking work. Of course, drafting laws is not a  romantic business. But this is precisely what we need today.  Otherwise we will not be able to either lay a foundation for the  new system of city administration or escape great cataclysms.</p>

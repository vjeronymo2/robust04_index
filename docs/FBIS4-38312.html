			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 Jun (MENA) -- Tonight south Yemeni  television showed the wreck of northern Yemeni warplanes and the  corpse of one of the pilots.    This came via a fax message that MENA received from Aden  tonight.    The southern television station referred in its Arab and  English newscasts to a communique by a southern military source,  which said that five northern warplanes were downed this  morning, including two helicopters, during a raid on some vital  and economic installations, including the oil refineries in Aden.</p>

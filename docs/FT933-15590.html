			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US and Russia in oil deal THE US and Russia yesterday signed an agreement to finance Russia's purchase of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) of US equipment and services to revive its flagging oil, gas and petrochemi-cal sectors. The deal, which comes after more than a year of difficult negotiations, is also ex - pected to create thousands of jobs in the US oil and gas equipment and services sector. Under the terms of the agreement, negotiated by the US Export-Import Bank, revenue earned by the Russians from the sale of oil and gas will be deposited in escrow accounts in Moscow Narodny Bank in London or Eurobank in Paris. Money from such accounts will be used to repay the Eximbank loans. In order for the deal to go ahead, the World Bank must release Russia from the requirement that it be the first institution repaid when a country has the currency to do so. The Bank board is expected to vote on this 'negative pledge waiver' in the next few weeks, but the Eximbank officials say they will not wait for the vote to move forward with paperwork on specific transactions. On March 30, the World Bank voted for a general approval of negative pledge waivers but the action still requires the Bank's board to grant a waiver to a specific nation on a country-by-country basis. The first transaction in the Dollars 2bn facility could be approved by Eximbank as early as September.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         OECD EXPORT CREDIT RATES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development announced new minimum interest rates (%) for officially-supported export credits for July 15 to August 14 (June 15 to July 14 in brackets)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- D-Mark                                       7.39       (7.51) Ecu                                          7.72       (8.00) French franc                                 7.73       (7.97) Guilder up to 5 years                                7.15       (7.30) 5 to 8.5 years                               7.35       (7.55) more than 8.5 years                          7.85       (8.05) Italian lira                                11.14       (11.7) Yen                                          5.40       (5.20) Peseta                                      11.34       (12.1) Sterling                                     8.10       (8.20) Swiss franc                                  5.69       (5.82) US dollar for credits up to 5 years                                5.53       (5.40) 5 to 8.5 years                               6.22       (6.20) more than 8.5 years                          6.61       (6.66)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- These rates are published monthly by the Financial Times, normally in the middle of the month.

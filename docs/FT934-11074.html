			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (2): ERM upset causes new anxieties - Antonia Sharpe examines foreign exchange risk MOST COMPANIES think nothing of paying large premiums year after year to insure their factories or offices even if, so far, they have never burnt to the ground. Yet many are only just coming round to the idea of paying similar amounts to protect their earnings against events beyond their control, such as volatility in the foreign exchange markets. European companies were starting to think that currency fluctuations were a thing of the past while the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was performing in line with their expectations. However, the exit of sterling and the lira from the ERM in September 1992 and the virtual collapse of the system in August this year, when some currency bands were widened to 15 per cent, has sent many corporate treasurers back to the drawing board. 'Companies are now worrying more about foreign exchange risk than before the collapse of the ERM,' says Mr Albert Maasland, the European head of foreign exchange sales and marketing at Chase Investment Bank in London. While the ERM was running under its old format, companies were content to use the D-Mark as their main hedging currency against the other leading global trading currencies, since the German currency was effectively the proxy for all the other European currencies. But after the ERM bands widened, this was no longer the case and companies could not take it for granted that the ERM would provide them with adequate protection. Consequently, they are having to hedge themselves against a far bigger number of currencies. This has led to a big increase in the trading volume between the leading world currencies and the less active European currencies. For example, trading in the yen against the Belgian franc has increased substantially in the last few months. The improved volume is actually working in favour of companies, because the greater liquidity in such currency crosses has improved pricing and the execution of larger transactions. In addition, now that the ERM no longer provides blanket protection against a wide range of currencies, banks have developed various derivative products which are designed to do just that. Bankers report that volume in derivative products has increased dramatically, because corporate treasurers agree that it is probably more dangerous to do nothing about a currency exposure than to devise appropriate hedging strategies. In addition, there is a consensus that the heavy currency-related losses suffered by Allied-Lyons, Shell and Adam and Co, the private bank since taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland, highlighted the inadequate controls at those companies and not that the hedging instruments were at fault. These derivative products, which tend to be traded more actively over the counter than on the exchanges, can be tailor-made to each company's individual needs. Their main attraction is that they offer companies a cheaper and more efficient way to hedge themselves against several currencies. One product which is becoming increasingly popular is the 'basket' option, which has been used for many years in the equity markets. It has since been developed to provide a lower-cost hedge for multiple currency exposures against one or more 'base' currencies. Such products are also being used by European companies which are trading more actively in the emerging markets, especially in Asia. Bankers say there is active two-way business in this area, because companies in the emerging markets are also keen to use derivatives to hedge themselves. Even companies that only do business in their domestic market are increasingly exposed to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market following the collapse of the ERM. UK companies were among the first to become aware of the indirect danger to their earnings, shortly after sterling started to fall against other European currencies. Although sterling's depreciation was seen as a godsend for the country's exporters, it has created a series of problems for companies in the domestic sector. Mr Les Halpin, managing director of Record Treasury Management, a UK company which advises corporate clients on how to manage currency risk, gives the example of confectionery manufacturers who are having to pay far more for their raw material, sugar. The intervention price of sugar in the European Community is denominated in the European currency unit (Ecu). Sterling's fall against the Ecu, combined with changes in the EC's agro-monetary regime, resulted in UK confectionery manufacturers having to pay more for their sugar. However, they were unable to pass on their higher raw material costs to their customers, because of the pricing war among the various supermarkets. Their profit margins suffered as a result. 'These companies suddenly woke up to the fact that they faced foreign exchange risks even though they were totally focused on the UK domestic market,' says Mr Halpin. One solution offered to a company in this situation was to undertake a series of foreign exchange deals, whereby it would be short of sterling when the currency was going down and be in a neutral position when sterling was going up. 'By using straightforward financial instruments these, companies can create a suitable risk profile,' says Mr Halpin. Some manufacturing companies that export their products neutralise any competitive disadvantages resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations by buying parts for their products in the countries of their principal rivals. For example, a UK car company is known to buy German gear boxes, one of the most expensive components in a car, so that it can compete on a more equal footing with German car companies both at home and in the export market. Companies which have been doing business in many countries for decades have not been greatly affected by the turmoil in the ERM, because they have been structured in such a way as to minimise the impact of foreign-exchange movements on their earnings. For example, BAT Industries, the Anglo-American tobacco and insurance group, has decentralised its operations, to enable most currency transactions to be handled locally. 'BAT tends to be fairly large in the local economies, so we have the ability to take quality decisions locally,' says Mr Richard Desmond, the group's corporate treasurer. 'As a result, our exposures are not great.' However, BAT also has a centralised 'netting' process, so that its foreign subsidiaries can set off any currency exposures which they might have against one another. 'We have an information system which lets us know exactly what the general exposures are in the group,' says Mr Desmond. BAT's non-remitted profits are not hedged, since they are kept by the local companies to build up their asset base. However, cashflows to the centre are managed actively by BAT's in-house treasury team of five professionals. BAT uses an average rate to translate foreign exchange earnings, but also uses options strategies to help reduce risk.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCHOOL PARLEYS RESCHEDULED  </P> <P> Centinela Valley Union High School District trustees have rescheduled a series  of private get-togethers that were canceled last week after a group of  protesters took seats in the room where the discussions were to take place.  </P> <P> The 30-minute, private sessions -- designed to give parents, teachers, students  and community members a chance to talk to individual trustees about racial  tensions in the district -- have been set for May 21 in the board room where  last week's demonstration occurred.  </P> <P> In accordance with open-meeting guidelines for elected bodies, no more than two  trustees will be present at any get-together.  </P> <P> Members of the predominantly Latino school board said the sessions were  scheduled as part of a 10-point plan to help ease the district's racial  tensions. But several black groups, including the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, objected to the meetings because they replaced  two regular board meetings.  </P> <P> A second series of sessions is set for June 12. Anyone interested in attending  a meeting with a trustee must sign up at the district's personnel office  between June 4 and June 8, Trustee Jacqueline Carrera said.  </P> <P> Though trustees will consider calling police if protesters try to disrupt the  newly scheduled sessions, "I'm hoping it won't come to that," Carrera said.  </P></p>

While he faces no narcotrafficking  charges in Bolivia, there are grounds to deport him because he  carries a forged passport.    Here is a report by Amalia Pando:    A capo of the Italian Mafia was arrested on 17 January in  Santa Cruz. He will be deported without any judicial  proceedings within a few hours or days. Four Italian policemen  arrived in Bolivia yesterday to take him away.    He arrived in Bolivia in August 1992 carrying an Italian  passport issued to the name of (Guido Lucatto) but it has been  established that the passport is forged. His real name is  (Salvatore Sciula). He was born in Palermo on 21 February 1950.  He is 44 years old. He is married to Chilean citizen (Claudia  Guzman Onoratto). He was arrested by the Santa Cruz Special  Force with the cooperation of the Italian Police and Interpol.    (Salvatore Sciula) was arrested at 0900 on 17 January. He  and an unidentified man tried to flee when they realized they  were being followed while crossing a downtown street aboard a  black jeep. (Sciula) was arrested but his companion is still at  large. Right now fingerprint tests are being conducted to verify  that this is the man being sought by the Italian Police.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ching Lai (2529 0171) and Chi Ling (0679 7227): </F> "Mysterious Success of Military's Transnational Enterprise"]    [Text] First Transnational Joint Enterprise Group  Ordered Established by Central Military Commission, General  Logistics Department    The military's first transindustry, transnational joint  enterprise group, which was ordered established by the Central  Military Commission and the Liberation Army's General Logistics  Department (GLD)--the Sanjiu (999) Enterprise Group--after being  in operation for two short years, has developed from the  original 34 joint enterprises, with the Southern Pharmaceutical  Factory as the chief enterprise, to 106 enterprises. It has set  up branch companies in 11 countries, including Germany, America,  Russia, Thailand, and Malaysia.    Not only the CPC Politburo and high-ranking military  officers  attach importance to the outstanding achievements of the Sanjiu  Enterprise Group; some major financial groups abroad with solid  strength have sought cooperation with this enterprise group.    What is the secret of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group's amazing  achievements over two years? Not long ago we interviewed Zhao  Xinxian [6392 2450 0341], general director of the Sanjiu  Enterprise Group.  <H5>  Recorded in Cambridge World Who's Who </H5>   Zhao Xinxian is China's first enterprise star, and in 1993  he  was selected by the editor in chief at England's Cambridge  International Biography Center for inclusion in its Who's  Who. The talents and the wisdom and courage of this  entrepreneur in management and in enterprise development were  displayed for the first time when he set up the Southern  Pharmaceutical Factory with its famous "Sanjiu Stomach Tonic,"  and his fame spread abroad.    In 1985 he led five young people in obtaining a 5  million-yuan loan in preparation for setting up the  pharmaceutical factory. In the first year after it went into  production in 1987 it achieved an output value of 11 million  yuan and a profits tax of 1.78 million yuan. Afterward, the  plant expanded the scale of its production year by year, and its  returns multiplied year by year. In seven years' time the output  value and the profits tax increased respectively by 60 and 52  times, becoming above average in the pharmaceutical industry of  the People's Liberation Army and even of the whole country.  <H5>  Pharmacy Holds Sway Over Entire Country </H5>   In 1991 the Sanjiu Enterprise Group was formally  established,  and it had a total output value of 640 million yuan; in 1993 the  output value sharply increased to 2.2 billion yuan, with an  increase of 330 million yuan in fixed assets, an increase in per  capita output value of 900,000 yuan, and an increase in profits  tax of 290 million yuan, not only holding say in China's  pharmaceutical industry but also jumping to 74th position among  China's 100 largest industrial enterprises.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji Says: Armed Forces Enterprises March at the Head </H5>   What is noteworthy is that, during the application of the  Sanjiu Group's armed forces-style management to enterprises,  effective "Sanjiu mechanisms" were found and summed up. First of  all, in fitting out the leading body of an enterprise, they  boldly broke with the tradition of the "multihead system"  forbidden zone and put effect the enterprise's corporate  representative "single-head system," thereby taking the lead in  the reform of the rights structure of Chinese enterprises, which  for the Chinese military was unprecedented.    The year before last Zhu Rongji went to the Sanjiu  Enterprise  Group to inspect it. He found quite admirable the fact that it  did not set up the position of deputy to the head of the leading  group, and he said to important officials of Guangdong Province  and Shenzhen City accompanying him: "Foreign enterprises are run  like this. The armed forces enterprises are marching at the  head. We must learn from the Liberation Army!"    Doing things in this way means that there is quick decision  making by the leading mechanism, there is no internal dawdling,  and the sense of responsibility of the corporate representative  is strong. In the words of Zhao Xinxian: "If there is one  carrier then there will still be water to drink; if there are  three carriers then even if they still carry water there will be  no water to drink!"    At present the several leading groups of China's state-owned  enterprises are often bodies in which the collective has the  final say. If there is a loss or an accident, the members of the  leading group can shift responsibility on each other and "it is  not known whose backside the bamboo rod should strike."    Zhao Xinxian thinks that an enterprise may be compared to an  orchestra: an orchestra can have only one conductor and can  absolutely not have two conductors. If there were two conductors  the orchestra would be in a total muddle. What the Sanjiu Group  put into effect was precisely the corporate representative  responsibility system, which "lets one person conduct the  orchestra, i.e., the enterprise."    Of course, the enterprise's corporate representative  responsibility system does not mean that the corporate  representative can make decisions at will and do what he wants;  there must be corresponding restraining mechanisms that ensure  that the decisions of the corporate representative are made on a  scientific basis, and ensure that the corporate representative  is restrained by rules and regulations and the supervision of  relevant departments, thereby protecting the state-owned  enterprises' maintained value and increased value.  <H5>  Boldly Improving Sanjiu's Wage System </H5>   The "Sanjiu mechanisms" of the Sanjiu Enterprise Group, in  distribution criteria, put into practice the 1:18 ratio wage  system of "drawing salaries according to responsibility,  calculating remuneration according to work, and dividing work  according to profit," which for the first time set a precedent  for China's enterprise wage system.    Zhao Xinxian said that in the initial period of its  establishment the Sanjiu Enterprise Group, when the enterprise  was growing and needed manpower, several competent cadres  resigned, giving as their reason that the "Sanjiu" wages and  benefits were too low. The families of some staff members and  workers played the stock market, and in one year made 18,000 to  20,000 yuan; and the cadres, who had made several tens of  millions and even several hundreds of millions of yuan for the  state, had an annual income of several thousand yuan, and  therefore pyschologically there could not be a balance.    Not long ago Zhao Xinxian went to Singapore on an inspection  trip, and he discovered that in Singapore there are enterprises  in which the wage differential ranges from high to low by more  than 20 times, and these enterprises are managed very well.  After returning to Shenzhen he reformed the fixed wages system  in the old way of distribution, and exanded the difference in  wages so that there was a differential between the highest and  the lowest of 18 times. At present, the monthly wage in the  enterprise at the lowest is several hundred yuan and at the  highest can exceed 10,000 yuan.    The Sanjiu Group's new wage system also stipulates that the  group's subordinate enterprises, under the premise of improving  economic returns year by year and of ensuring that state-owned  enterprises multiply their output value, can put into effect a  distribution in which the differential ratio is higher than 1:18  times. Fifteen percent of an enterprise's after-tax profits are  to be put into the enterprise's distribution fund for wages and  bonuses. For enterprises that greatly exceed the quota for  profits the standard level for share-out bonuses may float up to  20 percent. For enterprises that cannot fulfill the quota for  profits to be handed over to the higher authority, the standard  level for share-out bonuses must fall 10 to 5 percent.  <H5>  If You Have the Ability, You Will Be Given Money as an </H5> Investment in Letting You Display Your Talents    Zhao Xinxian says to people: If you have ability and also a  feasible project, we will give you money to start up a company,  run a business, and be the boss. If you are a talented person,  before you come to Sanjiu we will prepare a home, furniture, and  other living conditions for you. If you have a scientific  research topic worth developing and using, we will give you  money for the cost of the scientific research, and if results  are obtained, besides doubling your bonus, we will deduct a  proportional percentage from the profits made by the result and  give it to you, thereby making you a "millionaire" overnight.    For two years the Sanjiu Group has had a total of more than  90 competent persons in charge of leadership work at all levels,  and more than 40 cadres who did not perform well either have had  their wages cut or have been dismissed. The personnel  elimination rate is being maintained at about 15 percent.    After the Sanjiu Group reformed its distribution system, the  enterprises put into effect three major supervisory systems  (political supervision, economic supervision, and quality  supervision), and the effect of "high salaries fostering  honesty" is manifested there, because up to now there has not  been discovered one case of using authority to seek private gain  or of graft and bribe taking. Over the past two years, according  to statistics: cadres have refused to take 100,000 yuan in cash  gifts and have turned over to the higher authority 320,000 yuan  for return to the factory.    With regard to this "healthy phenomenon," Zhao Xinxian made  an analogy: "If a cadre's monthly wage were one carton of  cigarettes or one bottle of spirits, then, of course, one carton  of cigarettes or one bottle of spirits would be attractive to  him. If his monthly wage were equal to 10 cartons of cigarettes  or several dozen bottles of spirits, it would not be worthwhile  for him to accept one carton of cigarettes or one bottle of  spirits in return for committing a mistake, because they would  be of too little worth."  <H5>  Li Chia-ch'eng Invests in Sanjiu Group </H5>   The Sanjiu Enterprise Group, which has nearly 2 billion yuan  in fixed assets, which makes pharmaceuticals primary, and  conducts pluralistic operations, has now developed the scope of  its operations to 12 industries, including real estate, motor  vehicles, import and export trade, electronics, foodstuffs,  clothing, and banking, and has set up branch companies in 12  countries.    Wealthy businessman Li Chia-ch'eng [2621 0857 6134], the  head  of Hong Kong's 10 major financial groups, at the spring of the  year before last began to invest in real estate with the Sanjiu  Group, and in Shenzhen he built the 81-storey Sanjiu  International Building. Shortly afterward, some major financial  groups, including America's First National Bank of New York and  Thailand's (Chungta) Group, competed to become shareholders in  the group. An inspection team formed by (Yi Kim-chi) [2621 6885  0892], chairman of the board and concurrently general director  of South Korea's (Chukao and Nito) Pharmaceutical Corporation,  and (Kim In-san) [6855 0690 3595], general director of South  Korea's Pharmaceutical Trading Comnpany, inspected the Sanjiu  Group and its core enterprise--the Southern Pharmaceutical  Factory--and in South Korea signed an agreement under which they  will the general agents for the products of the Southern  Pharamaceutical Factory. America's San Francisco Mayor Frank  Jordan led a 25-member commercial delegation to the Southern  Pharmaceutical Factory, and the two sides signed an agreement to  set up in San Francisco an American Sanjiu company. Recently,  Hawke, a former prime minister of Australia, made a special trip  from Hong Kong to the Sanjiu Group, and the two sides explored  cooperation in tourism.</p>

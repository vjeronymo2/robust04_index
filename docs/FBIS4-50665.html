			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Evil </F> Intentions"]    [Text] Britain's news media have recently fabricated two  news pieces to slander South Africa and China. On 15 May, THE  SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson  Mandela, who has just been elected president, will "resign from  the post of president of South Africa within two years," and  that this would "cause a power struggle within the African  National Congress." The next morning, the BBC broadcast a  so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together  various pieces to claim that "China has 10 million prisoners in  labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation." When these rumors  came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully  by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign  Ministry.    On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report,  Mandela issued a statement which said "that the article is  totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create  instability in the first democratically elected government." On  17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to  point out that the allegations by the BBC were "sheer  fabrications."    It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies  one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander  South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark  side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see  advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under  British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast  off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon  a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable  development of the country; China, implementing the policy of  reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social  stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the  historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some  people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but  they have no alternative, and although they have tried something  which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis  trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful  means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors  in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the  countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to  interfere in their internal affairs.    The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are  "objective and just" in their reporting. But facts prove that  they say something in one way and do something another way, and  even play a disgraceful role in fabricating rumors to mislead  people. Regarding this, I do not know what kind of explanation  they have to offer to the British public and international  public opinion circles.</p>

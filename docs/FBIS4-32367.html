			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 23 -- Former Finance Minister Marek  Borowski stressed the continuity between the government's  "Strategy for Poland" and the economic programme of its  predecessor during Thursday's Sejm debate on the strategy.    He told his political opponents in the so-called  constructive  opposition that "imitation is not forbidden." He recalled that  during the last Sejm the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) when in  opposition had supported some of the proposals of the government.    The basic pre-condition for the success of the strategy was  the lowering of inflation, Borowski said. That was why the  government had to find sources of financing its budget deficit  beyond the banking sector. He said that the SLD thought that  foreign capital was such a source.    Borowski said the SLD did not favour lowering taxes for the  most well off.    He added that the constructive opposition should remember  that some of the points in the strategy would be ready for  implementation in three years time, when the present opposition  may form the government.    Waldemar Michna of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) said the  strategy created a harmony between the free market and state  interventionism. The strategy was based on factors dependent on  people not on capital.    All the parties which left the Sejm two weeks ago when  Finance Minister Kolodko introduced the strategy maintained that  the strategy was too general and full of wishful thinking.    Tadeusz Syryjczyk of the Freedom Union (UW) saw in the  strategy a realism in evaluating the recent past, common sense  in microeconomic matters and in agricultural policy. However he  added that there were also aspects to the strategy which raised  some doubts. He was not sure if the idea of a management board  for state property was not aimed against privatisation. Neither  was it clear what role local government was to play.    In addition the strategy did not say whether there was too  much or too little welfare expenditure.    Labour Union (UP) leader Ryszard Bugaj said that the  strategy  contained no real macroeconomic or industrial policy. He said  that there were too much tax relief for the already rich and  there was no provision made for increasing pensions or the wages  of public sector workers.    Wojciech Blasiak of the Confederation for an Independent  Poland (KPN) said that the strategy meant the "Latinisation" of  Poland. He said that continuing the policy imposed by the IMF  and the World Bank meant that it was a strategy for "dependent,  peripheral economic development."    Jerzy Eysymontt of the Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) said his  grouping was treating the strategy as a declaration of intent  but had serious doubts concerning privatisation, investment  finance and export. The BBWR would still be considering how to  vote on the strategy, he added.</p>

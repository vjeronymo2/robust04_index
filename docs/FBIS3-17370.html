			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 24, BNS -- The Latvian Democratic Party  acknowledges the necessity of agreement between Latvia and  Russia on army withdrawal, but it considers that the  unacceptable for Latvia regulations in the agreement and its  supplementary documents must be changed.    The party claims the initialled documents correspond with  Russia's interests to keep possibly large military potential in  Latvia and sustain people supporting Russia's attempts to make  Latvia economically dependent from Russia.    The party is against granting equal rights both to Latvian  pensioners and Russian military pensioners and their families,  and remaining of disbanded army units' officers and their  families in Latvia. The party also is against Skrunda radar  station's further functioning in Latvia for five and a half more  years, without even coming to terms as to the rent payments.    The party head, Aivars Kreituss, said Wednesday [23 March]  at  a press conference that the rent for Skrunda radar station's  usage could equal 40 million U.S. dollars a year. Kreituss  considers Latvia has to determine precisely the radar station's  created damages to the environment and demand a compensation for  them from Russia.    Kreituss condemned Latvian president Ulmanis decision to  meet  with Russian President Yeltsin only in the middle of April. He  stressed that the above mentioned problems had to be discussed  immediately to manage the revising of the agreements by May and  complete the Russian Army withdrawal by the fixed term.    The party members consider the publishing of the not yet  fully coordinated agreements unnecessary, and they condemn the  Saeima [parliament] faction Homeland and Freedom proposal to  organize a referendum on this issue, because it is not even  clear who would organize and finance the referendum.    The Democratic Parrty is represented at the Saeima by five  deputies.</p>

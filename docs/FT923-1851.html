			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Observer: Authorised by the Prez As the Bundesbank digests the volley of criticism slung at it last week, Observer's sympathies are partly with president Helmut Schlesinger's press office. The governor of the Bank of England had to phone Schlesinger twice last Tuesday seeking clarification of press interviews (in which the Bundesbank chief had suggested a more comprehensive EMS realignment might calm markets), to be told the reports were 'not authorised'. It is not the first time the professor has been misunderstood. In a notable instance when still Bundesbank deputy, Schlesinger appeared to suggest to Reuters that the bank was not in favour of intervening to support the dollar - a remark that had to be amplified next day. Again, last summer when he took over from Karl Otto Pohl Schlesinger was unusually forthright, in the weeks before he chaired his first council meeting, about the need to raise interest rates. While some central banks find this a good way to test the water, it was unusual enough in Germany to mean that, by the time the council met, its options were distinctly circumscribed. In contrast to the wily Pohl, an ex-journalist who was seldom tripped up by his former colleagues, the dour Schlesinger is more loquacious than one might expect. He also tries to impose a Beamte-like distinction between what is 'authorised' and what is not. It can be confusing.</p>

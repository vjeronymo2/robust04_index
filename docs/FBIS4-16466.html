			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed ADS report: "Procurement Prices for 1994 </F> Crops Will Be 180,000 to 200,000 Rubles Per Tonne"]    [Text] Procurement prices for 1994 crops will be on average  "not less than 180,000 to 200,000 rubles [R] per tonne." In  1993, this sum constituted R57,000. This was the conclusion  made 14 April by the Russian Federation Government's Food  Commission. In the current year the government will procure  10.7 million tonnes of grain into the federal food fund designed  to supply military and same-status categories of citizens, as  well as for other purposes, which is 1.1 million tonnes less  than in 1993. The government will allocate R1.6 trillion in  budget loans to raise federal grain funds and, in addition, 5.5  trillion to 6 trillion will be channeled for these purposes from  the state fund to ship foodstuffs to Upper North areas.</p>

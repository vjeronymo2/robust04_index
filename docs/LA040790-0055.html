			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF SUPER BOWLS NOT DICKERSON'S FAULT  </P> <P> Jim Murray is off the deep end again. I do not completely agree with the way  Eric Dickerson handled his salary complaint against the Rams, but everyone  knows that he was underpaid.  </P> <P> If you want to knock Dickerson, go right ahead, but don't use the quarterback  scenario to criticize him. Super Bowls are won the same way all other team  sports are won -- with team efforts, not quarterbacks.  </P> <P> LISBON C. MCCARTHY, Oxnard  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Comments on the Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received three comments on the proposed allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide. Two of these comments support the allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide for export to Article 5 countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The two supporting comments agree with EPA's proposal stating that: ``(1) The Agency has the legal authority to adopt this amendment; (2) there is a serious need for this amendment; and (3) this amendment will have no adverse environmental consequences.'' The legal authority to grant potential production allowances for methyl bromide was discussed in the proposal published October 14, 1994 (59 FR 52126). One of the two supporting comments acknowledged that, ``there is no contrary authority (within the Montreal Protocol or the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) to these provisions; therefore, EPA has the legal authority to promulgate this amendment to 40 CFR Part 82.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The two comments state, and EPA agrees, that the need for this amendment to allocate potential production allowances for methyl bromide stems from a need to maintain competitiveness in world markets for U.S. methyl bromide producers. Without the additional production allowances, U.S. companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other producers of methyl bromide in developed countries for the methyl bromide markets in Article 5 countries. The demand within Article 5 countries for methyl bromide is smaller than the potential global supply as currently allowed under the Montreal Protocol (100 percent of 1991 levels plus the 10 percent to meet basic domestic needs in Article 5 countries). Therefore, methyl bromide will be produced and exported to Article 5 countries, regardless of whether it is supplied by U.S. companies or another Party. EPA believes that it is important for U.S. producers of methyl bromide to continue to maintain their position in these markets as international contacts will enable U.S. companies to lead the global transition to alternative pesticides other than methyl bromide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The two comments state, and EPA agrees, that the allocation of potential production allowances to U.S. companies for the export of methyl bromide to Article 5 countries will not have a detrimental environmental impact. The allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide to U.S. companies will not change global emissions; nor will global emissions increase if such additional allowances are granted. Because the demand for methyl bromide from Article 5 countries is limited, the percent of methyl bromide that will be emitted during the use and application of methyl bromide will be the same, regardless of the supplier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The provisions in the Protocol for additional production to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 countries were included by the Parties for sound environmental policy reasons. The additional production provided in the U.S. by potential production allowances is designed to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 countries. The Parties felt it would be preferable to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 countries through production and exports from existing facilities than through construction of new production facilities in Article 5 countries. If Article 5 countries were to build new production facilities, the level of production would not be subject to the same controls as those in developed countries and more methyl bromide would potentially be produced over a longer time period because Article 5 countries have a 10-year grace period beyond the phaseout date for the various ozone-depleting substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The third comment EPA received on the October 14, 1994, proposal was from an environmental group that also expressed support for the Montreal Protocol and the potential production allowances for Article 5 countries. However, the commenter expressed concern about EPA's argument justifying the quantity of allowances allocated. EPA does not believe this is a valid concern as the quantity of allowances authorized to be allocated (the 10 percent additional production for export to Article 5 countries) is not set unilaterally by EPA, but is derived from provisions of the Protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The commenter also expressed concern with EPA's argument that if U.S. companies do not produce methyl bromide for Article 5 countries, another Party will. The commenter indicated that if this view is adopted by other Parties, it would encourage increased use and dependence on methyl bromide by Article 5 countries. EPA disagrees with these comments. As stated above, the potential global supply of methyl bromide far exceeds current demand in Article 5 countries. Therefore, there is no environmental benefit in denying U.S. companies the 10 percent additional production which is granted under the Protocol. Protecting stratospheric ozone can only be achieved through a cooperative global effort and EPA does not wish to put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in competing in the global methyl bromide market unless there is an environmental benefit. In this case, EPA does not believe an environmental benefit would accrue from a lesser allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide. Furthermore, denying the potential production allowances intended by the Parties to the Protocol to be allocated to all producers of class I substances at the 10 percent rate would be disadvantage producers without evidence of significant environmental detriment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWISH CALENDAR STARTS WITH ADAM SYMBOLISM  </P> <P> Christians know that the Christian calendar starts from the birth of Jesus.  Muslims know that the Muslim calendar begins with the flight of Mohammed from  Mecca to Medina.  </P> <P> But most Jews would be hard pressed to explain what happened 5750 years ago and  why the Jewish calendar begins with that event, which will be commemorated this  year on Friday evening.  </P> <P> Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, begins the introspective 10-day period  called the High Holy Days, culminating at sundown on Yom Kippur, Oct. 9.  </P> <P> By analogy to the Christian and Muslim calendars, it might be expected that the  Jewish calendar would start either from the birth of Abraham (the first Jew) or  from the Exodus out of Egypt (the birth of the Jewish people).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Choose Starting Point  </P> <P> Yet the rabbis in the 2nd Century who made up the current Jewish calendar chose  as their starting point the estimated time that Adam left the Garden of Eden.  </P> <P> The Hebrew word "Adam" means humankind -- the species. The first Adam  represents civilized humankind. The exit of Adam from the Garden of Eden  symbolizes the transition of humankind from a largely Stone Age state of  hunters and gatherers to the more advanced Bronze Age society of farmers and  city dwellers.  </P> <P> When did this take place? The most famous attempt to calculate "the beginning"  was that of James Ussher, an Irish bishop who wrote a book on biblical  chronology in the early 1650s. He sets the date of the departure from the  Garden of Eden in the year 4004 BC.  </P> <P> Although it might seem like a simple task to add up the life spans of the  generations mentioned in the Bible, it is not. First of all, the Greek  translation, the Septuagint, reports very different figures from those given in  the Hebrew Bible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 160-Year Underestimate  </P> <P> A second problem arises when there is no continuity of generations. Thus the  estimate of the time back to Adam made by Rabbi Yosi ben Halafta in his  2nd-Century book, "Seder Olam Rabbah," was too short because Rabbi Yosi  underestimated the length of the Persian Empire by about 160 years. The current  Jewish calendar is based on his chronology. According to this, Adam exited the  Garden of Eden and became civilized in the year 3760 BC. With the addition of  the 160 years, Rabbi Yosi's date is within a century of Bishop Ussher's.  </P> <P> Another way to estimate when humankind became civilized is to use the evidence  of archeology. Most archeologists believe this fundamental development in human  evolution took place in the Tigris/Euphrates Valley almost 6,000 years ago.  </P></p>

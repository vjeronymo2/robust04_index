			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- The exiled Black  Consciousness Movement of Azanian [BCMA] will return to South  Africa to merge with its internal but separate sister  counterpart, the Azanian People's Organisation [AZAPO].  Publicity and Information Secretary Vuyisa Qunta said in a  telephone interview from the BCMA's headquarters in Harare on  Friday his organisation would return at the earliest possible  date.    The future of the BCMA's armed wing, the Azanian National  Liberation Army, would be addressed after returning to South  Africa.    "We are coming back home to strenthen AZAPO in its fight  against deprivation of the black people, to strengthen it in its  fight against the landlessness of the black people, their  non-participation in the economic life of the country and their  generally poor social conditions."    AZAPO boycotted the April elections saying they would only  justify the inequalities created by apartheid.    Asked to comment on the 20 per cent showing by the National  Party, Mr Qunta said it showed the critical role that needed to  be played by AZAPO in urging blacks to be self-reliant and not  regard the white man as the "baas" of the old days. "The minds  of our people are in bad shape and a lot of work...still needs  to be done.    "It is often said that the strongest weapon that the  oppressor has is the mind of the oppressed, and this was clearly  reflected in the recent elections where the oppressor got a  substantial number of votes from the oppressed community  itself," Mr Qunta said.</p>

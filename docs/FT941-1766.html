			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Icy Sino-British relations show signs of thaw: The row over Hong Kong democracy may be near a resolution Britain's winter of bruising struggle with China over Hong Kong has given way to a spring thaw. Since Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) voted more than a month ago for the first stage of Governor Chris Patten's political reform legislation, Beijing has scaled back its attacks on the British. Last week Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, suggested Beijing might be prepared to draw a line under its row with Britain over democracy in Hong Kong. He said co-operation with London could continue in spite of the row over political development. This theme was taken up by Chinese Premier Li Peng this week when he affirmed Beijing would not exclude UK companies from the Chinese market because of the Hong Kong dispute. British officials are used to having hopes raised only to see them dashed. But the recent comments, together with other developments, were seen in the colony as further evidence of what in different circumstances Sir Percy Craddock, the British government's former China adviser, called 'the faint musical sounds of the lake ice cracking in the sun'. Beijing's more accommodative stance has been matched by London. Mr Patten has virtually vacated the Hong Kong political stage since he returned from Australia last month. This is a far cry from the political campaign which the governor's advisers were promising in December when Sino-British talks about Hong Kong broke down. In recent weeks Beijing has given the impression of seeking a resolution to a number of outstanding issues. The two sides appear to be closer than they have ever been to an agreement on the issue of defence lands. Senior officers of China's People's Liberation Army have been in Hong Kong to view the government's plans for 'reprovisioning' defence facilities - notably the HKDollars 1bn (Pounds 87m) construction of port facilities for the Chinese navy on Stonecutters Island, in the middle of Hong Kong harbour. Similarly, prospects for an agreement on the financing of Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project seem brighter than at any time for the past two years. Earlier in the year the Hong Kong government capitulated to demands from China to pump more cash into the project. China may yet wish to extract further concessions but UK officials say they feel a deal is close at hand. In addition Beijing has shown signs of flexibility (or indecision) in relation to Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. During and immediately after last year's failed Sino-British negotiations on the colony's constitutional development Beijing's position was uncompromising. It threatened to overturn all political arrangements made without its agreement. But the recent meeting of China's National People's Congress (NPC) suggested Beijing's position has become less dogmatic. Mr Li clearly stated that 'British enterprises are welcome to participate in the Chinese market,' adding that Beijing would make efforts to minimise the negative effects of the Sino-British row on bilateral trade. During the NPC, there was confusion over the meaning of a resolution on Hong Kong politics and an inability of delegates from Hong Kong to speak with one voice. A resolution proposed by Mr Cheng Yiu-tong, chairman of New World Development, a large Hong Kong property and infrastructure developer, recommended abolition of the colony's 'political structure' after 1997. In the end the NPC did not vote on Mr Cheng's motion. This gave comfort to those who believe Beijing does not want to box itself in, but rather wants to leave itself room for manoeuvre. Mr Qian's remarks last week were among the more emollient to come from a Chinese leader in months and Mr Li's comments indicated that Beijing was not prepared to jeopardise all aspects of ties with Britain. Mr Qian highlighted the work of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a bilateral group dealing with the mechanics of the transfer. The foreign minister said the activities of the JLG, and its sub-committee dealing with the airport, had been unaffected by the political row. His comments were welcomed by Mr Hugh Davies, Britain's chief representative to the JLG, who said they were 'very encouraging'. Mr Qian, perhaps recognising that Beijing has been losing the hearts and minds campaign in Hong Kong, went on to underline China's commitment to the colony. 'Despite a breakdown of Sino-British talks on the political structure arrangement of Hong Kong, China still cares about Hong Kong's economy and the livelihood of its people,' he said. But in spite of his softer tone, UK and Hong Kong government officials point out there is a long way to go before resumption of constructive co-operation on Hong Kong. Central to this is a resolution of differences over the colony's legal system. The 'localisation' of Hong Kong law - to bring it into line with the Basic Law, China's mini-constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong - has proceeded painfully slowly. There are about 600 laws in Hong Kong needing amendment; half of these are based on UK enactments and about 200 relate to international treaties. Since April 1990, when China enacted the Basic Law, only 30 of the laws have been approved, and about half of the treaties agreed in principle. Moreover, Hong Kong has yet to legislate for the Court of Final Appeal, the court which will supersede the Privy Council in London. Legislation is being drawn up to give effect to a 1991 agreement between London and Beijing on the court. Details of the legislation will, however, need to be agreed through the JLG. When Hong Kong government officials heard Mr Qian say that 'both sides should make efforts to ensure Hong Kong's prosperity and stability' they hoped he was referring to the colony's legal system.

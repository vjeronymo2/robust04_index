			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Republics to meet on debt impasse THE former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, are to meet in Moscow on Monday to consider how to service a Dollars 60bn foreign debt. So far the republics have been unable to agree to accept joint and several responsibility for the debt, a precondition for fresh credits from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Russia said yesterday it was looking for partial deferral of interest payments on the debt, following a postponement of Dollars 11.1bn of principal payments already agreed with western creditors. Mr Peter Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, said his country had to pay Dollars 8.7bn this year. 'This is a big sum especially when other republics are not paying anything,' he said. Ukraine has refused to accept joint responsibility for the debt, preferring instead to pay its share independently. One western official said the only concession on offer to Ukraine when it meets the former Soviet Union's creditors in Paris next month would be an opportunity for it to make repayments through an institution other than the Moscow-based Vnesheconombank. Ukraine is due to present its case to creditors on March 15-16. Western creditors meet next month to discuss extending until the end of the year deferral of principal payments.</p>

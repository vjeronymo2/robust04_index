			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Canals may help combat droughts THE SHORTAGE of water in eastern and south-east England, made acute by low rainfall in the past three years, could be alleviated by transferring supplies by canal from areas with ample resources. British Waterways, responsible for the canal system in England and Wales, said yesterday it was commissioning a feasibility study into whether millions of gallons of water could be diverted into canals and transferred south without damaging animal and plant life or affecting recreational use. Consultants are expected to be chosen within two months and their study should be completed in about nine months. Until then, British Waterways intends to continue talks with water companies and the National Rivers Authority (NRA), the rivers watchdog, to assess who needs more water and who would pay for its transfer by canal. Mr David Ingman, British Waterways chairman, said initial studies showed it would be several times cheaper to improve the channels of its canals than to build long-distance pipelines to form a national water grid. He said: 'We approached the NRA more than a year ago with our ideas and we could be up and running within five years. The next step is a full engineering and environmental feasibility study which is essential before volumes of water could flow, and we are now in the process of seeking tenders from major consultancies.' One preferred option is for water from the north-west to be diverted south via the Shropshire Union, Trent &amp; Mersey, Coventry, Oxford and Grand Union canals to the rivers Nene and Great Ouse serving East Anglia, and down to the Thames. Other possible sources are the Cambrian Mountains in Wales and Kielder reservoir in Northumberland. The feasibility study will consider the effect of extra water on locks, bridges and aqueducts; the number, location and cost of pumping stations; the protection of wildlife, fisheries, heritage and architecture, and the maintenance of water quality and the character of affected canals. Mr John Taylor, British Waterways water development manager, said supplies destined for public use had been flowing along canals for many years. At present, 148m gallons a day were carried, including 45m gallons which met half Bristol's daily requirement. The initial plan would add about 60m gallons, but other schemes could be added. The rivers authority welcomed the feasibility study and said it would consider any proposals to alleviate water shortages. Mr Jerry Sherriff, head of water resources at the authority, said the proposal did not offer a 'quick-fix' solution, but it could be implemented more quickly than some other options such as regional grids and desalination plants. Curbs on water use because of the drought affect 6.75m people. The drought is considered to be the worst in parts of the south and east since records began in the mid 1700s.</p>

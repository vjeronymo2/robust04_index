			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Australian tabloid king Rupert Murdoch has been accused of trying to change the  face of journalism. Now he's changing bodies, too.  </P> <P> This week's issue of Murdoch's TV Guide features a very slim Oprah Winfrey in a  gauzy dress sitting on a pile of money alongside the headline, "Oprah! The  Richest Woman on TV?"  </P> <P> But TV Guide admitted Monday that the portrait is actually a composite. The  head is Oprah's while the body belongs to actress Ann-Margret -- a circa 1979  Ann-Margret at that.  </P> <P> It's just the kind of stunt the magazine condemns each week in its "Cheers 'N'  Jeers" section.  </P> <P> TV Guide, purchased by Murdoch's News Corp. last year, acknowledged that the  illustration could be mistaken for a photo. But David Sendler, one of the  magazine's editors, added: "Ann-Margret should be thrilled because she's got  another TV Guide cover. And Oprah should be thrilled because she looks  terrific."  </P> <P> Winfrey, who appears to have regained some of the 67 pounds she lost in a  well-publicized diet last year, was on vacation and couldn't be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> However, Winfrey spokeswoman Christine Tardio, said: "Oprah had no part in it  whatsoever. . . . Oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that."  </P> <P> Ann-Margret apparently wasn't thrilled, either. TV Guide said its artist used a  publicity still of her from a decade-old TV special for inspiration.  </P> <P> "I think she was shocked," said her publicist George Kirvay. "If you look at  the two pictures, they're identical. It's even her ring on Oprah's hand."  </P> <P> The revelation comes just a week after a TV Guide article on television shows  asked the question: "Who's Got Egg on Their Faces?"  </P> <P> Greeting cards measuring 4-by-6-feet were personally delivered to the homes of  four county supervisors over the weekend. But the senders, members of Social  Services Union Local 535, weren't in a festive mood.  </P> <P> The cards repeated the union's demand for a limit on the number of cases  involving abused children and adults that can be assigned to each county social  worker. Local 535 vows to go on strike Oct. 3 if no limit is agreed upon.  </P> <P> The only supervisor to escape the deliveries was Pete Schabarum, whose house no  one could find.  </P> <P> At the residence of Supervisor Deane Dana -- who wasn't home -- the visitors  tied balloons bearing the message "Put a Cap on Caseloads" to bushes in the  front yard. A Dana spokesman said that the supervisor's wife, Doris, "wasn't  happy about having her flowers bothered" or about the footprints left behind in  the garden.  </P> <P> Sign on a cigarette machine in a trendy restaurant in West Los Angeles:  </P> <P> "We do not sell cigarettes. Cigarette machine for sale."  </P></p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Net at French insurer advances to FFr4.2bn UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the leading French state-owned insurer, yesterday reported a 27 per cent increase in net profits for 1990, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Group turnover rose 51 per cent to FFr97.3bn (Dollars 16.5bn). However, UAP said the underlying rise was 9.4 per cent, after taking account of the consolidation of its minority stake in Groupe Victoire, and its controlling stake in Gesa, the Spanish assistance and emergency services group it acquired in February last year. Net profits rose from FFr3.4bn in 1989 to FFr4.2bn last year, a 23 per cent increase, re-adjusted to 27 per cent after changes in accounting principles to bring UAP in line with international norms.</p>

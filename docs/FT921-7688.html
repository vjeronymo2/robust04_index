			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / US rethinks arms procurement philosophy: The challenge to stay supreme in defence technology as budgets shrink THE Soviet threat has for decades been both gauge and goad for the development of US military technology; its virtual disappearance is now forcing changes not just in the size of the defence budget, but in the way that money is spent. 'We are faced now with a different world situation in which we are no longer being chased by the Soviets or the Russians in the development of new technology,' says Mr Donald Atwood, deputy secretary of defence. Some weapons systems specifically targeted at the Soviet threat, such as the Seawolf submarine or the B2 stealth bomber, are being ended or cut. But it is the whole philosophy of procurement which is changing; no longer can the Pentagon rush new systems into production as soon as they are developed, regardless of cost or operational problems. 'We have weapons which have proved themselves to be the finest in the world, and we don't have to get into production on new ones just because we are chasing someone or they are chasing us,' Mr Atwood says. But with a shrinking budget forcing severe cuts in procurement programmes over the medium term, how is the US to ensure that it has the technological and industrial capacity to regain the upper hand if some future threat emerges? The Pentagon's 'new approach to defence acquisition' involves a much more rigorous approach to the decision on when to move a weapon system from the development phase into production. Many systems will stay as prototypes until all their technical problems have been worked out, and a real military need can be demonstrated. R&amp;D contracts are expected to move to a cost-plus basis, instead of forcing companies to lose money on development projects in the hope of making it back on the production run. 'In the past, the method of contracting with the industry has either encouraged them or they have encouraged themselves to buy in on the research and development phase, always in the back of their mind thinking they could get well in production. I think that's a cruel mistake and something we have to rectify,' says Mr Atwood. Mr Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives armed services committee, thinks the Pentagon's new approach is inadequate. In a recent report on the future of the defence industrial base, Mr Aspin ridicules the Pentagon's assumption that companies will be able to convert from military to commercial production and then back again as 'a kind of industrial triple somersault'. Mr Aspin's committee has in the last few years been particularly critical of Mr Cheney's policy of shutting down the production line for existing weapons and shifting funds to the development of new tanks and aircraft still in gestation, and has repeatedly written these programmes back into the Pentagon budget. This has provided fertile ground for Mr Cheney to complain of a spendthrift Congress forcing him to buy equipment he does not need. In many cases, Congress's insistence is motivated largely by the desire to maintain production in an influential member's district. While this is certainly fair criticism when it comes to buying more Meals Ready to Eat (the army's ration packs) when the Pentagon is still trying to give away surplus stocks to Russia, Mr Aspin makes a more serious case when it comes to major systems such as the M1 tank and the F15 fighter. Mr Cheney and Mr Atwood argue that the 8,000 M1 tanks in inventory have proved their superiority in Desert Storm; the army has no need of more or better tanks. Mr Aspin retorts that many elements of tank technology, especially armour, are uniquely defence-oriented: upgrading the armour and electronics of the M1 will maintain a 'warm' continuous production capacity. He cites an army estimate that mothballing tank production facilities would cost Dollars 758m over six years, and it would still take 51 months from start-up, and another Dollars 750m, to get the first tank off the line. Senior administration officials, however, say it would only take around a year to get tank production started again so long - and the condition is important - as the Pentagon preserves critical manufacturing capability for components such as armour and engines. Some industrialists, however, believe Mr Aspin's solution of 'warm' manufacturing rates combine inefficient production and high cost with only minimal reduction in the lead time needed to get the production line back up to speed. 'The conclusion I reluctantly draw is that maintaining a warm base for most items is simply far too costly to contemplate under the type of defence budgets being proposed for fiscal year 1993,' says Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta. Mr Aspin goes further and advocates low volume procurement - regardless of whether the equipment is actually needed - to keep suppliers in certain critical areas, such as nuclear-powered vessels, alive. Rebuilding a lost shipyard, Mr Aspin estimates, would cost at least Dollars 1.5bn and take six to seven years. 'If you want to be able to produce subs, if you want to be able to produce tanks - but there is no direct requirement to do so right now in military terms - you may need to produce some just to maintain the ability to produce some. That may be a necessary inefficiency,' comments Mr Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a Washington research group. Neither the administration nor Congress, however, wants to grapple with the question of choosing the survivors. 'He who gets the contract will survive. He who does not, will not,' says Mr Aspin. But this kind of industrial Darwinism could leave the US dependent on fragile single suppliers. The choice becomes particularly difficult at the subcontractor level, but it may be here that the most critical threat to US technological capacity is posed. 'The problem with defence industrialisation is really at the subcontractor and vendor level. There's a certain amount of guys where the commercial world does not have a demand for what they make, and nobody has the policy to deal with that,' says Mr John Ford, a former staff director of the House armed services committee. It is ironic that, before US generals and industrialists have finished applauding the triumph of free market capitalism over the Soviet system, they may be forced to back into a form of centralised industrial policy. BOEING, the aerospace group based in the Pacific north-western US, is this year to cut about 6,500 jobs in Washington state, or about 6 per cent of its employees there, because of Pentagon cuts in defence spending and a weaker market for commercial jets, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The company said the reduction, out of a total employment of 156,500, would be achieved by redundancies and non-replacement. A company hiring freeze, which went into effect last October, would continue indefinitely.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Smith reshapes party policy-making MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, has redrawn the party's policy-making machinery, with himself at the head of a pivotal new committee that will greatly reduce the powers of the long-planned National Policy Forum. The changes, outlined in an appendix to Labour's Agenda for Change strategy document, are likely to provoke controversy among delegates at this year's annual conference, which opens in Blackpool on Monday. They put Mr Smith at the centre of a core policy group of senior party figures and transform the still-to-be-created NPF from the party's key policy-making body to a largely consultative role. Under the revised plan, agreed by the national executive this month, the crucial decisions will now rest with a Joint Policy Committee which will also determine priority proposals. The JPC will comprise less than 20 members, 16 of them from the national executive and the shadow cabinet, and be chaired by the party leader. The new slimline body is commended as cheaper and more flexible than the unwieldy NPF model. But it also centralises decision-making, concentrates authority in the party leadership and ensures that policy plans opposed by Labour's senior figures will be dropped without wider debate. The Forum - originally proposed to diminish the ability of the conference to damage Labour's image by springing policy U-turns on the leadership - will be slimmed from 200 to 100 members and will meet once next year and not quarterly as originally planned. Charged with acting as a steering group and policy co-ordinator to the Forum, the JPC will also commission and vet policy positions drawn up by seven subsidiary Joint Policy Commissions, with sectoral responsibilities covering issues such as foreign affairs, economics, tax and benefits and constitutional reform. While the NPF will be able to recommend changes to proposals to the national executive - the ultimate authority - it loses its capacity to initiate policy. A party official said this week that the eventual powers of the NPF will depend in large part on the effectiveness of its chairman and the quality of its proposals. Explaining the changes, the Agenda for Change document says the new format will increase flexibility, allowing Labour to respond rapidly to Tory initiatives and to devise new thinking on the party's future. The move has also been justified as a necessary response to Labour's Pounds 2.2m overdraft and annual overspending that last year reached Pounds 1.3m. Man in the News, Page 8</p>

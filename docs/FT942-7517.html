			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / US and Japan agree to resume trade talks: Breakthrough has muted welcome in Tokyo The US and Japan yesterday agreed to resume negotiations on a trade 'framework' which Washington expects will produce increased exports in specific sectors and a reduction of Japan's trade surplus. Agreement was announced after five days of talks in Washington and a phone call between President Bill Clinton and prime minister Tsutomu Hata. They congratulated each other on ending three months of stand-off and vowed to strengthen the bilateral relationship. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said sectoral talks would begin immediately on cars and car parts, insurance and government procurement. He also hopes to launch discussions 'as soon as possible' in other disputed areas, such as financial services, glass and intellectual property. The agreement reflects an improved political climate between the two countries. It has become apparent that the failure of the February 11 summit between President Clinton and Japan's then prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, resulted from deep suspicion on both sides. The Japanese thought the US was pressing them to accept fixed market shares, as it did in the case of semiconductors; the US thought Tokyo was once again negotiating a meaningless deal which would not produce results. It was Mr Hata - then foreign minister - who remarked that the US would not trust Japan unless it agreed to numerical indicators, while Japan would not trust the US if it did. Turbulence in the foreign exchange markets and the prospect that the entire relationship was in trouble forced both sides to work out their differences. Their dispute had centred on a US demand for market-opening agreements that contained 'objective criteria' to measure progress. 'We have confirmed that we are not seeking numerical targets,' Mr Kantor said. 'Objective criteria will provide the basis for deciding if the agreements succeed or fail to meet their purpose to achieve concrete results.' Each group of sector negotiators will work out a set of objective criteria. In Tokyo, officials were guarded in their view of the breakthrough and stressed that the agreement was only one step towards resolving a wide array of issues over which Japan and the US remain at odds. Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, said in announcing the latest agreement that the two sides had agreed not to use numerical targets as 'objective criteria' for measuring progress in opening Japan's markets. Mr Kakizawa said, in his view, the US would not impose sanctions based on such criteria. Japanese business leaders welcomed the breakthrough. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor and chairman-elect of Keidanren, Japan's Federation of Economic Organisations, said the resumption of the talks was welcome but the issue of greater imports of foreign vehicle parts should be decided by private industry. US officials have said they would like to reach sectoral agreements in time for them to be signed at the Group of Seven summit in July. However, Mr Kantor said the new framework did not contain a timetable for reaching specific agreements. 'Both countries are committed to moving as quickly as possible.'

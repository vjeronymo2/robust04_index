			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / US to lift Cambodia trade ban: Bush announcement will be further step to end Vietnam war legacy PRESIDENT George Bush is expected today to lift the 16-year-old US trade embargo on Cambodia in recognition of the progress toward peace and free elections in the country once ravaged by the Khmer Rouge. The announcement would mark a further step toward laying the legacy of the Vietnam war to rest, and Mr Bush is expected to unveil it in a speech in Singapore, the second stop on the president's four-nation Pacific tour. Mr Bush has made expanded trade with the region his top priority during his 12-day trip, but he arrived in Singapore yesterday prepared to deal mainly with security issues stemming from the forced US withdrawal from Subic Naval Base in the Philippines. Mr Bush is looking to Singapore to help fill the gap, allowing the US to show its Asian allies that it intends to retain a major military presence in the region despite the end of the Cold War. One specific US proposal is to move its Naval Task Force Command headquarters from Subic Bay in the Philippines, including the relocation of up to 200 personnel which form the Seventh Fleet's logistical unit. Mr Bush will raise the issue in talks today with Singaporean President Wee Kim Wee and Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister. Initial signs are encouraging that an agreement can be reached, according to a senior US official. The official said: 'We're coming here to an end of one age and the beginning of another in terms of the Cold War. It's important to see Singapore as part of a network of basing facilities around the Pacific.' If the two sides reach agreement it would expand their 14-month-old bilateral pact allowing the US expanded rights to use Singaporean bases. The US is also expected to approach Malaysia and Thailand to open their ports, boosting a security network that already includes Japan, South Korea, Guam and Hawaii. During his visit, Mr Bush will also meet Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled Singapore for more than 31 years. Mr Lee, who stepped down in November 1990, remains the dominant political presence behind the scenes. On his first stop in Australia this week, Mr Bush was roasted by farmers complaining about US export subsidies for wheat. But the president, often sounding like a candidate for re-election rather than a head of state, sided vigorously with American farmers and lashed out at Japan and the European Community for protectionism. Mr Bush is being accompanied on his trip by 21 senior US corporate executives, including the top three Detroit car manufacturers. He has warned several times that he expects trade concessions from Japan, raising alarm in Tokyo where he arrives next week. The US trade embargo against Cambodia has been in effect since April 1975. After the UN-sponsored peace accords were signed in Paris in November between Vietnam and members of rival Cambodian factions, including the Khmer Rouge, the US sent a special envoy to Phnom Penh to work out peace arrangements and free elections. Mr Bush's speech will be watched closely for signs that he may be willing this year to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. The two former adversaries have been edging toward normalisation of relations over the past 18 months, a process slowed by US concern over missing servicemen from the Vietnam war. Cambodia said yesterday it would free 400 more political prisoners, but the International Red Cross said Phnom Penh was violating the peace accord by not freeing all such prisoners, AP adds from Phnom Penh. Mr Jean-Jacques Fresard, chief Red Cross delegate, said the prisoners were only a small part of the roughly 2,000 political prisoners and POWs still being held.</p>

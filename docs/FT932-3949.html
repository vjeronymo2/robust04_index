			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Ferruzzi The restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison is an acid test for Italian capitalism. The 1988 deal by which Meta, Montedison's retail and financial services subsidiary, was shunted into the then unquoted Ferruzzi remains a notorious example of how not to treat minority shareholders. The sight of Mediobanca once again orchestrating raises old fears. The hope must be that Italy's desire to maintain international goodwill - notably for the privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two of the creditor banks - will dictate an equitable solution. Since the Bank of Italy has been pressing for banks to be allowed wider shareholdings, a debt-for-equity swap could be on the cards. The danger then lies in letting the banks walk away with too much. Despite its debts, the empire contains some attractive assets. A large slice of debt will be deconsolidated if the proposed plastics venture with Shell can be tied up. The Edison power business is another jewel, as is Fondiaria insurance, if Ferruzzi can be persuaded to sell. The broader question is how another of Italy's big industrial groups has been allowed to get into such a mess. The lack of big institutional investors to keep management in check must be partly to blame. Perhaps the advent of private pension funds will tilt the balance of power. The state-owned banking system has also been too willing to support corporate giants. An orderly break-up for Ferruzzi - and privatisation for the banks - cannot come soon enough.</p>

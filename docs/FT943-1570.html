			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Observer: Blue-eyed boy What a relief. When China finally gets its hands on Hong Kong in 1997, nothing will change except 'a yellow-faced Chinese, not a blue-eyed British' will be in charge. And that's reasonably official, coming as it does from China's ambassador in Singapore, Yang Wenchang. 'Even driving will be on the left side of the road. In China we drive on the right side,' he added. Large ones all round at the Jockey Club please.</p>

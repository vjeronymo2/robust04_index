			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: Turkey ready to court world's banks again TURKEY is preparing to turn back to international banks for cash for the first time since a disastrous attempt to raise Dollars 200m foundered last year. Last year, banks were offered a loan margin of 90 basis points (0.9 percentage point) over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). 'It was at least 40 basis points too cheap at the time,' one banker said last week. As a result, the republic is expected to have to pay significantly more to guarantee a successful deal this time around. It has retained a group of banks to lead the deal, among them JP Morgan and Citibank, which will reach agreement on the pricing of the loan by consensus. Only last week, Turkey offered the equivalent of around 1.8 percentage point over Libor to investors in its first issue of Ecu in the Eurobond market. Bankers said it would probably have to pay even more than that to attract banks to lend it money, given the perceived greater liquidity of bonds compared with bank loans. Turkey last week narrowly succeeded in achieving investment-grade status when it was awarded a BBB rating from the two leading US rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's.</p>

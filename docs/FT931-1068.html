			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Russia's politicians try to exploit crisis AFTER a week of intense political manoeuvring the main centres of power in Russia find themselves operating outside the constitution. If a compromise can be reached involving President Yeltsin, parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies and the Constitutional Court, it will be between politicians unsure of their authority and the validity of the agreements they may sign. Into this vacuum, other forces are rushing, seeking to take advantage of an increasingly lawless space. The radical democrats, Mr Yeltsin's traditional power base, still support him because they have nowhere else to go. Yet, as Mr Yuri Afanasiev of the radical Civil Initiative Group said on Wednesday, they fear that Mr Yeltsin's call for a national popular vote on his presidency and a new constitution is merely another 'political bargaining chip' to be cashed in for yet another compromise. For the hardline communists and nationalists, still demanding Mr Yeltsin's impeachment yesterday, in spite of the apparent turn-around on the issue by the parliamentary speaker, Mr Ruslan Kasbulatov, the president must be removed because of his continued espousal of radical market reform. The revived Communist party, which has a number of determined politicians in its leadership, has identified the popular dissatisfaction with reform as their main political weapon and will pursue this whether or not Mr Yeltsin survives any vote today But the centrist group now appears not to have the will to pursue Mr Yeltsin to this conclusion. Mr Khasbulatov's breathtaking throwaway remark yesterday that 'frankly speaking, I'm no supporter of impeachment' shows that he reckons he has not got the votes for it. He is probably preparing to hobble Mr Yeltsin through the use of stripping him of his powers if he oversteps his authority. The centrist position was rehearsed in yesterday's Rossiskaya Gazeta by Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, deputy head of the Union of Industrialists and chairman of the 'Obnovleniye' (Renewal) party. Playing down the issue which has convulsed Russian political life, Mr Vladislavlev said reform was proceeding in enterprises large and small, and that a government of national unity was needed. The centrists really are centrists. They recoil from the radical reform of Mr Yeltsin's cabinet. But, when push comes to shove, they recoil also from the fury of the hardliners. They wish to constrain, but not to dismiss, the president. A common position now emerges - the call, voiced by Mr Vladislavlev, by the trade unions, by leaders of autonomous republics and the regions for elections for a president and for a parliament. So fluid is the political situation that almost every group believes it has a chance to improve its position.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 15 -- A mission of the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) led by Deputy Head of the IMF's European  Department Michael Deppler has agreed with the Polish side a  draft stand-by agreement, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance  Minister Grzegorz Kolodko and Deppler announced on Wednesday.  It is expected that Poland and the IMF will sign the 18-month  stand-by agreement end of July, early August, 1994. By the end  of 1995, Poland is to obtain 900 million dollars for the  financing of imports and agreements with the London Club on the  buying back of the Polish debt.    Deppler stated that the IMF mission familiarized itself with  the "Strategy for Poland" economic development plan and praised  its approach on the issues concerning the agreement with the IMF.    The "strategy" is a realistic programme, Deppler said at the  end of the mission's two-week visit but added that the agreed  draft is an initial version and the final outcome will hinge on  the results of talks with the London Club.    The draft has to be approved by the IMF managing director  and  the Polish Government. Deppler announced that the new agreement  is likely to be approved by the IMF's board of executive  directors in early August.    Kolodko claimed that the medium-term agreement with the IMF  will concern the targets Poland wants to achieve, which are also  included in the "Strategy for Poland," including a fall of  inflation rate, the budget deficit and the defining of an active  credit policy plus the level of interest rates. The draft also  envisages the stability of Poland's foreign exchange reserves,  Kolodko added.    Asked about the agreement's performance criteria, Kolodko  said the 1994 budget deficit is to agree with the level set by  the budget law and in 1995 it should not exceed 3.7 per cent of  the GDP. The inflation rate fixed at 16 per cent is also in  accordance with the "Strategy" guidelines.    Kolodko went on to say that the draft stand-by agreement  does  not envisage non-financial criteria but the "implementation of  monetary targets depends on difficult measures in the sphere of  social security," the finance minister argued.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Written comments were received from the Thunder Basin Coal Company (TBCC) (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;18). TBCC supported the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. A summary of the comments, and the Directors responses to them, appear below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI)_Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USDI_Bureau of Mines, USDI_Geological Survey, and the U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health Administration each responded that it had no comment (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;25&hyph;22, WY&hyph;25&hyph;14, WY&hyph;25&hyph;16, WY&hyph;25&hyph;15, and WY&hyph;25&hyph;17 respectively). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) recommended that, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The State program be as specific as possible pertaining to time and space requirements for contemporaneous reclamation and not completely rely on the development of case by case individual permits requirements. We believe, if there is not adequate standards established, the State Program will have difficulty in maintaining consistency and compliance with the intent of the Reclamation Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;20) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed previously, the State's contemporaneous reclamation regulations are as stringent and as effective as the corresponding provisions in SMCRA and the Federal regulations. OSM is not authorized by SMCRA to require State programs to be more stringent than SMCRA or more effective than the Federal regulations. OSM cannot, therefore, require Wyoming to further amend its program in response to the FWS's comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, commented that the proposed changes seem to be logical and valid (administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and the ACHP for comment. No comments were received from the ACHP. The Wyoming Division of Parks and Cultural Resources_State Historic Preservation Office commented by reminding OSM that management of cultural resources on OSM projects is conducted in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Advisory Council regulations at 36 CFR part 800. The SHPO had no objections to the proposed Wyoming amendment provided that OSM follows the procedures contained in 36 CFR part 800 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;19). OSM assures the SHPO that it is obligated to follow the procedures at 36 CFR part 800. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency Concurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to provisions of a State program amendment which relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 7, 1994, the EPA replied that it had no comment on Wyoming's proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;13). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Director's Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above findings, the Director approves Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted May 1, 1986, and as subsequently clarified on November 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undo delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Procedural Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA CHURCH HIT BY THIEVES  </P> <P> Thieves made off with four wooden benches from the Church of the Angels in  Pasadena earlier this week, police said.  </P> <P> The benches, valued at $1,500, had been installed as part a restoration that  began in 1983, said the Rev. Robert Gaestel, vicar of the Episcopal church on  Avenue 64.  </P> <P> Gaestel said one of the benches, gold with an arch pattern on the backrest, was  a special loss.  </P> <P> "It was beautiful," he said. "It was a real work of art. It wasn't just thrown  together."  </P> <P> The three other benches were a gift of Alice Thomas, a parishioner.  </P> <P> The theft, which happened Sunday night, occurred only a week before the  church's observance of the 100th anniversary of its consecration.  </P></p>

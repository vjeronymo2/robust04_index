			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: A lively look at death Post Mortem is a short, angry, anti-war play by Noel Coward, unstaged since he wrote it on a steamer in 1930. Now The King's Head Theatre, Islington, has brought the play to life in a lucid, engaging production. It is 1917. John Cavan dies in action in France. But his perturbed spirit stretches the moment of death into 13 mortal years. He returns to see family and friends in 1930 to look at the war from then. His idealism at death meets their compromises during the post-war years. Only one fellow officer, Perry Lomas, remembers the war: he has written an anti-war book called 'Post Mortem'. The play amounts to a series of encounters: there is unfinished business with Cavan's mother and fiancee; and an awkward reunion with his army friends. The sternest test of Cavan's beliefs comes in his exchange with Lomas, a dispirited agnostic inveighing against an English conspiracy to cover over the war. When Cavan appears, Lomas is about to kill himself: 'Don't put me off, there's a good chap, it's all I've got to look forward to.' All of Coward is in this scene: his despair of English class, his horror at English following of rules, and his Swiftian love of people as individually pleasant but collectively idiotic. The plot lies between Tennyson's In Memoriam and Truly, Madly, Deeply. The former asks 'Do we indeed desire the dead should still be with us at our side?', the other plunges into afterlife drama. Here, Coward manages to imbue the creepiness of Cavan's visitation with the social swing of a visit. The wit erupts occasionally: 'Are they in love?' asks Cavan. 'I don't know - they go to the opera together,' his mother replies. Richard Stirling's direction and Mark Friend's design for this small theatre both work well. Steven Pacey acts Lomas superbly, a model of unquiet resolve; Harry Burton as Cavan keeps pace with the demands of the part, but looks unmoved and unmoving. Opposite him, his father, Sir James 'Jumbo' Cavan (Roy Sampson), proprietor of The Mercury is a horror of hypocrisy. The tricks of time resemble TS Eliot's work in the 1920s. There are spots of thoughtful lyricism: 'Youth is a long way away, it doesn't matter any more . . . Life's a joke with no one to laugh at it.' Really, life's a slow way of dying. Post Mortem, The King's Head, Islington, London for six weeks (071 226 1916)</p>

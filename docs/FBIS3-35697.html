Twice the barricades outside  the White House have been dismantled but they still stand firmly  in people's awareness, dividing them into two hostile camps.    The flames of confrontation are not being left without fuel.  The trial over the State Committee for the State of Emergency  case is continuing -- an absurd trial of people who tried to  encroach on power in a state which no longer exists. From their  uncomfortable dock the accused have already moved to seats in  the Federal Assembly, having received a vote of confidence from  voters. Yet the trial is still continuing and an attempt is  being made to persuade us that this is some supreme justice and  public benefit.    Investigations are also developing into the events of 21  September through 4 October in Moscow. If they are conducted  objectively then they are bound to go beyond the framework of a  criminal case involving the organization of mass riots and will  force us to return to the sources of the event, to political  assessments of the two sides' actions.    The question arises: Why is all this necessary? Why have  we, in other cases so tolerant of failure to comply with the  laws, suddenly used the ancient principle of "let justice be  done even if the world comes to an end!"    The voting in the State Duma on the question of an amnesty  for the participants in the events of August 1991 and  September-October 1993 revealed a most unexpected disposition of  forces: The proposal received no support not only from their  political opponents but even from some of those who  ideologically and organizationally are quite close to the State  Committee for the State of Emergency members and the Lefortovo  prisoners. The motives? "Let them be patient for a while," I  was told later in the corridors. "These trials keep the  opposition in good shape, enable it to maintain a useful tension  in society."    I have already written repeatedly about how radicals at  opposite political flanks unexpectedly merge and how much they  need each other. Some need rousing slogans for demonstrations,  other pretexts for calling for the struggle against  "communofascism." I allow myself to disagree with one other  widespread argument: An amnesty will mean an admission of  guilt. In legal practice the most diverse forms of amnesty are  known, including those which simply offer to end legal  proceedings or investigation.    Such an amnesty could be a way of drawing a line under the  past, a step toward national conciliation. As we know, that is  the path which was taken in the past in post-Franco Spain, in  Argentina, and in some other countries. By rejecting the  persecution even of those who were involved in mass repressions  and by rejecting the idea of retribution, people there gained  something greater -- civil peace and stability.    What awaits us in the immediate future: an aggravation of  political confrontation? Crowds taking part in meetings under  the slogans of "freedom!" on the one hand and "shoot them like  dogs!" on the other? Or the peaceful respite the country needs  so much? To a considerable extent that depends on how the  amnesty question is resolved.</p>

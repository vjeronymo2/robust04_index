			<p>BFN     [Text] Weihai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong  Province has recently signed a contract with Singapore on a 200  million U.S. dollar project for an "international city."    Located in Yantai city and covering an area of 658,000  square  meters, it is the biggest project wholly financed by Singapore.    According to the plan, the "city" will have facilities such  as meeting center, exhibition center, education center,  entertainment center, office buildings and luxury apartments.    Figures given at a press conference showed that Singapore  injected over 100 million U.S. dollars into the province from  January to March this year, jumping to second largest investor  after Hong Kong.    Last year, the province absorbed a promised investment of  390  million U.S. dollars from Singapore, quadruple that of 1992.</p>

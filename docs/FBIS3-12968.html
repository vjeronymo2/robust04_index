Observers say  this measure will paralyze a large sector of the Jordanian  economy.    AKHIR KHABAR has learned that Iraq will confine  transportation to the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company.  Iraq did not explain this measure or announce it; it  implemented it on the ground. Sources told us that Jordanian  transportation firms are trying to take a unified stand and  address the Jordanian and Iraqi Governments in order to explain  the extent of damage they will sustain.    It is noteworthy that approximately 80 percent of these  firms' work is devoted to Iraq. This shows the size of this  problem. Truck drivers are living in extremely difficult  conditions at the Iraqi-Jordanian border area of al-Ruwayshid.  AKHIR KHABAR has learned that world television networks will  today begin to raise this problem as a political issue, taking  pictures of the al- Ruwayshid area.</p>

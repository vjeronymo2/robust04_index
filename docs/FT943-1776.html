			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pittards back into the black at Pounds 1.1m midway The closure of its clothing business enabled Pittards, the leather manufacturer, to return to the black with profits of Pounds 1.06m for the first half of 1994, compared with losses of Pounds 310,000. Operating profits were Pounds 1.85m, against Pounds 635,000 which included losses of Pounds 837,000 on discontinued activities. In addition, the comparable pre-tax figure was struck after closure losses of Pounds 135,000. Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said the outlook for the rest of the year was mixed. The gloving division had a reasonably full order book at satisfactory margins but the shoe and leathergoods side would continue to struggle with expensive raw material. Turnover was Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 58.5m), including Pounds 307,000 (Pounds 8.34m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share came out 3.6p (2.2p losses) and an interim dividend of 0.75p (nil) is declared.</p>

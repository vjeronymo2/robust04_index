			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAVALIERS GAIN A FIRST, THEN FALL INTO SECOND  </P> <P> It was of little solace to the Cleveland Cavaliers that they became the first  team in the National Basketball Assn. to clinch a playoff position Wednesday  night.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers qualified for postseason action when Indiana knocked off  Washington, but when the rejuvenated Philadelphia 76ers held off a late surge  to earn a 100-97 victory at Philadelphia, it sent the Cavaliers reeling into  second place in the Central Division.  </P> <P> Buoyed shortly before the game by reports that center Mike Gminski had agreed  to a contract that would keep him in Philadelphia for four more seasons, the  76ers snapped out of a mild slump.  </P> <P> Charles Barkley scored 27 points and had 21 rebounds to lead the 76ers, but it  was two free throws by Gminski with eight seconds left that clinched the  victory.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers, trailing by 17 points in the second quarter, made a spirited  rally, and baskets by Brad Daugherty and Mark Price cut the deficit to 98-97  with nearly two minutes left. The only points the rest of the way were  Gminski's. Craig Ehlo missed a three-point shot in an effort to tie, and  Barkley pulled down the rebound at the buzzer.  </P> <P> The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the 6-foot 11-inch Gminski, who is  eligible for unrestricted free agency at the end of the season, has agreed to  terms. The paper said the announcement would be made next week.  </P> <P> Gminski figured to get numerous offers, including one from the Lakers, if he  decided to become a free agent. Good centers are hard to find.  </P> <P> The 76ers had lost two games in a row, and Barkley had played without spirit in  recent games. Moreover, the 76ers' once-comfortable margin over the Boston  Celtics in the battle for the seventh playoff spot in the East was down to two  games.  </P> <P> Wednesday night, Barkley controlled the boards at both ends, enabling the 76ers  to win despite shooting only 43.4%.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers shot 55.2% but they were badly beaten on the boards and had 32  fewer shots than the 76ers.  </P> <P> "We had not been rebounding well," Barkley said, "ands I decided it was up to  me to take charge. I finally got my share."  </P> <P> The Cavaliers are 48-18 but trail Detroit, which is 47-17, by .007.  </P> <P> Chicago 112, Phoenix 111 -- The move of scoring champion Michael Jordan to  point guard appears to be paying off for the Bulls.  </P> <P> With Jordan leading the way, the Bulls followed the stunning win over the  Lakers at the Forum Tuesday night with another victory at Phoenix.  </P> <P> Jordan scored 18 of his 32 points in the second half as the Bulls, who led most  of the way, barely held on.  </P> <P> The win gave the Bulls a 39-26 record and sole possession of fourth place in  the tough Central Division.  </P> <P> The defeat ended the Suns' five-game winning streak and dropped them 3 1/2  games behind the Lakers in the Pacific Division.  </P> <P> Miami 107, New York 103 -- The Knicks' slim hopes of finishing with the best  overall record became slimmer when they couldn't beat the Heat at Miami.  </P> <P> Kevin Edwards scored 26 points to lead the expansion team to its 11th victory  in 66 games. The Heat made its last 19 free throws to prevail in a tight  finish.  </P> <P> Miami led, 97-93, when Patrick Ewing scored five points in a matter of seconds  to put New York ahead. Ewing sank a turnaround jumper, then stole the inbounds  pass and converted it into a three-point play. He gave the Knicks a 98-97 lead  with 2:14 left.  </P> <P> But Edwards hit a jumper, and Scott Hastings extended the lead to three with  another jumper. The Knicks never caught up.  </P> <P> The Heat shot only 41.1% from the field, but the Knicks weren't much better at  42.4%.  </P> <P> Detroit 115, San Antonio 94 -- The Pistons, after a tough game Tuesday night at  Atlanta, were slow to begin at San Antonio. But Joe Dumars scored six of his 20  points in a 17-3 second-quarter spurt that broke the game open, and the Pistons  breezed into first place in the Central Division.  </P> <P> The win put the Pistons 30 games above .500 (47-17) for the first time in  franchise history.  </P> <P> Bill Laimbeer had 21 points and 10 rebounds for Detroit, while Frank Brickowski  had 20 points for San Antonio.  </P> <P> Indiana 101, Washington 92 -- Detlef Schrempf came off the bench at  Indianapolis to score 22 points, and the Pacers dealt a severe blow to the  Bullets' playoff hopes.  </P> <P> The Bullets, still without Jeff Malone, their injured leading scorer, fell  three games behind Boston in the fight for the final playoff spot in the East.

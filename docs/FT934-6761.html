			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Discover agrees compromise with rival credit card issuer A stand-off between two of the US's big four credit card companies was partially resolved yesterday as Dean Witter Discover announced it was to issue cards bearing the MasterCard logo. DWD, which was spun off from the retailing group Sears, Roebuck earlier this year, has been fighting both MasterCard and Visa in the courts for the past two years. It is seeking the right to issue cards under the two payment systems through one of its own banking subsidiaries. Yesterday's agreement does not involve the company joining MasterCard directly. Instead, it will issue a co-branded card with NationsBank, the North Carolina-based bank which is eager to grow its own base of cardholders. The two sides have dropped all litigation against each other. However, under the terms of their agreement, subsidiaries of DWD will be admitted to MasterCard directly if DWD wins a separate action seeking admission to Visa. The Discover card, launched in 1985, has around 39m cardholders and is accepted by 1.8m merchants in the US - nearly as many as accept Visa and MasterCard. The card to be issued through NationsBank, known as the Prime Option MasterCard, will continue DWD's strategy of issuing 'value-based' general purpose cards - those with no fees and low interest rates. Following the huge success of Sears' Discover card, which also pays holders a rebate, many similar cards have been issues by banks and others under both Visa and MasterCard.</p>

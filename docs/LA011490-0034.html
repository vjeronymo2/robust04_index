			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE: NIELSEN: SYMPHONY NO. 2; "PAN AND SYRINX:" "ALADDIN" SUITE.  ESA-PEKKA SALONEN CONDUCTING THE SWEDISH RADIO SYMPHONY. CBS MASTERWORKS MK  44934 (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> Conductors are lining up to record Carl Nielsen's orchestral music now, and the  attraction is not hard to understand.  </P> <P> Nielsen offers the wide-ranging, crowd-pleasing emotional gamut and sonic  glitter of the most popular late-Romantic and nationalist composers, yet seems  adventurous in the bargain -- Tchaikovsky without the apologies. Salonen  stresses the immediacy of "The Four Temperments" Symphony and the kinetic  flamboyance of "Aladdin," exploiting the able services of the lean-sounding,  hard-hitting Swedes to the maximum. The pacing is swift, the textures clear,  and the musical/psychological contrasts almost brutal. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Indian Trust Pounds 16m short of target The Fleming Indian Investment Trust, the first London-listed trust to specialise in India, has raised Pounds 84m from a placing and public offer - short of its original Pounds 100m target. Mr Patrick Gifford, chairman of Fleming Investment Trust Management, said he was delighted by the response to the fund against a background of difficult stock market conditions. The public offer brought in Pounds 26.4m, of which Pounds 3.4m was an application on behalf of Robert Fleming Investment Trust. An initial placing raised Pounds 54.6m, with an additional 2.94m shares taken up as a consequence of the level of applications in the public offer. The proportion of the total which came from private investors - either directly or via intermediaries - was comparatively large for a trust of this highly-specialised, risky nature. Shares are being issued at 100p with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Separate dealings in the shares and warrants are due to start on May 26.</p>

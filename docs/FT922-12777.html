			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Russian government wins chance to continue reforms THE Russian government yes-terday appeared to secure a hard-won compromise with parliament, allowing it to remain in power and pursue unpopular economic reforms, at least in the short term. The compromise document, adopted by deputies as a basis for discussion, still needs to be approved today. However, the political pressure for an agreement is so strong that deputies are unlikely to reject it. The draft accord, presented by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform, and Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, parliament's deputy speaker, frees the government from parliament's demands for specific policy changes. Without stating so explicitly, it also allows President Boris Yeltsin, who currently heads the cabinet, to keep until December 1 his powers to rule by decree, and to choose ministers. The deal was achieved partly thanks to Mr Gaidar's warnings that a western aid package of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) needed to underpin his reforms could be lost if the government was forced to resign. The western package now seems safe pending further upsets. But western concern over Russian turmoil was underlined with a visit to Moscow yesterday by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary. Before the compromise was announced, Mr Brady said: 'The matter of world confidence in a reform programme here in Russia is one that is very important in terms of the transfer of money to this country. Some of the steps we have read about this week are steps backward in generating that confidence.' Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, added his weight to the reforms, saying the future of world civilisation depended on their success. Speaking in Tokyo, he appealed for investment in Russia. 'It is very important for the global community to support this process of reform.' The document's main concession to deputies commits the government to submit by May 20 a list of measures to take 'into account economic and social realities'. Mr Gaidar told parliament that he believed a majority of deputies were in favour of an effective interaction with the executive. 'There are politically ambitious people . . . who want to hurt Russia, but this is a misleading path,' he added. This was an apparent reference to Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman who has been instrumental in this week's showdown with the government. The MPs' strongman, Page 2</p>

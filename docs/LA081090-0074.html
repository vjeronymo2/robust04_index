			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR KUWAITI STUDENTS, FEAR AND LOATHING;  </P> <P> REACTION: IRAQ'S INVASION HAS CAUSED AN UPHEAVAL IN THE LIVES OF THE ESTIMATED  2,000 WHO ARE ENROLLED AT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES.  </P> <P> The images on the television screen were awesome: a nuclear-powered aircraft  carrier knifing through the Red Sea; bombers, tankers and missiles en route to  the Persian Gulf; troops and warplanes headed to Ahdi Alroumi's part of the  world -- a world in upheaval.  </P> <P> Watching with Alroumi were his Kuwaiti friends, college students gathered to  get the latest news in his West Los Angeles apartment. This has become routine  for them since Iraq invaded their country last week.  </P> <P> They haven't wanted to do much else. Many have dropped out of summer school.  They can't concentrate. They can hardly sleep.  </P> <P> "We are praying five times a day," said Alroumi, 30, a student at Northrup  University in Inglewood who is working on a master's degree in technology  management.  </P> <P> Like most Kuwaiti students in California -- an estimated 2,000 -- Alroumi, who  has been in the United States for six years, is here on a scholarship. He had  been getting a monthly stipend from the Kuwaiti government.  </P> <P> "Since the invasion, we have been glued to television news, reading reports in  the newspaper and staying at home," he said. "We don't even go out for food,  because we don't want to miss anything . . . ."  </P> <P> He recently acquired a fax machine to get late-breaking news about the Mideast  and information from friends in the United States and Europe about relatives  and friends in Kuwait.  </P> <P> Like his Kuwaiti college friends, Alroumi hungers for news about his family.  </P> <P> "A friend of mine called my family last Friday, and my family told him they  were all OK," he said. "But since then, I have not heard one word from them. I  have 10 brothers, one sister and my mother back there.  </P> <P> "This is all a shock. I'm trying to keep myself calm. If I lived alone right  now, I think I'd be dead from worry. I'm leaning on my friends . . . ."  </P> <P> His network includes Abdullah Ali, 25, Ahmed al Khaled, 24, and Osamah al  Tuwairesh, 22.  </P> <P> Ali, a junior at Cal State Northridge studying mechanical engineering who has  been here almost four years, said: "My sister called me on the afternoon of the  invasion. They were scared to death. She said it felt like the house was going  to fall down. I haven't heard from them since.  </P> <P> "My dream always was to come to the United States and get my degree from here  and go back and help develop my country. I will always keep that plan. . . . I  will never give up on my country."  </P> <P> Neither will Khaled, a senior at Cal State Long Beach, who has been in Southern  California for six years studying computer engineering. He has two brothers and  parents in Kuwait. A newlywed brother was heading from Australia to home when  the invasion occurred; he is in Bahrain. The two have been in touch, but  neither has heard from or about their family.  </P> <P> Khaled said: "Knowing my parents, they will be stubborn and stay in Kuwait and  try their best to resist. . . . I'm sure a lot of Kuwaiti families would rather  die than leave. They want to stay and do everything they can to keep their  country. . . ."  </P> <P> Khaled said that he and his Los Angeles friends want to return "no matter what,  and give something back to Kuwait, because everything we had, knew and needed  is in Kuwait."  </P> <P> In the meantime, he said, they will stay in touch with their embassy in  Washington and the Washington-based Committee to Free Kuwait, which is trying  to help Kuwaiti students, residents and tourists.  </P> <P> "We still have hope," Tuwairesh said. "My faith is in God. . . . I want Kuwait  back, all of it, every inch."  </P></p>

A similar survey noted a 51 percent ratio in the first three  months of 1976, when Japan was suffering from a recession  stemming from an oil crisis.    In February, the Labor Ministry polled 5,359 companies with  more than 30 employees across the nation. Of them, 3,345  replied.    The ministry said the latest ratio is a 4 percentage point  rise from the level seen in the July-September period.    As for trimming the work force, 38 percent of the  respondents  cut overtime and 24 percent decreased or suspended new hirings.    Seven percent temporarily closed factories, up 5 percentage  points from the previous survey, and 2 percent called for early  retirement or dismissed employees, an increase of 1 percent from  the previous poll.    As for the service industry, the ministry said the ratio of  companies that reduced staffers increased by 7 percentage points  to 31 percent.    The ratio for companies in the wholesale, retail sales and  restaurants industries, on the other hand, declined by 9  percentage points to 27 percent.</p>

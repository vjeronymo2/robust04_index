			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- A bilateral group of Russian  and U.S. experts from the Russian and U.S. defence ministries  met in session in Moscow on May 4. The meeting is being held in  a constructive and friendly atmosphere, said Russian Deputy  Chief of Staff Dmitriy Kharchenko today.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS Kharchenko said that the  sides  exchanged opinions on problems of European security, the  situation in Bosnia, Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace  programme, nuclear weapons in Ukraine and prospects for the  development of contacts between the armed forces of the two  countries. General Kharchenko pointed out that the Pentagon  delegation led by the U.S. defence secretary's aide for issues  of nuclear security, Ashton Carter, displayed a particular  interest in cooperation in ensuring nuclear security, the  reduction and elimination of weapons of mass destruction.    The Russian delegation to the talks led by the Russian  defence minister's aide for military politics, Gennadiy Ivanov,  informed the American side about the Russian Duma's stance on  joint Russo-U.S. exercises of peace-keeping forces scheduled to  be held at a Totsk test site in the Orenburg region in May.  Pentagon officials believe that it is important to explain to  Russian lawmakers that similar exercises are scheduled to be  conducted next time on the American soil. The U.S. point of  view will be brought to the notice of the Russian military and  political leadership, Kharchenko said. The meeting between the  two working groups of the U.S. and Russian defence departments  continues.</p>

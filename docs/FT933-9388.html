			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc weakens on rate cut THE French franc weakened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bank of France decided to ease monetary policy for the first time since the widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands, writes James Blitz. The Bank of France cut its overnight rate of lending from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. The move immediately led to a sharp weakening of the franc from about FFr3.490 to FFr3.509, a drop of nearly 2 centimes. The currency recovered as European trading continued, but at the London close it was coming under pressure again, closing at FFr3.507. Last week, the Bank of France managed to keep the franc above the FFr3.50 level by keeping liquidity low in its money market. But yesterday's move smacked of the worst of all worlds: showing the market that interest rates are coming down and that there will be a smaller premium on francs, but not sufficiently boosting the French economy to promote the franc on more fundamental grounds. With a poor foreign exchange reserve position, France may have to take a cautious approach on rate cutting to keep the franc strong. But the prospects for maintaining franc fort against the D-Mark look bleak, whatever happens to interest rates. At the weekend, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank vice-President, said that the market should expect German interest rates to come down quickly, despite the additional liquidity in the market. This helped to push the D-Mark up against most European currencies yesterday. Moreover, dealers think that European central banks will buy D-Marks in waves in the next few months to repay the Bundesbank for supporting their currencies in the recent crisis. The Bundesbank needs to drain the markets of D-Marks to restore money supply growth to its target range. Those factors helped to push down the Danish krone and the Belgian franc yesterday in spite of the continuing tightness of their policy in money markets. The Belgians waived their money market tender, but their currency fell to a low of BFr21.4023 and later closed at BFr21.24. The Danish krone closed at DKr4.0424 to the D-Mark having been as low as DKr4.0532 at one stage. Floating currencies also fared badly against a background of D-Mark appreciation. The dollar closed at DM1.6970 down from a previous DM1.6975, despite a lack of any new data in the US. Sterling lost  3/4 of a pfennig against the D-Mark, despite strong credit business figures for June. It closed at DM2.5350. In both cases the fall may partly have been due to both these currencies losing their safe haven status as calm returns to European markets. The Italian lira bottomed out at L952.51 to the D-Mark and closed in London at L950.3 amid expectations of sharp cuts in Italian interest rates.</p>

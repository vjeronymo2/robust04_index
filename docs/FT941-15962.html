			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: US branch of Habitat files for Chapter 11 Conran Stores, which operates the US branch of the Habitat chain founded by Sir Terence Conran in the UK, is seeking protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The company's 14 home furnishings stores, which operate in the US under the Habitat name, were attempting to find a buyer, but it seemed unlikely they would continue in their existing form. Conran Stores is owned by a group of US investors headed by Mr Marvin Traub, a former chairman of the Bloomingdale's department store group. They bought the loss-making company from Storehouse, the UK retailing group, in 1992. Mr Traub's company had tried to revive the chain, but said that the 'difficult and very competitive retail environment and the continuing general economic decline which had severely affected Conran's during prior years proved too high a hurdle to overcome.' Discussions were being held with several parties, but if these proved unsuccessful the company would 'take appropriate action to maximise recoveries from a prompt disposition of its assets'.</p>

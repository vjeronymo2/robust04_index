			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Ontario returns with DM1.5bn offering The Province of Ontario lost no time in returning to the Eurobond market yesterday, now that the uncertainty surrounding its rating had been lifted. On Wednesday, Standard &amp; Poor's cut the long-term debt ratings of the province of Ontario and Ontario Hydro to double-A minus from double-A. Ontario, which had been absent from the Eurobond market since early September, raised DM1.5bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds, its first offering in the D-Mark sector for nine years. Canadian issuers can tap the D-Mark sector now that international sanctions against South Africa have been lifted. They had shunned the sector while the sanctions were in force because of the German banks' links with South Africa. The timing of the issue sent a strong signal to the market that Ontario had put the downgrading behind it and would now proceed with its heavy borrowing programme. 'The downgrading has unfortunately happened and we will now drive on,' said Mr Ronald Otsuki, Ontario's director of capital markets. He added that he was encouraged by Moody's decision to hold Ontario's rating at Aa2. Prior to yesterday's deal, Ontario said it expected to borrow an additional CDollars 2.6bn through public issues in the current fiscal year, ending March 31 1994. This would bring total fiscal 1994 borrowings to CDollars 11.7bn. Yesterday's offering, the proceeds of which are likely to be swapped back into Canadian dollars, reduces the additional borrowing to CDollars 1.4bn. Mr Otsuki said that if the opportunity arose, Ontario would seek to pre-fund next year's borrowing programme, of CDollars 9bn-CDollars 10bn. He added that he had chosen the D-Mark sector because it offered the lowest-cost funds of all global markets and that the opportunity and demand was there. The bonds will be priced today to yield 47-49 basis points over underlying German government bonds. Syndicate managers said the pricing was fair but added that had Ontario not been downgraded, the yield spread on the bonds would have been seven basis points tighter. Elsewhere, activity was slow due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Honda Motor, a well-known name in the Euroyen sector, raised Y50bn through an issue of Eurobonds due 2001, via Nikko. Today, Sumitomo Realty and Development plans to raise a total of Y80bn through three Eurobond offerings.</p>

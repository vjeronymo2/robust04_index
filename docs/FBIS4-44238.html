			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos attributed  the opposition parties' criticism of the government for the  results of the EU [European Union] summit on Corfu to cowardice  and ignorance. The opposition parties' criticism of the Greek  presidency and the results of the EU summit, Venizelos said, is  a reflection of party cowardice, ignorance, party demagoguery,  as well as international developments. The public has seen and  can judge for itself, Venizelos said. He added that being in  opposition does not mean criticizing the government to win  points. The opposition, he concluded, is not a simple contract  which is carried out, but a democratic function.</p>

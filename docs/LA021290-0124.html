			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OUTSIDE HELP SOUGHT BY DREXEL BURNHAM WALL STREET: SECURITIES FIRM BATTERED BY  CRIMINAL TROUBLES AND SLUMPING JUNK-BOND MARKET.  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said today that it is seeking a major investor or  merger partner after falling on hard times because of its criminal troubles and  the slumping junk-bond market.  </P> <P> In a statement, Drexel said senior members of the firm have concluded that it  should seek outside assistance.  </P> <P> "The unsettled markets, particularly in the high-yield area, have adversely  affected the liquidity of our parent corporation, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group.  . . ," Drexel said.  </P> <P> Drexel has long been rumored on Wall Street to be in serious financial  difficulty and seeking an outside investor or partner.  </P> <P> Such a move would conclude one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Wall Street  history. Drexel was the emblem of the high-flying, takeover-driven 1980s, and  the firm made a profit of $522.5 million on revenue of $5.3 billion in 1986.  </P> <P> But Drexel reported a loss of about $40 million for last year, in which it  pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid $650 million to the federal government  to settle wide-ranging securities fraud charges and avoid a trial.  </P> <P> The firm earned more than $400 million in 1987 but reported a loss of $166.7  million in 1988, which included a charge to cover the $650-million payment to  the government.  </P> <P> The firm's net capital position was said to be of concern because a slumping  capital base could put it in jeopardy with federal regulators. Drexel's equity  capital has fallen from a peak of $1.4 billion in recent years because of the  government payments and withdrawal of stakes in the firm by departing  executives.  </P> <P> The closely held Wall Street firm said today that the parent company has a  consolidated net worth of more than $800 million. It said the securities  business subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., "continues to have good  liquidity and has satisfactory excess regulatory capital."  </P> <P> Drexel said it is "taking appropriate action to maximize liquidity" but it did  not elaborate.  </P> <P> The firm had been battered by the charges in the government's lengthy  investigation of Wall Street securities fraud. The inquiry now focuses on the  former head of Drexel's highly productive high-yield "junk bond" division,  Michael Milken, who is under indictment.  </P> <P> Before Drexel's troubles mushroomed, Milken reportedly received $550 million in  total compensation in one single year, 1987.  </P> <P> Drexel was also hard hit by the slump in the nation's $210-billion junk bond  market last fall, which followed the collapse of a takeover deal for United  Airlines parent UAL Corp. The market has yet to recover, and Drexel had to  write down the value of its junk-bond portfolio.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts said they are not surprised by the announcement, adding  that they expect Drexel to try to sell a chunk of its business or a general  stake rather than the entire firm.  </P> <P> "I don't know if anything is too drastic," said securities industry analyst  Lawrence Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco.  "Selling a piece of the firm would be the best way for them to go."  </P></p>

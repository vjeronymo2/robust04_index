			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Opec's heavyweight controls the ring: How the Saudis foiled a move to cut production One member, one vote is the rule within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. But if there is a difference of opinion it helps to have the world's largest oil reserves and a third of Opec's total production on your side. On Saturday night Saudi Arabia proved again that the cartel can act only with Riyadh's active co-operation. Its decision not to take part in a proposed production cut to bolster weak prices put paid to a scheme being promoted by many of its Opec colleagues. And it was made in spite of dire warnings from the secretariat that such a course could trigger a further collapse in the price. The Opec communique stressed the group's unanimous agreement to adhere to the extension to the end of the year of the present 24.52m barrel a day production ceiling. But the rhetoric did little to hide the dissatisfaction of some member states, all of which are struggling to cope with a fall of more than 20 per cent in oil prices over the past year. 'There was a possibility of a very substantial achievement and success which we let slip through our hands,' said Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister. He noted that Iran, one of Opec's most populous and poorer states, had lost Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.39bn) in oil revenues in the six months since the organisation's decision to set the present production ceiling. But Tehran's suggestion of a 1.4m b/d cut did not even make it to the formal proposal stage. Nigeria, another poor and populous member, did manage to present formally a complex proposal for a 6 per cent cut. But it died a quick death before a final meeting confined to the 12 oil ministers. A similar fate was in store for an Indonesian plan to cut to 23.5m b/d the ceiling set last March, which was rarely respected because of widespread quota cheating by some Opec members. There was no need to propose the rollover, according to Mr Subroto, Opec secretary-general, because there was no other option left. The only issue was its duration. An Opec official said the line taken by Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, was simple: 'If you think a cut is the best way forward, then go ahead.' But Saudi Arabia was not about to be easily moved off its 8m b/d quota, say analysts, and without Saudi participation there could be no reduction that would be credible to world oil markets. Riyadh's reluctance to lower output may appear counter-productive at a time when it, too, is under severe financial strain because of falling oil revenues. But Saudi Arabia has been equally reluctant to have its policy dictated by the short-term volatility of oil markets. It also harbours doubts about the effectiveness of even a large production cut. The country has steadfastly adhered to its quota, but it fears other Opec states would take advantage of any price rise that a cut might trigger by cheating on theirs. In addition, Saudi Arabia was the only Opec member to agree to a reduced quota at the beginning of last year and it, along with the United Arab Emirates, did not take part in last September's round of quota increases. The possibility that non-Opec producers such as Britain and Norway would make up for any shortfall that an Opec cut might create was another factor in Saudi thinking. So, too, was the belief that demand will improve significantly in the second half of the year. It is a view shared by many analysts. 'There could be a sudden increase in price by the fourth quarter,' according to Mr Leonidas Drollas, economist at London's Centre for Global Energy Studies. He believes that by then, the Opec basket, the average price of seven crude oils, could rise by about Dollars 2 to Dollars 15. Analysts were also generally positive about the length of the rollover. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst with the International Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, said 'refiners should be more eager to buy if they know there is no more Opec production coming in the fourth quarter', when Opec's output tends to rise to meet high winter demand. Saudi Arabia also controls most of the excess oil production capacity in the world, so it would not be easy for other Opec or non-Opec producers to take advantage of any price rises later in the year. The Saudis also have the financial means to cushion the short-term price falls which Opec ministers concede are likely to accompany the current strategy. It is less certain whether their less well-off colleagues can stand the pain which the next six months may bring.</p>

Berendzen pleaded guilty to two  misdemeanor charges of making obscene telephone calls from his office.  </P> <P> His lawyer told a Fairfax, Va., court the educator deeply regretted his  actions. His psychiatrist released a statement that said the 51-year-old  Berendzen had been sexually abused as a youngster. Fairfax County Judge J.  Conrad Waters Jr. sentenced Berendzen to 30 days in jail on each charge. He  suspended all of the jail time, provided the educator stays out of trouble for  one year and continues treatment.  </P></p>

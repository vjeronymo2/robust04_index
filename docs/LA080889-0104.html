			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HANGAR FIRE INJURES MECHANIC, DESTROYS PLANE  </P> <P> A flash fire Monday in a hangar at Fox Airfield in Lancaster injured a mechanic  who barely escaped fast-moving flames that incinerated the plane he was working  on, fire officials said.  </P> <P> Andrew Reo, 36, of Lancaster, was treated at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical  Center for first- and second-degree burns to his hands and released Monday  afternoon.  </P> <P> The fire at the county-operated facility began shortly before 9:30 a.m. and  caused $150,000 worth of damage, said Capt. Mike Waters of the Los Angeles  County Fire Department.  </P> <P> The fire in the single-engine Cessna 206 broke out when a short circuit in a  wing-flap motor caused a spark that ignited gasoline fumes, officials said.  </P> <P> Reo was doing maintenance work on the wing flaps, officials said. He turned on  the power of the airplane, then turned on the electric motor to check the wing  flaps, Investigator Mike Little said.  </P> <P> "That motor is right next to a fuel tank on the wing," Little said. "There must  have been gas vapors present."  </P> <P> Reo climbed out of the cockpit and ran from the hangar as flames from the  burning gas tank engulfed the plane, airport officials said.  </P> <P> In addition to destroying the Cessna, owned by Michael Schafer of Lancaster,  the fire damaged three other planes in adjacent hangars before it was  extinguished by airport and county fire crews at about 9:50 a.m.  </P></p>

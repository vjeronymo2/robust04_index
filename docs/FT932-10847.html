			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): Still only negligible exposure - Global Bonds / Richard Waters checks asset allocations in the UK BONDS may have provided the best overall investment returns in the UK since the beginning of the 1990s, but pension funds have maintained their almost negligible involvement in the fixed income markets. If this is the decade of bond, in the way that 1980s was the decade of the equity, then the asset allocation decisions of pension funds are proving slow to register the fact. In the past three years, the return from UK bonds averaged 15 per cent a year, compared with 10.1 on UK equities, according to Combined Actuarial Performance Services Limited (Caps), the performance measurement company. That has reversed the pattern of the last decade, when returns on UK bonds, at an average of 12.6 per cent a year, lagged the 18.8 per cent return on UK equities. Yet the median UK pension fund has continued to maintain only a negligible exposure to the bond market. From a 21 per cent share 10 years ago, UK bonds accounted for only around 4 per cent of pension fund assets at the start of the decade, and over the past two years has levelled out at three per cent. The growth of holdings of overseas bonds, particularly in 1989/90, has helped to swell fixed income exposure to some 9 per cent in all, according to Caps. With the UK debt repayments of the 1980s, and the consequent shrinking of the gilt market, pension funds had to look abroad to maintain their involvement in bond markets. The relative outperformance of bonds and the starkly different picture presented by the UK's finances could be set to change this. 'One thing that characterises pension fund investment is that things always happen with a time lag. I would expect a change in the percentage (of investment in UK bonds) by the end of the year,' says Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Caps. One simple reason for buying more bonds: because the UK government - and indeed many other governments - are going to have to sell more to finance their budget deficits. Pension funds may not be in the front rank of investors queueing up for gilt-edged stock, but if private investors, insurance companies and more fickle foreign investors cannot be persuaded to buy more than Pounds 3bn of gilts a month, then yields will have to rise to a level where other investors are drawn to the market. Pension funds' holdings of gilts fell during the 1980s as the UK government repaid part of the national debt. It seems logical to expect those holdings to rise again now that the government is borrowing with a vengeance. Such a shift in investment approach will be dressed up in more sophisticated arguments than this, of course. Sterling's brief disinflationary sojourn in the European exchange rate mechanism may have come to an abrupt end last September, but the case for holding bonds rather than gilts remains a strong one. The real yield on 10-year gilts is hovering around an unlikely 6 per cent, if inflation can be held down at current levels. And for investors who fear the resurgence of inflation, index-linked gilts have offered an attractive return - 8.4 per cent since the start of the decade, only marginally lower than the return on equities. Since sterling left the ERM, the Bank of England has sold around Pounds 2.5bn of index-linked gilts, with pension funds apparently active buyers. Other factors also suggest a greater exposure to fixed income investments in the future. The reduction in advance corporation tax announced in this year's Budget will reduce the attraction of equity dividends to tax-exempt investors like pension funds, adding to the relative attraction of bonds. And holdings of bonds are widely expected to rise as pension funds become more 'mature' (that is, have a higher proportion of retired members, encouraging them to match their liabilities to these people by holding fixed income securities.) Such funds are increasingly turning to tailor-made benchmarks, which contain a higher proportion of bonds than the industry average, against which to measure their performance. While a noticeable swing towards gilts has yet to be seen, the emergence of international bond investment has brought with it a greater use of specialist fund management arrangements. Some funds, rather than tailor a benchmark for their main balanced fund, have preferred to spin off separate fixed income portfolios. Of the Pounds 4bn of fixed income investments managed by Mercury Asset Management, Pounds 1.6bn takes the form of specialist briefs from particular funds or investments tied to benchmarks with a higher-than-average bond weighting, said Mr Nigel Hurst-Brown, vice-chairman. The push into overseas bonds has been largely tactical in nature, rather than strategic: that is, fund managers in pursuit of higher returns have sought and been allowed leeway to invest in overseas markets. If the UK only accounts for 3 per cent of the global bond market, runs the argument, then why limit yourself to such a small arena? Most fund managers also appear to have run such portfolios with unhedged currency exposures, counting on a continuation in the long-run fall of sterling against most principal currencies. Beyond this, there appears to have been little strategic motivation for the move into international bonds. 'Overseas bond investments (by pension funds) increased sharply in the late 1980s, but could decline just as quickly,' says one big UK pension fund manager. That could be especially true if funds move back into gilts in any volume, a step that could be supported in the short-term by a simple switch from international to UK bonds without any change to overall investment parameters.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        AVERAGE ASSET DISTRIBUTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               UK     Overseas   Overseas    UK   Index-  Cash  Property            equities equities %  bonds %   fixed  linked    %       %               %                             %    gilts %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1983         49        17          0        21      2      3       8 1984         48        19          0        20      2      4       7 1985         53        19          0        16      2      5       5 1986         54        21          0        15      2      4       4 1987         55        24          0        12      2      4       3 1988         59        17          0        12      2      7       3 1989         57        18          1         9      2      9       4 1990         56        25          3         4      2      7       3 1991         57        20          5         5      2      9       2 1992 (start) 59        21          6         3      2      4       2 1992 (end)   60        23          6         3      3      4       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Combined Actuarial Performance Services Ltd (Caps)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

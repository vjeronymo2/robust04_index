			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Bonds: GECC launches two-year sterling offering A short-dated sterling issue by General Electric Capital Corporation was the eurobond market's main focus of attention yesterday, in a session which saw little new issuance with North American and Japanese markets closed. GECC launched a Pounds 100m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 20 basis points over UK government bonds, in a deal lead-managed by HSBC and Paribas. HSBC said 50 per cent of sales were made to UK institutions. There was also broad demand from retail investors in France, the Benelux region, Switzerland and south-east Asia, Paribas said. 'We are seeing a lot more international flows at the short-end of curves and hence this deal and our recent deals for Abbey National and Sweden,' a syndicate manager at Paribas said. The launch was boosted by the better tone in the gilts market, which has outperformed other domestic European markets over the last week, the syndicate manager said. The sterling market has also been supported by the current strength of the pound and by reports that UK economic growth is moderating, a syndicate manager at HSBC said. 'There is now less immediate pressure upwards on UK interest rates,' he said. He also emphasised that HSBC was seeing very strong institutional demand, as well as retail demand, for bonds. In the D-Mark sector, Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned electricity generator, launched its debut eurobond with a DM300m five-year offer. Lead manager Deutsche Bank reported demand from Japanese banks, UK institutions and German funds attracted by the relatively high spread 'Very rarely does a new name of high quality come to the market,' said a syndicate official at Deutsche Bank. 'There has been a number of recent issues in the five-year D-Mark area, which has made this sector difficult, but it still went very well.' Statkraft is unlikely to come to the market again this year, although when it does it is likely to tap the dollar sector, sources said. The dollar sector saw two five-year FRN issues. Cariplo London launched Dollars 150m of bonds priced to yield 12 1/2 basis points over three-month Libor. The Hellenic Republic issued Dollars 200m of bonds priced to yield 80 basis points over six-month Libor. 'Both deals are tightly priced, whatever that means in current conditions. At the moment, the market lacks direction. We are in a bear market and we just have to continue doing a variety of small deals that may go slowly but do at least add value,' one syndicate manager said.</p>

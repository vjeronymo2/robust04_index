			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / People: Nomura International replaces its president Nomura International, which has experienced a difficult year with the flop of the GPA flotation as well as hefty staff reductions at the end of last year, sees its president, Taizo Kondo, moving to Hong Kong and replaced by his deputy, Takashi Tsutsui. Nomura stresses the shift is routine, part of the rotation of senior executives, and that it 'would be a mistake' to make any connection with the GPA fiasco, in which Nomura acted as global co-ordinator in the aborted Dollars 800m issue. 'He has done his normal tour of duty,' a spokesman added. But it has been a tough year for the London end of Japan's largest securities house. Unofficial estimates of results for the year ended March 1993 published on Wednesday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper say Nomura International lost Y6.55bn (Dollars 60.8m), after a Y1.18bn (Dollars 11m) profit in the previous 12 months. Kondo, 44, moved to London in 1989 as deputy managing director of Nomura International. He became president in March 1991, when he also joined the main board of parent Nomura Securities. Meanwhile, co-president John Howland-Jackson stepped down in January to join NatWest Markets. Nomura says it is looking outside the organisation for a senior European executive to replace him. Tsutsui, 43, deputy president since early last year, has been in London since mid-1991. Unlike Kondo, he is not yet a board member of Nomura Securities. Kondo's new job is as head of the Asia and Oceania division. Whilst outside observers questioned whether this represented a promotion, Nomura responded that the position entailed responsibility for a geographically larger, and considerably more profitable, area of the group.</p>

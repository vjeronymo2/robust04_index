			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Morris certain to take over head of new union MR BILL MORRIS is almost certain to take over as temporary head of the giant general union to be formed within the next three to four years when his own union the TGWU general union merges with the GMB general union. Senior officials of both unions believe that Mr Morris, who is 53, will take over as leader for about one year before handing over to GMB leader Mr John Edmonds. The TGWU's biennial conference yesterday gave full backing to the principle of merger as did the GMB conference in May although with a more vocal dissenting minority. The biggest problem areas in the merger negotiations will be fusing the lay member-dominated culture of the TGWU with the more central role played by full-time officials in the GMB. Some of the GMB regions are also highly independent. In recent times the TGWU has been on the left of Labour party politics and the GMB on the right. But the picture has become much more blurred with Mr Morris pushing his own union towards the centre and Mr Edmonds, especially in his recent defence of the Labour-union links, making overtures to the left.</p>

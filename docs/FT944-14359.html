			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Palestinian committee holds talks on dealing with Hamas A top-level Israeli-Palestinian troubleshooting committee met in Cairo yesterday to try to forge agreement on ways of dealing with Hamas, the militant Islamic Palestinian group behind last week's Tel Aviv bombing, writes Mark Nicholson. Palestinian negotiators, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, are arguing that Israel should abandon its policy of collective punishment of Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank following each Hamas-led attack. Instead, they said, Israel should support Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and the interim Palestinian Authority, by releasing Hamas prisoners and hastening moves towards a full Palestinian election. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, joined the talks after morning meetings with both President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, and Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, who called on both sides to avoid acts which would 'plunge the region into a cycle of retaliations.' The joint Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee was created out of the original discussions leading to this year's deal on limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as the chief troubleshooting forum between the two sides. The Palestinians said they would resist pressure from Israel to take tougher action against Hamas in Gaza, a move which many fear might spark bitter intra-Palestinian conflict. 'They can suggest what they want, but we respond the way we want,' said Mr Zohdi al-Kudra, the Palestinian ambassador to Egypt.</p>

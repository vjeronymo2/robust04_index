			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Labour slammed over NHS 'fiction' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday dismissed Labour claims that the government was preparing to sell parts of the National Health Service as 'a monstrous fiction'. She denied that talks between Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, and Salick Health Care, the US cancer specialist, would lead to privatisation. 'Talk of parts of the NHS being sold off to US firms is complete and utter nonsense,' she said. Her decision to intervene in the row highlights the government's sensitivity over the issue with its backbenchers. Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, called for a debate on the future of the NHS. 'While I support the principle of a private health service, it should complement the NHS and not replace parts of it.' Mrs Bottomley accused Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, of 'scaremongering' after he said that the government was prepared to see the service run by people whose only motive was profit. She said: 'The Labour party and the press have transformed the small fact of Tom Sackville's meeting with Salick Healthcare into a monstrous fiction.' She said the NHS was 'the most cost-effective healthcare system in the world. We could teach the Americans a thing or two about cost control.' Mrs Bottomley said the government was always ready to explore better ways of delivering health services - 'but not at any price'. Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio that the involvement of US companies in the NHS would be to the detriment of patients. He said the US was desperately trying to move away from its own system of healthcare while the UK government was moving in the 'wrong direction' - away from a 'world-beating cost-efficient service' towards commercialisation and competition. He added: 'We want a service that is funded, delivered, accountable to the public, not a regulatory body where the Department of Health sit on their hands and allow our service to be bought up, to be privatised, to be invested in by people whose raison d'etre is profit, not the delivery of healthcare.' One in four non-executive board members and people who chair NHS trusts do not live in the area they serve, Labour said yesterday. Mr Blunkett said: 'In any democratic system a residential qualification is the norm but with quangos the only qualification necessary appears to be a willingness to toe the Tory party line.'</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour party 'dream ticket' rises in value MRS MARGARET BECKETT, front-running candidate for Labour's deputy leadership, may win the post in the first ballot of the July 18 election, many of her opponents now concede. Yesterday the shadow chief secretary's office released results from 11 constituency parties indicating the 'dream ticket' - with Mr John Smith, as leader - as the outcome. But the claims provoked a vituperative response from Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary and candidate for the posts of both leader and deputy. Speaking in East Ham, Mr Gould clearly targeted Mrs Beckett and Mr John Prescott, his rivals for the deputy leadership, for failing to help open up the debate on Labour's future. 'A premature election, a ridiculous electoral college and campaigns that have done their best to avoid a political debate have done the Labour party no service at all,' he said. He added: 'Candidates have put more effort into claims of how well they are doing and rubbishing how well other candidates are doing than into giving reasons why they should be elected.' The post-mortem into the general election defeat, due at a special meeting of the national executive on Thursday, had become 'a personalised game of hunt the scapegoat' instead of looking at why Labour lost by a huge 7 per cent deficit. Supporters of Mr Gould claimed the speech was deliberately intended to fire up the leadership campaign and provoke a wider debate on the party's future. However, it is certain to raise serious doubts as to whether Mr Gould can now expect an important portfolio from Mr Smith when he forms his shadow cabinet. One Labour MP close to the Gould camp has privately admitted that there seems little chance that Labour's environment spokesman will pass the first hurdle and force Mrs Beckett to a second ballot. At the GMB general union's annual conference in Blackpool yesterday, Mr Smith reiterated his backing for a fundamental review of links with the unions underpinned by one-person, one-vote principles. He also indicated support for a longer timetable on reform than many Labour activists envisaged. The review would to begin in earnest after the leadership elections on July 18 with final recommendations to go to the party's conference in the autumn of next year.</p>

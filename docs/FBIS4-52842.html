			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii by an </F> unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Without the recommendation of the  electoral redistricting panel on new constituency boundaries for  the House of Representatives, the government cannot submit  relevant bills to the Diet. When will the panel give the  recommendation?    [Ishii] The panel is composed of intellectuals. The Home  Affairs Ministry has no intention of intervening in its  discussions and urging it to compile the recommendation at an  early date. We just hope it to compile it as early as possible.  I expect the panel will make the recommendation at a fairly  early time. Judging from how political reform bills were  enacted, I think the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] also will  not oppose the bills on new constituency boundaries. We will do  our utmost to have the bills adopted during the current Diet  session.  <H5>  Whether Public Notification Period Should Be Set Depends on </H5> the Situation    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will the prime minister's right to dissolve  the House of Representatives be restricted until a new electoral  system is introduced?    [Ishii] Legally, the right cannot be restricted. But  politically speaking, I think it has already been restricted.  Political reform bills became law after all parties, except the  Japan Communist Party, gave approval to them. After all, what  is the purpose of political reform if we do not hold the next  election under a new system? Those who call for relapsing into  a state five years ago and holding the election under the  current 70-year-old, worn-out electoral system are just trying  to maintain their status as Diet members. They will be  criticized as being concerned only about own interests.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Even if the bills to redraw constituency  boundaries pass through the current Diet session, it will still  be impossible to hold the election under a new system in summer  because of a public notification period needed to make known to  the people the new electoral system.    [Ishii] The constituency reallocation plan drawn up by the  former Kaifu cabinet recommends a three-month notification  period. But the Hata government is to set the duration of the  period after the bills on new constituency boundaries are  enacted and enforced. Although some say the government should  have the notification period, I think the decision should be  made after examining a future political situation.  <H5>  There Are Many Severe Penalties </H5>   [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How will a new electoral system affect the  reorganization of political parties?    [Ishii] The current multiple-seat constituency system  established a political structure in which five major political  forces and five LDP factions were formed. As such, an electoral  system certainly determines the political structure of a nation.  Although the new electoral system is combined with proportional  representation in consideration of small parties, more seats  should be allocated to single-seat constituencies in the future.  Various things will happen in the process of forming a new  political structure, but it is certain the new electoral system  will lead to a two-party system. If the Social Democratic Party  of Japan, which seceded from the coalition, continues to go its  own way, this will help the main opposition LDP return to power.  Moreover, it will defile the spirit of political reform.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Doesn't the Political Corruption Prevention  Law still has a loophole?    [Ishii] The fact is that measures to prevent only political  corruption have been implemented in several stages since the  Miki cabinet. Politicians are now bound by many regulations.  We have to depend on our party for raising political fund. The  four political reform bills recently enacted carry stiff  penalties for violations. One mistake will cost a politician a  five-year deprivation of civil rights. So, I hope you will not  underestimate these laws. I also hope the people will  understand them.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The promotion of decentralization of power  is also a major task for the Hata cabinet.    [Ishii] I would like to be a powerful driving force to  promote the decentralization and hope to make some progress  while I am in office. There are many issues local governments  should deal with from their position of being close to citizens.  The central government should transfer as many powers as  possible to them.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Home Affairs Ministry has been calling  on the Tax Commission to create a regional consumption tax.    [Ishii] The creation of a regional consumption tax will form  a new source of revenue for local governments. Moreover, it  will respond to an international call for Japan to abolish the  centralization of administrative power. Under the current tax  system, taxes are first collected by the central government and  then distributed to local governments. If this system is  maintained, the Finance Ministry will continue to take the  initiative. Without missing a good chance for the tax reform, I  will tackle this issue as an urgent task. However, whenever  elections draw near, politicians tend to become reluctant about  tax reform. I hope the people will support politicians who have  opinions of their own and carry out their policies in earnest.</p>

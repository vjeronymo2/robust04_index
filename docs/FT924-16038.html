			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Disposal losses leave Tuskar IPounds 31m in red TUSKAR RESOURCES, the Dublin-based oil and gas exploration company suffered pre-tax losses of IPounds 30.8m (Pounds 32.3m) for the year ending March 31 1992, almost quadrupling its previous year's losses of IPounds 8.1m. Some IPounds 27m of the losses, or 90 per cent, are the result of the disposal last August of the company's Colombian oilfield interests to Coplex Resources, an Australian exploration company, for IPounds 5.6m in a cash and share deal. Mr Duncan McGregor, who recently replaced Mr Neil O'Donoghue as Tuskar's chairman, explained that the loss was due to deferred exploration expenditure in the Rubiales oilfield in Colombia which had been held in the books. That loss was realised upon disposal of the field to Coplex, he said. In its 1991 annual report, the company reported a total of IPounds 29.5m deferred expenditure relating to its Colombian exploration licences. A further IPounds 1.23m has been written off in exploration expenditure, primarily in the UK and Turkey and there was a IPounds 1.29m loss on the sale of its investment in Tuskar (Texas). In April this year, Tuskar entered into a share-swap deal with Coplex to dispose of 54 per cent of its Colombian acreage, following a takeover bid by Coplex. The bid was rejected by shareholders, and led to the revised deal under which all of Tuskar's interests in the Piriales field were sold in August to Coplex. The company's shares, which trade on the USM, were then suspended at 1p. Losses per share increased to 11.71p (4.06p).</p>

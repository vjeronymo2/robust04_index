On June 14, 1994 OSHA issued a supplemental notice giving parties until August 13, 1994 to submit comments; until August 5, 1994 to file notices of intention to appear; and until August 13, 1994 to submit testimony and evidence. The hearing was scheduled to start September 20, 1994. 59 FR 30560. These dates have  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  been changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large number of persons have asked to testify at this hearing. Consequently, OSHA has extended the length of the hearing as specified above. OSHA has also scheduled the first four days of the hearing at a larger auditorium as specified above. The location of subsequent days will be announced. Persons who filed notices of intention to appear have already been notified of the initial change by mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Clarifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the persons who filed notices of intention to appear and have been scheduled to testify have indicated uncertainty about OSHA's intentions with respect to parts of the proposal. In order to permit hearing participants to focus their testimony on the relevant issues, OSHA is clarifying certain aspects of the proposed rule and directing participants to the relevant preamble discussion on other points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA wishes to clarify that it is not proposing to regulate smoking or indoor air quality in private homes, and does not intend to do so. The scope provisions in the proposal cover only `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> work <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  environments'' and ``indoor or enclosed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> workplaces <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' However, some of the comments indicate uncertainty on this matter. OSHA intends to develop even clearer language on this point for use in a final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's intention on this issue is consistent with its longstanding practice. For example, a statement of policy set forth at 29 CFR 1975.6 provides that domestic service employment in a private home is not subject to the requirements of the OSH Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

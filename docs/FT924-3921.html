			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Fortis records a steady 10.3% earnings increase FORTIS, the Belgian-Dutch insurance and banking group, yesterday reported a 10.3 per cent increase in net profit for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Third-quarter net rose to Ecu108.1m (Dollars 86.89m) from Ecu98m, while nine-month results increased to Ecu303.9m from Ecu275.4m. Turnover in the nine-month period was up 22.7 per cent at Ecu6.5bn, helped partly by acquisitions and exchange rate movements. Without these influences, turnover showed a 13.5 per cent increase. In the third quarter, operating profit in insurance came under pressure, falling to Ecu97.9m from Ecu102.6m, because of a decline in non-life results. 'In both Belgium and the Netherlands, the outlook for motor insurance, which is essentially cyclical, and fire insurance is less bright than was previously assumed,' the company said. 'Measures will inevitably have to be taken in both sectors.' Banking results advanced to Ecu26.3m from Ecu17.9m.</p>

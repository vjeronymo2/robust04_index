			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Bilyy, head of the Control Commission on </F> Privatization Issues of the Supreme Council of Ukraine:  "Advances and Debts"]    [Text]According to the data obtained by our Commission from  the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine, privatization in Ukraine  proceeded at a rapid pace, in accordance with the legislation of  Ukraine.    The share of non-state property increased in all branches of  the national economy; and the share of production (services) by  non-state enterprises also increased.    Certain data on the activity of non-state enterprises are  presented in the table.    The particular characteristic of privatization in 1993 in  industry was the transition of several hundred large and middle  sized enterprises to the non-state form of property; this is  shown by the rapid growth of the share of industrial production  by non-state enterprises, from 17 to 29 percent.    In construction, non-state enterprises increased their share  in the total number of enterprises, and in the scale of  production. It is expected that in 1994, the share of  construction and repair work carried out by non-state  enterprises will exceed the work carried out by state  enterprises.    In retail trade, the share of non-state enterprises has  reached 60 percent. Now the task is to unify small state  enterprises into commercial companies, and trading houses, to  create a wholesale chain for private commerce, for the  intensification of the interregional exchange of goods in  Ukraine, to improve the activity of the commodity exchanges, and  to introduce the changes in legislation necessary for their  activity.    The number of joint ventures in Ukraine is rapidly  increasing; at the end of 1993, they reached 2,530, and continue  to grow, despite the statements about the supposed worsening of  the conditions for their activity as a result of the curtailing  of certain untenable benefits.    The amount of privatized state housing is steadily  increasing. At the end of 1993, more than 900,000 apartments had  been privatized by citizens.    The farmers' movement in Ukraine is gaining strength. More  than 27,700 farms have already been created; 558,200 hectares of  land have been allotted to their use, of which 504,600 hectares  are arable. The farmers are experiencing great difficulties  because of the absence of targeted credits from the state, the  absence of specialized technology, and of other means of  production.    Privatization by initiative from the enterprises themselves,  from their labor collectives, has proceed in the most organized  way. After the change in the form of property, such enterprises  work stabilely, and use internal reserves for resolving  production and financial problems.    The basic economic obstacles to the process of the transfer  of the property of state enterprises to non-state forms of  property are the serious financial situations of the majority of  state enterprises; their indebtedness to other enterprises of  Ukraine, to banks, and to enterprises of other states increased  by the end of the year to 127 trillion karbovantsi, which is  almost twice their claims on their own debtors. Thus, for every  employee, the state enterprises have an average of more than  five trillion karbovantsi of pure debt. This significantly  limits the possibilities of their activity, and the transition  to leasing and auctioning.    The second most important factor making the privatization of  enterprises more difficult was the great number of normative  acts, which mostly do not correspond to the laws of Ukraine on  privatization, and which were published by agencies of the  executive branch, with the goal of hindering privatization; as  well as similar decisions by government structures concerning  particular facilities, when initiatives for privatization  appeared. This shows that officeholders in government structures  do not sufficiently understand the great political significance  of the process of privatization, as an important economic means  for increasing the effective utilization of the national wealth  of Ukraine, which was created by the hard work of several  generations of our nation; of the transfer of property into the  diligent hands of owners, who will increase it and preserve it  from being stolen and ruined, and will utilize property for the  profit of our national and the Ukrainian state.</p>

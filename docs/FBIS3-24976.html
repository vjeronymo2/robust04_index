The condition set by UNITA is  that the Angolan Government must be prepared to discuss the  matter at the highest military level. This is stated in a UNITA  communique dated 3 February and signed by [Chief of Staff]  General Ben Ben.    The communique notes UNITA's satisfaction with the agreement  on a national police force reached at the Lusaka talks, but this  satisfaction is tempered by Gen. Ben Ben's concern over  statements by Joao de Matos, chief of the Angolan Armed Forces'  General Staff, whom the communique accuses of having called for  the continuation of the war in Angola despite the progress made  at the Lusaka talks.    Gen. Joao de Matos's statements were made before his  departure for Brazil, where he is now. Gen. Ben Ben believes  that de Matos was not expressing a personal view but was  speaking for the Angolan Government. The communique says that  UNITA leaves it to the Angolan people to judge who is making  money out of purchasing arms from Brazil while the Angolans are  starving to death.    The communique ends with praise for UN representative  Alioune  Beye for his role at the Lusaka talks.</p>

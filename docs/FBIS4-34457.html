			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Cesar Gaviria by unidentified </F> domestic reporters at Bolivar Plaza in Santa Fe de Bogota upon  his voting in the presidential elections; broadcast in progress  -- live]    [Text] [Gaviria] ...in Colombia's democracy. Whoever is  elected will have the support not only of the president but of  all the Colombian people.    [Reporter] Is the secretary general of the OAS concerned  about Haiti?    [Gaviria] The situation in the country is pretty good. I  think we are going to have a day when the Colombians will be  able to freely say who they want to be Colombia's next  president. This is Colombians' most important decision, which  they make every four years. I trust that all the Colombians  will fulfill this sacred duty. We will adopt a decision that is  important for ourselves, for our children, and for future  generations, in order that the country may continue gaining  credibility and trust. This is a process in which we must make  progress diligently.    The fact that elections are being held in this environment  represents significant progress when compared to sad times in  the past.    [Reporter] What about the soccer defeat?    [Gaviria] I feel sad about it, like all Colombians. I hope  that in the two remaining games the team will recover its  potential and capabilities, leave behind past problems, and  resolve future problems so that we may secure victories in the  two remaining games.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Gaviria] It is very probable.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Gaviria] Yes. I think it is a disturbing factor, but I  think the citizens know that voting is not just a right, it is  also an obligation. The decision to be made today is too  important to ignore for soccer-related reasons.    [Reporter] As secretary general of the OAS, are you  concerned  about the situation in Haiti?    [Gaviria] We Colombians do believe that the Colombian people  will vote and [words indistinct].</p>

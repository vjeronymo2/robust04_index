These seven species are endemic to the Apalachicolan Region of the eastern Gulf Slope, defined as the rivers from the Escambia River in the west to the Suwannee River in the east. These drainages comprise southeast Alabama, southwest Georgia, and north Florida. Primary threats to these mussels are habitat degradation attributed to impoundments, poor land-use planning, sedimentation, and poor water quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, requires that a public hearing be held if it is requested within 45 days of publication of a proposed rule. The hearing provides a public forum to interested parties desiring formal oral comment on the proposed listing. By September 19, 1994, the Service had received 12 public hearing requests from within the proposed mussels' range. Due to this level of interest, the Service has arranged to conduct five public hearings on the following dates and locations: January 19, 1995, Fayetteville, Georgia; January 23, 1995, Dothan, Alabama; January 24, 1995, Marianna, Florida; January 25, 1995, Albany, Georgia; and January 26, 1995, Columbus, Georgia. Parking is available at all five sites. Each public hearing is scheduled from 7:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Those parties wishing to make statements for the administrative record are encouraged to bring a copy of their statements to present to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral statements may be limited in length if the number of parties present at the hearing necessitates such a limitation. There are, however, no limits to the length of written comments or materials presented at the hearing or mailed to the Service. Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list of sites and addresses for the public hearings is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fayette County High School Auditorium, Lafayette Avenue, Fayetteville, Georgia (one block north of the county courthouse square). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dothan Opera House, 115 North St. Andrews, Dothan, Alabama (across the street from the Dothan Police Department and Dothan Civic Center). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chipola Junior College, 123 South Main Street, Marianna, Florida (approximately two miles north of the courthouse in downtown Marianna). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Albany Civic Center, 100 West Oglethorpe Boulevard, Albany , Georgia (between Washington and Front Streets near the Oglethorpe/Flint River Bridge). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbus, Georgia Convention and Trade Center, 801 Front Avenue, Columbus, Georgia (Front Avenue runs north-south along the Chattahoochee River). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In acknowledgement of public response to date, the Service has also scheduled five public meetings. The purpose of the public meetings is to provide an advance opportunity for the public to ask questions and gain additional information in preparation for the hearings to be held at a later date. The Service will not be taking oral statements for the administrative record at these meetings. Meeting hours, locations, and sites are the same as for the public hearings; dates are as follows: January 5, 1995, Fayetteville, Georgia; January 9, 1995, Marianna, Florida; January 10, 1995, Dothan, Alabama; January 11, 1995, Albany, Georgia; and January 12, 1995, Columbus, Georgia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original public comment period for the proposal closed on November 1, 1994.

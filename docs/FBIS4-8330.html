			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 12/4/1994 -- "Deciding for armed  actions, the United Nations has forsaken the role of peacemaker  it used to play, overtly siding with the Muslims in the civil  war going on in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has discredited the role  of this organization in the subsequent evolution of events,"  Desimir Jevtic, the ambassador of the Yugoslav Federal Republic  in Bucharest told a ROMPRES correspondent.    The ambassador also said that "the Yugoslav Federal Republic  firmly condemns the NATO bombings under UN patronage, because  such actions affect the efforts directed towards stopping the  civil war and reaching a lasting and peaceful, political  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. UN officials invoke  resolution 836 of the Security Council, while they themselves  fail to entirely abide by its provisions."    "The spring offensive of the Muslims was announced long in  advance, and it started under the very eyes of United Nations  and UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Forces) military  observers who did nothing to disarm the Muslim troops in Gorazde  and other protected areas. It was also with the cognizance of  the foreign observers that 6,000 Muslim military were armed as  soon as the Serbian side proceeded to self-defensive  counter-attacks. When the situation on the battlefield turned  to its (Serbs) advantage, the United Nations resorted to air  strikes against the Serbs' positions, and this caused the death  of civilians and the destruction of economic units," the  ambassador said.    "The Yugoslav Federal Republic definitely pronounces against  a policy of pressure, ultimatum and armed attacks over the  Serbian areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and shares the conviction  that all this is far from capable to lead to a peaceful  settlement. Therefore, the Yugoslav Federal Republic pronounces  for a cease of all activities against the Serbs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the renunciation of a double-standard  policy."</p>

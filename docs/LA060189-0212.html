			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COACH PRAISES PROGRESS;  </P> <P> AIKMAN MAY START FOR DALLAS IN FIRST GAME  </P> <P> Dallas Cowboys Coach Jimmy Johnson says multimillion-dollar quarterback Troy  Aikman has made so much progress that he could start in the team's season  opener.  </P> <P> "Troy has been everything we've expected and more," Johnson said of the first  pick in this year's NFL draft. "Mentally, he has a good grasp of what we're  trying to do. And we already knew how physically talented he is.  </P> <P> "He is right on schedule for where we want him to be. He may be ahead of  schedule. I have no reservations about Troy possibly being the starter in that  first game."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Richest Rookie in History  </P> <P> Aikman, the richest rookie in NFL history, has a six-year, $11-million  contract. But after practices, he eats $3 sandwiches as he sits on the locker  room's carpeted floor, brown-bagging it with offensive linemen.  </P> <P> Aikman has earned his teammates' respect on the field.  </P> <P> "He hasn't come in here with an attitude like 'Clear out. I'm the big cheese,'  " linebacker Garry Cobb said. "He's working as hard as anybody. There's no hot  dog in him.  </P> <P> "He's going out there every day, trying to do everything within his power to  improve and learn. That's the kind of attitude that everybody respects."  </P> <P> Aikman will be the first to agree that much remains to be done.  </P> <P> "I need to work on everything, not one particular area," he said. "Right now,  being in shorts is a whole different ballgame than it is when you put the pads  on. When I get the pads on, I'll be able to learn a lot more about myself and  my progress."  </P> <P> He has rejected all but a few requests for endorsements and personal  appearances.  </P> <P> "I don't want to receive a lot of attention until I prove myself on the field,  and right now I don't think I'm worthy of receiving that attention," Aikman  said. "So I've backed off."  </P> <P> Players are praising the strength of Aikman's arm and his ability to learn  quickly.  </P> <P> "He can throw just about any kind of ball," cornerback Everson Walls said. "He  can throw it deep. He can lay it up and put some touch on it. He can throw it  short. He can get it outside."  </P></p>

Issuing  the new dinar based on production of goods would create a  situation in which a dinar with hard currency backing would be  replaced by a dinar based on the production of goods for which  no reliable market has been verified. This was stated yesterday  by Dr. Nebojsa Savic, a member of the team of experts  participating in the creation of the new economic program. The  comment was made in response to the latest credit approval for  IMT [Industry of Machines and Tractors]. The primary mechanism  of financing, in Dr. Savic's opinion, should not be connected  with the Central Bank, but with commercial banks that would  determine whether the programs they finance are justifiable,  i.e., whether the companies would be able to secure their  liquidity and acquire new dinars by selling their products.    Dr. Savic believes that if a company obtains credit through  an agreement with a commercial bank, that is a two-way deal  because it involves a definite interest rate and a repayment  deadline within 90 days.    However, Dr. Savic points out that the main purpose of the  new economic plan was to have solid currency, the new dinar,  fully backed by hard currency, which would make it possible to  introduce the new dinar into all transactions. "My idea is that  we should remain within this firm monetary regime and financial  discipline until the end of the first quarter and only then  consider ways of activating some other possibilities," Dr. Savic  said. After all, the firm financial discipline, requiring  companies to deposit their hard currency, was designed for the  purpose of extracting the hard currency which the companies used  in what were termed illegal transactions among themselves. For  this reason, Dr. Savic stresses that during this quarter  production should not be accepted as backing for financing.</p>

Pleskachevskiy  (NPO [scientific production association] ``Radiyevyy institut  imeni V.G. Khlopin''); received May 25,1993; UDC 621.039.58]    [Abstract] Because of difficulties in performing direct  radiochemical analysis of microscopic amounts of [.sup]90[/]  Sr and [.sup]239+240[/]Pu and the ambiguity of  derived results it is necessary to find ways for indirect  estimates of concentrations of these radio nuclides in  environmental samples based on the content of gamma radiators. [.sup]144  [/]  Ce content and concentration and isotope content  of plutonium in soil samples were determined. The objective of  the work was to develop a model that would make it possible to  assess contamination of territories with [.sup]90[/]Sr and  plutonium based on data of contamination of the territories with  gamma-radiating radio nuclides. The first stage of the work  consisted of experimental measurements that provided  gamma-spectrometry and radiochemical analysis of soil samples  taken at settlements with various levels of contamination  located at various distances from the Chernobyl AES. During the  second stage correlation analysis of Goskomgidromet [USSR State  Committee for Hydrometeorology] data and experimental  measurements conducted by the authors was performed. A linear  model satisfactorily describes the relationship between [.sup]90[/]  Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs in the remote zone  (Bryansk oblast) soils and makes it possible to estimate  territory contamination with [.sup]90[/]Sr based on data of [.sup]137[/]   Cs contamination.

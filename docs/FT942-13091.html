			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / EMI chief drops ERM line Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, yesterday joined a growing consensus in Europe that the path to a single currency no longer lies via a resurrection of the old exchange rate mechanism. In testimony to the European parliament, Mr Lamfalussy said he had changed his mind about the need to revive the ERM's narrow fluctuation bands. Currency stability was the fundamental objective, he said. Mr Lamfalussy expressed cautious optimism about exchange rate stability, tempered by a warning to member states to reduce their record budget deficits. Failure to do so risked an increase in long-term rates, which could choke off the incipient recovery in Europe. Mr Lamfalussy's remarks on the future of the ERM reflect a new consensus among central bankers, the European Commission and the Bundesbank that the 15 per cent fluctuation bands - introduced as a crisis measure last August - have helped not only to deter speculators but also to reinforce currency stability. The EMI president said he favoured keeping the wide bands for as long as possible. The unexpected success of the crisis measures still leaves ministers with a dilemma: how to reconcile the 15 per cent bands with the Maastricht treaty's provision that a currency must be a member of the 'normal' ERM bands for two years to qualify to join a future single currency.</p>

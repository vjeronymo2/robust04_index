A delegation headed by General  Teoman Erkan, under secretary at the Ministry of National  Defense, is visiting Russia for that purpose now. Minister of  National Defense Mehmet Golhan said the delegation will try to  establish whether or not the two sides can reach a  reconciliation in the military field.    It has been ascertained that Gen. Erkan and his delegation  have already begun their contacts in Russia. It has also been  ascertained that Russia will propose to sell MiG-29, MiG-31, and  SU attack aircraft to Turkey in addition to Kalashnikov  automatic weapons, various types of helicopters, and BTR-60 and  BTR-80 armored combat vehicles. Turkey is interested in  acquiring helicopters, Kalashnikov weapons, and armored combat  vehicles from that country. However, Ankara prefers that Turkey  manufacture them under patent.    Replying to CUMHURIYET's questions on the visit, Mehmet  Golhan said: "Attention will be focused more on bilateral  agreements than on arms purchases. Russia has economic  problems. Compared with the prices in other countries, several  items required by the Turkish Armed Forces cost less in Russia.  Nevertheless, the delegation has not visited that country to  buy arms. Its objective is to establish whether or not the two  countries, which were members of two different blocs for many  years, can cooperate on military issues. We are making an effort  to establish whether we can reach an agreement for cooperation  in the military field. That may provide an opportunity to the  two sides to dispatch observers to follow each other's military  exercises or exchange students to study in each other's war  colleges. Meanwhile, the purchase of interesting products or  the establishment of installations in Turkey to manufacture them  under patent is also possible."    A source in the Russian Embassy in Ankara has assessed the  delegation's contacts in Moscow as follows: "We attach  importance to Russia's neighborly relations with Turkey. We  trust Turkey. In view of that, we can cooperate with Turkey on  defense in two fields. We can jointly realize several defense  industry projects. The manufacture of armored vehicles or  helicopters can be the first step in that direction. We can  also sell ammunition and firearms to Turkey. In fact, we are  already selling Kalashnikov automatic weapons. Meanwhile, we  have proposed to sell MiG-29 and MiG-31 aircraft, which are  superior to the F-16's, and SU-type planes, which are used in  air-to-surface operations."</p>

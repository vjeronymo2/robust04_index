			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Shortage of protective gloves feared New European Union import quotas could lead to a shortage of industrial gloves, with a potential knock-on effect for industries where protective clothing is needed to comply with health and safety regulations, say British glove importers. The potential problem has arisen because of the imposition of EU-wide quotas on the import of industrial leather gloves from China, a popular source of good-quality general purpose protective gloves. The quotas, opposed by the UK, were imposed after stiff lobbying from fashion glove manufacturers, particularly in southern European countries such as Italy and Portugal. When the industry was last faced with a shortage 10 years ago - when Russian manufacturers began buying heavily into the leather market - importers turned to cotton and PVC gloves. But failures of the cotton crops in Pakistan and China are leading to worldwide shortages and higher cotton prices. 'The shortfall in cotton supplies will lead very quickly to an acute shortage of gloves,' said Mr Peter Ward, secretary of the Association of Protective Clothing Importers. A UK-imposed quota last year officially allowed about 166,000 pairs of Chinese gloves into the country. Mr Ward says the real figure was nearer 5m pairs - out of total imports of about 22m - because most were arriving through backdoor routes such as Germany and the Netherlands which did not have quotas. Mr Ward says the new quota - Ecu76m (Pounds 60m) for the whole of Europe - is far too low and that importing countries will hang on to their own stocks instead of re-exporting them. The Department of Trade and Industry agreed with Mr Ward, but the extent of the problem is disputed by some UK manufacturers. Mr Brian Bennett, sales director of Bennett Safety Wear, of Crosby, Liverpool, and chairman of the industrial section of the National Association of Glove Manufacturers, said: 'Rather than a shortage, I would expect the main effect to be one on price. We have other important source countries for imports such as India, Pakistan, Thailand and Hong Kong.'</p>

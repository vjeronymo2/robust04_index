At a meeting of  chairpersons heading member groups belonging to the Central  Federation of Women's Organizations, support was given to Rehn.    The Central Federation is politically independent. It  represents 400,000 women in 52 different organizations.  Constituent groups include the women's auxiliaries of the Center  Party, Conservative Party, the Christian Party, and the Rural  Party, as well as the Martha Confederation, the Young Women's  Christian Association, the Kindergarten Teachers' Union, Wives  of Engineers, Zonta International [Finnish chapter], and, for  example, the wives of foreign service officers.    The leftist women's organizations do not belong to the  Central Federation.    Also supporting Rehn is the Women's Party, [which said in a  statement]: "As a women, wife, mother, and grandmother, she has  new groups of people with her and is bringing a human dimension  to the highest realm of politics."</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Middle East: Talks in US turn to arms control DELEGATES from Israel, its Arab neighbours and other interested countries convene today in Washington to discuss arms control in the Middle East for the first time since the Gulf war, in one of five sets of multilateral peace talks opening this week. The first sessions of the talks, which shadow the main Arab-Israeli peace talks and are open to more countries, are not expected to move much beyond preliminary discussion on the format of further, possibly more substantive, talks. In Washington, US officials said the disarmament talks would take a 'seminar' format, with countries presenting papers rather than engaging in negotiation in the four-day meeting. The same format will apply to the other four sets of talks: discussion on economic issues which open today in Brussels under the aegis of the EC; talks in Ottawa on refugees and in Vienna on water resources, which open on Wednesday; and discussions on the environment, which open on May 18 in Tokyo. The PLO, though formally excluded from the US-brokered peace process, nevertheless yesterday gave its blessing to Palestinian participation in the talks. Israel, however, has decided to shun the meetings on refugees and economic issues. On arms control specifically, progress will be limited by Arab countries' resistance to any arms control regime affecting their ability to arm as they wish while Israel retains its nuclear deterrent.</p>

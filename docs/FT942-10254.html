			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Drugs industry seeks prescription for growth - Manufacturers and distributors are scrambling for market share The bomb detonated under the US drugs industry last year by Merck's Dollars 6.7bn takeover of Medco, a drug distributor, has been reverberating loudly in recent weeks. In a rapid series of takeovers and alliances, some of the biggest distributors in the US have aligned themselves with pharmaceutical manufacturers. And with a shrinking number of distributors not yet spoken for, the scramble for market position is getting intense. 'We clearly want to keep our lines of distribution open as much as possible,' says Mr Edward Bessey, president of Pfizer's US pharmaceuticals business. Pfizer, which has had one of the best records among manufacturers for launching big-selling new drugs, has been quick to make its own arrangements, forming links with two distributors in recent weeks. The panic prompted in drug company boardrooms by the Merck/Medco deal is understandable. Medco is one of a new breed of distributors, known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which has come to prominence in recent years. These companies have a strong grip on drugs sales in the US: access to their distribution channels has become vital. Medco, for instance, claims to account for 38m people (known in the trade as 'lives') under assorted managed care arrangements. Diversified Pharmaceutical Services - which, under a deal announced last week, is being bought by SmithKline Beecham - claims 44m lives, PCS (a subsidiary of McKesson) 45m and Caremark, another independent, 28m. Even allowing for some inflated claims and a degree of overlap, it is a fair bet that more than half of all Americans buy drugs through these companies. The distributors have won their position by discounting heavily. They fill out prescriptions for people covered under company health plans and other bulk programmes. The main weapon in the distributors' armoury, though - and the one that frightens some manufacturers - is their formularies. These are lists of recommended drugs they maintain, and which doctors are steered towards when prescribing. A doctor prescribing a drug not on the formulary is likely to get a call suggesting they switch to another (usually cheaper) drug that is. Caremark claims that it manages to persuade three out of every five doctors to change their prescriptions in these circumstances. McKesson claims some 20m lives are covered by its formulary, while Medco claims 18m, Caremark 12.5m, Diversified 11m and Value Health, another of the distributors, 5m. These numbers are likely to grow fast: the distributors have all made it a priority to convert their customers to the formulary approach, and are using aggressive pricing as an inducement. The result has been a scramble. Merck and SmithKline Beecham have already bought two of the biggest PBMs (the latter still needs approval). Two other distributors, Caremark and Value Health, have made clear their intention to remain independent of any one drug company. A month ago, Caremark signed agreements to put the products of three manufacturers on its formulary - Pfizer, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and (it is widely believed) Bristol-Myers Squibb. Value Health last week agreed a similar deal with Pfizer. Other, smaller companies could also become takeover candidates. For instance, Express Scripts, a small PBM based in Missouri, has seen its market value leap from Dollars 175m to Dollars 450m in recent months. McKesson, though, stands out as the only big company that has yet to show its hand. Control of distribution may be the main force behind the realignment, but there is also a second motivating factor: access to information. The manufacturers' thinking goes like this. Under pressure to hold down prices, both from bulk buyers of their products and politicians in Washington, they need new data both to support their marketing and develop new markets. Information on how their drugs are being used, and the effectiveness of the treatments, is vital: it would enable the manufacturers to make a better case for the effectiveness of their products, and at the same time would enable them to develop closer ties with the users of their drugs. It would also enable them to sell drugs to big buyers under capitation arrangements - agreements to provide all of a patient's drugs over a set period for a pre-determined fee. Some of the information that the manufacturers needs sits in the databases of the PBMs. More of it, though, resides with the Health Management Organisations (HMOs) and other managed care groups who provide overall healthcare cover to many Americans. Notably, SmithKline's deal with United Healthcare - the company from which it is buying Diversified - will give it access to United's database. Pfizer will likewise have access to information about Value Health's patients. 'Disease management' - an overall approach to treating illness that goes beyond just selling drugs - has become the fashionable industry jargon for this approach. Explaining the Value Health deal, Mr Bessey at Pfizer says: 'We saw the capability and the data that will allow us to move very quickly into disease management - from diagnosis to cure.' Ultimately, that approach could help the stronger manufacturers both to take market share off weaker rivals, and at the same time grow their overall market by giving pharmaceuticals a more significant role in overall courses of treatment than they currently enjoy (only 7 per cent of US healthcare spending is on drugs, for instance, compared with more than 60 per cent on hospitals). Over the long term, the drug companies hope, this approach could sustain the sort of growth which has been lacking in the industry in recent years.</p>

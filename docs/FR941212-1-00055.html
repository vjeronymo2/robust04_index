Capacity Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. In its Section 214 application, GTE Service Corporation (GTE) has proposed a video dialtone system that would make extensive use of digital capacity. GTE proposes a platform with approximately 168 compressed digital channels, 80 analog channels, and 4 reverse analog channels. Programmer-customers on GTE's platform would have the option of delivering to GTE an analog signal or a digital signal. If a programmer-customer delivered an analog video signal, GTE would either modulate this signal onto an analog channel, or encode and multiplex this signal input onto a digital bit stream. The analog signal or digital bit stream would then be delivered over the video dialtone network. To access all channels and services offered on the platform, GTE's proposal requires end user subscribers to purchase or rent a set-top converter, both because the converter is needed to view compressed digital video signals on today's televisions and because some channels may be encrypted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Commission sought comment on the merits of the GTE approach or some variation of it as a way of meeting its capacity and expandability goals. Parties commenting on this approach should address, in particular, the technical, economic, and operational feasibility of digital equipment and facilities. For example, the Commission sought comment on whether digital compression and transmission equipment will be commercially available on a broad scale in the near future, and on the quality of compressed digital video. The Commission also sought comment on the costs of digital equipment. Likewise, the Commission sought comment on the cost of set-top converters and on whether and when, given these costs, it should require LECs to employ all-digital video dialtone systems. In addition, the Commission sought comment on the impact of such an approach on low-income subscribers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Commission also sought comment on methods or arrangements for promoting more efficient use of analog channel capacity. In order to make more efficient use of this analog capacity, and to comply with the Commission's rules, four LECs have proposed ``channel sharing arrangements.'' The stated purpose of these analog channel sharing mechanisms is to maximize use of analog capacity by avoiding carriage of the same video programming on more than one analog channel, thereby making video dialtone more attractive and available to multiple video programmers, and more marketable to consumers. Generally, channel sharing arrangements would make available to all programmer-customers subscribing to the basic platform the programming on shared individual channels or blocks of channels. In turn, the shared channels could be made part of the programmers' general service offering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Commission tentatively concluded that channel sharing mechanisms, if properly structured, can offer significant benefits to consumers, programmer-customers, and video dialtone providers, while remaining consistent with the requirements of the cross-ownership provisions of the 1984 Cable Act. For example, these arrangements could increase the number of video programmers on the platform, thus creating diverse programming options. In addition, they would enable multiple video programmers to offer full service packages to consumers. Channel sharing arrangements would also maximize use of the platform by programmer-customers, thereby benefitting video dialtone providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. At the same time, the Commission recognized that, depending upon how they are structured, these arrangements can raise significant legal and policy issues. The Commission believes that the public interest would be well-served by the establishment of specific rules and policies to govern channel sharing arrangements. To this end, the Commission sought comment on the following issues: First, if channel sharing is permitted, who should structure or administer shared channels_the LEC, a programmer-customer, a consortium of programmer-customers, or an independent third party? In this regard, the Commission sought comment on the role that LECs may play in structuring or administering channel sharing arrangements without violating the cross-ownership provisions. If the Commission were to conclude that video programmers should play a role in administering shared channel mechanisms, it also proposed to modify its rule prohibiting video programmers from jointly operating, with a LEC, a basic video dialtone platform. Second, what criteria should be used to select the shared channel administrator? Third, how should programming be selected for the shared channels? Fourth, the Commission sought comment on the terms and conditions on which shared channels should be made available to programmer-customers. Finally, the Commission sought comment on any other relevant issue regarding channel sharing arrangements. The Commission does not intend at this time to prescribe one kind of sharing arrangement, but to establish rules and policies that will ensure that any such arrangement will further the public interest and remain consistent with the 1984 Cable Act. Nor does it intend to defer consideration of Section 214 applications proposing channel sharing arrangements pending the development of rules and policies governing such arrangements. Rather, the Commission will address those proposals on a case-by-case basis. Section 214 authorizations will, however, be conditioned on compliance with any subsequent rules that the Commission may adopt with respect to channel sharing mechanisms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Modifications to the Commission's Prohibition on Acquisition of Cable Facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The Commission also sought comment on possible modifications to its prohibition on the acquisition by telephone companies of cable facilities in their telephone service area for provision of video dialtone. The Commission noted that while this prohibition generally promoted facilities-based competition for video services, the prohibition serves little purpose in markets that are incapable of supporting two video delivery systems. Indeed, the Commission expressed concern that in these markets, the prohibition would preclude the establishment of video dialtone service, denying consumers its benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Commission therefore sought comment on appropriate modifications to its prohibition that would permit acquisitions of cable facilities in markets in which two wire-based multi-channel video delivery systems are not viable, while preserving the ban in other markets. Specifically, the Commission sought comment on criteria that would permit it to identify those markets in which two wire-based multi-channel video delivery systems would likely not be viable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

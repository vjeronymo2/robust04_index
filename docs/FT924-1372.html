			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Arts: Bad picture made good 'And When Did You Last See Your Father?' is one of the great anomalies of British art. Everyone knows the picture, but few could tell you who painted it. As art it is undistinguished and was presumably always considered so, given its unenthusiastic reception at the 1878 Royal Academy. Yet the picture became a household favourite and remains firmly lodged in the collective consciousness of the nation. Madame Tussaud's waxwork tableau after the painting was dismantled only in 1989. Contemporary satirists and cartoonists such as Posy Symmonds and Nicholas Garland still rely on readers instantly recognising any allusion to the picture. It has never seemed to matter that this is a history painting that records an event that never even happened. The phenomenon of 'And When . . .' is now under examination at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (until January 10). William Frederick Yeames's canvas is the centrepiece of this exhibition which not only places it in the context of Victorian fascination with the Civil War but also charts its march to fame. 'And When . . .' was a truly popular picture from the start. It was bought by the fledgling Walker Art Gallery in 1878 as part of an acquisitions policy that intended to appeal to 'the numerous visitors to the gallery who are uninterested in the higher forms of Art'. The image's rapid dissemination which, began after the turn of the century was primarily the result of new and inexpensive photographic printing techniques. Collins was the first publishers to use the painting to illustrate mass-market school textbooks. Parodying the picture in cartoons seems to date from the 1920s. In 1932 Wills issued a series of 'sectional cigarette cards' based on famous paintings, which offered the Walker picture alongside Millais's 'Boyhood of Raleigh' and Hals's 'The Laughing Cavalier'. Madame Tussaud's tableau was erected the following year. A play of 1934 recreated the circumstances of 'And When . . .', as did a 'quota-quickie' film of 1936. It is fascinating to chart the change in the Parliamentarians' critical fortunes. For Thomas Carlyle, the Puritan revolution was the 'last glimpse of the Godlike vanishing from this England'. Ford Madox Brown's intense portrait of the young Cromwell emphasises Cromwell the radical and visionary destined to uphold the literal word of God. And in his 1859 'The Night Before Naseby', Leopold Augustus Egg accords him near divine status, applying the imagery of Christ's Agony in the Garden for Cromwell praying outside his tent. But by 1898, when the songwriter Frederic Weatherly ('Roses of Picardy', 'Danny Boy') based 'The Young Royalist' on Yeames's picture, the Royalist boy is lip-tremulously heroic and the Roundhead captain no more than a brute. Changes similarly occur in the remodelling of the Tussaud tableau. In 1933-80, the boy - true to the picture - is represented as a nine or 10 year old. His is therefore an adult moral dilemma: is it permissible not to tell the truth? In the 1980-89 version he has become a little boy of five, and the Roundheads are simply big bullies. A recurring theme is the triumph of human kindness over sectarian loyalties. Thus William Shakespeare Burton portrays a young Puritan woman helping a wounded Cavalier while her brother/husband disapprovingly looks on. More often that not, however, these genre scenes are no more convincing than costume dramas; Frederick Goodall's chocolate-box 'Puritan and Cavalier' seems absurd enough to be a parody of the genre at its worst. As history paintings in the noble sense they fail miserably. This fascinating show reveals how the fame of 'And When . . .' became self-perpetuating. What it cannot explain is why this picture, rather than any other, should have assumed its position of national icon.</p>

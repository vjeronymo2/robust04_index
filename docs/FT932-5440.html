			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US prices flat as May jobless data awaited Wall Street US SHARE prices ended mostly flat as investors turned their attention toward tomorrow's eagerly-awaited May employment report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.11 at 3,553.45, a fraction short of its all-time high. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.02 firmer at 453.85, while the Amex composite finished 1.37 higher at 439.97, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.52 at 705.80. Trading volume on the NYSE was 287m shares. After Tuesday's solid gains, prices opened lower in light trading, although by mid-afternoon they had crept back into positive territory. In the absence of a lead from the bond market, which held steady, or from gold prices, which rebounded slightly after the previous day's big declines, investors focused on the day's economic news, and on tomorrow's release of May jobs data. This will give the markets the latest reading on the current state of the economy. Economic figures yesterday were inconclusive. April home sales, up 22.7 per cent on the month, came in well above forecasts, and failed to lift prices. Instead, investors paid more attention to the April index of leading economic indicators, which showed a modest rise of 0.1 per cent. Analysts had expected an increase of about 0.5 per cent. MCI Communications, which is traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 after announcing that it had sold a 20 per cent stake to British Telecom for Dollars 4.3bn and agreed to establish a Dollars 1bn joint venture to develop the two companies' North American telecommunications businesses. ADRs in British Telecom fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 65 1/8 . Tambrands fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 43 after the company warned second quarter earnings would fail to meet last year's levels. Drug and healthcare stocks came under selling pressure. Syntex fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 19 7/8 after the Food and Drug Administration rejected its application to sell an over-the-counter version of its Naproxen painkiller. Leading drug stocks elsewhere fell on reports that the release of President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform proposals will probably be delayed until July. Fear of prolongued uncertainty about the proposals left Merck Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 37 1/4 , Schering-Plough down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 65 1/8 , Johnson&amp;Johnson Dollars  1/2 weaker at Dollars 44 1/4 , and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 59 1/2 . Healthcare stocks on the Nasdaq also tumbled. Canada TORONTO STOCKS closed steady in heavy trading. An active session closed narrowly mixed as a recovery in oil and gas and precious metals issues offset tumbling consumer products. A plunge in heavily weighted Seagram Co shares took the consumer products index down 97.19 to 6,262.31. The TSE-300 finished 2.95 points higher at 3,859.82 on turnover of 76.54m shares valued at CDollars 668.17m. Declines led advances 350 to 355, with 277 issues steady. Seagram fell 1 1/8 to 35 3/8 in brisk trade. It posted operating net profit of USDollars 0.43 per share versus USDollars 0.41.</p>

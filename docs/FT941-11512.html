			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / PM concedes up to 3% rises in public sector: Concern over job losses as 'new money' to finance pay increases is ruled out The government yesterday backed away from a confrontation with public sector trade unions by accepting above-inflation pay rises of between 2.75 per cent and 3 per cent for nearly 1.5m workers. The settlement follows cabinet approval for reports from pay review bodies covering teachers, senior civil servants, judges, the armed forces, nurses, and doctors and dentists. The review bodies' recommendations will be met in full from April, with the exception of the armed forces, which will receive part of an average 3.6 per cent increase from January. The awards compare with inflation of 1.9 per cent. The settlement was rushed through by the cabinet to clear the way for a campaign to restore the government's battered authority before the local and European elections in May and June. However, a political row was brewing last night over the extent of job losses needed to finance the pay rises without breaching a freeze on public sector pay bills announced in the November Budget. Mr John Major told MPs in a Commons written answer that there would be no 'new money' to finance the settlement, which will add nearly Pounds 1bn to the government pay bill. He also ruled out a raid on the government's Pounds 3.5bn contingency reserve. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the settlement was a theoretical pay rise which would cost many workers their jobs. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the planned efficiency savings were 'code' for job losses. Downing Street said departmental spending ministers had already identified efficiency savings which would finance the bulk of the increases with minimal job losses. A senior official said opposition claims that the freeze on departmental running costs would inevitably lead to job losses or cuts in services were 'arrant nonsense'. 'This decision has not been taken without the relevant ministers having an extremely clear idea about where the savings are going to come from,' he said. However, the government's approach to public sector pay has clearly softened since the Budget, when Mr Clarke insisted that efficiency savings should be used to fund improved services as well as higher pay. City analysts said it would be difficult to fund the rise in the pay bill from productivity increases. Some suggested job cuts of 40,000 would be needed to cover the review body rises. Union leaders were pleased that the review bodies' recommendations had been broadly accepted. The bodies were effectively suspended during the operation of the 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit in 1993-94. The unions were also pleased that pay rises will be close to those in the private sector, where earnings are currently rising at about 3 per cent. Mr Mick Graham, local government secretary of the GMB general union, said that the 4m public sector workers not covered by review bodies would see 3 per cent as a 'benchmark'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the award was 'probably the best obtainable in the current climate'. The settlement means that public sector pay as a whole will lag behind the private sector for the second year running after outstripping it in the two previous years. The detailed findings of the public sector pay review bodies include a move towards performance only pay rises for senior civil servants and a further move to hasten the introduction of local bargaining in the National Health Service.

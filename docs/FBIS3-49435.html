"Without a prompt resolution of the Kosova problem and  without an end to the abrogation of all human, civil, and  national rights of the Albanians in Kosova, the Balkans will  ultimately face the serious possibility of a devastating  conflict which would not only obstruct the new NATO Partnership  for Peace initiative, but would also affect the present  structure of NATO itself," says the letter, asking NATO use its  influence to: redeploy international human rights monitors to  Kosova; send peacekeeping forces to the region; keep  international pressure on Serbia; and bring the perpetrators of  crimes against humanity to justice.    This letter together with a statement of the Kosova prime  minister elaborating the need for action on Kosova were sent to  all NATO-member heads of governments in Brussels.    Dr. Bujar Bukoshi said in the statement that "without a just  solution to the Kosova problem, there can be no comprehensive  settlement of the brutally aggressive Balkan conflict," adding  that unless it is addressed as an international problem, it will  "lead inevitably to an international conflict which will demand  international action."    Prime minister Bukoshi offers a comprehensive account of the  deteriorating situation in Kosova following the expulsion of  Serbia of the CSCE mission to Kosova.    In face of the alarming situation in Kosova, prime minister  Bukoshi urges NATO summit to consider four specific actions to  address the problem "realistically and effectively." One is the  redeployment of the international human rights monitors to  Kosova, in compliance with the UN Security Council's resolution  adopted last August. Second, Kosova prime minister asks for UN  or NATO peacekeeping forces to be deployed in Kosova in order to  avoid a massive bloodshed in face of the heavy Serbian military,  paramilitary, and police build-up. Third, Dr. Bukoshi maintains  that the "economic sanctions against Serbia must be kept in  place," although as he says, "the people of Kosova suffer on two  counts" from sanctions imposed on Kosova by Serbia itself and  the international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.    [passage indistinct] the perpetrators of crimes against  humanity to justice. "Prompt and decisive action by the United  Nations War Crimes Tribunal will do much to teach the criminal  aggressors that such gross crimes against humanity will not go  unpunished," says Dr. Bukoshi in his today's statement, adding  that "failed policies of the past are no excuse for the failure  to act in the present. The means to avert a Kosova calamity are  clear. All that remains in the will of NATO and the  international community to act."</p>

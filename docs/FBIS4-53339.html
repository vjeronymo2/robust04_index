			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter U Chong-chang: "How Is the Money of </F> the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan Remitted to  North Korea?"]    [Text] We could not feel the warm breeze of April but a  piercing wind was blowing, making us adjust our clothes. We are  at Niigata Port, situated on the western coast of Japan, at  around 1430 on 20 April. Niigata Port is where the fellow  countrymen who were repatriated to the North, are filled with  regret. Right at this place, the ship Mangyongbong-92 came to  anchor. It left Niigata Port on 11 April with the  congratulatory group of Kim Il-song's 82d birthday and the  visiting group to visit their families who were repatriated to  the North. It returned after making a 1,000km trip from Wonsan  to Niigata.    At around 1330, one hour before the arrival of the  Mangyongbong-92, one omnibus carrying a a white banner with the  word "reception" in Korean, and one automobile upon which hung a  large North Korean flag arrived at the pier. The only people  welcoming the Mangyongbong-92 were five to six people in the  omnibus and the automobile which came from the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon]  Headquarters in Niigata Prefecture and the Niigata Central  Branch of Chongnyon. The crowd welcoming the Kim Il-song  birthday congratulatory group was also shabby.    When the Mangyongbong-92 slowly came into the pier, the  `Song  of General Kim Il-song' was heard through the large speaker.  Employees of the Niigata Port Maritime Security Office set up  barricades at both ends of the pier and controlled people from  coming and going. When the door of the ship's cabin opened,  three Japanese customs officers went on board and then the  passengers got off board headed by an old man in a wheelchair.  The number of passengers amounted to 250 people.    When leaving Niigata Port on 11 April, there were about  1,000  pieces of baggage, but now there was only one bag per person.  They left with much baggage and returned empty handed. Some  big figures including reporters from the CHOSON SINBO, a paper  affiliated with Chongnyon, carried North Korean special products  such as blueberry wine and ginseng liquor. These were not  contained in shopping bags but in vinyl bags for one-day use.  The customs procedure ended by attaching just one tag to their  belongings.    In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, measures  for economic sanctions in North Korea have been brought up.  Thus, Niigata Port is once again attracting the world's  attention. Among the economic sanctions, the greatest blow  North Korea can suffer from is blocking the remittance of money  to North Korea through the Mangyongbong-92. The easiest place  to restrain the Mangyongbong-92 from going to North Korea is  Niigata Port.    Niigata Port is the original base of the repatriation ship.  Niigata Port can be seen in our textbooks. The first  repatriation ship left Niigata Port on 14 December 1959,  carrying 975 Korean residents in Japan from 238 households.  Since then until 1984, 93,339 Korean residents in Japan boarded  the repatriation ship for North Korea at Niigata Port. Since  there were no longer any Korean residents in Japan who wanted to  go to North Korea, such a project was completely suspended in  1984. Nevertheless, the Mangyongbong-92's entry into Niigata  Port continues.    Along the 2km road from the Minami Plaza Hotel in Niigata  Prefecture to the office of the Niigata Chongnyon Headquarters,  many willows have been planted. They have been planted along  the street every 50 meters. This is the 'willow street' which  Chongnyon takes pride in. Chongnyon had planted these trees in  commemoration of the first repatriation ship that left Niigata  Port in 1959. The willows which were only the size of a child's  finger, have now grown to be as thick as an adult's thigh, 35  years later. The willows are growing to be a symbol of time  showing the history of the repatriation ship.    It has been learned that since last autumn, when it began  to discuss in earnest the problem of economic sanctions against  North Korea, the Japanese Government has put under control  Chongnyon's remittance to North Korea via Niigata port. However,  we could not sense such an atmosphere on-the-spot at Niigata.  The international terminal of Niigata port where the  Mangyongbong is anchored was rather decorated as a tourist site.  The terminal did not look like a chilly and quiet port as it was  seen when Korean residents in Japan were repatriated to North  Korea in the past. An observation platform and seats for  spectators were installed in the terminal so that people can  observe the Mangyongbong calling at and leaving the port. Even  spectators were able to freely observe customhouse officers'  inspection activities nearby. The information board installed in  the terminal was written in Korean along with English and  Japanese. In other words, the terminal has changed into a  sightseeing spot for South Koreans.    We could sense North Korea's serious food shortage even at  Niigata port. When the repatriation of Korean residents to  North Korea began in the past, North Korea's propaganda said  that North Korea "will provide them with a tile-roofed house,  silk clothes, rice, and meat soup," and the Mangyongbong  intentionally prevented repatriates from loading their food on  the boat. This was in order to show that North Korea "lives in  opulence."    However, entering the nineties, North Korea did not prevent  the repatriates to North Korea from bringing food with them.  Rather, in 1991 Chongnyon waged a campaign to send foodstuffs  for the repatriates to North Korea. What cropped up in the wake  of this campaign was so-called "foodstuffs sets for gift." The  foodstuffs sets were divided into three kinds of "rice set,"  "rice-cake set," and "noodle set."    The "rice set" contains 10 kilograms of rice, two cans of  sesame oil, one bag (500 grams) of condiments, and one bag (one  kilogram) of sugar. "Rice-cake set" and "noodle set" also  contain foodstuffs such as ramyon noodles, condiments, and  sugar. The price of each foodstuffs set is 11,000 yen. Korean  residents in Japan who are not repatriated to North Korea, as  well, can buy and send these foodstuffs sets to North Korea.    The company which deals with this business is the Kyonghwa  Business Company in Niigata Prefecture. The Kyonghwa business  company is located one kilometer away from Niigata port and 50  meters away from the Chongnyon Niigata Prefecture Headquarters.  The Kyonghwa company founded in June 1976 is operated by the  Chongnyon Central Headquarters. The head of the Chongnyon  Central Headquarters is Yi Chae-yong.    In addition to the Kyonghwa company, there are the Chongnyon  Niigata headquarters, the Chongnyon Niigata Central Branch  Office which is in charge of repatriating Korean residents in  Japan to North Korea, the Choun Credit Union which is a  Chongnyon-operated Korean bank in Japan, and the  Chongnyon-operated Korean junior and senior high schools in  Niigata Prefecture. Korean compatriots in Niigata number about  2,700. Of those, Chongnyon-affiliated Korean residents are only  about 960. The number of students at the Chongnyon-operated  schools does not exceed 70. Mr. Kim Haeng-su, standing adviser  to the (pro-Seoul) Federation of Korean Residents in Japan  [Mindan], 71, said that "the number of seceders from Chongnyon  is on the increase."    Chongnyon's routine life in Niigata varies according to the  moves of the Mangyongbong. On the day when the Mangyongbong  does not put in at the Niigata port we can see the shutters of  the buildings of Chongnyon Niigata Central Branch Office and the  Kyonghwa business company pulled down. We can see no one in  these buildings, as well as in the building of the Chongnyon  Niigata headquarters. On the contrary, when the Mangyongbong  calls at the port the shutters open again, and the buildings  become a houseful of people carrying baggage. The Korean  residents belonging to Mindan were not interested in the  Mangyongbong calling at and leaving Niigata port.    One day in early 1990 the Mangyongbong delayed its departure  time for a couple of hours despite the fact that passengers and  cargo were already on board and customhouse officers'  inspections, as well, were finished.    A couple of hours later, a taxi arrived hurriedly in front  of  the Mangyongbong. The person who got off in a hurry from the  taxi was a certain Yi, vice chairman of the Chongnyon  Headquarters. He carried a briefcase. The Mangyongbong departed  as soon as he embarked on the ship. Later, a former Chongnyon  cadre member revealed that the delay in the Mangyongbong's  departure at that time was because of this briefcase which  contained money.    Cargo carried by the Mangyongbong is inspected at random by  Japanese customs offices, which open and inspect about ten  parcels selected randomly out of thousands unloaded at the port.  They confiscate those things found to be uncleared, and clear  everything that has no particular problem. This inspection  system has been unchanged for a long time.    Japanese customs inspection is not tight because of  government policy. The Japanese Government thoroughly controls  the introduction of drugs and murderous weapons in the country,  but customarily hardly interrupts people from taking them out of  the country. Japanese law allows anyone who stays in Japan to  carry money not exceeding five million yen without notifying the  Ministry of Finance when departing Japan. Passengers of the  Mangyongbong are no exception. Some people, however, criticize  that the Japanese Government does not control the illegal  remittance via the Mangyongbong under the situation in which the  North Korean nuclear issue has emerged to be a worldwide issue  because it does not want to have the extra security burden  imposed by possible protests by Chongnyon.    However, a large amount of cash is hardly found inside the  cargo. Chang Myong-su, 60, who was vice chairman of Chongnyon  headquarters in Niigata and is working as secretary general of  the Council for Treating Defectors from the Republic [North  Korea] since he left Chongnyon as he felt conscientiously uneasy  with the business of sending people to North Korea, said:  "People do not attempt the dangerous gamble of hiding money  inside packages because there are various ways to send money to  North Korea."  <H5>  The Mangyongbong Is the Source of Money for the North Korean </H5> Regime    According to a common view, Chongnyon funds are dispatched  to  North Korea through the Mangyongbong, banks in Japan, and third  countries. Out of these three channels, the Mangyongbong is  known as the best for the open remittance of large amounts of  money.    In 1975 North Korea began to ask Korean businessmen  affiliated with Chongnyon to donate to the fatherland. The  dispatch of money through the Mangyongbong also began that year.  The late Mun Tong-kon, who was vice chairman of Chongnyon and  was one of the special figures who made huge donations to North  Korea. He built a 5,378-ton cargo ship worth approximately one  billion yen and donated it to North Korea. Mun's donation was  reported large scale in the August 1976 issue of KUMIRUI CHOSON,  a Japan-based North Korean magazine for propagating North Korean  affairs to Japan. The ship donated by Mun was used in  transporting North Korean spies involved in the Aungsan  Mausoleum incident.    In November 1993, THE NEW YORK TIMES reported that millions  of yen were flowing into North Korea, hidden in suitcases and  plastic bags carried by the Mangyongbong. Sato Kazmi [as  transliterated], head of the Hyundai Korea Research Institute in  Japan, said that about six million yen come into North Korea  each year through the Mangyongbong, thus astonishing the world.    There are differences in opinion on the total amount of  money  dispatched to North Korea through the Mangyongbong. However,  Japanese Government officials, the Institute for Studying  Economic Issues in Asia, the East Asia Trade Institute, and the  ROK Embassy in Japan are unanimously saying: "The estimate that  the total remittance through the ship is six million yen is  against common sense. The presumed amount is 1-2 million yen  per year."    A former high-ranking official of Chongnyon said: "The  Chongnyon economy is influenced by the long-term economic slump  in Japan. The annual donation by an individual reached several  hundred million yen before 1980, but since the beginning of 1980  it declined and was finally reduced to tens of millions of yen  at the end of 1980."    The total amount of the remittance to North Korea through  the  Mangyongbong is still unknown, but no one denies that this ship  is the source of money supporting the North Korean regime as  well as the channel for smuggling advanced technologies needed  by North Korea. This is proven by facts that most equipment  used by North Korean spies is made in Japan, that a Japanese  truck made by Nissan was rebuilt as a missile launching ramp in  North Korea, and that Pyongyang Children's Palace is decorated  with computers from Japan's NEC.    A high-level source of Chongnyon has said: "The sending of  compatriots to North Korea has greatly contributed to North  Korea's munitions industry. To cite an example, Nikon  lens-making technology went to North Korea in the sixties, and  that of the semi-conductor industry went in the seventies. Such  technologies have not been properly made use of because North  Korea has not had its own technology to put those technologies  into practice."    There is no limit as to the number of personal items to be  loaded onto the Mangyongbong. Back in the early eighties, North  Korea limited the cargo to four items per person so as to block  materials of vulgar Western culture, including pornographic  magazines, from being imported along with other cargo. Items of  personal cargo were once limited to only two. But, since the  end of the eighties, the limits have been lifted. This is a  sign showing the economic difficulties facing North Korea. A  Chongnyon-affiliated industrialist in Niigata has once even  carried a total of 16 pieces of luggage on his way to meet his  child who had earlier been repatriated to North Korea.    Chongnyon sometimes remits money to North Korea through  banks  in Japan. A typical bank of the kind is the Asikaga Bank. The  bank is a regional bank in the Tochigi Prefecture and has about  160 branches across the country. It is a main bank with which  the Chongnyon-affiliated Choun Credit Union is in a  correspondent relationship. The Asikaga Bank has opened a legal  correspondent relationship with the Choson Joint-Venture Bank  headquartered in Pyongyang.  <H5>  Money Sent in Crisp Dollar Bank Notes on Kim Chong-il's </H5> Birthday    The third method is the remittance of money through a third  country such as China, Macao, or a Southeast Asian country. A  former Chongnyon cadre bore testimony to this, saying: "The  remittance through a third country is mainly done in Macao.  Yamaguchigumi, a gang of thugs in Japan, has a base in Macao.  Remittance is simple. A man willing to send money goes to  Macao. He does not have to carry money when traveling. He  borrows money from a gang of thugs on mortgage of his stationery  assets in Japan. After the gang examines, through its  organization in Japan, his capability for such mortgage, the  gang lends money to him within the scope of his capability. In  this way, a man has once remitted $500,000 at a time.    This route was often utilized with the approach of Kim  Chong-il's birthday (16 February). The money to be sent to Kim  Chong-il should be in crisp dollar bank notes. If the bank  notes are used ones, those involved will be blamed for  blasphemy. Therefore, they go to Macao and withdraw brand-new  bank notes from a Macao branch of a Chinese bank. The amount of  money is limited to $2.16 million to match the date of his birth  [16 February]. The money is wrapped in a thin cloth, put into  Samsonite bags, and then sent to North Korea."    He added that if a Chongnyon-affiliated industrialist  complains of the difficulty in donating money, North Korea would  even propose that "if you go to Macao, you will be introduced to  a remitter." He went on to say: "As the amount of money sent in  has dwindled since the early nineties, North Korea has forcibly  demanded that Chongnyon-affiliated industrialists "donate money  in return for being provided with North Korean zinc ingots and  steels on a priority basis." When industrialists say "it is  difficult to remit money due to Japanese Government  surveillance," using this as an excuse to turn down such a  proposal, then North Korea presented a method by saying "then,  come to Macao, you will be introduced to a Japanese gang of  thugs."    Ogata Sigetake, Director General of the Japan Public  Security  Investigation Agency, said in answer to a question by a Diet  member of the Liberal Democratic Party at the House of  Representatives's Budget Committee on 30 March: "The ways of  remitting money to North Korea mainly consists of payments in  trade transactions; sending money to relatives or acquaintances  in North Korea; paid-in capital in joint venture projects; and  donations to the Workers Party. Major ways for the remittance  are to remit money through banks, to hand-carry money to North  Korea, and to ask those visiting North Korea to carry it."    It is said that there are many other ways than using only  the  Mangyongbong route. For example, remittance can be carried out  through Japanese people, not through Chongnyon routes. Because  there are many ways like this, Japanese businessmen share the  view that it is hard to expect any effect to come from an  economic sanction against North Korea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 1 May (DPA) -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen's  liberal government, which will reportedly be defeated in today's  elections in Ecuador, has announced its willingness to "work and  cooperate" with the new Congress, in which opinion polls predict  the opposition will enjoy an ample majority. "We want  cooperation, not confrontation," Carlos Larreategui, the  government's secretary general, said while reporting that  everything was calm in the country during the election in which  6.2 million voters will elect 65 of the 77 Congress members.    No incidents have been reported during the election, which  began at 0700 local (1200 GMT) at 15,870 polling stations  throughout the country's 21 provinces. Nevertheless, military  forces are keeping watch at strategic locations, as stipulated  by the Electoral Law, which also forbids the sale of alcoholic  beverages.    "This is calm, not indifference," Jaime Nebot, former  presidential candidate for the Social Christian Party, said.  "Those who talk about indifference do so because they have not  seen the excitement of the party's campaign," he added.    According to opinion polls, the Social Christian Party will  be the overwhelming winners in the election. The party is  expected to win at least one-third of the seats for which the  country's 17 parties are competing. The government is expected  to be the great loser, receiving less than 10 percent of the  seats in the new Congress to be installed on 10 August.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the ideological affinity  between the government and the Social Christian Party, parties  separated by personal rather than ideological disagreements,  will allow implementation of the government's economic opening  program despite the government's minority in Congress.</p>

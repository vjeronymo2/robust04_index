			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP], considers his party's role in the  elections to have been successful. According to him, the  Smallholders could become the most significant opposition force  because, he said, after the Hungarian Democratic Forum's bad  performance, there is still an internal explosion awaiting it.  Torgyan also said that the Hungarian Socialist Party's success  has to be accepted.    Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] is of the view that in the past four years his party  has traveled the path that it set itself in 1990. According to  him, this was sufficient for it to achieve its election result.  [passage omitted]</p>

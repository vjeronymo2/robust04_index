			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Scientists demand share of Millennium Fund Science risks being left out of the Pounds 1.6bn Millennium Fund, Dr Anne McLaren, departing president of the British Association, warned at the final day of its science festival in Loughborough yesterday. Association leaders said scientific projects must be given a share of the fund, which will distribute a quarter of the proceeds of the new National Lottery to projects marking the start of the third millennium. The only millennium proposal so far with any scientific content is the redevelopment of the area of South Kensington in London inspired by Prince Albert in the 1850s which includes the Natural History Museum. Dr McLaren's successor, Sir Martin Rees, said one of his priorities during the coming year would be to help organise 'high-profile scientific proposals' to put to the Millennium Commission, which will decide how the fund is to be distributed. 'The important thing is to ensure that on the menu of millennium proposals there is at least one that is likely to be widely supported by the scientific community,' he said. Sir Martin, who will also become Astronomer Royal in January, said it was too early to specify scientific millennium projects. But he indicated that his preference was for something that would involve people all round Britain in science, rather than creating a grandiose UK equivalent of La Villette, the 'science city' in Paris. One possibility would be a nationwide network of science centres, linked by telecommunications and computer technology. At each centre, visitors could interact with their counterparts elsewhere in the country - videoconferencing, sharing experiences in virtual reality and taking part in collaborative games and experiments. Sir Martin said another priority during the coming year would be to monitor the performance of the new science minister, Mr David Hunt. 'By the time of our meeting in a year's time in Newcastle, he will be beyond his honeymoon period and we will want to see whether he can deliver on the promises he made in Loughborough this week,' he said. Mr Hunt told the association on Thursday of his commitment to fight for science in the government. 'Scientists are being very patient,' Dr McLaren said. 'Last year's science white paper was well received and it is excellent that we have a cabinet minister responsible for science. But by next summer, unless there are signs of a bit more money forthcoming for the science budget, scientists are going to become very concerned.' Dr McLaren, a distinguished geneticist, added that one sign of trouble was that the Medical Research Council was forced by lack of funds this summer to reject some excellent grant proposals.</p>

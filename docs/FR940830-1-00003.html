			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A referendum was conducted in 1989 to determine if majority of watermelon growers and handlers favored the passage of an industry funded research and promotion program for watermelons. The Plan is intended to collect assessments for research and promotion of watermelons. Currently, any individual not favoring the program can request a refund of the assessments paid by that individual. Procedures to request a refund of assessments are explained in the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers, and the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum. Watermelon imports enter the country primarily during the winter season. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds. The assessment rate for imports would be the combined total assessment rate paid by producers and handlers of domestic watermelons. The current assessment rate for producers is 2 cents per hundredweight and for handlers is 2 cents per hundredweight. The combined assessment rate for importers, therefore, would be 4 cents per hundredweight. Assessments will be paid at the time the watermelons enter the country. The collection of assessments on imported watermelons will be expected to generate an additional $137,400 per year in revenue to the Board. In order to make these changes, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.305, 1210.320, 1210.321, 1210.328, 1210.341, 1210.350, 1210.351, 1210.352, 1210.363, and 1210.364 of the Plan; &sect;&sect;1210.402 and 1210.405 of the nomination procedures; and &sect;&sect;1210.515, 1210.518, 1210.519, 1210.521, 1210.530, 1210.531, and 1210.532 of the rules and regulations. In addition, a new &sect;1210.314 will be added to the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate the collection of assessments on imported watermelons, the Secretary proposes that the United States Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury be designated as the collecting agency for assessments levied on such imports. Other commodity research and promotion programs utilize the Customs Service as a means of collecting assessments on imported products, and the Customs Service is agreeable to collecting these watermelon assessments. An agreement between the USDA and the Customs Service would be entered into to implement this action. In order to make this changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.518 of the Rules and Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The importer representation on the Board would be proportionate to the percentage of assessments paid by importers to the Board, except that at least one representative of importers would serve on the Board if importers are subject to the Plan. This representation would enable importers to participate in developing the Board's programs, plans, and projects, and express their views and concerns on how Board funds are used if imports are assessed under the Plan. Importers would nominate individuals to serve as importer members on the Board, and as required for other members of the Board, two nominees would be submitted to the Secretary for each vacancy. The Act requires the number of importers members to be proportionate to the assessments paid by importers. However, it is necessary to calculate the number of initial importer members on the volume of imports because imports are not currently being assessed. There are currently 14 producers and 14 handlers on the Board. This is the equivalent of one domestic industry member for every 67.7 million pounds of domestic production. Based on the average annual volume of imports during the last 3-year period (323.1 hundredweight), four importers would be added to the current Board. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.320, 1210.321, and 1210.401.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides for the elimination of refunds of assessments if the producers, handlers, and importers vote to eliminate refunds. The refund provision has been in effect since the beginning of the program. Refunds have been increasing every year from 9 percent in 1990 to almost 29 percent in 1993. If the refund provision is eliminated, it would provide the Board with an estimated additional $250,000 per year for research and promotion activities. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.343 and 1210.520.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the refund provision remains in the Plan, and importers are subject to the Plan, then importers would be entitled to a refund of all assessments paid on watermelons imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act increases the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons. Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year would be entitled to apply for a refund which would be the producer equivalent of the import assessments. The 150,000-pound exemption level for importers is the level determined to be equivalent to 10 acres of watermelons for domestic producers. In addition, the Act provides that the Board has the authority to establish rules for producers to certify whether they are exempt from the assessments. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.341, 1210.342, 1210.518, and 1210.521.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. This amendment would expand the Plan to cover producers, handlers, and importers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the District of Columbia. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.305 and would add a new &sect;1210.315.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1647(f) of the Act permits changes in the assessment rate through notice and comment rulemaking. No change to the Plan is necessary to implement this amendment to the Act because &sect;1210.341 of the Plan states that assessment rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1647(f) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision facilitates the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.321, 1210.363, 1210.368, and 1210.402.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act would now allow referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which would reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Act changes the criteria for determining the outcome of referenda. The Act previously provided that the Plan should not be effective unless approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers and handlers voting in the referendum, or producers and handlers of not less than two-thirds of the watermelons produced and handled during the representative period by producers and handlers voting in the referendum, and by not less than a majority of the producers and a majority of the handlers voting in the referendum. The Act now specifies that the determination of the results of a referendum should be on the basis of a simple majority of the producers, handlers, and, if covered by the Plan, importers voting in the referendum. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, &sect;1210.252 would be revised to correct a wording error made during the promulgation of the Plan and &sect;1210.322 would be revised to delete obsolete language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;1210.325 would be changed to reflect a change in the number of Board members that constitute a majority. This revision would reflect the addition of importer members to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

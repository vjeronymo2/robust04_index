			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Green light for sale of E German shipyards PRIVATISATION of a large part of the east German shipbuilding industry was given the green light yesterday by the Treuhand, the government agency selling off the former communist country's state industry. The managing board approved an 'international solution': the sale of the Warnow shipyard and, subject to an improved offer, the Neptun shipyard to the Kvaerner group in Norway. The MTW shipyard in Wismar and the DMR diesel engine plant in Rostock is to go to Bremer Vulkan of Germany. The deal, announced earlier this month, caused a serious political row in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the shipbuilding industry is located. Mr Alfred Gomolka, the Christian Democratic state leader, was forced to resign this week after originally backing the sale of all three shipyards to Bremer Vulkan with state financial participation. Shipbuilding workers demonstrated against the sale outside the headquarters of the Treuhand. 'A whole region is being unscrupulously wrecked and we will be forced to leave' Mr Eckhard Reschke, a member of the Works Council at DMR said angrily. Shipyard workers favoured the sale of all the shipbuilders to Bremer Vulkan which had previously saved thousands of shipbuilding jobs in Bremen with the help of generous state subsidies. Seven thousand of the present 10,000 jobs in the east German shipbuilding companies are to be retained until 1995 with stiff fines imposed on the buyer for violations. The Treuhand said yesterday that the sale, subject to the expected approval of the European Commission, would involve a 'considerable' financial contribution by the agency and the state. The agency is expected to assume previous debts by the shipbuilding companies, losses stemming from new orders as well as making investments to improve productivity totalling up to DM3bn (Pounds 1bn).</p>

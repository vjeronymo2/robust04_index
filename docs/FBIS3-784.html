This was announced at a  Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberley today. Speaking after the  meeting, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi said the Alliance had agreed that General Viljoen  should resign so that he could lead his Freedom Front in the  election. General Viljoen said that he was prepared to join the  Freedom Alliance as the leader of the Freedom Front. Meanwhile,  the former Conservative Party leader in Natal, Mr. Carl Werth,  has confirmed that eight of the region's 11 executive members  have agreed to stand as candidates for the Freedom Front. He  said that they had taken the decision at a recent meeting.  Leaders of the Freedom Alliance meeting expressed strong  disapproval of the deposing of Dr. Lucas Mangope as president of  Bophuthatswana. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Dr. Mangope had  been betrayed and stabbed in the back. He said there was a need  for the alliance to review its position following the weekend's  events.    A Conservative Party spokesman said the events in  Bophuthatswana had been planned by the ANC [African National  Congress] through the Transitional Executive Council, to deprive  the state of its independence.</p>

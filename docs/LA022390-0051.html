			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAVEL: A MAN IN SEARCH OF AN IDEAL  </P> <P> Of all the noble souls thrust into prominence in the thrilling months since  tyranny's icy grip on Eastern Europe began to loosen, Vaclav Havel,  Czechoslovakia's playwright-turned-president, is perhaps the greatest. This  week he addressed a joint session of Congress. What he said concerning the need  for a wise and enlightened U.S. approach to Soviet affairs already has been  widely discussed. But much of his talk dealt with democracy and the  responsibilities of, and toward, the human spirit. It bears thoughtful  consideration.  </P> <P> "Without a global revolution in our sphere of human consciousness, nothing will  change for the better in the sphere of being," Havel said. "We still don't know  how to put morality ahead of politics , science and economy. We are still  incapable of understanding that the only genuine backbone of all our actions,  if they are to be moral, is responsibility -- responsibility to something  higher than my family, my country, my company, my success.  </P> <P> "When Thomas Jefferson wrote that governments are instituted among men,  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, it was a simple  and important act of the human spirit. What gave meaning to that act, however,  was the fact that the author backed it up with his life. It was not just his  words; it was his deed as well."  </P> <P> Communism's bequest to Czechoslovakia, Havel said, was "a legacy of countless  dead, an infinite spectrum of human suffering, profound economic decline and,  above all, enormous human humiliation." But though they have been victims,  Czechs and Slovaks feel "a sense of culpability for our former reprehensible  passivity . . . . Democracy in the full sense of the word will always be no  more than an ideal. One may approach it as one would a horizon, in ways that  may be better or worse, but it can never be fully attained . . . . You, too,  are merely approaching democracy."  </P> <P> It is sobering to wonder who among our own leaders could have framed such  thoughts? Who among them could have set them down entirely by himself, as Havel  did. Who of them would have spoken so clearly and so fearlessly? And, yet, how  edifying that the man who did all those things chose to do them in the very  heart of our own imperfect American democracy.  </P></p>

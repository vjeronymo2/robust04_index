			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "NATO Ready To Hoist Russian Flag"] </F>   [Text] Paris -- NATO has recently received some highly  encouraging signals suggesting that Russia will sign the  Partnership for Peace [PFP] agreement in the next few months,  Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO deputy secretary general, has  stated.    It would be premature to think that Moscow will affiliate to  this program in May or June, the deputy secretary general noted,  addressing the opening of the headquarters of the Partnership  for Peace coordinating center in the Belgian city of Mons, but  we hope that the Russian flag will fly here alongside the others  this summer.    Previously this same building in Mons housed the center  which  directed the Live Oak military program, which was designed to  repulse Moscow in the event that it tried to blockade West  Berlin. It symbolized the division of Europe, U.S. General  George Joulwan, NATO supreme allied commander Europe, stressed  at the ceremony, but in the future it will be a symbol of the  new NATO and the new Europe.    It seems that the Russian Government, the NATO deputy  secretary general noted, is now unanimous over the need to  affiliate to Partnership for Peace, which 14 East European  countries have joined.    It seems that NATO regards the participation of General  Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff,  in the NATO military planning committee session in Brussels as  one of these signals: Among other things that session examined  questions of cooperation with the East.    In the weeks ahead, military men from the East European  states will begin preparing for joint exercises in Mons and  participation in peacekeeping operations and other NATO events.  The first maneuvers within the Partnership for Peace program  will be held this summer.</p>

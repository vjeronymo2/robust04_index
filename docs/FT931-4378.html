			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Personal View: How Lamont can square the circle To tax or not to tax - that, according to most economic commentators, is the dilemma facing Britain's chancellor of the exchequer in his Budget. To tax would risk strangling an incipient recovery. Yet Norman Lamont must tax soon or the deficit will get out of hand. The most widely held view is that he should not tax in March, but should in December. This choice has been presented too starkly. The danger of inhibiting recovery arises from reducing effective demand for goods and services. But there are two ways of increasing taxation, overall, which could reduce the deficit without reducing demand. One is by changing the tax mix. If the chancellor increased taxation on the savers and reduced it on the spenders, he could take rather more from the savers than he gave back to the spenders without reducing aggregate demand. To take an oversimplified example: if there were two groups of taxpayers of equal size, one of which saved half of any additions to their income while the other saved none, the chancellor could raise twice as much in extra taxes from the former as he returned to the latter in reduced taxes, without diminishing aggregate demand. In general, the lower income groups save very little of any additions to income while the highest income groups save more. A change in the balance of taxation, taking more from the rich and less from the poor, would enable the chancellor to contribute to deficit reduction without harming recovery. There are many ways in which this could be achieved which could be calculated with some precision from the Treasury's economic model. Thus, for example, the reduction in demand arising from an additional top rate of income tax of 45 or 50 per cent on, say, taxable incomes above Pounds 40,000, could be matched by an increase in the income tax threshold or an extension of the 20 per cent band. More acceptable to the Conservatives' low tax philosophy (which has really meant low income tax philosophy) would be to raise the upper limit for employees' National Insurance contributions and offset the demand effect by raising the lower limit. Of course, the increase in demand could come from additional public spending. It would cost about Pounds 1bn a year to give an extra Pounds 20 a week to those unemployed for more than a year - either directly (to show that the community still cared) or subject to some 'workfare' conditions. Payment to the long-term unemployed would rarely be saved and more than Pounds 1bn could be taken from higher rate taxpayers, without reducing demand. The other way of reducing the deficit, by taxing without cutting demand, is to increase inheritance tax. Property owners rarely feel it necessary to save against future death duties, while inheritors only have regard to the post-tax inheritance. The state can insert a bigger tax wedge between what is left at death and what the beneficiaries receive without reducing demand. A new rate of death duty - say, 50 per cent on estates of more than Pounds 500,000 - could be added to the present 40 per cent rate. Any fear that adverse effects on agriculture or the private business might inhibit recovery have been removed by the reliefs of successive Conservative chancellors. The contribution to deficit reduction by an increase in inheritance tax would be small, but a useful start. Moreover, because of the much increased opportunities for accumulation by the wealthy which have been provided by the Conservatives, an inheritance tax increase should prove an expanding source of revenue, especially if the easier avoidance loopholes were blocked. Many people would see these measures as desirable in their own right. One of the least attractive features of the Thatcher years has been the enormous increase in income inequalities (see table). Changing the tax mix would be a modest offset. Moreover, if the higher tax were seen as a specific measure to help the long-term unemployed, even some of the payers might not be too displeased. As for death duties, it has always been inconsistent that the party which stressed the enterprise culture and pay-related performance should favour low death duties. The characteristic of inheritance is that the beneficiaries' receipts are unrelated to any contribution (with the possible exception of spouses, who are exempt anyway). Perhaps the need to curb the deficit could even promote a little more consistency in the Conservative philosophy] The author is emeritus professor of political economy of the University of Bath and former director of Bath University Centre for Fiscal Studies.  -------------------------------------         PERCENTAGE SHARE OF        EQUIVALISED POST-TAX         INCOME BY QUINTILE        GROUPS OF HOUSEHOLDS*  ------------------------------------- Quintile group           1979    1990  ------------------------------------- Bottom                    9.5     6.3 Second                   13.0    10.0 Third                    18.0    15.0 Fourth                   23.0    23.0 Top                      37.0    45.0  ------------------------------------- *Equivalisation is designed to allow for different family sizes  ------------------------------------- Source: Economic Trends  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed his serious  regrets at the House of Councillors' Budget Committee this  morning on North Korea's (the DPRK's) announcement of its  withdrawal from the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency).  He indicated that he would continue to persist in persuading  North Korea to agree to hold dialogue with the international  community.    [Begin Hata recording] With regard to the withdrawal from  IAEA, it is indeed unfortunate. However, this still does not  mean withdrawal from the nuclear NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty].  In the circumstances, we still hold hopes that they [the North  Koreans] will open their doors to the international community as  soon as possible to eliminate suspicions about their development  of nuclear weapons. [end recording]    Hata thus indicated his intention to persist in persuading  North Korea to engage in dialogue with the international  community.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Blair signals end to public ownership commitment: Labour's new leader reinforces historic shift to centre ground Mr Tony Blair pledged yesterday to rewrite Labour's constitutional commitment to public ownership, using his conference debut as party leader to underscore a historic shift towards the political centre ground. His surprise decision to signal at the Blackpool conference an end to the party's 75-year attachment to Clause 4 of its constitution came in a speech which redefined Labour's economic and social ambitions. The move, backed by his more traditionalist deputy, Mr John Prescott, represented a calculated effort by Mr Blair to persuade the voters that his leadership foreshadows an irreversible shift in the party's policies. Clause 4, committing the party to 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange' has been a symbol of Labour's socialism since it was first stamped on membership cards in 1918. It was last challenged - unsuccessfully - by the then Labour leader Mr Hugh Gaitskell after the party's election defeat in 1959. But Mr Blair said Labour now needed a 'clear, up-to-date' statement of its objectives. In a confident, uncompromising performance which won warm applause from his audience but later drew sniping from some on the party's hard left, Mr Blair said the party had no alternative but to change. 'We have changed and we were right to change,' he said. 'Parties that don't change die and this party is a living movement, not an historical monument.' Directing his speech at a far wider audience than the 4,000 delegates and supporters in Blackpool's Empress Ballroom, Mr Blair embraced the market economy, underlined his support for the family and reassured the middle classes that Labour had abandoned its high tax and spending policies. There would be no wholesale repeal of the government's trades union laws and a tough stance on rising crime. In spite of earlier disputes at the conference over taxation, he insisted: 'To middle and lower income Britain facing the biggest tax rise in peacetime history - Labour is on your side.' Casting Labour as the party of the majority rather than the 'privileged few', he launched a fierce attack on the Tories for their 'incompetence' and dogmatic attachment to unfettered market forces. Labour's ambitions for a partnership between public and private sectors would foster individual opportunity: 'We are the mainstream voice in British politics today - Labour back to speak up for Britain, Labour back as the people's party.' Mr Blair said Labour's strategy would be built on the four pillars of opportunity, responsibility, fairness and trust. But it would include a new realism in which the party would promise the electorate only what it could deliver. Mr Blair appeared confident after his speech that his plan for a new statement of the party's ambitions - which he will present to the National Executive before Christmas - would be carried at next year's conference. But leading leftwingers indicated their determination to campaign to preserve Clause 4. Blair's new vision, Page 12 Editorial Comment and Observer, Page 23</p>

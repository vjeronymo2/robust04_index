			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: France Few French investors will be trudging into work this morning with red eyes and weary step having combed through the fine print of the new government's budget. Its main outlines had already been trailed, allowing the markets a more measured contemplation of their effect. The government was always going to face difficulties reconciling demands to reduce the projected FFr340bn budget deficit and to stimulate economic growth. The rise in indirect taxes on petrol and alcohol provided a touch of rigour in addressing the former problem. A modest spending programme offered some encouragement for the latter. The bond market may appreciate this lack of drama. The equity market, though, may begin to worry more about the underlying economic situation. The government is now projecting a 0.4 per cent fall in market sector GDP in 1993, suggesting real damage to corporate earnings. Some support should be provided by new tax incentives designed to encourage investors to switch from money market funds into share savings plans ahead of the government's privatisation programme. Further cuts in interest rates would provide a more direct impulse. That, though, will depend on France's eastern neighbour.</p>

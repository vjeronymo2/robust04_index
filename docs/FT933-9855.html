			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Jury may order big asbestos penalties A MISSISSIPPI jury has found two US companies, Westinghouse Electric and Dresser Industries, and an Australian company, Colonial Sugar Refinery, guilty of wrongfully distributing products containing asbestos, and ordered them to pay damages and penalties that could total hundreds of millions of dollars, Patrick Harverson writes from New York. Another US company, Uniroyal, was also found guilty but will not be affected by the verdict because it had already settled during the trial. The jury in the four-month trial, which was a consolidation of 9,600 individual asbestos-exposure lawsuits, ruled in favour of plaintiffs who claimed they suffered lung injuries from inhaling products containing asbestos fibres. The four companies were held liable for intentionally and maliciously distributing defective, asbestos-bearing products. The jury will begin considering how much to award as punitive damages today. The jury awarded damages of Dollars 9.26m (Pounds 6.2m) to just six representative plaintiffs whose cases were part of the trial. Three other representative plaintiffs were found not to be eligible for compensation. Five smaller defendant companies named in the lawsuit were found not guilty.</p>

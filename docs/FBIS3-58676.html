It was learned that  the uneasiness felt by Russia over a Turkic summit was the  reason for the postponement.    Besides, it is being claimed that Uzbekistan and  Turkmenistan  wanted the summit to be postponed to avoid giving the impression  that the summit is a front against Armenia. Whereas, the  Azerbaijani Government stated that the summit was postponed to  allow for better preparations for it.    The second summit of the Turkic republics -- the first was  held in Turkey in 1992 -- would have been held in Baku at the  end of 1993. However, Geydar Aliyev postponed the summit until  January. Ankara was surprised by Aliyev's decision to postpone  it for a second time.</p>

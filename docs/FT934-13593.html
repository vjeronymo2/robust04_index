			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / NHS seeks Pounds 1m telecom savings A MULTI-million pound contract between Mercury Communications, the main rival to British Telecommunications, and the National Health Service, could save the NHS more than Pounds 1m a year on telecommunications costs. The contract was billed by the NHS as the 'first step' in a rationalisation of its Pounds 150m annual bill for linking its 22,000 sites. About 10 per cent of the Pounds 150m already goes to Mercury for a large part of the NHS's long-distance phone and fax traffic. The deal involves a special tariff package for high usage, with the prospect of further savings as it is extended to include more NHS sites. Mercury now links about 350 of the NHS's 22,000 sites. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said: 'We are pleased that suppliers like Mercury recognise the NHS as a single major customer and provide the sort of discounts that a large customer should expect.' Mr Peter Bury, Mercury's National Customer Director, said: 'Genuine partnership between government bodies and suppliers is becoming more important as the public sector seeks to increase value for money.' The deal underlines Mercury's growing role in the public sector. Earlier this month the company, a subsidiary of the Cable &amp; Wireless group, won the outsourcing contract for the government's long-distance telecommunications network, serving about 250,000 civil servants in 550 sites.</p>

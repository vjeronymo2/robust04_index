			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Waiting for GSP Extension"] </F>   [Text] The United States government's decision to grant  Indonesia another six months in which to improve the protection  of its workers rights before deciding whether to extend or with  draw its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) surely portends  an eventually satisfactory solution to that issue. We, thus  feel that we can rest assured that the American government will  opt for the most rational measure to maintain good, productive  relations and mutual understanding with Indonesia.    Extending the validity of the GSP facility seems to be the  best alternative, seen from at least two major points of view.    First of all, now is the worst time for the U.S. to pick a  fight with Indonesia, the chair of the Nonaligned Movement,  which will host the next annual summit of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum in November. Withdrawal of the GSP  facility not only would unnecessarily become a thorn in the side  of the otherwise good and mature relations between the two  countries but also would be counter-productive to the United  States' noble objective of helping improve human and workers'  rights.    The Indonesian Government which has now become increasingly  assertive in international fora, obviously dreads the political  more than the economic impact of the stoppage of the facility.  After all, the $650 million worth of exports that it might lose  with the GSP withdrawal would only make a small dent in its  total exports of more than $30 billion. What would hurt most  would be the "political slap in the face" of a government which  has been priding itself on many internationally-acclaimed  development achievements.    However, the most important point is the fact that the  Indonesian Government has fully understood the message of the  United States' threat to withdraw the GSP facility. The  government has been making concerted efforts to improve the  protection of workers' rights. The trade union movement has  been restructured to make it a more effective forum for the  protection of those rights. The decree that allowed military  intervention to break strikes has been revoked and the minimum  daily wages have been increased.    The government may perhaps violate the International Labor  Organization's convention by allowing only one trade union but  that, we think, is not "the end of the world" in terms of the  workers' plight. In fact, that issue is more political in  nature than it is economic.    In a country where millions of people are fully unemployed  and over 30 million are under-employed, the political right to  organize is certainly not top priority in the agenda for the  protection of workers' rights. [sentence as published]    What the government has been doing to force employers to  improve the lot of their workers counts much more than the mere  existence of hundreds of trade unions, which are either impotent  or technically incompetent to negotiate anything economically  viable with powerful employers, or which are simply  trigger-happy bodies ready to resort to strikes anytime they  want to demand something.    Obviously, the protection of workers' rights should not be  seen nor undertaken as a oneshot measure, but should be treated  as an ongoing process, which follows the stages of economic  development and which should take into account the international  market competition.    It would be futile or even disastrous to the economic  stability of this nation if the government, under strong  pressure from outside, enforced minimum wages at such high  levels it might drive many employers into bankruptcy.    We fully understand that a facility or trade privilege, such  as GSP, normally imposes certain economic and political  requirements. But the enforcement of such requirements should  take into account what is economically and politically feasible  in the country beneficiary at a particular period of time and  what should be postponed until a more appropriate time rolls  around.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts strengthen on success of Bank's Pounds 3bn auction UK government bonds surged by over a point yesterday on news that the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year gilts - the biggest-ever auction of UK government stock and the first in the government's new programme of gilt issuance - had been well-received. The strong rally prompted the Bank to take advantage of the favourable market conditions by announcing a further Pounds 600m of 8 per cent stock due 2003 available for sale with effect from today. Gilt-edged marketmakers described the Bank of England's auction of the 8 per cent gilt due 2013 as a 'big success', pointing to the relatively high cover of 1.96 and the lack of a 'tail'. The 'cover' is the ratio of bids to the amount of stock on offer, so a high cover suggests that demand from dealers and investors was strong. The 'tail' at an auction is the difference between the average accepted yield and the highest accepted yield. The Bank said both the average and the highest accepted yield were 8.53 per cent at yesterday's auction. The lowest accepted yield was 8.52 per cent. 'The auction result exceeded people's wildest dreams,' said Mr Chris Anthony, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Long-dated gilt prices gained a point on the auction announcement and remained firm during the afternoon. The Liffe gilt future rose from 105.07 to a high of 106.17 in heavy trading before ending at around 106.13. Ten-year gilts gained about half a point, while short-dated issues underperformed the rest of the market as hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate faded. As a result, the gilt yield curve flattened yesterday. Gilt-edged marketmakers said demand at yesterday's auction came mainly from domestic institutions, although they noted some foreign buying interest too. The market had been particularly anxious about the auction, as it is the first one to take place in the Bank of England's new funding programme of bigger and more frequent auctions. GERMAN government bonds ended lower on the day, reflecting market disappointment at the Bundesbank's small cut in the repo rate yesterday. The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM84.6bn in its tender, and cut the lowest allocated rate for 13-day funds to 8.17 per cent from 8.25 per cent at the previous week's repo. The central bank drained a net amount of DM13.8bn from the market. Dealers said the market had hoped for a larger decline in the repo rate. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 95.58, and climbed to a high of 95.68 early in the trading session, but drifted lower in the course of the day to end at around 95.38. US Treasury prices weakened in thin trading yesterday as investors chose to stay on the sidelines before tomorrow's important employment figures. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 102 1/2 , yielding 6.922 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also lower, down  1/8 at 99 13/16 , to yield 3.957 per cent. Dealers put the modest declines down to the Chicago purchasing managers' February manufacturing and employment indices, which came in stronger than expected. The market ignored news of a 1.4 per cent rise in February factory orders and a 0.5 per cent rise in the February leading indicators, increases that were in line with expectations. The day's data aside, investors' attention remained fixed on the all-important jobs report for March, which will be released tomorrow. Analysts are expecting the figures to show a 100,000 increase in non-farm payrolls. THE combination of a strong yen and stock market weakness in Tokyo helped to push up Japanese government bond prices yesterday morning, although the market later fell back to close lower on the day on hedge-selling by dealers. The yen strengthened against the dollar during Tokyo trading, prompting the futures contract to rise from its opening price of 108.65 to a high of 108.86. However, bond prices later weakened on hedge-selling after the monthly government bond auction, and the futures contract ended Tokyo trading at 108.51. The futures contract picked up again in London trading, reaching 108.81 as the yen appreciated against the dollar. The ministry of finance auctioned Y800bn of 10-year bonds with a coupon of 4.5 per cent, up from 4.2 per cent at the previous auction. This marks the first time that the coupon has been raised in nearly a year. The 10-year bonds were auctioned at an average yield of 4.458 per cent. In the cash market, the benchmark No 145 issue yield opened at 4.2 per cent, moved in a range of 4.185 to 4.220 per cent, and ended at 4.22 per cent.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rising bond prices cited as DAX tests 2,000 ACCORDING to the Eurotrack 100, bourses saw their best share prices at the beginning of the day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's DAX index tested the 2,000 mark, peaking at 1,997.71 before ending at a new all-time closing high of 1,987.05, up 14.32. Turnover eased from DM10.8bn to DM10.6bn. Brokers thought that a break above 2,000 was only a matter of time, and the Ibis indicated DAX rose to 1,994.81 in the afternoon. The talk yesterday was all of the relationship between equities and rising bond prices. Corporate earnings prospects were a less attractive proposition. According to Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, the DAX is on prospective earnings of DM75 to DM80 a share for 1993, so it would need eps growth of a quarter to a third in 1994 to put it on a prospective p/e of 20; even that would be at the high end of European valuations. Big winners on the day included one leader of the recent rally in Allianz, the insurer, up DM32 at DM2,740 on a 1993 progress report; losers took in Daimler, DM6.30 lower at DM753.70 following its US debut, and Kaufhof, down DM10 at DM550 as it sank in that the retailer's plans for a New York quotation did not involve a change in its accounting practices. ZURICH marched to a second consecutive record close, supported by hopes for lower interest rates and a firm bond market. The SMI index added 13.5 to 2,534.8 Insurers were led higher by Zurich Insurance, SFr16 ahead at SFr1,291. Kleinwort Benson, which rates it as a buy, said that in spite of one of the worst underwriting years on record, Zurich's core Swiss insurance market continued to provide a profitable, stable platform for earnings growth. Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, added SFr47 or 5.0 per cent to SFr991 in active trade as the company sought to clarify earlier comments on the profits outlook. SMH had fallen by 11.5 per cent over the previous three sessions. PARIS drifted throughout the session and the CAC-40 index closed 5.69 ahead at 2,164.46, after a day's high of 2,179 and a low of 2,156. Paribas Capital Markets, in its latest focus on French equities, remained positive on the medium term outlook, forecasting that the CAC-40 index could reach the 2,350 level by the year end, helped by falling interest rates. On a sector-by-sector analysis Paribas recommended a long-term switch into consumer stocks, noting that food retailing, particularly hypermarkets, can be expected to perform well, given an expected improvement in consumer spending. The brokers commented that food retailers could see earnings growth of between 15 and 20 per cent in 1993, and that Carrefour and Promodes had the potential to achieve high growth. Shares in Carrefour closed yesterday up FFr87 at FFr3,586. SocGen advanced FFr7 to FFr662 ahead of reporting a 9 per cent rise in first half profit after the close. MILAN saw late profit-taking pull prices back from their best levels with the fortunes of Fiat group companies again the day's main theme. The Comit index rose 3.94 to 600.41. Fiat gave up an early advance to finish L11 easier at L6,172 although Ifil, the Agnelli holding company, was L113 ahead at L6,045. MADRID's climbers included Argentaria, up Pta100 at Pta5,770, Tabacalera, Pta90n better at Pta3,780, and Telefonica, up Pta40 at Pta1,625 as the general index closed 2.47 higher at 291.51. Mr Stephen Hughes at Kleinwort Benson said that Argentaria (up Pta350 this week) was recovering from weakness following a new equity issue; Tabacalera reacting to a new chairman, who talked of job cuts this week; and Telefonica to a KB buy note which went down well in the US market. AMSTERDAM was broadly higher although Hoogovens, the steel group, fell back Fl 1.80 to Fl 43.00 in spite of denying rumours that it might file for court protection against creditors or issue new share capital. The CBS Tendency index gained finished up 1.00 at 127.9. STOCKHOLM followed Tuesday's tax cut proposals with a morning rally, but the afternoon saw an upward correction in money market interest rates and the Affarsvarlden General index closed only 1.3 higher at 1,327.0. A fall in Ericsson B shares, down SKr7 to SKr437, from Tuesday's all-time high weighed on the market, as did a decline in Volvo B, off SKr9 to SKr431. OSLO, in contrast, was spurred to a 2 per cent gain by lower domestic interest rates and forecasts of a narrower budget deficit for 1994, the all share index closing 11.62 higher at 575.55. COPENHAGEN closed 1.1 per cent higher with the KFX index up 1.09 at 98.86. Investor interest in Superfos, the agricultural chemical, grain and road-building group, was stimulated by continuing rumours that the company could be the subject of a hostile takeover. The shares rose DKr17 to DKr384. ISTANBUL retreated by 1 per cent as a consolidation phase, which began on Monday, was seen continuing. The composite index lost 163.9 to 15,698.9 in turnover of TL1,200bn. However, most market commentators believe that equities remain positive and forecast further gains in the short-term.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 6                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open      11.30     12.00     13.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1324.44   1323.73   1322.73   1321.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1402.91   1402.74   1400.83   1399.80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             14.00     15.00     16.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1321.80   1321.39   1322.16   1321.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1399.74   1399.39   1400.77   1403.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 5     Oct 4     Oct 1     Sep 30    Sep 29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1313.91   1299.14   1293.99   1293.02   1288.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1391.47   1377.73   1368.19   1362.51   1356.79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1324.88; 200 - 1404.48 Low/day: 100 - 1320.58  200 - 1399.11.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

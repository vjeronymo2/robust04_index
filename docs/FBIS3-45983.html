Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the Chinese National Association of  Industry and Commerce, has announced that he will lead a  254-member delegation to Japan February 27-March 5 to promote  locally-made products there. It will be the largest Taiwan  trade delegation ever to have visited Japan.    The group, comprising representatives from textile, sports,  furniture, lighting, and stationery manufacturers, will make  sales presentations in Tokyo and Osaka.    Two Japan-based trade organizations -- the Japan Federation  of Economic Organizations and the Coordinating Council on  Japanese-Sino Business of Sales -- will assist the delegation in  its mission.    According to customs statistics, Taiwan's trade deficit with  Japan was U.S.$14.2 billion last year, up 10.5 percent from  1992. The imbalance is expected to increase to U.S.$15.5 billion  this year as Taiwan further integrates itself into the world  economy.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li, will also head a  12-member official trade promotion delegation to Japan January  23- February 3 in the hope of attracting more Japanese  investment and technology transfers to Taiwan. They will visit  Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sendai, and Kobe.</p>

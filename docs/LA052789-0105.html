			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIJUANA RACES TO REPAIR ITS AQUEDUCT  </P> <P> A ruptured aqueduct that had threatened water supplies to this city of more  than a million residents should be repaired by early today and a reduced flow  should be reaching the city hours later, authorities said Friday. A hookup with  San Diego, across the U.S.-Mexican border, was helping fill the void.  </P> <P> "It's still an emergency situation, but the level of concern has been reduced  considerably," said Miguel Ravelo, a spokesman for the state Public Service  Commission.  </P> <P> However, Ravelo said that water supplies were not expected to return to normal  until late Tuesday -- after the Memorial Day weekend, a major time for tourism  here -- as the newly repaired aqueduct will have to be tested, filled,  pressurized and sanitized. In the meantime, the city will continue to depend in  part on other sources, including an emergency tie-in with San Diego water  lines.  </P> <P> Despite emergency declarations, officials said drinking-water supplies were  never threatened, as most residents here, as in much of Mexico, rely heavily on  bottled drinking water purchased from private distributors. The water from the  aqueduct, although nominally purified, is used largely for non-drinking uses,  such as washing and sewage flow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Complaints  </P> <P> Residents here, accustomed to breakdowns in the system, seem to take the lack  of water with relatively few complaints. There was little evidence of panic or  long lines at private water suppliers, although commercial sales of water were  brisk.  </P> <P> Officials in this city of about 1.5 million residents, wary of losing tourist  income, have been downplaying the potential impact of the water shortage on  visitors, noting that many hotels and restaurants have their own holding tanks  with reserve capacity, or have the option of purchasing water. Tens of  thousands of Americans and other tourists traditionally head for Tijuana and  points south during the Memorial Day holiday weekend.  </P> <P> The emergency began Wednesday morning, when an underground section of the giant  aqueduct -- about six feet in diameter -- ruptured and began spilling water,  prompting an eventual shutdown of the system. The aqueduct, which carries water  from the Colorado River, supplies more than 90% of the city's non-drinking  needs.  </P> <P> Engineers from Mexico and the United States have been working non-stop to fix  the breakage, and it is anticipated that the metal-reinforced concrete pipe  will be completely repaired by about 3 a.m. Saturday, officials said.  </P> <P> Authorities called for conservation and opened a number of wells and several  dozen state-owned trucks began distributing water, free of charge, to some of  the hardest-hit neighborhoods.  </P> <P> On Thursday, officials on both sides of the border arranged to reopen a hookup  with the San Diego water system, which has been sending Tijuana as much as 13  million gallons a day -- less than a third of that city's average daily  consumption but still a significant flow.  </P> <P> The trans-border hookup had previously been used to transport water to Tijuana,  but was abandoned a decade ago when Mexican officials completed construction of  a supply line from the Colorado River. The hookup will continue as long as  needed, a San Diego official said.  </P> <P> The water-sharing caused San Diego officials to call for residents to adopt  voluntary conservation measures, such as limiting watering and vehicle washing.  </P></p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Payroll figures hold the key to rates - Currencies The start of this week's trading on the foreign exchange markets is likely to be dominated by reaction to Saturday's partial deal on US-Japan trade talks. But by the end of the week, attention will turn to Friday's US non-farm payroll figures, which some feel may push the Federal Reserve into increasing interest rates. Although the dollar responded well on Friday to rumours of a trade deal, analysts do not expect the US currency to gain much in the long term from a partial agreement. Economic fundamentals will have a greater impact on the Japan trade surplus, which many believe is the reason for the continued strength of the yen. The non-farm payroll numbers are expected to be strong, with a Reuters poll of economists showing an increase of 250,000 in September, accompanied by a drop in the unemployment rate to 6 per cent. The latter figure is seen by some academic economists as equivalent to 'full employment' and accordingly analysts believe the numbers may underpin a tightening of policy by the Fed, which decided not to raise rates last week. If the Fed does not raise rates after Friday's numbers, attention will switch to next week's producer and consumer prices data. Even if the Fed does raise rates, however, it is far from clear that this will be beneficial for the dollar. Exchange rate movements this year seem to have been governed by trends in the bond market, rather than short rates. To date, the Fed's tightening moves have shown little sign of convincing bond investors that the inflation threat has been eradicated. The dollar may have some scope to strengthen against the D-Mark in the run-up to the October 16 German general election. Traders will con-centrate on the prospects for Chan-cellor Kohl's coalition partner, the FDP, which is struggling to get the 5 per cent it needs to return to Parliament. Sterling was on the sidelines for much of last week and this week's economic data is unlikely to have much of an impact on the pound, analysts say. However, Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe) thinks the pound is due for a period of strength. 'By raising base rates by half a point on September 12, well ahead of a deterioration of either the trade account or inflation, the UK authorities have broken with the pattern of the past and severed the comparison with US monetary policy,' he says. Mr Persaud expects the pound to break through the Dollars 1.60 level by the end of the year.</p>

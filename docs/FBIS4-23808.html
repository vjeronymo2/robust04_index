			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy President Thabo Mbeki says the Volkstaat  [homeland] Council is ultimately responsible for negotiations  for a volkstaat and self-determination for the Afrikaner.    Mr. Mbeki was speaking at the swearing-in of the 20 members  of the council in Pretoria this morning. Addressing the members  at the Old Raadsaal at Church Square, he said a volkstaat and  self-determination should be given attention under the  guidelines of a democratic South Africa. He commended the  leader of the Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, for  drawing right-wing Afrikaners towards the constitutional process.    General Viljoen said the changes that had taken place in  South Africa were only the first step. He said it was in the  interests of the country that the needs of the Afrikaner were  rapidly identified. General Viljoen said Afrikaners would have  to realize that they would not be able to live totally separate  from the country because South Africa had an integrated economy.    Mr. Johann Wingaard was elected chairman of the Volkstaat  Council.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS' FIX DELIGHTS READER  </P> <P> I haven't ever enjoyed a newspaper article as much as I did this one.  </P> <P> Melvin Simon and Jerry Snyder . . . are caught in the middle of lawsuits  instituted by Los Angeles and Culver City, two municipalities whose elected  officials have been more than willing to sacrifice the quality of life of  residents for campaign contributions from developers.  </P> <P> However, since the Culver City officials receive no financial gain from the  Snyder development, and Ruth Galanter receives no financial gain from the Simon  development, these politicians, in order to keep their jobs, are trying to  convince the voters that they have some concern for the damage overdevelopment  is causing to their constituents by attempting to prevent those developments  which are not actually located in their districts.  </P> <P> This all puts Simon and Snyder in the position where the avarice of each  developer greatly damages the other. Welcome to the world of greed and  corruption, fellas!  </P> <P> I guess maybe there is a God after all.  </P> <P> FRANCES LONGMIRE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

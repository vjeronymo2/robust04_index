			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / VAT relaxed on sports clubs Amateur sports clubs will be able to reclaim value added tax paid on subscription income, equipment hire to members and fund-raising, Customs and Excise said yesterday. Any VAT paid on these items since January 1 1990 can be reclaimed from April 1 this year, in a move that Customs estimates could trigger reimbursements worth about Pounds 40m. The announcement follows a reinterpretation of European Union law by Customs. It will not affect VAT charged on transport, accommodation, catering or fees and hire for visitors to clubs. Customs also said yesterday that it would remove VAT from 'vanity units' in bathroom and cloakroom sinks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Mr. Delcroix Confirms Chile's </F> Interest in Mirage Fighters"]    [Text] Brussels, 8 March (BELGA) -- Belgian Defense  Minister Leo Delcroix confirmed on Tuesday [8 March] that Chile  had expressed an interest in purchasing the 20 modernized  Mirage-5's which have been rendered redundant by restructuring  of the Army.    Chilean Defense Minister Patricio Rojas had announced in  Santiago on Monday the purchase from Belgium of 20 Mirage  fighters of French design as part of the modernization of the  Chilean Air Force.    Following a joint sales mission by the Sabca [Belgian  Aeronautic Construction Company] aviation company and the  Belgian Air Force, Chile has shown an interest in 20 Mirage  fighter bombers modernized under the Mirship [Mirage System  Improvement Program] program in order to replace its Hawker  Hunters which are now obsolete, Mr. Delcroix indicated in a  communique.    Mr. Delcroix reports that a Chilean Air Force delegation  will  be coming to Belgium in order to inspect the equipment which is  being produced at the Sabca factory in Gosselies. This meeting  should result in a contract being signed before 1 July, Mr.  Delcroix added.    Military and industrial sources report that a Belgian  delegation visited Chile at the end of February in order to  negotiate the signing of a letter of intent on 28 February  concerning 20 aircraft, 15 BA single-seaters and five BD  twin-seaters.    The Defense Ministry has refused to confirm the amount of  the  Chilean contract, estimated to be 85.5 million dollars (about 3  billion Belgian francs) including spares, maintenance, and  personnel training.    This is the first big sale of heavy military equipment  rendered redundant by the restructuring of the Belgian Army as  decided by the government last year, observers note.</p>

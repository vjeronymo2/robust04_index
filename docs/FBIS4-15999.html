			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- The presidium of Ukraine's Supreme Council  held a meeting on 12 April chaired by Ivan Plyushch. It heard a  report on the preliminary results of elections to the new  parliament of Ukraine. It confirmed the number of elected  deputies, 337, which amounts to a constitutional majority and  allows a session to begin. Results are being verified in one of  the constituencies in Odessa oblast. The 337 new deputies  include 56 members of the previous parliament.    The meeting also approved an estimate of expenses for the  Ukrainian presidential election on 26 June 1994 submitted by the  Central Electoral Commission, and an estimate of expenses and  paper needs for the local council elections due on the same date.    The presidium approved the design of a jubilee medal, "50th  anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941-45,"  and resolved to hold a parliamentary conference for the new  parliament: "Experience, forms, and methods of parliamentarian  work", provisionally, in June.    The presidium resolved to hold the last session of Ukraine's  Supreme Council of the previous convocation -- at which it will  resign -- on 22 April 1994.</p>

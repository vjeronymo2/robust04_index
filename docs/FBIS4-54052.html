			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Saudi Arabia's Minister of  Petroleum and Mineral Resources Hisham Muhyi-al-Din Nazir on  Tuesday [24 May] reiterated calls for Japan to resume  negotiations on a joint project to refine Saudi crude oil in  Japan, Foreign Ministry officials said. Nazir made the call in  a 30-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at the  Foreign Ministry, the officials said.    The Saudi minister, who is visiting Japan through Friday,  made a similar request Monday during a meeting with Minister for  International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata.    The joint project calls for building or acquiring several  refineries in Japan to refine 45,000 barrels of Saudi crude oil  per day for sale in the Japanese market. The project has been  on hold since last November due to a policy rift among four  Japanese partners in the scheme. The partners include Nippon  Oil Co., Japan Energy Corp. and Arabian Oil Co.    Kakizawa told Nazir he wants to play the role of catalyst in  resuming the project, the officials said. He was also quoted as  saying Japan wants to strengthen partnership with Saudi Arabia  in the political field along with economic cooperation  relations, they said.    Kakizawa said Japan wants to contribute in humanitarian and  economic fields as well as to the promotion of Middle East peace  talks.</p>

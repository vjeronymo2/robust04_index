The law, which has already  been passed by the Bundestag, sets out the arrangements for the  move of the Bundestag and government to Berlin. Under the  arrangements, the German Government is to move to Berlin "in  temporal coordination with the Bundestag." At the same time, a  "fair division of labor" between Berlin and Bonn will be laid  down by means of the allocation of federal ministries to the two  cities. Several federal bodies are to move their headquarters  to Bonn. The region will also receive financial compensation.  The costs of the move are put at around 20 billion German marks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XIZANG RIBAO reporter: "Tibet Scores Successes </F> in Anticorruption Drive"]    [Text] Thanks to earnest, resolute, and concrete action,  the majority of localities and departments in Tibet have  recently scored initial successes in the three tasks of the  anticorruption drive.    In line with the "Decision on Several Tasks to be Seriously  Carried Out in the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future,"  adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council,  and with the guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the regional party  committee and regional government, as well as the regional  discipline inspection commission and regional supervision  department, mapped out specific plans for intensifying the  anticorruption drive and promoting the construction of party  work style and a clean government. Party committees and  governments at all levels have attached great importance to the  anticorruption drive, adopting a resolute attitude and taking  prompt action; while large numbers of party members and cadres  and the masses have energetically supported and actively  participated in the drive. As a result, certain achievements  have been made in the fight against corruption.    These achievements are manifested in the following: Leading  cadres have earnestly carried out self-examination and made  prompt correction in accordance with the five requirements for  clean standards and self-discipline. To ensure a good job of  self-examination and correction, all prefectures (cities) and  departments held democratic meetings, during which leading  cadres voluntarily accepted supervision by the masses.  According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of 1993, 76  percent of leading cadres at and above the county (section)  level had conducted self-examination and correction and found  problems in the following aspects: While screening economic  entities affiliated with party and government organizations and  concurrent jobs held by party and government cadres, some found  themselves to have been involved in compensated intermediate  activities, or sightseeing trips in a disguised way outside the  country (territory). A fairly large number of party and  government cadres found themselves to have taken part in  gambling or accepted dinner invitations, gifts, or cash while  attending weddings or funerals or performing official duties. A  number of cases involving violations of the law and discipline  were investigated. As of the end of 1993, discipline inspection  and supervision organs in the region had received a total of 681  tips on such cases from the masses. Of these, 349 were accepted  initially. After investigation and verification, 58 persons  were punished according to party and administrative discipline;  and 10 were turned over to the judicial organ for further  investigation of their criminal responsibilities. As a result,  the state and collectives recovered 1.145 million yuan in  economic losses. Meanwhile, quite a few departments and units  took the initiative to investigate and solve some serious  problems reported by the masses.    To lighten the burdens on farmers and herdsmen at large,  fees  collected by various localities and departments were also  screened. After screening 177 fees and the standards of 1,337  fees, a total of 1.761 million yuan were found to have been  collected in violation of discipline and were turned over to the  treasury. As a result of the screening, the regional government  abolished 31 unreasonable fees, while various prefectural (city)  governments abolished 216 unreasonable fees.</p>

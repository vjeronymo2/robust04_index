			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 5 SAPA -- The three police generals  implicated in a Goldstone commission report on third force  activities would maintain their voluntary withdrawal from  service pending further investigations, Police Commissioner Gen  Johan van der Merwe said on Tuesday [5 April].    Generals Basie Smit, Johan le Roux and Krappies Engelbrecht  had decided to accede to this request from Attorney-General Jan  D'Oliviera, who is heading an international investigation into  the allegations.    Dr D'Oliviera had made the request in the interests of an  impartial and unhindered investigation, Gen van der Merwe said.    Generals Smit and Le Roux were back at work on Tuesday but  their positions were reviewed at a meeting between Gen van der  Merwe and Dr D'Oliviera on Tuesday.    They had been on "voluntary leave" until Tuesday following  an  agreement between Gen van der Merwe and the generals that they  could resume their duties unless specific evidence to justify  action against them was submitted.    Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on Monday announced that he had  obtained "substantial further evidence" concerning the  commission's March 18 preliminary report on alleged senior  police involvement in third force activities.    Gen van der Merwe said Dr D'Oliviera had indicated that due  to the volume of the information he had received from the  Goldstone Commission, he could not properly evaluate or make a  statement on the issue at this stage. Dr D'Oliviera had  undertaken to expedite the evaluation and further investigation.    In a separate statement Generals Smit and Le Roux said they  had previously undertaken to resume duties on Tuesday unless new  information came to light justifying action against them. They  said Gen van der Merwe had on Monday informed them that no such  information had come to his attention and he therefore ordered  them to resume their duties.    Gen van der Merwe re-affirmed on Tuesday after his  discussions with Dr D'Oliviera that the attorney-general had  also not mentioned such information, Generals Smit and Le Roux  said.    In a copy of a letter by the investigating task force it was  said that "...the status quo of withdrawal from service should  be maintained until we are in a position to decide on  involvement or not of any person... Re-employment at this stage  will be against the wishes and advice of the team".    The two generals said "to accommodate the  attorney-general...we are prepared to voluntarily withdraw from  service for a further period from April 6".    They called on Dr D'Oliviera and the task force to evaluate  the information available as soon as possible to determine  whether there were any reasonable grounds why their withdrawal  from service should be maintained. It was essential that the  matter be brought to a head as soon as possible. "In light of  the abovementioned we will soon reconsider our position," the  generals said.    Earlier on Tuesday, before the generals again withdrew from  service, the Democratic Party said the Goldstone Commission  should release specific evidence against the police generals  implicated in the commission report "as a matter of urgency".  "The fact that Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux have  decided to return to work, in spite of President (F W) de  Klerk's order that they stay on leave, raises serious problems,"  said DP Executive Director James Selfe.    The discipline of the South African Police [SAP] was  essential for holding elections later in the month and for a  successful transition to a new democratic order. Equally  important was the principle of civilian control over security  forces. Nothing sapped the effectiveness of the SAP more than  unresolved allegations of third force activities. "Both to  clear up these allegations, as well as to avoid a potential  clash between the SAP senior management and the political  leadership of the country, it is essential the Goldstone  Commission makes available the specific evidence as a matter of  urgency," said Mr Selfe.    The African National Congress, in reaction to the generals  returning to work on Tuesday, said the step was typical of the  contempt with which senior SAP personnel had sought to cover up  charges of police complicity in the third force.    SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news  quoted the ANC as saying it was totally unacceptable that any  officer, who had been implicated in alleged criminal activities,  be allowed to return to active duty until the allegations had  been properly investigated, and they had been cleared by due  process of law.</p>

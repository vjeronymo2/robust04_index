			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / People: Turning the wheel at Saab UK Bryan Hatter is sliding out of the driving seat at Saab Great Britain, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Swedish executive car-maker which is now controlled jointly by Saab-Scania and General Motors. Hatter, 56, who cut his executive car sales teeth with rival BMW (Great Britain), where he was national sales manager until joining Saab in 1987, is Singapore-bound. There he will take the wheel as regional director for Saab Automobile's Region Asia/ Pacific, a vast sales zone which under Saab's broad definition includes the Middle East. Hatter's move is part of a general shake-up of Saab - still making losses, albeit much reduced - as it prepares for an intensive new model programme which, thanks largely to GM cash infusions, will see a succession of wholly new cars being launched from next year. Earlier this week it was announced that David Herman, who has overseen the start of the revival at Saab Automobile since it became a joint venture company with General Motors in 1990, was moving on to become chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, GM's German car subsidiary. Moving up to succeed Hatter as managing director at Saab GB is 42-year-old Will Edwyn-Jones, who has barely had time to warm the seat of the company's sales and marketing director, to which he was promoted from general sales and marketing manager earlier this year. Completing the shuffle inside the UK operation is the appointment of Paul Richmond, formerly finance director, to be Edwyn-Jones' deputy, and the appointment to the board of Chris Banks, to be responsible for all sales, dealer development, business management and training activities. Hatter's departure also leaves the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders with a gap on its Car Importers Section, of which he has been chairman. ***** The first price skirmishes of the summer holiday season are over and Britain's tour operators are waiting to see whether fierce and damaging discounting continues into July and August. The tour operator UNIJET has used the lull in hostilities to appoint Philip Ovenden as managing director of its Viking International Air Chartering subsidiary. The subsidiary sells aircraft charter seats both in-house and to other providers of package holidays. Ovenden is no stranger to travel industry boom and bust. He previously worked for Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, which collapsed last year. He has since been responsible for long-haul operations at tour operator Meon Villas. ***** Robert Fox, chairman of Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and a former Lasmo director, is to become chief executive of the London-quoted, US-based natural resources company. Joint managing directors David Wilkinson and Michael Hogue will report directly to him. Fox was appointed chairman in 1990 at the instigation of large shareholder County NatWest, following the failure of a Pounds 31m placing to fund acquisitions.</p>

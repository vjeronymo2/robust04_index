			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CONNECTICUT;  </P> <P> CANDIDATE IS DRIVING WITH INVALID LICENSE  </P> <P> Rep. John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, has driven with an  expired Connecticut license for 16 months but plans to renew it "at the first  opportunity," a spokesman for Rowland said. The 33-year-old congressman  contended that the state Department of Motor Vehicles never sent him a renewal  notice -- a claim the agency denied. Rowland's license expired in May, 1989,  but the fact that he failed to renew it was not made public until the Hartford  Courant checked motor vehicle records after receiving an anonymous tip.  </P></p>

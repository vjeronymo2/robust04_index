			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Drama from Balzac to Sophocles - Radio THE CLASSIC Serial this month on Radio 4 is Balzac's Pere Goriot, with Stephen Fry as a handy Balzac and Douglas Hodge as the socially ambitious Eugene. The eponymous Goriot is scorned by Eugene and the other lodgers chez Vauquer, especially the cynical Vautrin (David Ross); they do not know that his girl friends are not his mistresses but his daughters. The tale, dramatised by David Hopkins, has not yet blossomed, despite the author's commentary, but is doing well under Kate Rowland's direction, with a helpful Goriot by Geoffrey Banks. The Monday Play was Murray Watts's The Fatherland, about life in Soweto, only it wasn't broadcast. Instead, Keith Waterhouse presented sundry readings from comic English writing. Still, drama-addicts like me had all the half-hours - The Food of Love by Joanne Maguire on Tuesday, about love and diet; part three of Christopher Lee's The House, later in the day, about Members of Parliament; the first of six parts of Eric Williams's The Wooden Horse on Wednesday, about escaping from a German prisoner-of-war camp; the second half of Wilde's Lord Arthur Savile's Crime on Thursday, about predicted murder; and the last part of Nigel Baldwin's Cordoba that evening, also about predicted murder. We can't complain. And Radio 3 gave Sophocles's King Oedipus on Sunday, in WB Yeats's translation. John Theocharis directed it in his last production before retirement (though he had directed Thursday's A Harlot and a Nun, sbout Edna St. Vincent Millay), and he had a fine company. Robert Lindsay was Oedipus; Dorothy Tutin, Jocasta; Paul Daneman, Creon; beside these, I admired the Corinthian and Theban shepherds of David Ryall and Cyril Shaps, their speech so ably contrasted with the magisterial delivery of the higher-ups. However often you hear the legend, it never palls. Last week Radio 4 took us for a buggy-ride round the French quarter of New Orleans. Last night the same director, Piers Plowright, gave us a bus-ride on Radio 3, in A Bus named Desire, which naturally was centred on Tennessee Williams. Local comment on him varied from 'Who's he?', via 'I thought he was really dull', 'A nice man, very quiet', 'All too decadent' to 'I loved Tennessee Williams'. There is no tramcar named Desire, or anything else, for the streetcars have been dismantled. In any case, the Desire Housing Project is a tricky area, where bus passengers may be robbed at gunpoint at the terminus. A fascinating programme. If you still long for New Orleans, Nancy Lemann, in Radio 3's Young Americans series, called it 'very beautiful and very painful'. I was not quite at home with this series, where young American writers talk with the Irish novelist Timothy O'Grady and read from their work. There is too little real intimacy, despite the personal quality of the talk. Moreover it is not always easy to separate reading from interview. More intimate was Tudor Parfitt's view, in Radio 4's King Solomon's Tribe on Thursday, of the Lemba in Zimbabwe and South Africa, who claim to be Jews, stemming from 'Sena'. The prophet Nehemiah, who gave much space to nominal rolls when he was not building walls, wrote in his Chapter 7, verse 38, 'the children of Senaah, three thousand, nine hundred and thirty,' but did not record their having emigrated southward. The Lemba are based in Soweto. They wear black skull-caps, circumcise babies rather than youths, even use a six-point star flag. They claim no close relationship with Ethiopia's Jewish Falasha, though both tribes observe Jewish kosher laws. Some of the Boers thought the land they gained after the Great Trek was the Promised Land, so the Lemba must watch out for ethnic cleansing.</p>

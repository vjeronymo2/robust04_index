			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rallies to new two-year closing peak Buying by foreign investors and domestic institutions supported share prices, and a late afternoon rally sent the Nikkei 225 average to a new two-year high, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index finished 157.63 higher at 21,552.81, its best level since February 1992. It declined to a day's low of 21,271.55 at the beginning of the session on selling by dealers and profit-taking by institutional investors. Buying by overseas investors and domestic institutions pushed prices higher later, absorbing index-linked selling by investment trusts and profit-taking, and an intraday peak of 21,573.21 was registered just before the close. While a further rise in the index would require the participation of domestic institutions, traders expected the downside to be limited. Although most institutions had not changed their view over the economy and were not convinced of an imminent recovery, many were nervous of being left behind in the current rally, said a UK based broker. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 11.93 to 1,712.73, while the Nikkei 300 added 1.99 at 311.71. Advances led falls by 730 to 286, with 174 issues unchanged. A total of 162 stocks were at their highs for the year. Volume dropped to 400m shares, from 1.09bn on Friday. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.29 to 1,411.77. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, put on Y8 at Y828. It managed to shrug off earlier profit-taking by investors who regarded the stock as too expensive. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries moved ahead Y16 to Y516. Minebea, the ball bearings manufacturer, fell Y24 to Y900. Speculators and dealers, who had bought the issue on prospects of higher profits due to increasing sales of the company's computer keyboards, rushed to take profits. Construction companies, regarded as laggards, gained ground on buying by foreigners, domestic individuals and dealers. Kumagai Gumi rose Y26 to Y538 in heavy trading, while Haseko appreciated Y20 to Y726. Profit-taking depressed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which declined Y2,000 to Y872,000, and East Japan Railway, which lost Y2,000 to Y513,000. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 99.95 to 23,747.18 in volume of 38.8m shares. The index climbed for the fifth consecutive day on rises in low-priced issues. Roundup Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were subdued after Malaysian election prospects seemed to fade. Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. SINGAPORE was volatile on a mixture of political news with selective Japanese buying, ending with the Straits Times Industrial index 11.79 higher at 2,295.92. Equities fluctuated after Mr Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, told state political leaders not to be disappointed if a general election was not held soon. However, they were led higher by an 80-cent rise in Cycle &amp; Carriage, the motor group, to SDollars 11.60 on Japanese institutional demand. SEOUL bought early on expectations that the government would soon increase the ceiling of foreign share ownership. But profit-taking set in after Finance Ministry officials said the government had no plans to revise its previously announced schedule. This process wiped out most of the early gains, the composite index finishing a net 4.64 ahead at 923.24 after reaching a day's high of 931.67 during the first hour. KUALA LUMPUR closed well off its highs on heavy afternoon profit-taking, after the prime minister said that the general election could be held at any time from now until December 1995. The composite index ended just 0.95 firmer at 1,017.93 after a morning peak of 1,033.31. There were reports that Nomura Securities had launched a new Malaysian fund, known as the Aurora Fund, which was aiming to raise up to Y300bn. BANGKOK encountered profit-taking which left the SET index 4.37 lower at 1,379.04 in moderate turnover of Bt7.6bn. Losses were pared by the firm performance of the property development sector, spurred by Krisda Mahanakorn, which jumped Bt7 to Bt79.50 in turnover of Bt603.7m. The stock rallied after a case of alleged stock manipulation against its major shareholder Vichai Krisdathanonda was dropped last week. Shares in Jalaprathan Cement gained Bt4 at Bt131 in turnover of Bt142.6m on a newspaper report of a planned capital increase. SHANGHAI's yuan-denominated 'A' shares remained under pressure from a flood of new issues, a loss of confidence in company managements and robust sales of treasury bonds. The index fell 23.42 to a two-year low of 497.79, compared with an historic peak of 1,640.71 in February 1993. 'B' shares, reserved for foreign investors, have put in a steadier performance, helped by locals who have enlisted the help of relatives and other foreigners to buy on their behalf. The 'B' share index dipped 1.49 to 71.13. MANILA edged lower as the market continued to consolidate, missing the stimulus of the Hong Kong market. The composite index dipped 1.99 to 2,986.19 in volume that fell to 826.2m shares from the previous session's 1.3bn. WELLINGTON turned lower after a firm opening, the NZSE-40 Capital index losing 19.98 to 2,104.03 in subdued trading. JAKARTA was weaker in lifeless trade, which left the Jardine index 0.15 lower at 101.51. Ades, a water bottling firm which made its debut, finished at Rp3,650 for a 5.2 per cent decline from its offer price. COLOMBO edged down, with limited foreign demand leaving the all-share index 7.77 off at 973.73. Turnover fell to SLRs38.6m from Friday's SLRs120m.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: Off the beaten track in London Docklands - Peter Marsh seeks some of the capital's hidden jewels Anyone who is in London and looking for something different should head for Stave Hill. Although it is only a little over two miles from the Bank of England, in the heart of the City, the hill is well off the beaten track and a marvellous place from which to view the capital. Stave Hill is an artificial mound in the middle of what were Surrey Docks - now mainly filled in as part of the Pounds 10bn Docklands development programme. From the top you can see the tall buildings of the City to the north-west, the smooth brutality of Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs to the east, gently sprawling Victorian suburbs to the south, much bland, although not completely soul-less 1980s housing all around, and - the real star - the grey, restless waters of the Thames snaking away on both sides. Stave Hill, especially on a cold, misty winter's day, is far from beautiful. But it is a convenient place while on a walking tour of Docklands to pause, look around and try to understand London. Much has been written about how Docklands - 8.5 square miles that take in Wapping and the easterly Royal Docks as well as the Isle of Dogs and Surrey Docks - has been ruined by lack of planning and good architecture. Critics of quick-built dross can have a field day. But such complaints miss the point that, throughout its history, London has rarely seen much planning and has witnessed a great deal of bad building. Even so, the extraordinary diversity of the capital means there is much to admire. And so it is in Docklands: seeking out the jewels requires some effort. To explore a representative segment of the area on both south and north of the river you will need a day to spare, good shoes and the ability to refocus your mind on a part of London far from fashionable. A good place to start is the FT's headquarters on the south side of Southwark Bridge. From here you can meander through a maze of Victorian streets to the sturdy 18th century St George's Church standing on the borders of Borough and Bermondsey. A few minutes' walk along Long Lane takes you to a scruffy car park where Bermondsey Abbey stood for about 500 years until it was demolished in the 16th century. There should be time for a brief tour of the local leather works, erected in the last century though sadly dilapidated, before heading off along Spa Road to the old Peak Freans biscuit factory and Southwark Park - a pleasantly laid-out tribute to Victorian public spirit which was opened in 1869 on the site of marshland. Now you can explore Surrey Docks - formerly a collection of artificial inlets and ponds dug out mainly in the 19th century. Most of the docks have been built over, but Greenland Dock and South Dock are intact and Russia Dock, immediately to the south of Stave Hill, has been turned into parkland, reminiscent of what the area as a whole looked like before industrialisation took over in the 18th and 19th centuries. Before getting too caught up in tracing the sites of the old docks, for which you need curiosity and an old map, you should branch off to the ancient village of Rotherhithe, squeezed between the 1980s developments and the river. Rotherhithe is a bit the worse for wear but has charm. Look out for the 18th century St Mary's Church - the four pillars inside are made not from stone but from tree trunks - and the Mayflower pub near where the Pilgrim Fathers left for America in 1620. A short detour takes you back westwards for a mile along the river, past the evocatively named King's Stairs and Cherry Garden Pier, for a walk around Shad Thames. This still contains many of the warehouses constructed when the Thames was the world's busiest waterway. Retracing your steps to Greenland Dock, make for Deptford and the Pepys council estate, surrounding some victualling buildings which were a feature of the famous royal dockyards built by Henry VIII in the 16th century. Continuing east you go through a shabby riverside thoroughfare called Stowage - don't stop unless you want to buy some spare parts from the car scrapyards which line the route - before reaching Greenwich. Here you take the pedestrian tunnel under the Thames to the Isle of Dogs on the north bank. Until 200 years ago, the area (not an island but a peninsula in a loop of the Thames) contained hardly anything but a few wharves and windmills and a lot of mud. Then came the great phase of dockbuilding, followed by the mega-development of the past decade with its brave, brassy buildings, many of them looking impossibly flimsy and destined to last not much beyond the early years of next century. Be sure to inspect the sad-looking, early-20th century housing around the area's perimeter, and walk over the Mudchute, the local park built up from solidified silt dredged out of the Millwall Docks in the 1890s. The outline of the new buildings framed against the water of the docks - which the developers have largely left alone - and the sky are often spectacular. However, the best view is from the parcel of land just west of Canary Wharf overlooking the river. Ignore the not-quite-finished buildings and the piles of rubble signalling their hasty abandonment. Concentrate on looking out at the setting sun, the remnants of the Rotherhithe wharves opposite, and the calm of Limehouse Reach stretching towards the City. It is a place to reflect that, often, the best and worst of London can be focused on the same spot.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Observer: Out of the cold If John Major has difficulty finding out what is really going on in Russia, it's not for the want of specialist advice. His comparatively small press and private offices are now bulging with Russian hands, exiled from the Foreign Office. Observer has already commented on Chris Meyer, the PM's new press secretary, who has shown his true colours by adorning his office with framed copies of Pravda, the once all-powerful organ of the Soviet Communist party. Meyer was in Moscow in the late 1960s. Major's private secretary for foreign affairs, Roderic Lyne, headed the FO's Soviet department for four years until he moved to No 10 and he has just taken delivery of a deputy, Philippa Leslie-Jones, who has hardly had time to shake Moscow's snow off her boots. Another sign, perhaps, that the Thatcherite cold war between the FCO and Number 10 is finally over?</p>

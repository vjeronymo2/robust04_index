When I was entering  the Chongwadae presidential office I felt spring had arrived. I  understand you do jogging every morning. What do you at dawn?    [Kim Yong-sam] It is still chilly at dawn. It is March, so I  can feel spring is coming. [passage omitted on jogging habits]    [Yi] Mr. President, thank you very much for your response to  our request for this interview despite your busy schedule. The  date 25 February marked one year since you took office. You are  now entering the second year. Most of the people know the  method, content, and style of your management of state affairs  through the mass media. The purpose of my visit here today is  to hear more of them directly from Mr. President; for instance,  the background in making policy decisions, managing state  affairs, and so forth. Mr. President, what were your plans and  objectives in managing state affairs during the past year?    [Kim] We cannot say the previous governments were strong  governments because they failed to enjoy the people's support  and because they were not the governments that were entrusted by  the people. On the other hand, however, the present civilian-led  government is a government entrusted by the people and a  government chosen by the people. Therefore, the present  civilian-led government can dignifiedly carry out politics for  the interest of the country and the people as stipulated in the  Constitution. In other words, the present government is a  legitimate government, so it can dignifiedly ask the people to  do what they should do. It accepts our people's demands, if they  are considered to be reasonable.    To make a clean and honest government is a very important  task. I think only such a government can become a strong  government and enjoy the people's support and love.    [Yi] Inspection activities continued last year in order to  eliminate all sorts of old social and political corruption and  irregularities. These activities enjoyed praise from people at  home and abroad. However, there were also voices of resistance  and complaints from some former privileged people. How do you  assess the past year?    [Kim] I have said that the past year felt like 10 years or  so. I think that during the past year I have done a lot of work  in eliminating all sorts of past corruption and irregularities.  One of the most important tasks the previous governments failed  to implement, which our civilian-led government has  accomplished, is the adoption of the real-name financial  transaction system. With the adoption of this system, the people  can receive due compensations for what they have done --  shedding sweat. Another important task that our government has  accomplished was the adoption of the system of revealing the  private property of public servants, including myself. With the  adoption of the system, those who have accumulated property  through illegal means had to leave their posts. This system will  be enforced in the future, too, on a continuous basis. This kind  of reform is unprecedented in our history, and, therefore, is a  revolutionary event.    I stress here that my plan for reform and change will  continue. It is very difficult to complete the work of reform  and change in one year. However, the effectiveness of our work  for reform and change is presently being witnessed in our  society. In other words, our society is now in the process of  reform and change. Many changes have been implemented among both  upper and lower grade public servants. I think we should  concentrate more efforts on carrying out reform and change among  lower grade servants.    [Yi] What difficulties have you had in carrying out your  work  for reform and change during the past year?    [Kim] I was well aware of the president's duties and  responsibilities because I had a long career in politics. After  I took office, however, I came to realize that my prior  understanding of the president's duties and responsibilities was  limited. I know some people hold that I am enforcing one-man  politics or a one-man dictatorship under the civilian-led  government. This is indeed a wrong assertion. Under the  presidential government system, the president should assume  responsibility for all things. So, it is wrong to say that I am  enforcing dictatorship under the civilian-led government. I am  just performing responsibilities assigned by the people. When I  make serious decisions I am often engulfed in agony and feel  lonely because I have to make a final decision alone without  consulting with other people.    [Yi] These reforms and changes are efflorescing in our  society. Yet, there is still a field where the work of reform  and change has not been smoothly carried out. It is precisely  our political field. What do you say about the reform movement  in the political field?    [Kim] Changes in the political field are very important.  Politics should change. Our politics have never changed, still  the same as the politics of 20 years ago, 30 years, and 10 years  ago. Whenever an opportunity presented itself, I stressed the  need for reform and changes in the political field.    To achieve reform and changes in the political field,  elections should be clean. So, the bills which have been  submitted to the National Assembly this time for deliberation  are in fact revolutionary bills. I mean the bills on elections.  If these bills are passed at the National Assembly the politics  of our country will become advanced ones. As long as political  corruption and corrupt elections exist, our country cannot  become an advanced country. I know a country where political  corruption and illicit elections have been perpetrated. Of  course, I would not identify the name of the country here.  Anyway, political corruption and illicit elections are indeed a  misfortunate phenomenon. That country is undergoing  difficulties these days. This is because of the lack of clean  politics and clean elections. Only when clean politics and  clean elections are conducted can people's awareness of genuine  politics be changed. Illicit elections are to drive people into  depravity and ruin.    [Yi] Last January you met the three former presidents.  Afterward, many Sixth Republic figures were released from  prison. Witnessing this, many people have raised the voices of  worry that your will for reform is being enfeebled. What do you  think of this?    [Kim] It is entirely different from facts. Of course, the  assessment of the three former presidents may be various. Among  them are the presidents who were not directly elected by the  people. However, meeting the former presidents as the president  of the civilian-led government is also meaningful.    The release of Sixth Republic figures is a matter on the  rights of the Judical Branch. So, we cannot argue on this  matter. We should not link the meeting of the three former  presidents to the release of the abovementioned figures.  [passage omitted]    [Yi] Last year, many foreign heads of state visited our  country. You met many heads of state at the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting. Also, you had summit talks  with U.S. President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister  Hosokawa. While traveling overseas what image did you witness  foreign countries had toward the ROK?    [Kim] The establishment of the civilian-led government has  completely changed the image of the ROK. In a nutshell, I think  that democracy is the supreme value. Under the previous regimes  our diplomacy was not properly and smoothly carried out. The  strongest power in diplomacy is precisely democracy itself. At  the meeting of heads of the ROK missions in the Asia, Pacific,  and American regions held in Seoul I told them that they should  become salesmen. I urged them to make their best to increase our  international competitive power.    The United Nations publishes a report on human rights once a  year. The ROK has been a target country of this report.  However, since the civilian-led government was established, our  country has become a human rights screening member country in  the United Nations. The position of our country has changed  completely.    [Yi] I understand you are scheduled to visit Japan and China  this year for summit diplomacy. What are your expectations?    [Kim] The importance of these two countries is very great in  today's pan-Pacific era. In terms of our security, the two  countries are also important. Japan and China are among our  three major trade partner countries. So, my visit to these two  countries will be closely related to our future economic  development. Deep and detailed discussions will be held for  bilateral economic cooperation. I think that my visit to the two  countries will become a great turning point in respective  bilateral relations. The two countries participated in the APEC  meeting. This fact also gives more significance to my planned  visit.    Of course, Russia, which is one of our neighboring  countries,  is very important to us. We cannot disregard the importance of  Russia. I cannot make a visit to this country at this time.    Anyway, if economic cooperative relations are smoothly  achieved, our country's future will be very bright. [passage  omitted]    [Yi] The greatest pending foreign policy issue is the  inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities. The North  Korean nuclear issue is a problem which we are directly  concerned with, and it is a difficult problem to solve for the  world as a whole. Fortunately, the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] inspection team has entered Pyongyang to conduct  official inspections. In Panmunjom, a working contact is being  held for the exchange of special envoys. How do you think this  problem will be solved? If it is not solved, what measure do  you think will be necessary?    [Kim] The North Korean nuclear program should be stopped by  all means. This is necessary not only for the survival of the  70 million fellow countrymen but for peace in Northeast Asia and  the world. This is a problem directly connected with our  survival and for peace on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, I  think we should mobilize all means possible to solve this  problem.    Fortunately, the IAEA inspection has started. The working  contact for the exchange of special envoys is being held. We  cannot be too optimistic at this stage, for we have undergone  numerous critical stages in our relations with North Korea. We  cannot expect that everything will be settled smoothly. We will  have to overcome some more critical points. However, now that  North Korea is permitting the nuclear inspection, the so-called  nuclear card has left the North Korean hand. I think the  inter-Korean dialogue, therefore, has to make considerable  progress. The United States has promised us that it will not  hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea unless  there is significant progress in the exchange of special envoys.  North Korea has also officially announced it will do so.    What is most important at the present stage is that we are  handling every matter in close cooperation with the United  States. The United States has always consulted us on their  contacts with North Korea. At times, the United States even  halted the talks with North Korea to have time to discuss  matters with us.    I think what is most important to the ROK is maintaining  such  a close cooperative system with the United States. If the  exchange of special envoys and inter-Korean dialogues proceed as  we intend and North Korea's nuclear development program is  hindered, we could promote relations with North Korea in  various areas, including the economic sector.    I think North Korea should acknowledge the fact that the ROK  is in a position to actively help it improve relations with the  United States. It would be foolish of North Korea to think that  it can discuss this issue without the ROK.    [Yi] In a recent news conference, you said that the  precondition for the exchange of special envoys is holding a  summit. You even said that you would meet with the North Korean  president when you believed it conducive to keeping North Korea  from developing nuclear weapons. When do you think it will take  place?    [Kim] It is hard to predict now. I will have to judge the  timing by watching the development for the exchange of special  envoys. [passage omitted]</p>

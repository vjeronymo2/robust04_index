			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries regain balance after rout on Friday The US Treasury market regained its balance yesterday after plunging the previous session on unfavourable economic data. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 higher at 97 1/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.746 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 3/4 , to yield 6.369 per cent. There was no fresh economic news to guide sentiment as the trading week opened. The lull afforded traders the opportunity to regroup after Friday's rout, which pushed the price of the long bond down by nearly two points and lifted the yield to its highest level of the year. In yesterday's vacuum, the 30-year issue appreciated a little in light activity. The only occasion with the potential to move the market yesterday was an afternoon speech by Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He addressed an economic conference at Boston College, but in the event restricted his comments to the issue of banking reform. In part, Friday's sell-off reflected an emerging consensus that the central bank could bring forward its next move to tighter credit conditions. Before the release of last week's data, most traders were reasonably confident that Mr Greenspan and his colleagues would wait until after the November elections before lifting interest rates again. That calculation was undercut by Friday's news of a 0.7 per cent jump in industrial production last month, a figure which suggested economic growth was still robust. Even more unsettling to the inflation-sensitive Treasury market, capacity utilisation in August had risen to 84.7 per cent, its highest level in five years. The production bottlenecks which are likely to arise with factories working at such a pace suggest that prices are on the rise. Against this backdrop, traders were eyeing this week's impending Treasury auctions of two-year and five-year securities as opportunities to unload more of their holdings. In a small blessing, only a smattering of second-tier economic releases are due this week, limiting the potential for another severe downturn. After Friday's sell-off, most European bond markets clawed back some ground yesterday as dealers covered their short positions, but prices drifted lower in the afternoon. Investors remained mostly sidelined, ceding the stage to the futures traders. 'Many end-investors are still shell-shocked,' said a bond dealer, adding 'there's very little going on in the cash, but there's quite a lot of fast trading in the futures market'. UK gilts opened on a slightly firmer note as prices ticked up from the lows seen on Friday, when some yields reached 9 per cent. There was no weight behind the move, however, and the market gave up much of its advance in the afternoon. Trading remained thin, with one dealer describing the market as very illiquid. He said longer-dated stock was tracking overseas markets, while concern over sterling weakness and the possibility of further UK base rate rises after last week's 50 basis point increase affected short-dated gilts. The 9 per cent yields of Friday had prompted some buying interest said another dealer. However, according to Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS: 'There is little chance of capital flows into the market while there is this general pessimism at the short end over interest rates.' Details of next Wednesday's gilt auction are due today. Some analysts anticipate that the Bank of England will create a new 10-year benchmark gilt, with Pounds 2bn of 8 1/2 per cent stock due 2005. On Liffe, the December long gilt future reached a high of 98 27/32 in the afternoon before falling to 98 11/32 , a rise of  3/32 on the day. The yield spread over bunds was around 152 in late trading. German government bonds ended a listless session slightly firmer. Dealers were focusing on data releases due later this week. They include August M3 money supply, expected as early as today; August producer price data; September inflation numbers; and the Bundesbank's announcement of the next Bund issue, as well as the issuance calendar for the final quarter. Also looming large are Sunday's state elections in Bavaria, which are seen as an indicator for the October 16 federal elections. Swedish bond yields ended about 15 basis points higher following Sunday's election but off their early highs. The Social Democrats did not win a parliamentary majority and the poor performance of the Liberal party dashed hopes for a centre-left coalition. However, Prime Minister in-waiting Mr Ingvar Carlsson indicated that he plans to form a minority government relying on centre parties for support on key economic policies. His stated intention of forming 'an effective government of co-operation' and the strength of the currency helped lift bond prices off early lows. Italian bonds rose about a point on hopes that the government is close to finalising its 1995 budget package. It met yesterday with trade union representatives to discuss planned pension reforms and dealers said prices were boosted by hopes for a near-term agreement. In Portugal, bond prices rose by more than  1/2 point following the central bank's 50-basis point cut in its emergency lending rate to 11.50 per cent and its rate for draining excess liquidity to 8.75 per cent.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / People: More shrinking at John Foster The board at specialist textile group John Foster &amp; Son has shrunk further with the departure of David Allen, 43, previously managing director, and sales and marketing director Keith Halliday. Halliday, however, remains as a consultant. Peter Giles, a company doctor who was brought in to mastermind a restructuring towards the end of last year, says that Halliday, who has been with the company for 20 years, will continue to advise on Japan; that market accounts, indirectly, for up to 60 per cent of sales, particularly mohair-spun cloth for men's suits. Allen had been running John Foster before Giles' arrival. 'There clearly was not a role for both of us,' the new boss explains. At the end of last year, Graham Creswick, the former finance director, resigned, having served in a non-executive capacity for three months while Giles was appointed. The company now has no finance director but Carol Watkinson, who was made company secretary last September on the resignation of Nicholas Butler, is also chief financial officer. The company lost Pounds 1.8m in the half year to the end of August 1992, and losses will continue into the second half, it predicts. Giles is putting in place a programme of staff reductions, and pulling out of certain lines of business to concentrate primarily on mohair.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DICK TURPIN: NEW BUILDER CHIEF A 'DOER  </P> <P> For the first time ever, the nation's rough-and-tumble hard-hat housing  industry will be headed by an assertive woman home builder from Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Selected as the 50th president of the influential National Assn. of Home  Builders at their Atlanta convention last week, Shirley McVay Wiseman has been  in the building business for two decades, overseeing the construction of  residential and commercial developments in Kentucky and Florida.  </P> <P> Nationally, she has served various stints with the Department of Housing and  Urban Development, the Small Business Administration and a Social Security task  force. Recently, she was appointed to the Florida Developmental Disabilities  Council by Florida's Gov. Bob Martinez.  </P> <P> Locally, the brisk, fiftyish builder founded Lexington (Ky.) Housing for the  Handicapped, served as an adviser to the Urban League and served on the  Executive Committee to Insure Good Government. She founded the local Home  Owners Warranty Corp.  </P> <P> Her record is that of a doer and pragmatist but not a bleeding heart.  </P> <P> She spoke rapidly about the many issues confronting her as NAHB president  during a sneak, one-on-one interview between action on resolutions by the  group's board of directors. In a corridor of the vast Omni arena adjacent to  the convention in the Georgia World Congress Center, Wiseman cited these  principal concerns:  </P> <P>  -- The homeless: So many people are just "one paycheck away from being  homeless."  </P> <P>  -- Congressional threat to eliminate mortgage-interest deduction: President  Bush told her it won't happen. (The NAHB, the Mortgage Bankers Assn., and the  National Assn. of Realtors will all fight the possibility of change, she said.)  </P> <P>  -- Parental aid in home buying: There will have to be more of it.  </P> <P>  -- Affordability: Government agencies can and should do more to help would-be  home buyers qualify for loans.  </P> <P>  -- No white paper: That's the last thing she wants from a task force she has  just appointed to focus on affordability of homes.  </P> <P>  -- Housing for the handicapped: More availability for them.  </P> <P>  -- Frustration: Knowing that the industry has a product the public wants but  can't provide affordably because of countless regulations.  </P> <P> Wiseman is not all surprised that she has attained the top spot in the home  building industry's trade group that has 157,000 members, predominantly male.  After all, she has built more than 1,500 single-family homes and apartment  complexes and developed commercial property and a shopping center.  </P> <P> She heads the Wiseman Construction &amp; Development Co. Inc., of Lexington and  Wiseman Homes of Lake Wales, Fla., During her year in office, a son, Larry, 38,  will manage the firms. She also has a daughter, Sherri.  </P> <P> She will be traveling extensively but has already traveled far and wide and  abroad delivering her message of the need to provide decent, affordable homes.  One of her favorite expressions is "building homes for our families is no  ordinary profession."  </P> <P> Wiseman has been active in local, state and national home building  organizations during her 20-year career and has been honored as a local and  state "Builder of the Year."  </P> <P> In the NAHB, she has served as a national vice president, member of the group's  executive committee, chaired the membership committee and became a life  director in 1987.  </P> <P> She was equally active in local and state NAHB affiliates, as a director of the  Home Builders Assn. of Kentucky, served or chaired a number of its committees  and was named the "Builder of the Year" by the Lexington affiliate in 1978 and  given the same honor by the state association in 1980.  </P> <P> Michael Sumichrast, a nationally respected housing analyst and former NAHB  economist, succinctly assessed the elevation of Wiseman to the presidency of  the powerful organization.  </P> <P> Personally, acquainted with her work, dedication and verve -- and alluding to  the progressive changes which have taken place in the tumultuous industry -- he  said:  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, no way she (or any other woman) could have been named  president. Today, she knows the government people and bureaucrats and how they  work. She will do well."  </P> <P> Please see related story on this page.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> KOREANS HOPE TO RAISE $130,000 FOR SENIORS  </P> <P> The Orange County Korean-American Assn. has begun a drive to raise $130,000 to  establish a Korean senior citizen center.  </P> <P> H. Andrew Kim, an association spokesman, said the organization recently  received a $5,000 grant from Pacific Bell to pay such fund-raising expenses as  postage and printing of information sent to Korean households in Orange and Los  Angeles counties.  </P> <P> The group, established in 1987, plans to locate the senior center in a building  bought by the association, Kim said.  </P> <P> The money is to help repay a $130,000 mortgage on the building at 9888 Garden  Grove Blvd., which is now being shared by the association and Korean senior  citizens, he said.  </P> <P> "The association eventually wants to move out so we can put the elderly center  in there, because the facility is too small to handle both groups," Kim said.  </P></p>

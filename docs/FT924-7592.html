			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Pension curbs opposed EMPLOYERS are strongly opposed to the prospect of pensions legislation limiting their ability to use surpluses for their own purposes, accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick found in a survey. The government has commissioned an independent review of pension law under Professor Roy Goode, whose committee has until next May to make recommendations. The 16 companies surveyed, all clients of KPMG, said employee contributions to a pension scheme were fixed and intended to purchase a fixed level of benefit in future. They said surpluses arose when employers discovered that they had allocated more than was needed to the fund, given the level of investment returns. Employers should therefore have no restrictions on their ability to extract surpluses, although they might choose to share some of a surplus with scheme members.

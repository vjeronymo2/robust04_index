			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Prospects brighten for pit leasing deals British Coal yesterday entered the final stages of negotiations to lease pits it no longer operates with the strong possibility that nine collieries  -far more than first expected - will be run by the private sector. The corporation privately believes that there is room in the market for only about six of the pits. Mr Neil Clarke, its chairman, has warned that some producers may be 'squeezed from the market' after privatisation. It said yesterday that it was entering detailed negotiations with a preferred tenderer at each of its collieries at Calverton in Nottinghamshire, Silverdale in Staffordshire, and Hatfield in South Yorkshire. The corporation said that 'provided no insurmountable difficulties arise' it wanted to reach agreements as soon as possible with the three companies involved - RJB Mining at Calverton, Coal Investments at Silverdale, and Hatfield Coal, a management buy-out team. The three pits were among the last of 28 which have been offered by British Coal to the private sector in the past year. The leasing arrangements are a prelude to privatisation of the rest of the industry later this year and next when up to 16 'core' pits will be offered for sale in five packages. Leases and licences have already been granted at four of the 28. Negotiations at two other pits are at an advanced stage. The government made a commitment to give the private sector a chance to operate pits closed by British Coal after the public outcry over the run-down of the industry in 1992 and 1993. Few analysts believe that more than two or three will be viable, especially as the collieries have no contracts for sales. However, all the pits will produce less coal than under British Coal's stewardship. In most cases it will be less than half. The private-sector operators believe they can make them profitable by improving mining techniques, working practices and marketing. The four pits that have already been leased are Clipstone in Nottinghamshire and Rossington in South Yorkshire, both of which are being operated by RJB, together with Trentham, in Staffordshire, and Coventry, which are being operated by Coal Investments. Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal marketing director, is also negotiating for Markham Main in South Yorkshire. Betws Anthracite, a management buy-out team, is in the final stages of negotiation for the Betws pit in south Wales.</p>

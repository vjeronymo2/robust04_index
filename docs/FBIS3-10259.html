They arrived at the Mais Gate  Airport at about 1800 GMT. Sen. Larosiliere says he wishes to  continue his work to unblock the country's current crisis and  says he will return to his office in parliament after resting up  from his stay in the United States. He says he wants to work for  the reconciliation of all of Haiti's sons. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording, in Creole] [unidentified reporter] Sen.  Larosiliere, you know your name has been mentioned as a possible  Haitian prime minister. Are you still willing to accept this  post?    [Larosiliere] Listen, brother, I tell you well: I am always  ready to go exactly where my duty calls me, but this is not what  I went to settle in the United States. I went there to find a  way to get my country out of the present situation. Sen.  Larosiliere will work so that whoever is chosen as prime  minister can be ratified and succeed, provided he can do the  job. Being prime minister is not Sen. Larosiliere's main  objective. Not at all. I have three more years to spend as a  senator of the Republic. But as I told you, I will always be  wherever my duty requires me to be. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

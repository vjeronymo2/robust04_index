			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / EC computer security breached by schoolboy A SCHOOLBOY computer hacker breached security surrounding computer networks at EC headquarters in Luxembourg, the Financial Times in London, European medical organisations involved in research and treatment of cancer, and universities, a court heard yesterday. Such was Mr Paul Bedworth's level of illegal activity that he was unable to pay his phone bill, British Telecommunications cut him off, and he then used his mother's telephone line, Mr James Richardson, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court. Other hackers faced similar charges. Mr Richardson said Mr Bedworth, now 19, who carried out his computer forays using a Pounds 200 microcomputer, was caught when Leeds University set up a data line monitor after the level of illegal activity on their system became so great genuine users could not access it. At one stage, claimed Mr Richardson, Mr Bedworth said he obtained access to a Lloyds Bank computer. Another hacker replied he was not into stealing cash. 'There is no suggestion that any of these had any part in fraud but the effect that access was gained to banks demonstrates the dangers of what they were doing and the nuisance value of what they were doing,' said Mr Richardson. Mr Bedworth pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to obtain telecommunication services dishonestly, the unauthorised modification of computers and unauthorised access of computer material. Mr Karl Strickland, 22, unemployed, of Liverpool, and Mr Neil Woods, 26, unemployed, of Oldham, admitted conspiracy to obtain telecommunication services dishonestly and plotting in the unauthorised publication of material under the Telecommunications Act 1984. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

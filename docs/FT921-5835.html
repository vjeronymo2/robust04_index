			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Japanese utilities set to test demand INTERNATIONAL demand for dollar bonds will be tested again this month, following January's new issue glut and a virtual famine in February. Several big new issues are expected over the next two to three weeks. One source of new paper is likely to be Japan, where the power utilities are preparing to raise funds. Payment date for the bonds will be after Japan's fiscal year-end on March 31, allowing companies to account for the borrowings in 1992-1993. The three biggest of Japan's nine power utilities, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), Kanzai Electric and Chubu Electric, are preparing new issues. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the telecommunications utility, is also close to launching a Eurodollar market deal. Most of these borrowers want fixed-rate yen funding to finance domestic operations. Hence, new Eurodollar issues are likely to be at around the five-year maturity, where the dollar/yen swap rates are most attractive. Each deal is likely to be of at least Dollars 350m. There is certainly some demand for shorter maturity Eurodollar bonds from European retail investors. This is based on the view that the US currency will appreciate on the foreign exchange markets over the next few months, presenting holders of dollar bonds with a capital gain. However, big institutional buyers are keener to buy long-dated paper on the grounds that US bond prices will rise as economic recovery falters and the inflation outlook improves. These buyers of longer maturity bonds were starved of new paper last month. Eurodollar issues of over five years maturity amounted to just Dollars 2.3bn during February, down from Dollars 6.1bn in January. With this in mind, Japanese borrowers queueing to tap the market may be tempted to launch longer-dated issues, even though swap opportunities are less attractive. One borrower known to be planning a 10-year issue is the African Development Bank. The supranational lending agency plans to make a Dollars 300m issue, lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, which will be its first foray into the Eurodollar market. Taken together, the market is anticipating specific new issues amounting to at least Dollars 1.5bn, even before the month has begun. Other regular issuers, such as Credit Local, the French state-backed local authority funding agency, are also likely to issue if underwriting firms can match their funding targets - in this case, around 20 basis points under the London interbank offered rate. It remains to be seen whether underwriting firms have learned from the sobering experiences of January, when Dollars 8.1bn of new Eurodollar bonds, many aggressively priced, were launched. Market rumour is that some firms are still holding substantial inventories of unsold paper. British Petroleum has had its Aa3 long-term credit rating placed on review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. The agency said its review would focus on the impact of lower oil prices on BP's financial flexibility.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  EUROMARKET TURNOVER (M DOLLARS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Primary Market    Secondary Market                     US dollars   Non-dollars   US dollars   Non-dollars Fixed income bonds Euros straight       852.5        1,509.2       23,922.2      45,848.3 Other straight         0.0        1,394.1          519.4      94,065.8 Convertible            0.0            0.0        1,058.1       1,357.8 Money market instr FRN                  315.0            0.0        6,946.4       3,758.3 CD's                 125.0            8.7        1,414.0         419.1 Short dollar MT Notes          16,889.6        5,377.4        8,151.7      10,722.8 Warrants               0.0            6.3          866.6         360.7 Equities              44.9            0.0          299.4       1.407.7 Total             18,227.0        8,295.7       43,177.8     157,940.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Cedel     Euroclear     Total US dollars              23,450.1   37,954.7   61,404.8 Other                   57,161.2   109,075.0   166,236.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week to February 27 1992 The Warrants and Equities figures are from Euroclear only Source ISMA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

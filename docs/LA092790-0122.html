			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: CHARGERS' PHILLIPS ATTACKED OUTSIDE BAR  </P> <P> Joe Phillips, San Diego Charger nose tackle, was hospitalized after being  severely beaten by three men early Wednesday when he left a Mission Beach bar.  </P> <P> Phillips suffered a fractured nose, fractures to the eye orbit, a concussion  and multiple bruises and abrasions, a team spokesman announced after team  physician Lee Rice's examination.  </P> <P> Rice said Phillips will undergo surgery to repair damage to his nose and eye  orbit within the week.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, police had reported that Phillips had skull fractures,  three broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken bone around his eye, but Rice's  examination found no skull fracture or broken ribs.  </P> <P> Police said Phillips, 27, was being treated in the intensive care unit of Sharp  Memorial Hospital, but a hospital spokeswoman would not describe his condition  or even confirm that Phillips was there.  </P> <P> Police said the attack occurred at 1 a.m. while Phillips was walking to his car  after leaving Saska's, a bar and restaurant on Mission Boulevard.  </P> <P> The three men, one wearing steel-toed boots, beat and kicked Phillips  repeatedly before fleeing, Robinson said. Phillips, 6 feet 5 and 275 pounds, is  one of the strongest Charger players. No arrests have been made, but police  have interviewed three witnesses to the incident, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Witnesses told a Times reporter that Phillips was accompanied by a woman who  also was attacked. Robinson would not confirm this, and her identity and  condition were not available.  </P> <P> A motive has not been determined, but Phillips was not robbed, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The Chargers placed Phillips on the reserve non-football injury list, meaning  he will be out for four games.  </P></p>

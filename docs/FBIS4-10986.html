			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Apr (AFP) -- President Fidel Castro Ruz  is "in perfect health," a Cuban Foreign Ministry representative  stated Wednesday, denying rumors spread abroad of an attack on  the Cuban leader or his hospitalization.    According to the source questioned by AFP, the head of state  participated as scheduled in an "official function" on Tuesday  [19 April] night. Nevertheless, rumors apparently started by a  Florida radio station spread in several Latin American  countries, claiming Fidel Castro had been the victim of an  attack or had been hospitalized in the CIMEQ [expansion unknown]  -- one of the best hospitals in Havana.    In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman announced  the United States had no information that enabled it to confirm  or deny any version of the story, and he noted there was no  "indication" of a change in the situation in Cuba.    In fact, the situation was completely normal on Wednesday in  Havana, where most Foreign Ministry officials were preparing for  a conference which, from Friday to Sunday, will bring together  representatives of the Cuban Government and some 200 members of  the Cuban community living abroad.</p>

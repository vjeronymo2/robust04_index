			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / EC agrees terms for Italian loan THE EC's monetary committee last night approved the terms for an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.47bn) balance of payments loan to Italy. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is expected to produce a formal proposal for the loan today. EC finance ministers will debate the proposal at their first meeting of the year on Monday. Following yesterday's meeting of the monetary committee, which is made up of senior EC central bank and treasury officials, ministers are expected to insist on strict budgetary requirements as a condition for approval, but details were not made available. The loan will be in four tranches, two to be paid this year. The last two will be paid in 1994 and 1995, but only after the budget for those years has been scrutinised. Italy asked for the loan last October, partly in an attempt to offset the loss of reserves used in supporting the lira during the September currency crisis. Rome now wants to return to the ERM if it can get international financial backing and enter at a rate which will not simply encourage speculators to force the lira out again.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Inflation spectre stalks Australia recovery: An interest rate rise or unpopular tax increase seems unavoidable With Australia's growth rate running at around 6.4 per cent - and as much as 7.3 per cent if the drought-stricken farm sector is excluded - the Labor government of Mr Paul Keating faces a dilemma. Most of the growth has come from higher domestic demand. Gross national expenditure in the September quarter rose by 8.3 per cent, year-on-year, a rate not seen since the late-1980s. No one, from private sector economists to federal ministers, thinks that this can continue without the economy reaching capacity constraints that would feed through to higher prices. At the same time, however, ) the figures released at the end of last month showed a big rise in business investment, up by 22.2 per cent on the September quarter level last year. But, while upgraded factories and expanded production lines may ease the pressure somewhat, a sharp rise in capital expenditure also threatens to cause different problems. Australia's new plant and equipment tends to be imported. As a result, a sudden surge in business investment adds to the trade deficit - a trend which has been evident recently. Since the country's current account deficit already stands at about 4 per cent of GDP, any deterioration would be serious. Already, private sector forecasts suggest a current account deficit of ADollars 20bn-ADollars 22bn (Pounds 9.9bn-Pounds 10.9bn) for 1994/95, compared with the government's ADollars 18bn prediction. 'The key figure in the national income data was the 8.3 per cent expenditure increase,' says Mr Don Stammer, chief economist at stockbroker Bain &amp; Co. 'That was a pretty big swing, especially with Japan slow to come out of recession and the balance of payments situation. Australia can't afford it.' The consensus is that annual growth needs to be reined back to 4-5 per cent. A rate of 3-4 per cent has traditionally been thought appropriate, but the higher rate is considered justified by the economy's greater ability to tap fast-growing Asian export markets. The question is how to achieve the reduction. Further monetary tightening is a virtual certainty. Short-term interest rates have already been increased twice since August, by 1.75 percentage points overall. A further rise of perhaps 1 percentage point is expected soon. Contrary to widespread market expectations, the Reserve Bank of Australia did not move yesterday, the obvious window after its board meeting on Tuesday. Nevertheless, many pundits think that an increase could still come before Christmas, and will certainly not be delayed far into the new year. Mr Bill Shields, economist at Macquarie Bank, says a rise of 1 percentage point would be about half the 'appropriate' monetary response for the next six months. However, interest rate action is no longer regarded as enough, and many economists are urging additional action on the fiscal front to rein in the budget deficit and further damp down demand. For a start, some economists fear that the severity of the rate rises needed if this is the only policy tool could choke off the investment recovery. Large rate rises could also be used by unions and employees to justify pay claims - and there are worryingly large wage demands in the system already. Only this week, the transport workers' union agreed to take industrial action against the sector's big trucking companies in pursuit of a 15 per cent wage rise over two years. The government's difficulty is that tax increases, always politically difficult, are particularly problematic now. First, minor parties - the left-leaning Australian Democrats and the Green party - hold the balance of power in the Senate, parliament's upper house, through which any tax changes must pass. For ideological reasons they are likely to oppose anything of a 'regressive' nature - taxes which impose a higher proportional burden on the poorer sections of the community - whether on the income or consumption tax front. Ministers have not forgotten the painful two-month period last year when the 1993/94 federal budget was stalled by political bickering - and both the government's ratings in the opinion polls and the Australian dollar plunged. One possibility would be for the government to bring forward the one percentage point increase in wholesale sales tax rates which is scheduled to take effect on July 1 1995, plus some tobacco excise increases which are also 'in the system' for next year, to January 1. Other possibilities are a temporary surcharge on the highest marginal income tax rates and a 'progressive' rise in the Medicare levy - Australia's national health surcharge - with higher income earners paying relatively larger increases. Then there is the question of elections. On the federal front, these do not have to be called until early 1996, although the government recently opened the option of an early poll by claiming that the Senate's failure to support its Aboriginal land fund legislation was grounds for a 'double dissolution'  -that is of both houses. But state elections are due to take place early next year in New South Wales, where the opposition has held a very slender majority. Such considerations leave commentators divided over whether the government will implement unpopular tax changes now, hoping that these fade from the electorate's mind by the time a late federal election takes place, or whether it will attempt to go to the polls early, seeking a new mandate. The former is deemed more likely, but Mr Keating has been giving nothing away. While he acknowledged yesterday that growth was too fast, he also told parliament that the government was focusing on the May budget to monitor fiscal policy. But, he added teasingly, 'that would not preclude any measures which the treasurer or government thought necessary'.</p>

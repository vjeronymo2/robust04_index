			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / PLO urged to resume peace talks Israel and the US yesterday urged the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Syria to resume Middle East peace talks suspended since last month's massacre of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron. Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said after talks with US President Bill Clinton in Washington he was dismayed by the murders, but security for Jews needed attention as much as security for Palestinians. 'Security is a two-way street,' he declared. Israel remained ready to achieve peace with Syria. 'This has always been our strategic choice. We will stand ready to do what is required, if the Syrians are ready to do what is required of them,' Mr Rabin said at a joint news conference with Mr Clinton. Asked about the suggestion that PLO police be allowed to operate in Hebron, Mr Rabin said security forces must be under a single chain of command. The government in the West Bank was the Israeli military government. Urging PLO chairman Yassir Arafat to end his boycott of talks, Mr Rabin added: 'We do not seek to rule them any more.' Mr Clinton said it was vital enemies of peace should not triumph. 'That is why I have called on the prime minister and Chairman Arafat to find a way to resume negotiations and to do so quickly.' Mr Rabin said he had told President Bill Clinton Israel and the Palestinians were 'near the finish line' of the initial phase of their talks. 'Some problems have yet to be solved (but) I'm sure we shall find the right solution once talks are renewed.'</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Nigeria postpones political reforms Nigeria's military regime has postponed indefinitely the national constitutional conference, scheduled for early this year, Paul Adams writes from Lagos. It was to be the basis for a political reform programme promised by General Sani Abacha when he seized power last November. A commission set up nearly two months ago to organise the conference sent a preliminary report this week to the head of state which contained only one specific recommendation: to hasten the building of accommodation for the delegates in the capital Abuja.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Protection for joint account Pounds 56,000. What would our position would be on the event of the building society closure? Would we each be entitled to the maximum insurance cover or is it just per account? Each depositor is entitled to the protection afforded by section 27 of the Building Societies Act 1986 (90 per cent of up to Pounds 20,000) regardless of the number of accounts he or she holds. Where there are joint accounts the amount of the investment is divided by the number of people who are beneficially entitled. Thus, each of you and your husband would be deemed to have half the investment and so you would each have Pounds 28,000, Pounds 20,000 of which is protected, so Pounds 40,000 of the joint fund is protected. If the account were held on trust for one of you only, only Pounds 20,000 would be protected. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

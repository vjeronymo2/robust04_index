			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / FoE plan to block bypass 'frivolous' A DEVICE to block construction of a road by selling small plots of land to protesters was dismissed as frivolous and vexatious by the High Court yesterday. The Norfolk branch of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, had paid about Pounds 2,000 for a  3/4 -mile stretch of disused railway line lying across the proposed route of the Wymondham bypass. It then sold off plots at Pounds 8.50 each to 1,700 supporters. FoE then claimed that the Department of Transport had failed in its legal duty to notify each individual plot owner of its plan to acquire their land through compulsory purchase orders. Mr Justice McCullough ruled that the scheme was a device to frustrate the department. He struck out part of a court challenge to the orders, ruling that the plot owners' argument based on ownership of the square-metre plots was 'frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the court process'. Miss Denise Carlo, for Norfolk FoE and four individual plot owners, had been given leave to seek judicial review on the grounds that, as landowners, they had suffered a sense of grievance and substantial prejudice because they had not been notified. The judge said the plot owners had known that the purchase orders would be made. The whole point of buying the plots was to frustrate the road scheme. However, the judge said they could challenge the road plan on the limited ground that the government disregarded evidence that, at a public inquiry in May 1990, Mr Philip Richardson, the mayor of Wymondham, misrepresented the views of the town council by saying that its members supported the department's preferred route for the bypass.</p>

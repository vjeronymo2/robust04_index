			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yo'av Limor and Tamar Golan, correspondents to </F> London and Paris]    [Text] A Tunisian Jew who currently resides in London has  claimed that "thirty eight Jews were murdered in Tunisia  following the Hebron massacre." According to him, the murders  were perpetrated over the past two weeks, taking place in  several cities throughout the country, and were not interrelated.    The man, who wished to remain unnamed for fear for his  family  which still lives in Tunisia, said that after the Hebron  massacre, large demonstrations were staged in Tunisia. The  demonstrators carried signs in which Jews were warned not to  leave their houses. "We will kill anyone who leaves his house,"  some of the signs read. Others read: "No Jew will come out alive  from Tunisia."    The source further said that many Jews dress up as Arabs in  order to go shopping. "They do not want this story published;  it could make their situation even worse," he said. According  to him, Jews may have also been murdered in Libya, but the  Jewish community there is not interested in making this story  public.    Jewish sources in Tunisia denied the report that Jews were  murdered altogether.    Leon Matzliah, the secretary general of the supreme  religious  body of the French Jewry, spoke with Jewish residents of Tunis  last night. "I checked this story with senior members of the  Jewish community in Tunis," he said, "and they said that they do  not know that any harm was caused to Jews in that country. They  were absolutely calm."    An Arab source in Tunis told MA'ARIV that this story is  "hostile propaganda." "Such mass murder could never be kept  secret," he said.</p>

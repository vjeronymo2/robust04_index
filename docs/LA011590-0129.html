			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MOTLEY CRUE STAYS ON WAGON  </P> <P> Guitars are still thrashed and arenas trashed, but one thing has changed on  Motley Crue's latest tour: The heavy metal bad boys remember what they do.  </P> <P> "We only remember bits of past tours," lead singer Vince Neil said in this  week's People magazine.  </P> <P> Booze, drugs and more drugs left the band members' memories as fuzzy as their  guitar sound, until bassist Nikki Sixx nearly died of a heroin overdose in  1987.  </P> <P> The entire Crue checked into a drug rehabilitation program, and now a drug  counselor follows them around on tour to help them stay on the wagon, the  magazine said.  </P> <P> But concert-goers haven't yet mistaken the group for advocates of temperance.  </P> <P> "We don't just play rock 'n' roll, we live it," Sixx said. "We go on tour and  get broken bones, diseases, the crowd leaves bloody. It's more like going to  war."  </P></p>

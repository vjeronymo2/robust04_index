			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / People: Early departure of Taylor Woodrow chief Taylor Woodrow, one of Britain's biggest construction and property companies, surprised the stock market yesterday by announcing that it was replacing its chairman little more than a fortnight before announcing a sharp drop in profits. Peter Drew, who has headed the group since October 1989, has resigned as chairman and a director of the company with immediate effect. He has been replaced by Colin Parsons, a 58-year-old chartered accountant, who is currently president of Monarch Development Corporation, TW's quoted Canadian affiliate. Peter Drew will be 65 this year and was due to retire. However, the company decided to bring his departure forward so that the new man could be in place for the announcement of the company's results. Like many construction companies TW has been hard hit by the recession and the collapse in property values. It confirmed again yesterday that it intended to recommend a final dividend of 9.5p net per share. TW went out of its way yesterday to praise Drew's 26 'highly successful' years with the company. He made his name as the first developer with docklands and masterminded the St Katherine's dock development. However, his chairmanship has not been regarded as a great success and there has been increasing concern about the company's lack of leadership. By choosing another TW veteran, the company has once again missed an opportunity to inject some outside talent onto its board. Colin Parsons joined TW in 1959 and joined the TW board in 1987. There will be some surprise that he has leap-frogged deputy chairman John Topping who has been on the board since 1976. ***** BRISTOL &amp; WEST Building Society has appointed Jeff Warren, formerly finance director of Mountleigh, as director of finance, Ken Scott, formerly retail banking director of Midland Bank's London region, as director of marketing, and Peter Beeke, information systems manager for Pearl Assurance, as director of management services. Stephen Howard, chief executive, group corporate development, is appointed to the board of COOKSON.</p>

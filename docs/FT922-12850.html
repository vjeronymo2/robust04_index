			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (3): Gateways to a new century - The many splendoured pavilions JAPAN HAS a built a four storey wooden pavilion, a massive African teak and Canadian pine teahouse. It is claimed to be the biggest wooden building ever erected and not a nail has been used to knock it together. Japanese salesmanship and ingenuity is omnipresent at the Exposition and the disarmingly unstressed Japan pavilion is therefore able to emphasise the concept of Kinari or nature as the fount of all culture. The pavilion flaunts a society that has gone through the high tech tube and come out the other side. Chile has brought along an iceberg. The 60 tonnes worth of freezing mass was fished off the Antarctic coast before Christmas and arrived in Seville stored in 10 containers like so many ice cubes for a giant's drink. A 'cold air curtain' and a system of inner tubes will keep the ice flow healthy in Chile's futuristic pavilion throughout Seville's soaring summer heat. Nobody knows what will happen to the iceberg when Expo rings down its curtain and there are those who recoil at the thought of transporting one to Southern Europe. But the idea is to impress the public with Chile's frozen food export potential. Hungary has reproduced a rural church with seven belfries. Forty aluminium bells will peel out the same carillon which in 1456 informed the Western world that the Turkish advance had been stopped at the battle of Belgrade and that Europe had been saved. If Hungary had had time and money to experiment with Seville's climatic conditions it would have packed its pavilion with thousands of chrysalises and had butterflies hatching by the half hour for the duration of Expo. They would have symbolised the rebirth of a nation. It has, instead, installed a fair-sized oak tree in a glass vacuum. Visitors will walk around the tree, look down through the glass to examine its spreading roots and perhaps take home the message that bell-ringing Hungary lies firmly in the Western World. Expo 92's Commissioner General, Emilio Cassinello, likes to say that the participants in the great event are paying tribute to 'imaginative intelligence'. Expo participants have mostly understood the mix of spirit and brains to be a once in a lifetime opportunity to let themselves go. The national buildings show off art works and tradition, they display present day industrial and creative muscle and they project a future of collective illusions. Most have restaurants, bars serving out the ethnic tipple and competitive souvenir stalls. The British pavilion commissioner is a former ambassador called Sir John Ure and he incarnates the flag-waving motivation. Convinced that 'the world and his wife' will be visiting Expo, Sir John is determined that 'we should put our best foot forward'. The British pavilion is the size of St Paul's Cathedral and it is entered by way of a very impressive waterfall. 'We are still a major world and European player and I would deeply resent doing things on the cheap,' says Sir John. Anything other than an arresting presence would 'give the wrong message'. Ireland's pavilion faces the British one and is a seventh of the size. Its commissioner, an engaging professional actor called Denis Rafter, says it is 'a gentle and honest pavilion.' Mr Rafter shows off what the Irish have achieved - their milestones, apart from the Atlantic voyages of St. Brendan and their modern literature, included the invention of the Dunlop tyre and of the hypodermic needle. Mr Rafter, an enthusiastic hispanophile, has recruited a troupe of fluent Spanish-speaking Irish graduates to run his pavilion. 'They are all at least trilingual,' he says. Their role is to 'project our young and skilled labour force'. The exit from the Irish pavilion is through a series of panels that detail the country's principal foreign investors. If there was not an Expo in the wake of the Cold War and on the eve of a Single Market, nations such as Hungary and Ireland would no doubt have felt the need to invent one. The talk of Expo as it limbers up to its inauguration is the Italian pavilion which is almost as big as the Spanish one and constitutes a determined attempt at Latin one-upmanship. Expo officials are tolerant: 'Spain is stealing the Southern European show and Italy had to respond, Columbus being Cristofolo Colombo and all that,' says one. The US pavilion, in contrast, is an embarrassment. Its twin geodesic domes are second hand structures that have already served their time on the trade fair circuit. It is dwarfed by the neighbouring New Zealand pavilion which has a facade that reproduces the rocky coastline that Captain Cook first saw. Commissioner-General Cassinello, who was once Spanish ambassador in Mexico, tries to be understanding about the US. 'They never properly understood that this was going to be a great exhibition.' US corporations have nevertheless made up for Washington's lack of vision. Coca Cola is an official sponsor and also a chief cheer leader of a daily parade that will snake its way through the pavilions every evening to announce that daytime exhibits are about to close and that Expo's night entertainment is due to start. Rank Xerox, which is providing Expo with its information and document management systems, is, together with Siemens and Fujitsu, one of three multinationals that has set up a corporate pavilion. Enthusiastic Rank Xerox officials say that Expo is 'the best living showroom' for the corporation's products and an 'outstanding opportunity' to exhibit them. Spain, naturally, stands to gain most of all. The host country's pavilion has the choicest location; it looks out, on one side, to the Avenue of Europe comprising the EC member nations and, on the other, it surveys an artificial lake bordered by the pavilions of the 17 regions or autonomous communities that make up the modern Spanish nation. Expo, centred on the magnificently restored gothic Charterhouse in which Columbus rested between his voyages, is an eyecatching reminder that Spain enlarged the globe in 1492. And it reflects Spain's ambitions 500 years later. Money for the exposition zone, for the main pavilion, for the regional ones and for the big thematic showstoppers has been no object. The overall budget for the exposition, after four upward revisions in as many years, now stands at Pta202bn. As Spain digs ever deeper into its pocket, the government keeps smiling. Every overshoot is justifiable, the organisers say, because it goes towards 'building a bigger and better Expo'. Expo knockers have claimed for months that the show could not be ready on time. They are going to have to eat their words. They also say it is all a Quixotic venture. But then pundits in Lisbon and London scoffed at Columbus until he came to Spain.

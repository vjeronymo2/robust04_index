			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Net profit at Molson slips 4.3% THE MOLSON Companies reported a 4.3 per cent decline in net profit for the first quarter of fiscal 1991, mainly due to its smaller stake in the brewing affiliate. But Diversey, the international special chemicals business, Malsham, the hardware retailing group, and the sports and entertainment units all did better. Earnings for the June quarter were CDollars 36.8m (USDollars 28.5m), or 62 cents a share, against CDollars 38.4m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 772m, down 3.3 per cent. Molson's interest in Molson Breweries is now 40 per cent, down from 50 per cent, following its alliance earlier this year with Miller Brewing of the US. Molson and Foster's of Australia each own 40 per cent of Molson Breweries, while Miller holds 20 per cent. Miller has the exclusive right to market Molson brands in the US in return for a cash royalty. The alliance's aim is to build the Molson name to 'mainstream' market share in the US. 'Molson's North American base can generate handsome rewards from this alliance,' said Mr Marshall Cohen, Molson president. In addition, Diversey was growing strongly in Europe and turning around in the US. Malsham's new home-improvement superstores in eastern Canada were performing above expectations, he added. Total Canadian beer sales dipped 0.3 per cent in the latest quarter. Molson Breweries' volume declined 2.6 per cent and its market share was 49 per cent, against 50.6 per cent. Molson's share of brewing operating profit was CDollars 37.4m, down almost 29 per cent, largely due to the lower ownership in Molson Breweries. Diversey's sales advanced 5.2 per cent to CDollars 335m and operating profit was up 12.5 per cent to CDollars 18m. Malsham sales dipped 3.2 per cent to CDollars 246m because of store closures.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Ferranti In retrospect, Ferranti's fate was sealed when it signed the deal with International Signal in 1987, though the end of the cold war and low oil prices have delivered the coup de grace. So why should anyone be prepared to take on the company's substantial debts at this stage? There are some businesses within Ferranti which are worth having - notably the naval sonar operation. That is worse than buying a shop to get a can of baked beans. Perhaps GEC or Thomson might wish to curry favour with the Ministry of Defence by rescuing one of its contractors, which looks like an expensive favour unless Ferranti's tax losses or pension fund surplus can be made to work for the bidder.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DEALERS IN stock index futures reported a dull but volatile session, with little in the way of features or economic data on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 got under way at 2,872, just below Friday's close. It soon went into retreat on selling from a leading UK house and independent traders, falling to the day's low of 2,866 within the first half-hour of business. The downward trend was reversed by buying from another UK house, and March then continued to move forward to reach the day's high of 2,895 at around 2pm. The poor opening on Wall Street once again led to a decline in the contract and it closed at 2,874, up 3 from its previous close and at a four-point premium to the cash market. The premium had moved between 16 and nil during the session. Turnover was poor, reaching only 6,198 lots. The volume in the traded options indicated a more active sector. It reached 30,165 by the close, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 7,037 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 1,954. In the stock options, British Steel was the most active with a day's total of 3,900 lots. It was followed by BP at 2,542, with the April 300 calls the busiest series. Trafalgar House was also active as talk of a rights issue continued to circulate, and some 1,580 contracts had been dealt by the close.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUPHORIA BEGINS TO FADE FOR JAPAN'S SOCIALISTS  </P> <P> Two months after voters handed Japan's Socialists the biggest election gains  they have ever enjoyed, the party that once declared "American imperialism" to  be the "common enemy of mankind" stands closer to a share in running the  government than at any time since it headed a coalition in 1947-48.  </P> <P> Analysts in foreign countries pour forth speculation about what a Socialist-led  coalition would mean to U.S. relations with Japan. The charismatic Socialist  chairwoman, Takako Doi, finds herself swamped with requests for interviews. And  Japanese voters, more than ever, say they are fed up with governments that have  been run solely by the Liberal Democratic Party since 1955.  </P> <P> The outlook remains strong for another setback for the Liberal Democrats and  major gains for the Socialists in a crucial forthcoming election for the lower  house of Parliament, which elects the prime minister. It must be held by next  July but could come as early as the end of this year.  </P> <P> However, the euphoria that set in at Socialist headquarters after voters handed  the Liberal Democrats their first-ever defeat in the upper house July 23 is  beginning to fade.  </P> <P> The party remains woefully short of candidates for the election. Inner-party  squabbles have re-emerged. Fearing their own demise in the shadows of the  Socialist upsurge, potential coalition partners in the non-Communist opposition  have stepped up their criticism of the Socialists.  </P> <P> Polls are showing that the beleaguered Liberal Democrats and their new and  younger "Mr. Clean," Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 58, have recovered some of  the support they dissipated through an influence-buying scandal and their  high-handed enactment of a widely opposed 3% consumption task.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, voters in Ibaraki prefecture (state) adjacent to Tokyo handed the  Socialists a convincing defeat in a by-election for the upper house, the first  parliamentary ballot since July.  </P> <P> Three major polls found that fewer than 20% of the voters want to see the  Liberal Democrats emerge from the forthcoming general election with a solid  majority. But only about the same percentage want a Socialist-led coalition.  </P> <P> The bulk of the voters said they favor a coalition headed by the Liberal  Democrats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change in Mood  </P> <P> Worse yet for Doi, the voters' mood on the consumption tax that gave the  Socialists their biggest boost in the July election appears to be changing.  Polls now show a slight majority supporting Kaifu's pledge to revise inequities  of the tax instead of Doi's insistence that it be abolished.  </P> <P> With victories for 257 representatives needed to gain a majority in the  512-seat lower house, the Socialists now hold only 85 seats and have endorsed  only 135 candidates. Despite the boost that the party got from its so-called  Madonna strategy of running a host of women candidates in the upper house  election, only two of the party's lower house hopefuls are women -- Doi herself  one of them.  </P> <P> Indeed, the combined candidates presently endorsed by the Socialists and their  three potential opposition partners still don't add up to a majority. Yet, a  decision by Doi to add another 50 candidates to the Socialist slate for the  lower house election has met resistance both from within the party and from its  would-be opposition partners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Egoistic Belief'  </P> <P> Masashi Ishibashi, Doi's predecessor, announced he will refrain from running in  the next lower house election and retire from politics to protest Doi's  decision.  </P> <P> "We should run about 150 candidates, and then join the other parties in  co-sponsoring 40 or 50 more," he told the Asahi newspaper. "That strategy would  firm up trust among the opposition parties as partners.  </P> <P> "I do not share the egoistic belief that the mood that prevailed during the  upper house election will continue, intact, into the lower house election,"  Ishibashi said. "Our boom was a passing phenomenon. The upper house election  results are not a reflection of Socialist strength."  </P> <P> Ishibashi's criticism marked the first attack on Doi's leadership by her own  party since she took over in 1986.  </P> <P> He also criticized the party for not going far enough to make its policies on  the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and Japan's own armed forces acceptable to  voters and to its potential coalition allies.  </P> <P> Announcing what was dubbed the "Doi Vision," the party's chairwoman declared  that a Socialist-led coalition would retain the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty --  the abrogation of which the Socialists still advocate in their party platform.  </P> <P> But she added that such a coalition would demand that the United States clarify  whether its ships and aircraft bear nuclear weapons when they enter or pass  over Japanese territory. It also would demand that joint military exercises  with the United States be ended, that U.S. bases in Japan be reduced and  ultimately eliminated and that there be no increases in financial support for  U.S. armed forces stationed there.  </P> <P> Duties of Japan's own Self-Defense Forces, moreover, would be limited to  Japanese territory -- wiping out a promise Japan made to the United States in  1981 to defend its sea lanes out to a distance of 1,000 miles. Japan also would  reduce its defense spending "in line with international disarmament."  </P> <P> As a package, the new policy amounted to the Socialists passing the initiative  for abrogating the treaty from themselves to the United States.  </P> <P> Both of the major would-be coalition partners -- the neo-Buddhist Komei (Clean  Government) Party and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party --  condemned the new security policy.  </P> <P> Even Takeshi Kurokawa, chairman of Sohyo, the labor federation that provides  the Socialists their chief organizational support, urged Doi to clarify whether  a Socialist-led coalition would retain Japan's position as an ally of the  United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coalition Government  </P> <P> Japan may, indeed, wind up with a coalition government -- whether in name or  only in substance -- after the lower house election, but it isn't likely to be  headed by the Socialists.  </P> <P> With their defeat in the upper house, the Liberal Democrats already need help  from the opposition to enact legislation. Only treaties and the national budget  can be enacted without approval by the upper house.  </P> <P> As the Asahi newspaper, commenting on its opinion poll, put it, "The feeling of  the people for a change in politics is strong, but they are hesitating to hand  over power to the opposition in one fell swoop."  </P></p>

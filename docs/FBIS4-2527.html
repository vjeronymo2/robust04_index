			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A number of advanced people who are ready to take  up the cudgels for a just cause have emerged recently in the  Xinjiang Military District. The regional military district  issued a circular on commending and recording the merits of Zhou  Fuqun, Zhang Wei, and other fighters who were ready to take up  the cudgels for a just cause.    Not long ago, Zhao Ping, a female driver of the Urumqi Taxi  Company, was held under duress by two ruffians with knives for  as long as seven hours when she was driving a taxicab. When the  automobile was passing a military camp in Urumqi, fighters Zhou  Fuqun and Zhang Wei, who were on guard and heard the calls for  help, promptly rushed to the site of the incident. The two  ruffians dropped the female driver and hurriedly ran away when  they saw fighters coming in their way. Zhou Fuqun and Zhang Wei  fought with the two ruffians, and the ruffians were finally  arrested with the help of other fighters and people who rushed  to the scene.    At 0300, in the wee hours of the morning, on 6 March, two  criminals who had escaped from a prison went to the dormitory of  their former friend Wang Guangyao, who is a soldier assigned to  guard the Urumqi Medicine Warehouse. Wang Guangyao did not act  wrongly out of personal consideration. Wang Guangyao left his  dormitory with an excuse of wanting to wash his face and  reported the matter to the authorities, and then returned to his  dormitory to set the minds of the two criminals at ease. A  concerned department immediately dispatched personnel to the  site to arrest the two criminals.</p>

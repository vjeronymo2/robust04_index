			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Today, on the day of Husayn's 'Ashura and  simultaneous with the mourning ceremonies for the Lord of the  Martyrs Aba 'Abdallah al-Husayn, peace be upon him, and at a  time when Islamic Iran was engulfed in mourning and the holy  shrine of Imam Reza was particularly filled with lovers of  Prophet Muhammad's household, unfortunately a bomb exploded  inside the Imam Reza's shrine. Reports received indicate that  dozens were martyred or injured.    The accident happened when the pilgrims were mourning the  anniversary of the demise of the Lord of the Martyrs and the  area around the shrine was filled with mourners. The pictures  you can see now were taken a few hours after this heart-rending  incident, which was perpetrated by the ruthless hypocrites  [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization]. As a result of this  unprecedented crime part of the holy shrine was also destroyed.    A statement obtained in Mashhad in the wake of this  heart-rending tragedy shows that the hypocrites committed this  criminal deed.    A report prepared by our correspondent, who arrived at the  scene of tragedy few minutes after the incident, indicates that  the bomb weighed perhaps about five kilos and was planted under  a column above the holy shrine, in the south-western sector of  the eighth Imam's grave site.    It is necessary to mention hat several years ago too, the  hypocrites intended to carry out a similar criminal deed in the  holy shrine of Imam Reza, but the agents responsible were  arrested. Their action today was perpetrated to mark the  anniversary of the 20 June 1981 incident. On that day the  ruthless hypocrites staged a last-ditch movement against the  sacred regime of the Islamic Republic. But they were crushed,  thanks to the people's presence and ever-lasting unity.

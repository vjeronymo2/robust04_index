			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Unit 2 reactor at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant was operating at 30% of  capacity after a one-week shutdown to replace a leaky cooling system valve, a  utility spokesman said. The reactor near San Luis Obispo was providing 300,000  kilowatts of electricity, enough for about 300,000 people in Northern and  Central California, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman Ron Rutkowski said.  The gradual process of returning the reactor to full power was expected to be  accomplished today. At full power the reactor supplies 1.1 million kilowatts to  1.1 million people.  </P></p>

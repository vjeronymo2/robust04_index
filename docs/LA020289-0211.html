			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OUSTS CHAIRMAN OF IMMIGRATION PANEL  </P> <P> The House Judiciary Committee, in a rare move, today ousted the chairman of its  immigration subcommittee, veteran Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli (D-Ky.) in favor of  fourth-term Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.).  </P> <P> Mazzoli, a 10-term congressman from Louisville who headed the subcommittee for  eight years, authored with Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) the sweeping  Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform of 1986. Democratic discontent with Mazzoli  had been growing over the way he ran the panel, according to Morrison. Mazzoli  was ousted on a 16-5 secret ballot of Democratic members. Morrison, who was  next in line of seniority, was voted in 21 to 1.  </P></p>

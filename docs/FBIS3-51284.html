			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo; from the "Vector 21" </F> newscast]    [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, head of a special commission  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, held a news  conference on 14 January before heading for Mexico City where,  according to Camacho, he will make consultations and meet with  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    He made important statements about the peace dialogue in  this  state. Camacho said that the outlook has changed; peace should  not involve a restoration of the status quo but the solution of  the political-military problem. It should also involve an  orderly and institutional leadership in the countryside, he  added.    Camacho said that we must implement the necessary measures  to  effect peace in Chiapas, but this should not be the result of a  conventional negotiation of the conflict. He said that there  are many beliefs and issues that still trouble the residents and  undermine peace in Chiapas.    The commissioner said that Chiapas residents must analyze  these beliefs and issues. He added that changes must be  made--for example, changes to the Penal Code. Camacho said that  we must open a formal negotiation process by ensuring that the  conditions that are established will enable the parties involved  to reach the goal.    He said that the government and local leaders must make  legislative changes, but only Chiapas residents should determine  which changes must be made. Camacho added that the most  important thing at this time is to ensure that united efforts in  this state will achieve security, justice, and democracy.    We now know who will be the mediator; that is, the direct  contact between the special commission for peace and  reconciliation headed by Manuel Camacho Solis and the Zapatista  National Liberation Army [EZLN]. That person will be Bishop  Samuel Ruiz. Camacho said that Ruiz is a valuable and highly  respected person in the state and was proposed as mediator by  the EZLN. He will be the direct link in the process to  determine whether the interlocutors that the EZLN selected are  valid and whether peace can be negotiated with them, Camacho  added:    [Begin Camacho recording] The EZLN, via public communiques,  has proposed Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las  Casas, as mediator. I think that the bishop's participation in  this process, along with the other Chiapas bishops, will be  important. Any idea or proposal received through Ruiz will be  immediately considered.    As I said upon arriving in San Cristobal, it will take some  time to restore peace in Chiapas. If we managed, however, to  turn into a clear political concept the efforts of the civilian  movement for peace, the unification of Chiapas residents to  achieve security, justice, and democracy, state and municipal  institutions, the decisions of the federal Executive Branch,  work in communities and organizations, pastoral reconciliation  messages, open and objective information, the efforts of the  churches, and the role of the Congress of the Union what seems  impossible could become reality. [sentence as heard] [end  recording]    Camacho added that only the combination of everyone's  goodwill, intelligence, and honesty will prevent the outcome of  this conflict from resembling those that have harmed other  countries in Central America. He said that at this time peace  must be built via specific dialogue.    Ruiz gave thanks for this responsibility, which he described  as a very heavy burden we must shoulder. He added: I will try  to reconcile my pastoral duties with my mediator duties.</p>

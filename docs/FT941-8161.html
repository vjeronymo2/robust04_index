			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Embargo against Macedonia illegal, Brussels tells Greece The European Commission yesterday branded as illegal Greece's partial trade embargo against Macedonia and warned that the Athens government risked being taken to the European Court of Justice. The warning came as Greece, which holds the rotating EU presidency, found itself isolated at a European foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. Ministers deplored Greece's unilateral action against the former Yugoslav republic and demanded an explanation. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, pledged to submit to Brussels a legal defence of the embargo shortly, and hinted that it would be based on public security grounds. Mr Hans Van den Broek, commissioner for external political affairs, is to visit Athens and the Macedonian capital Skopkje, probably tomorrow and on Thursday. He will attempt to mediate in the crisis caused by a dispute over Macedonia's name and use of an ancient Greek symbol, the Vergina, on its flag. However, a Brussels official made clear that the commissioner would not negotiate on the embargo. This was being tackled separately by the Commission. Greece last week banned the movement of oil and other goods through the Greek port of Thessaloniki without informing or consulting its EU partners. The partial embargo followed the US decision to extend diplomatic recognition to Macedonia. This move seems to have prompted the Greek Socialist government to harden its position - even at the expense of alienating the European Commission and Greece's EU partners. In Brussels yesterday, the Commission described the trade embargo as an infraction of the Treaty of Rome providing for the free circulation of goods inside the European Union. At the foreign ministers' meeting, there were also signs that Athens' action has weakened already fragile confidence in the impartiality of the Greek presidency.

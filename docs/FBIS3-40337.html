Professor and  Doctor of Engineering H. Maier says what we lack is quick pilot  production.    VDI-N, Aachen, 15 Oct 93. They are still lurking as likely  machine elements with properties yet unknown to many engineers.  This can change, however, because ceramic bearings are ideal for  numerous applications where conditions are extreme. They feature  a high thermal stability and an extremely high corrosion  resistance, and do not always require lubrication.    Owing to the special properties of the material, ceramic  bearings are bound to be eventually used where heretofore  conventional antifriction bearings cannot be used as, for  instance, in chemical reactor vessels. "The demand for ceramic  bearings will grow," Grad. Eng. Matthias Popp is convinced,  "wherever not only environmental compatibility, durability, and  maintenance-friendly operation but also energy consumption and  availability of the material are the principal considerations."  As business manager of the Wemhoener &amp; Popp enterprise in  Herzogenrath near Aachen, which designs and manufactures  antifriction bearings from purchased ceramic raw material, he is  since 1989 active in this new and very innovative market.    Users are meanwhile still very skeptical about this new  high-performance material, which has the reputation of crumbling  upon the slightest touch. What is commonly called brittleness  Prof. Dr. Horst Maier, director of the Institute of Ceramic  Components in Machine Construction (IKKM) at the RWTH Aachen,  calls "limited ductility."    The vocabulary used here makes it quite clear that, up to a  certain limit, the ceramic material can display all its  advantages while maintaining its extremely high shape stability.  "This limit is not reached under the specific load for which a  machine element has been designed", explains Professor Maier and  he adds: "For many years we have been making the mistake of  letting only specialists in fracture mechanics deal with ceramic  materials. They can tell us precisely indeed when something will  break to pieces, but in modern ceramic technology we are  concerned about reliability rather than about probability of  fracture."    Professor Maier sees an essential task for the IKKM to be  seeking new applications for "his" material. For the purpose of  a still more effective collaboration with the industry, there  was in 1990 established the Institute of Ceramic Processing and  Application Engineering (IPAK). Unlike in classical research and  development, areas of applications in IKKM and in IPAK are not  subdivided into those pertaining to machine construction or  processing technology. The director explains the operation of  his Institute as follows: "We analyze our applications for the  ceramic material on the basis of its properties so as to  subsequently identify those utilizing, for instance, its small  specific gravity or shape stability". As a specific example,  still in the development stage, he cites the possibility of  using a ceramic material in a blast furnace, where materials  must be extremely heat-resistant at temperatures up to  1300C. Steel stokers, until recently used in these  furnaces, require cooling. Owing to the high heat, not only the  water and energy consumption is high but so is also the  CO[.sup]2[/] emission. These economic and ecologic drawbacks  can be overcome by use of ceramic stokers which, because of  their heat resistance, require no cooling and thus eliminate the  need for a coolant circulation loop and the intensive  maintenance thereof.    Except for a few classical applications, such as those where  temperatures are high, wear is a significant factor in chemical  apparatus, or in filters. For potential users, use of this  ceramic material as a structural one still remains worthwhile in  discovering unknown territory. "I view myself somewhat as a  trail blazer intent on setting things in motion", says Professor  Maier. "We bring the partners to the table for a regularly  ongoing `target ceramics' research and application forum. We  carry on educational activity concerning application  possibilities for the ceramic material, we are laying out the  theory while also showing practical examples which include  finished products."    Professor Maier assesses the research and production status  in Germany. "In the area of structural ceramics our chances are  now very good." In the area of functional ceramics as for  sensors or chip carriers, he says, "We just have missed the  boat. Japan is leading here by having better coordinated  research and manufacture."    Actually the manufacturers operate with an overcapacity,  asserts Professor Maier. "What we lack is quick pilot  production, considering that flexibility in production of small  lots is needed for helping the user innovate." In this way it  would be possible to develop new areas of advancement. These  include sliding ring seals for pumps and compressors as well as  unlubricated antifriction bearings for the food industry.    The pace at which ceramic bearings are marketed is slow, but  not so much because of manufacturing engineering problems.  "Testing was discontinued not because of the intricacy of the  bearing manufacturing process," Matthias Popp offers a  background explanation, "but because we were not quite clear  about the actual market potential." In his opinion, the mistake  was focusing on replacement of steel bearings instead of seeking  new applications for the ceramic material.    Popp knows not only the advantages and disadvantages of  ceramic material but also the problems of customers in the  chemical apparatus, machine construction, and processing  technology sectors. "The best applications for totally ceramic  bearings are found foremost in chemical technology and  biotechnology where they will operate hermetically sealed from  the environment and run in aggressive media such as acids, lyes,  or liquid synthetics and thus where use of conventional metal  bearings is out of question."    Ceramic bearings made by Wemhoener &amp; Popp from silicon  nitride and zirconium oxide as raw materials can withstand  temperatures up to above 1000C. They also remain  corrosion-resistant in almost all media and are extremely  wear-resistant owing to their quite appreciable 80 Rockwell C  hardness. "Steel bearings require grease or oil lubrication and,  therefore, cannot be placed in chemical reactor vessels where  they would contaminate the reaction product." Popp does not  hesitate to compare them with ceramic bearings which, on the  contrary, could become lubricated by the processed medium such  as fruit juice and therefore could enjoy a long life even  without an added lubricant. He adds that "these ceramic bearings  also run lighter than conventional antifriction bearings, owing  to a 40% smaller friction coefficient." With a specific  weight  60% lower than that of steel, they are also ideal for  light-weight structure. Last but not least, a fully ceramic  bearing is nonmagnetic and dielectric.    "Ceramic bearings are today made almost exclusively of hot  isostatically pressed silicon nitride (HIPSN), because of the  homogeneous structure of this material," explains the bearings  expert, "because hardness is very important as far as  antifriction bearings are concerned." In comparison with  high-alloy steels such as 100 Cr6, for example, HIPSN is with a  1,500-1,700 DPH 0.5-kg number more than twice as hard. The  hardness is retained at temperatures up to 800 and  decreases only very slowly at still higher temperatures.    At the same time, however, making harder materials also  means  a more elaborate treatment. For this the Aachen producers of  antifriction bearings use modern CNC grinding center wheels  which most often carry diamond bits so as to ensure the  necessary precision. A sensor touches the treated surface  continuously throughout the grinding operation, the operation  then being automatically terminated as soon as the desired  finish has been attained. The result of this treatment is a  high-precision product: antifriction bearings with dimensions  deviating less than 4 m from nominal, the race length  deviating only 0.2 m maximum, and the race width deviating  only 1 gmm maximum.    Not only in chemical technology can ceramic material be used  under extreme conditions. This high-tech material is also  invading everyday life. For example, ceramic antifriction  bearings in the bicycle hub shown here ensure  maintenance-friendly light running. Photograph by Wemhoener &amp;  Popp.</p>

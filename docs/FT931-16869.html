			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Whither the cross-border cornflake? - Euro-brands IF THE Euro-consumer remains little more than a gleam in a marketing executive's eye, one reason may be that for all the manufacturers' talk about single-market strategies there are still few branded everyday products which are the same in every country. And often the prices of those which are identical vary widely across borders. Of course Sony electronics, Levi-Strauss jeans, Marlboro cigarettes and Coca-Cola are the same everywhere. But a recent survey conducted for the FT found that of the tens of thousands of products commonly sold in European supermarkets only 45 'Euro-brands' were widely on sale in identical format in at least the four largest countries. Nielsen, the market research company, found that Euro-brands were particularly common in personal-care products where multinational companies such as Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette, L'Oreal and Unilever have done much to standardise their products and packaging sizes across borders. Snacks and some alcoholic drinks are also acquiring a more European flavour. Brands which span most countries include Kit-Kat, Toblerone and Twix chocolate bars, Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky, Bailey's Irish Cream, Heineken lager and Guinness. In other types of food, Kelloggs cereals, Uncle Ben's Rice, Heinz ketchup and Danone yogurt are sold Europe-wide. So are Whiskas, Sheeba and Pedigree petfoods made by Mars, which has been harmonising its European range. Yet if the tastes of European consumers are converging on these products, the prices still vary widely. The biggest price differences found by Nielsen in the 45 products that it surveyed frequently amount to 100 per cent between the cheapest and dearest country. In two cases - Kellogg's cornflakes and Palmolive hand wash liquid  -the differences are much higher. These variations are large, even considering differing value-added tax rates, sales volumes and the impact of sterling's devaluation. Will prices converge as the single market develops? In theory they should since large differentials would be likely to encourage cross-border shopping and parallel import flows. However, the theory only applies if there are enough similar products.</p>

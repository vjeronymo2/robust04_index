			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FURGUSON RESPONSE  </P> <P> Your editorial of Aug. 28 was critical of my resolution concerning the teaching  of America's World War II Act excluding those of Japanese descent from the war  zone and our subsequent relocation policy. You attacked me declaring, "he wants  his inaccurate and dangerous version . . . included in textbooks."  </P> <P> Throughout your editorial you accused me of wanting to rewrite American  history. You are wrong. The whole purpose of my effort was to negate a measure  last year that does urge educators to teach a revisionist history of the  period.  </P> <P> Last year, the Legislature passed a resolution that told educators to teach  that period of our history as a denial of human rights, caused by war hysteria,  poor leadership and America's racism. They also urged that the war and military  necessity not be taught as any justification whatsoever.  </P> <P> There were many causes and reasons that motivated America's decision regarding  Roosevelt's War Zone Exclusionary Order. I agree that war hysteria, poor  leadership and racism were three of the many causes, but to deny that the  attack on Pearl Harbor and the war acts off our shore also affected those  decisions is preposterous.  </P> <P> My resolution simply said that teachers should make use of a broad array of  historic research and instructional material.  </P> <P> GIL FERGUSON  </P> <P> Assemblyman, 70th District  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1-DAY STRIKE DELAYS TRASH PICKUPS  </P> <P> Residential trash collection resumed Tuesday in four South Bay cities after 160  trash haulers for Gardena-based Western Waste Industries walked off the job  Monday in a one-day wildcat strike.  </P> <P> Trash pickups are running a day late this week in Carson, Gardena, Inglewood  and Manhattan Beach. The normal collection schedule will resume on Monday.  </P> <P> Western Waste trash collectors said they did not report for work Monday because  a new contract was adopted without their approval.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Richard Haft said representatives from the Teamsters Union  had accepted a contract. He blamed the strike, which he said did not have union  authorization, on poor communication between the union and its members.  </P> <P> Officials at Teamsters Local 396 declined to comment.  </P></p>

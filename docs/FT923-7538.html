			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Market instability leads to bid difficulty RECENT instability in the UK stock market has led to takeover bids involving paper offers running into difficulty as fund managers seek to reduce their exposure to equities. Corporate financiers say institutions are unwilling to underwrite cash alternatives for bids. All-paper offers are also proving unpopular with fund managers, many of whom see a cash bid as one way of reducing their equity holdings. Two current bids - the Kalon Group bid for Manders (Holdings) and the T Cowie bid for Henlys Group - were judged by the stock market on Friday as unlikely to succeed. In the paint industry battle, Kalon's offer of 17 of its shares for six Manders, valued each Manders share at 232.3p at Kalon's closing price of 82p, while Manders' share closed well below that at 211p. Kalon introduced a partial cash element to its bid when it increased the offer on August 7. This bid is of 14 shares plus 300p in cash for every six Manders shares, suggesting that each Kalon share should be valued at 100p. Under these terms  -with cash accounting for just over a fifth of the offer value - Manders shares are worth 241.3p at Friday's closing Kalon share price, and Manders is valued at Pounds 90m. However, Manders largest shareholder, the British Steel Pension Fund with a 22 per cent stake, is refusing the offer because it does not want to take Kalon paper. Kalon's offer closes on Friday this week. Meanwhile, in the motor traders sector, moves on the stock market on Friday suggested the offer was expected to fail. Cowie's shares rose 3p on Friday to 118p, while Henlys fell 1p to 74p. Cowie's all share offer of seven shares for every 10 Henlys shares equates to 82.6p on each Henlys share, and values the group at Pounds 31.3m. Cowie also introduced a cash element when it increased its offer last week, adding 40p to its original offer of one Cowie share for every two Henlys. Under these terms - with about a quarter of the price in cash - Henlys shares are valued at 79p each. This bid's final closing date is September 1.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal </F> Party Committee, at the closing ceremony of the second session  of the ninth municipal CPPCC committee, on 5 March]    [Text] Fellow members and fellow comrades:    Thanks to the concerted efforts of all members, the second  session of the ninth municipal committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is about to conclude  successfully today after satisfactorily fulfilling all  predetermined tasks. During the session, members listened to  and discussed the report made by Vice Chairman Li Changxing on  the work of the standing committee of the ninth municipal CPPCC  committee. They also attended as nonvoting deputies the second  session of the 12th municipal people's congress and listened to  and discussed the government work report delivered by Mayor  Zhang Lichang. They offered many sound opinions and suggestions  for the major issues related to the overall situation of  Tianjin, manifested a high degree of the sense of responsibility  and a strong sense of mission, and manifested the close  relations of showing utter devotion and sharing honor or  disgrace between the CPC and various democratic parties and  nonparty patriotic figures. This session, that has been held  very successfully, is a session characterized by democracy,  unity, reality, and encouragement, a session devoted to  emancipating the mind, enhancing morale, grasping practical  work, and promoting development, and a session to commonly  discuss how to accelerate the pace of reform, opening up, and  modernization drive and again create glorious achievements. On  behalf of the municipal party committee, I would like to warmly  congratulate the success of this session!    Since the shift of the term of the municipal CPPCC committee  last July, CPPCC organizations at all levels in the municipality  have profoundly implemented the guidelines of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's important speeches and the 14th CPC Congress,  conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and the "decision" of the third plenary session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, given full play to the advantages of  the CPPCC, and further expanded the sphere of work and  invigorated various activities in the course of carrying on and  carrying forward the fine traditions of the CPPCC. These  organizations have also made new progress in political  consultation, democratic supervision, participation in and  discussion of political affairs, and self- construction. These  organizations have also made great contributions to promoting  the building of two civilizations, to safeguarding social  stability, and to promoting the all-around progress of the  society. The good situation of today's Tianjin is indispensable  from the endeavor of all levels of CPPCC organizations and all  CPPCC members of Tianjin. Here, on behalf of the Tianjin  Municipal CPC Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's  government, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to the  municipal CPPCC committee, to CPPCC committees of all districts  and counties, to all democratic parties and industrial and  commercial federations, to all nonparty patriotic figures, to  pertinent people's groups, and to the figures of all  nationalities of all circles in the municipality!    This year is extremely critical to Tianjin's reform, opening  up, and modernization. As everybody knows, Tianjin's major  goals to be attained in the foreseeable future are: By 1997, it  should quadruple the 1980 GNP three years ahead of schedule; by  the end of this century, it should initially set up the  socialist market economic structure; and through 20 years' of  struggle, it should become one of the areas that take the lead  in basically realizing modernization. To attain these  magnificent but extremely arduous goals, Tianjin is required to  exert even greater efforts. It is of extremely great  significance to achieve success in this year's work. If we can  seize and make good use of the opportunity to make big  breakthroughs in all work and effect even faster and better  development, we will gain the initiative and embark on a  favorable development path under the new situation and will lay  a solid foundation for continuous advancement. Therefore, in  this year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, we should comprehensively implement the  guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and seize the  opportunity to form a new vivid situation of forging ahead in  unity and quietly immersing into hard work in order to make 1994  a year in which Tianjin's economy develops in a sustained,  rapid, and sound way, a year in which the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure is accelerated, and a year  characterized with stability, unity, and all-around social  progress.    To make this year's work a success and to fulfill all the  tasks, the most important thing is to extensively and profoundly  mobilize all the masses and the figures of all nationalities on  all circles to work hard with one heart and one mind. This  year, CPPCC committees at all levels should, under the guidance  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line,  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party  congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, should subject themselves to the overall situation of  the work of the whole party, should continue to hold high the  banners of socialism and patriotism, should better exercise the  functions of political consultation, democratic supervision, and  participation in and discussion of political affairs, should  unite all the forces that can be united, and should mobilize all  positive factors in an effort to make a big breakthrough, a big  progress, and even greater contributions to fulfilling all the  tasks set forth by the second enlarged plenary session of the  sixth municipal party committee and by the forthcoming second  session of the eighth National CPPCC Committee.    1. With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory as the fundamental  principle, we should raise the CPPCC work to a new height.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics constitutes the Marxism of current  China, the spiritual pillar of the whole party and the people of  all nationalities in China, and a powerful ideological weapon to  achieve success in reform, opening up, and modernization. With  Comrade Xiaoping's theory as the fundamental principle, CPPCC  organizations should, in particular, permeate all their work  with Comrade Xiaoping's theory concerning the united front  during the new period. We should conscientiously study and  profoundly comprehend Comrade Xiaoping's exposition that the  CPPCC is an important organization to consolidate and expand  China's patriotic and united front, as well as an important form  of China's political system to carry forward the socialist  democracy and exercise mutual supervision; his exposition that  the united front during the new period includes two alliances;  his exposition that the CPPCC should hold high the two banners  of patriotism and socialism; his exposition on realizing the  plan of "one country, two systems" and accomplishing the great  cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland; and his  exposition that the general task of the CPPCC is to mobilize all  positive factors, turn negative factors into positive factors,  unite all the forces that can be united, pool the efforts of all  fields to safeguard and develop political stability and unity,  and work hard to build China into a strong modernized socialist  country. The study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions  concerning the united front work should be combined with the  study of the guidelines of the important speeches on the united  front work and the CPPCC work made by Comrade Jiang Zemin,  Comrade Li Ruihuan, and some other central leading comrades. We  should make continued efforts to deepen the understanding of  Comrade Xiaoping's theory, comprehend the essence of the  guidelines of the theory, have a good command of basic  viewpoints, enhance our understanding of the theory, further  strengthen the sense of glory and the sense of mission in doing  the CPPCC work well, and give full play to the initiative and  creativity of CPPCC organizations and members in order to raise  the CPPCC work to a new height.    2. We should give full play to the role of CPPCC  organizations in participating in and discussing political  affairs in order to make new contributions to building the two  civilizations.    Participating in and discussing political affairs is a major  task of the CPPCC, is a major form to exercise the fundamental  functions of political consultation and democratic supervision,  and provides an even wider sphere and even more opportunities  for CPPCC organizations and members at all levels and the  figures on various circles, that are connected by the CPPCC, to  offer advise and suggestions and to give full play to their  professional knowledge and skills. We sincerely hope that CPPCC  organizations at all levels will participate in and discuss  political affairs in an even more vivid manner and will achieve  even greater results in this aspect. We should persist in  democratic consultation. From now on, all the major issues  related to Tianjin's overall situation should be subject to  consultation before they are decided. We should give full play  to the intelligence and wisdom of the figures on all circles to  make policymaking more democratic and scientific. We should  remove obstacles from the discussion channels, earnestly enact  the provisional regulations of the National CPPCC Committee on  political consultation and democratic supervision, and create a  democratic and harmonious consultation environment for all  democratic parties, people's groups, nonparty patriotic figures,  and personages of all nationalities on all circles in an effort  to remove barriers from and expand the channels of offering  advise and suggestions. We should give full play to the unique  advantages of the CPPCC, such as having a galaxy of talents and  abundant intellectual resources, being not restricted by  position, having a wide field of vision, having contacts with  various circles, and representing a wide range of areas. With  economic construction as the central task, we should pay  attention to and conduct discussion of major affairs in line  with the tasks and demands defined by the second enlarged  plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee. We  should focus on participation in and the discussion of political  affairs on major issues that have a bearing on the overall  development of the municipality. We should offer ideas, raise  suggestions, and work for accelerating reform and opening up,  for promoting economic development, for safeguarding stability  and unity, and for building spiritual civilization. By  participating in and discussing political affairs, the CPPCC  should widely and frequently contact the figures of all circles  abroad and should fully utilize its advantages and make even  greater contributions to expanding the scale of opening up,  utilizing foreign funds, and strengthening the friendship  between China and the world. CPPCC organizations should  continuously deepen their understanding of the participation in  and discussion of political affairs, enhance their sense of  consciousness and their sense of responsibility, and further  improve their ability and expertise of participating in and  discussing political affairs. Party committees and governments  at all levels should fully carry forward democracy, provide wide  opportunities for airing views to listen to public opinions, and  create conditions for making the CPPCC participate in and  discuss political affairs in an even better way.    3. We should pay attention to strengthening unity to help  promote reform, development, and stability.    The essence of the united front lies in mass unity and  integration. CPPCC committees at all levels should regard the  endeavor of strengthening unity as an unshrinkable duty and  should play a positive role in strengthening the mass unity  across the municipality. This year, China will take a big step  in reform and put forward many reform measures. Hence, Tianjin  is faced with an arduous task of reform and development. Under  such a situation, Tianjin must appropriately handle the  relations between reform, development, and stability, must not  only foster the idea of depending on reform to promote  development but also attach high importance to stability, and  must safeguard political and social stability so as to create a  good condition for the smooth progress of reform and  development. Having maintained close ties with all circles of  society for a long time, the CPPCC constitutes an important  force to coordinate the relations between various sectors, to  resolve contradictions, to strengthen unity, and to safeguard  stability. CPPCC organizations should utilize its unique  advantages to understand and reflect the public feeling through  various channels and then help the party and the government  dispel doubts and explain questions for the people through a  penetrating and painstaking work, strengthen the friendship  among the people, harmonize the feelings of the people, enhance  the people's common understanding, further strengthen the unity  among the people of all nationalities, all parties, all levels,  and the figures of all circles, and encourage all the people to  press forward with one heart and one mind the reform, opening  up, economic construction, to safeguard stability and all-around  social progress, and to work hard to invigorate Tianjin.    4. We should further build the CPPCC itself and make the  CPPCC better suit the demands of the current situation and  tasks. New situation and tasks set an even higher demand on the  CPPCC. To successfully accomplish the glorious mission invested  on the CPPCC and to create a new situation in the CPPCC work,  CPPCC committees at all levels should further build themselves  well. First, they should strengthen study. By carrying forward  the fine tradition of self-education, CPPCC committees should  encourage their members to consciously and voluntarily study  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, the politics on current  event, the state laws and policies, modern scientific and  cultural knowledge, and, in particular, Volume 3 of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" so that they can use Comrade  Xiaoping's theory to seek unity of thinking and guide the work.  To participate in and discuss political affairs in an even  better way in the course of deepening reform, CPPCC members  should also be encouraged to conscientiously study the "decision  of the CPC Central Committee on some issues of establishing the  socialist market economic structure" and study the knowledge and  theory concerning the socialist market economy. Second, CPPCC  committees should strengthen investigation and study. They  should make great efforts to create conditions to encourage  their members to go deep into the realities of life and the  midst of the common people to conduct investigation and study in  the light of the new circumstances and new problems cropping up  in the course of reform, development, and stability and then  offer feasible opinions and suggestions. Third, CPPCC  committees should pay attention to summarizing experiences. By  summarizing experiences, CPPCC committees should constantly  deepen their understanding of the law of the CPPCC work and  should further explore the new ways of doing the CPPCC work  well. Fourth, CPPCC committees should strengthen and improve  their office work. They should strive to improve the political  and professional expertise of office workers, improve the  quality and efficiency of their work, enhance the stratum and  level of service, and build CPPCC organs into the "home of  members" in an effort to made the CPPCC work even more vivid and  achieve even more fruitful results in the work.    The CPPCC constitutes the important organizational form of  the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation  under the leadership of the CPC. Party committees at all levels  should actually strengthen leadership over, attach high  importance to, and give great support to the CPPCC work. Party  committees should also list the CPPCC work as a major items on  their daily agenda, listen to the report on the CPPCC work, do  research for the CPPCC work, and help CPPCC committees solve  practical problems. Major cases should be reported to CPPCC  committees in a timely manner, and major problems should be  consulted with CPPCC committees in a timely manner in order to  give full play to the role of the CPPCC. The motions and  suggestions offered by CPPCC members should be earnestly handled  by departments concerned. All government departments should  voluntarily strengthen the contacts with CPPCC committees so  that CPPCC members can better understand government affairs and  discuss government affairs in an even better manner. Support  and assistance should be given to the inspection, visit,  investigation, and study of CPPCC organizations. Press units  should pay attention to widely propagating and reporting the  CPPCC work.    Fellow members and fellow comrades, the fighting goals and  work tasks defined by the second enlarged plenary session of the  sixth municipal party committee and by the second session of the  12th municipal people's congress are arduous but inspiring. We  believe that in this new year, all levels of CPPCC organizations  and all CPPCC members will certainly stand on a new starting  point, give rise to a new atmosphere, and create a new situation  with high morale and firm confidence. Let us closely rally  around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as  the nucleus, and work hard with one heart and one mind to  further maintain and develop the fine trend of the municipality  and win a new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization!</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on environmental issues monitored through 10 March.    BRAZIL    At least five areas of the country, totalling more than  115,000 square kilometers, are experiencing desertification.  According to Sao Paulo University Professor Jose Bueno Conti,  the most critical areas are in the northeastern part of the  country. The largest area, which includes Bahia, Piaui, Ceara,  Pernambuco, Alagoas, and Sergipe States, is nearly 100,000  square kilometers, almost two and a half times the area of Rio  de Janeiro. The desertification also affects the municipality of  Alegrete, in the southern part of Rio Grande do Sul State, the  municipality of Paranavai, Parana State, and Roraima State. (Rio  de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 13 Feb 94 p 7)    Brazil and the African countries are vying for attention in  the international convention on desertification that will be  signed in Paris in June. This so-called convention of the poor  alludes to those conventions on climate changes and biodiversity  agreed on during the Rio 92 environmental conference. The  convention on desertification involves international financial  aid and technological support. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL  in Portuguese 6 Mar 94 p 21)</p>

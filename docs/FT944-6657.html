			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Indian inflation rate is falling The Indian inflation rate is falling, according to data published this week showing that the annual rate of increase of wholesale prices in the week ending November 12 was 8.89 per cent. The inflation rate is well below its recent peak of 13.7 per cent in 1991-92, when Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, launched his economic reforms. It is also comfortably below a recent high of more than 11 per cent in May this year, when the rate of increase was pushed up by rises in prices of government-controlled commodities including fertilisers. A good monsoon, the seventh in succession, has helped limit price increases.</p>

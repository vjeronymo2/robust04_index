Revenues to the CIS"]    [Text] The CIS was conceived primarily as an instrument for  preserving the unified economic space. The leaders of the new  states understood that nobody would be able to single-handedly  bring them out of the economic crisis, which was manifesting  itself in all its depth by 1991, and that this could be achieved  only through all-around cooperation on a new, mutually  advantageous basis following the principles of a market economy.  Declarations of such cooperation were made repeatedly. But,  concerned about their own difficulties, the new states were  unable to realize them. The results of this situation, as could  have been expected, were pathetic.    In two years the national income of the CIS countries from  all sources decreased by one-third. There was an especially  sharp decline of production in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and  Tajikistan, which were gripped by armed conflicts. The share of  these states and also of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan,  where the economic reforms were delayed for various reasons and  to various degrees, in the CIS production volume from all  sources decreased (Table 1).    Because of this there were greater differences in the levels  of economic development and well-being of the population of  individual countries (Tables 2 and 3). As is the practice in  international statistics, the measure of the level of economic  development in one country or another is made up of indicators  of national income calculated per capita of the population and  per one individual employed in the branches of material  production.    The indicators in all of the tables were obtained by  translation into a single currency--rubles--taking into account  differences in the actual price levels in individual countries.    Table 1.

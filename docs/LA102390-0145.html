			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME AT LAST;  </P> <P> 'BEYOND SHELTER' PROGRAM WAGES WAR ON HOMELESSNESS BY PROVIDING FAMILIES  LONG-RANGE HOUSING ALTERNATIVES  </P> <P> Sometimes, late at night -- in the quiet, in the dark -- Maria Ortega would sit  outside her family's desert home in Michoacan, Mexico, and dream of a better  life in El Norte with her husband, Federico. The dream was to have a house with  a shiny new kitchen, carpeted floors and, the most important luxury, real beds  with box springs and clean sheets.  </P> <P> But eight years later, the Ortegas' life was anything but a dream. They lived  in a cardboard shack barely five feet high, with no gas or running water, a  single dangling light bulb above a small refrigerator and a mattress shared by  her five children while she and Federico slept on a concrete floor.  </P> <P> The Ortegas, legal residents who immigrated to the United States in 1982, paid  a monthly rent of $100 for that nightmare. They spent one-third of their income  from Federico's job as a warehouse employee in downtown Los Angeles to live in  an East Los Angeles chicken coop.  </P> <P> Today the Ortegas live in a spacious three-story, four-bedroom, two-bathroom  Whittier townhouse for $221 a month. The fulfillment of their dream -- the  subsidized rent, the stainless steel sinks, beds for all the children, the  security and the dignity -- is a result of a concerned social worker who heard  about their living conditions and sent them to Beyond Shelter.  </P> <P> The nonprofit social service agency secured move-in money -- first- and  last-month's rent, plus a security deposit -- and enrolled the Ortegas in a  government subsidy program that allows low-income tenants to pay rent on a  sliding scale.  </P> <P> Beyond Shelter is a new twist in the war against homelessness. While more than  160 shelters and programs throughout Los Angeles County offer temporary relief  from two weeks to two months, Beyond Shelter founder Tanya Tull says she wanted  to focus on permanent housing. By tapping into existing housing funds offered  by state and local governments, Beyond Shelter aims to do just what its name  implies.  </P> <P> Tull says her 18-month-old agency has placed 105 families, including 300  children, in permanent housing across Los Angeles. The apartments range from  townhomes in upper middle-class neighborhoods to units in government-subsidized  buildings. Depending on a family's income and the requirements for several  rental programs, rent ranges from $160 for a family of two to $650 for a family  of five or larger.  </P> <P> About 75% of Beyond Shelter's families are single mothers with three or more  children who have an average monthly income of $800. Because many mothers  cannot afford child care, they do not work and they receive Aid to Families  with Dependent Children, food stamps and supplemental government assistance.  About 20% of Beyond Shelter's clients are employed; the majority receive  minimum wage.  </P> <P> A former Los Angeles County social worker, Tull, 47, is president of Para Los  Ninos (For the Children), a Skid Row social service agency she founded in 1979  that now has an annual budget of $1.4 million. Four years later, Tull  co-founded the nonprofit Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., which develops  low-cost housing for families with children. She also helped start two  temporary shelters for the homeless, the Gramercy Place Shelter in 1986 and  Chernow House two years later.  </P> <P> After a private donor contributed $50,000 in start-up money, Beyond Shelter  opened its doors at 4032 Wilshire Blvd. With a staff of 11 people and a budget  of $310,000 for its first operational year, the agency is still developing  support and awareness of its work "to inform people, especially interested  landlords, that there are solutions to homelessness," says Tull, who adds that  she is also seeking financial support from several foundations, corporations  and private individuals.  </P> <P> The screening procedures for families take several weeks. "We will only work  with families who want to work with us," Tull says. "We lay out all the cards  on the table, everything about their family history, their problems and what  they want for their future."  </P> <P> Apartments are secured from landlords "empathetic, not sympathetic to the  homeless," Tull explains, and clients' move-in costs -- which can be as much as  $2,500 -- are paid from government resources including the state's Homeless  Assistance Program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and foundations  and social service agencies such as On Your Feet. Homeless families, Tull says,  are usually unaware of these resources.  </P> <P> Nicole Pagourgis, co-founder and director of On Your Feet, says her program has  provided almost $80,000 for rental assistance, furnishings and for getting  utilities turned on for 85 Beyond Shelter families.  </P> <P> Started 19 months ago, the privately funded On Your Feet is designed to "get  people back into housing," Pagourgis says. "There are a lot of good programs in  the city and we work with those programs, but the neat thing about Beyond  Shelter is that it shares our philosophy. We both feel that emergency  assistance is not enough. The whole goal of what we are doing collaboratively  is to break the cycle of homelessness. You do that by getting people back into  permanent housing and you do everything possible to keep them there."  </P> <P> While Pagourgis, Tull and others agree that temporary shelters cannot solve the  homeless problem, they agree that the shelters are crucial.  </P> <P> Ruth Schwartz, executive director of Shelter Partnership, which in the last two  years has distributed almost $5 million in food and goods to the homeless in  Los Angeles County -- estimated at 160,000 -- says that she and Tull visited a  Washington-based agency that focuses on permanent housing before Beyond Shelter  opened.  </P> <P> "We've been so busy with building emergency shelters and getting people the  emergency food, it's only now that communities are catching their breath and  asking 'What is missing from the system?'  </P> <P> "Many shelters just don't have the time to find permanent housing. Some have  very good housing referral programs, but any time you specialize you get to use  all your talents, which is why Beyond Shelter is special. It devotes all of its  resources to permanent housing," Schwartz says.  </P> <P> "There is a great need for the shelter system," Pagourgis adds. "But it isn't  complete. The road from homelessness to self-sufficiency is a difficult one. It  takes customized, financial services, follow-up time and all this is a very  expensive thing to do."  </P> <P> In order for a family to receive help from Beyond Shelter the head of the  household must sign a one-year contract agreeing to work with the organization  in meeting goals toward becoming self-sufficient. Families must agree to pay  the monthly rent, not damage the apartment, get counseling for family problems  as well as learn how to budget a welfare check.  </P> <P> The contract, although not legally binding, "helps establish trust, commitment  and dignity between the family and Beyond Shelter," Tull says.  </P> <P> All families are counseled on their rights as tenants as well as their  responsibilities to their landlords. With a family case worker at their side,  the family reviews a "Survival Skills" handbook -- written in English and  Spanish for Beyond Shelter clients -- that is filled with information about  money management, budgeting, housekeeping, telephone numbers of social services  and other resources in their area as well as maps of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Beyond Shelter case workers are in contact with families at least once a week,  often concluding visits with information about health benefits or where to go  for literacy classes.  </P> <P> So far, only 10 families have been dropped from the program because they didn't  pay their rent; they damaged the property, or they were housing additional  occupants in their apartment. Four of the families returned to shelters. The  others moved in with relatives or left the state.  </P> <P> Next year, Tull plans to link with agencies that will provide job training and  development for its clients.  </P> <P> She also is working on the first apartment building to be owned by the agency,  Columbia House, a 41-unit complex that will have on-site services for formerly  homeless and at-risk families. Beyond Shelter has received $3.9 million --  primarily government funds -- to purchase and renovate the building located  near MacArthur Park.  </P> <P> Jan Scott, vice president of Envoy Property, a management company in West Los  Angeles, oversees 1,000 apartment units throughout the city. She says several  property owners have agreed to work with Beyond Shelter because they wanted to  do something to take care of the homeless, including tenants who are formerly  abused women, mothers with disabled teen-agers and drug addicts undergoing  rehabilitation.  </P> <P> "And Beyond Shelter doesn't let the tenant get away with anything," Scott says,  adding if a tenant is late in paying the rent, Beyond Shelter intervenes with  counsel -- not cash -- to help the family and landlord resolve the problem. But  such instances are rare, Scott adds.  </P> <P> Adele Elliott, occupancy supervisor for American Development Corp., a property  management company with 1,300 apartment units, says, "So far we are batting  100%" with Beyond Shelter clients.  </P> <P> "I really do think that is due to the support and assistance the families get  with that agency. They are told and shown how they need to manage from this  point on. They aren't just shoved into an apartment and forgotten. Beyond  Shelter is there from the beginning to end. I need that," she says.  </P> <P> Says Tull: "I have been in the middle of the homeless and housing problem for a  long time. When I started out in this work, the problems seemed so simple  because we always had housing back then. If they were on welfare, the welfare  they received was enough. If they worked, their income was enough to afford a  place to live. But that just does not exist anymore.  </P> <P> "Society has dug deep pits for homeless people and we have taken away the  ladder. I have watched us create a sub-class called 'homeless people' and we  think that their needs are different than ours. They're not. They want a roof  over their heads, too."  </P> <P> Maritza and Simon Lopez, the parents of four boys, ranging from 1 to 13 years,  were living in a one-bedroom Van Nuys apartment, struggling to make ends meet,  when they were evicted last year. The family couldn't afford to pay a rent  increase. The youngest boy, Simon Jr., was barely 2 months old then.  </P> <P> "They let me go back inside the apartment to get diapers and milk for the  baby," Maritza recalls. Maritza, 29, took her children to a nearby motel where  she took a room and called her husband at work.  </P> <P> Two days later, the family was in a North Hollywood shelter because they  couldn't afford to live anywhere else. Simon, a roofer, depends on contract  work, which is sporadic.  </P> <P> "We needed at least $1,200 to move into a place and we just didn't have that  kind of money. Then, we'd need money to turn on the light and gas," she says.  So with the $650 the family was able to save from jobs Simon, 28, had worked,  they bought a used Chevy Impala.  </P> <P> "We only had 30 days to stay at the shelter and our time was running out. We  thought we'd live in the car until we could figure something out," she says.  Luckily, the family found transitional housing at another shelter for 60 days.  Before their time ran out there, they were referred to Beyond Shelter.  </P> <P> This December, the Lopez family -- with a monthly income of $800 -- will  complete its yearlong contract with the agency that put them in a  three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath apartment with central heating and air conditioning.  Beyond Shelter helped them secure move-in costs of $1,014 and the family hasn't  been delinquent on the monthly $457 rent.  </P> <P> "I can't tell you how happy my family has been this past year," Maritza says  while showing off a bedroom -- decorated in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sheets  and "Dick Tracy" curtains -- that is shared by brothers, Edwin, 13, and  Richard, 7. Jonathan, 5, shares a room with Simon Jr. The furniture, from beds  to a dining table and chairs to the living room's sofa and lamps were provided  by the Better Homes and Gardens Foundation.  </P> <P> "All our bills are up to date and my kids aren't sick like they used to be from  all the moving. We feel settled. When we were homeless, my husband and I felt  embarrassed of our situation. We isolated ourselves from our family and  friends. We dropped out of sight."  </P> <P> These days Maritza says the children are more focused on school. So is she.  Maritza, who dropped out after the 10th grade, wants to earn her General  Equivalency Diploma.  </P> <P> "My husband and I want our kids to get a good education. That's the most  important thing. That and having a good, clean place to live. And maybe in the  next three to five years, hopefully, we will get a down payment for a house,  something to call our own."  </P> <P> The Ortegas -- who once lived in the chicken coop -- have similar hopes.  </P> <P> "I remember when my husband first told me about this apartment," Maria Ortega  says, thinking back. Her husband, Federico, instructed her to keep her eyes  closed as he escorted her inside the apartment. Standing in the living room, he  placed his palms over her eyes.  </P> <P> "When he moved his hands I almost lost my breath," she says. "Then I cried,  then I wrote a letter to my mother. We've even sent photos to relatives in  Michoacan," she says excitedly while cradling the youngest of her six children,  7-month-old Maria de Jesus.  </P> <P> Maria points out the kitchen's generous cabinet space, the shiny stainless  steel sink, the linoleum-covered and carpeted floors. She shows off the  apartment's modest furniture her husband has worked hard to obtain. She walks  into all of the bedrooms where the children, who all used to sleep on one  mattress, now have their own beds.  </P> <P> Throughout the apartment, photos of her children behind paper frames Maria made  herself, are tacked on walls. Back in the kitchen Maria reflects on her past  and her future.  </P> <P> Just thinking about how she and her children used to live and how they live  now, "is the difference between a nightmare and dream come true," she says.  </P> <P> "We had no money to move into an apartment," Maria says. "We barely had enough  money for food and coats for the children. The children would wash up and bathe  with a water hose. My husband and I slept on the floor on top of blankets.  Whenever we went to find another place to live, the landlords didn't want  children or they only allowed two or three. And we didn't have the money."  </P> <P> Maria turns toward a sliding glass door, the drapes open, sunlight bathes her  little girl's face. She kisses the child and looks skyward.  </P> <P> "Before, the children would ask, 'Mommy, why don't we have a regular house like  our friends do?' You know what? They don't ask anymore. They bring their  friends and show them. Finally, we have a place to call home."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas </F> by Diego Hernan Canal at Narino Palace in Bogota; from the "NTC  News" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Canal] The government has just decided to put in  effect, as of today, a curfew in Aparatado, Turbo, Chigorodo,  and Carepa. Mr. Minister, why is this going to be implemented?    [Villegas] We have decided, basically, to complement the  decisions we have already adopted to protect life and guarantee  calm in the Uraba region and to face this violent offensive by  the Guerrilla Coordinating Board. In addition to the curfew, we  have decided to strengthen our military presence there, prohibit  alcohol consumption, suspend permits for the possession of  weapons, speed justice procedures, and intensify efforts to  implement the Uraba Plan.    [Canal] Mr. Minister, are the measures you have just  announced enough to guarantee the elections process in Uraba and  to reestablish public order in that region?    [Villegas] The idea of the government, society, and the  people of Uraba is to carry out an elections process capable of  strengthening democracy, enhancing that region's political life,  and becoming a main tool for facing the Guerrilla Coordinating  Board, which once again has made it clear, through bloodshed,  violence, and terrorism, that it is interested in preventing the  Hope, Peace, and Liberty Movement from gaining political support  in this region.    [Canal] Thank you, Mr. Minister. In the next few days,  decrees will be issued to authorize these measures.</p>

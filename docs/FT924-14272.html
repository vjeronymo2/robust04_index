			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pay plan pressure pays off - Prospects of a better tax deal for employees THE GOVERNMENT'S treatment of profit-related pay schemes seems likely to improve after pressure from companies lobbying for change. The outlook has brightened since August when an unexpected reversal of practice by the Inland Revenue disqualified hundreds of recently approved schemes from future tax relief for employees. Led by Wellcome, a group of companies demanded a change in the law. It expected a long struggle, but conciliatory remarks from government and Revenue spokesmen late last month seemed to signal willingness to consider even greater change than the lobby group is seeking. Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, said at a privately organised conference that he would be willing to listen to submissions on ways that profit-related pay might be linked usefully with wider share ownership. This was a departure from the government's previous insistence that financial incentive schemes should offer either tax-free cash or shares but not both. At the same meeting, a Revenue official said the department would listen to ideas on whether profit-related pay could be made more of an incentive. Profit-related pay schemes were introduced in 1987 but have taken off as the recession has worsened, growing from 1,277 to more than 3,000 in the past 18 months. About 760,000 employees in them can receive a pre-determined share of the company's profits. This comes as tax-free pay capped at either 20 per cent of salary or Pounds 4,000, whichever is lower. Carol Arrowsmith, managing director of New Bridge Street Consultants - which is co-ordinating the lobbying with Wellcome - said the schemes allowed companies to hold wage costs in line with variations in profit, and to avoid job cuts. The problem centres on the way companies calculate the proportion of profits to go into profit-related pay. The Revenue requires this to be set three months in advance of the financial year and many companies, anxious not to be committed to a simple percentage, have developed sophisticated formulae. The Revenue clamped down in August when it became concerned that most formula-based schemes were breaking substantially the link between pay and profits. But the curb also hit companies trying genuinely to give incentives. 'You cannot in future register a scheme with a formula, which means you don't know at the start of the year what percentage of profits you will share at the end,' said Arrowsmith. 'You can't increase the share of profit paid out by reference to improved performance by the company.' This was exactly the type of formula incorporated in Wellcome's profit-related pay scheme, geared to rewarding improved corporate performance rather than unchanged profits and approved by the Revenue after long negotiations only weeks before the August clampdown. Neville Machin, group employee relations manager at Wellcome, said he believed the Revenue had acted after a warning from its lawyers that the schemes they had been approving were out of line with the legislation. And he added that if this was not a matter of interpretation, the law should be changed.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions TIMOTHY Dewhirst, executive chairman of the Dewhirst group, has sold 300,000 shares, 142,000 of them to a fellow director. He moved up from chief executive in January and the shares have been performing strongly ever since. Although Dewhirst cut its dividend two years ago - for the first time ever - this provided cash to make an acquisition in the women's wear business. It helped, also, to balance the group's historic dependence on men's wear. Results announced in April showed a remarkable surge in both profits and earnings and brokers are forecasting further growth for 1994. Directors of HTV, the Welsh tv company, bought heavily in anticipation of success in last year's franchise competition. The shares performed strongly after the result was announced but have struggled since. Now, though, chairman Louis Sherwood has entered the market and bought a parcel - the first purchase by a director this year.

He has warned that this phenomenon has been on the increase  recently as a result of two separate circumstances. They are the  powerlessness of the Venezuelan government to deal with the lack  of security on the one hand, and on the second, the indifference  of the Colombian government.    In view of this situation, he believes not only that the  Venezuelan Government is incapable of resolving this problem,  but that there is also a need for the cooperation of the  Colombian Government for the purpose of developing a  coordinated plan for military and police intelligence strategy  in these areas, along with a socio-economic program. This is  because one of the reasons irregular forces have penetrated the  zone and the peasant population living there, including the  Yukpa and Bari Indians, is the inhospitable conditions to be  found in that environment. This is true in the sectors of health  care, roadways, and disease. The Venezuelan children there are  even attending classes outdoors, under the trees. They are being  instructed in the history of Colombia and are singing its  national anthem.    "According to information we in the Defense Commission have  obtained," Vera said, "there are 50,000 residents who have no  country in this frontier area. They are the children of  Venezuelans and undocumented Colombians who were born in a  no-man's-land where they are recognized neither as Colombians  nor Venezuelans. They have become a potential army that could in  the short run plunge the peace and labor and productive  tranquillity in this region into chaos.    "It is for this reason that the kidnappings that previously  occurred on the ranches and deep in the mountain areas are now  occurring only a few kilometers from urban centers. And the  public can be sure that within a very short time, such  kidnappings will be happening in the cities as well, with  politicians, industrialists, bankers, and other leading  personalities as their targets," he warned.    For these reasons, he believes that Venezuela should  seriously review its process of integration with Colombia,  because in connection with the binational agreements, and in the  specific matter of the stolen cars, Colombia has in many cases  failed to honor its commitment to return assets to the  Venezuelan Government.    Vera warned that in the specific case of the kidnappings in  this frontier area, there is one factor that is a cause of great  concern. He painted the following picture for us. "In the course  of the peace talks between the government and the Colombian  guerrillas in Bogota, there was agreement on certain zones to be  spared--areas in which the irregular forces and the authorities  agreed that the army will not engage in action.    "One of these `neutral' zones," he said, "is on the right  bank of the Machiques-Colon. And, naturally, as a result of  these negotiations, the Colombian Government is not interested  in reactivating its attacks on the guerrilla forces there."    According to Deputy Angel Vera, the interests of Bogota will  be served, from the strategic and tactical points of view, if  the problem in this frontier area continues, instead of having  it prevail in the urban zones of its main cities.    In the opinion of this parliamentarian, integration with  Colombia, seen from this realistic approach, has become a  matter of the export of an instability problem to Venezuela.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Unit 20(C)_Moose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board acted on a request from the Denali Subsistence Resource Commission to the Secretary of the Interior to establish an additional moose season on National Park Service lands in Unit 20(C). A review of the data indicated that there is a customary and traditional basis for a late fall or early winter hunt. The moose population in the area is stable and can withstand the additional harvest. The Board determined that the additional season would accommodate customary and traditional hunting periods and still be consistent with the conservation of healthy populations. The change establishes an additional November 15&hyph;December 15 hunt with a harvest limit of one antlered bull, except white-phased or partial albino, for Denali National Park and Preserve lands west of the Toklat River, excluding lands within Mount McKinley National Park as it existed prior to December 2, 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Units 23 and 26(A)_Dall Sheep <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board received a request for a Special Action closing the Dall sheep season in northwest Alaska. This request follows an Alaska Department of Fish and Game Emergency Order closing the same area. The sheep population in northwest Alaska has experienced a dramatic decline since 1989 with a series of severe winters, high predation, and poor lamb production. Therefore, the Board closed the season to ensure the continued viability of the sheep populations in Northwest Alaska. The change closed the sheep season in Unit 23 west of Howard Pass and the Aniuk, Cutler, and Redstone Rivers and in Unit 26(A) west of Howard Pass and the Etivluk River. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only the items described above are being changed; but for clarity, the entire table section for the pertinent species in each Unit is reproduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the above actions were supported by the Regional Councils in the affected areas. Notice of the Board meeting and the subjects to be considered were widely circulated and the public had an opportunity to comment and participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board finds that additional public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) for this extension are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Therefore, the Board finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive the public notice and comment procedures prior to publication of this rule correction. The Board also finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this rule correction effective July 1, 1994, the effective date of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act Compliance_A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments and staff analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the four alternatives. Proposed regulations (subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture_Forest Service, to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) implements the Federal Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance with Section 810 of ANILCA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process. The final section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0075.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

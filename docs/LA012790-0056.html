			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAVERICK GOVERNOR'S DEFIANCE A TEST OF AQUINO'S POWER AND RESOLVE;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: HE REFUSED FOR WEEKS TO ACCEPT SUSPENSION FOR BACKING A COUP  ATTEMPT AND TIED THE SYSTEM IN KNOTS BEFORE FINALLY STEPPING DOWN.  </P> <P> Bonfires of burning tires lit the night sky, and scowling guards armed with  assault rifles checked everyone who entered Rodolfo Aguinaldo's bunker-like  concrete command center -- surrounded by a 12-foot-high barbed wire fence.  </P> <P> Inside, President Corazon Aquino's latest nightmare was holding court.  </P> <P> "I'm a pain in the everything," Aguinaldo told visitors with a grin. "In  Manila, they get constipated every time they think of me."  </P> <P> Indeed, six weeks after Aguinaldo donned combat fatigues and announced that he  had sent troops and tanks to Manila to join an attempted coup by mutinous  soldiers, the boyish-faced governor and political boss of rugged Cagayan  province tied Aquino's government in knots.  </P> <P> For 16 days, Aquino tried to enforce a government order suspending Aguinaldo  from office for supporting the coup. For 16 days, Aguinaldo refused, becoming  an embarrassing public symbol of Aquino's political impotence.  </P> <P> By the time Aguinaldo finally stepped down last Saturday, two days after the  interview in his command center, his defiance was daily headline news. How  Aguinaldo resisted tells a lot about how the Philippines works. It tells even  more, perhaps about why Aquino's government often doesn't work.  </P> <P> Aguinaldo is one of the Philippines' classic warlords, a former national police  intelligence commander who became infamous under deposed President Ferdinand E.  Marcos. Known as a fierce anti-Communist, he trained and led a private "black  army" of several hundred 4-foot-tall Negrito tribesmen and former Communist  commandos.  </P> <P> Their tactics were not subtle: Amnesty International accused him repeatedly in  the mid-1980s of torturing, maiming and murdering his foes. A church group  accused him of raping the wives, sisters and daughters of his prisoners. Other  human rights groups called him Marcos' top torturer.  </P> <P> Aguinaldo was also one of the early leaders of RAM, the Reform the Armed Forces  Movement. The "Ramboys" have figured in every one of the six attempted coups  against Aquino, and Aguinaldo has never kept his sympathies secret.  </P> <P> In August, 1987, for example, while still provincial police commander in  Cagayan province, he won national notoriety by flying the Philippine flag  upside down to symbolize his support for an abortive coup by RAM leader Col.  Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan. Aguinaldo held out for months as head of one of the  so-called "lost commands" before resigning to run for governor. He won in  January, 1988, in a landslide. Since then, his critics say, he has used his  army and political payoffs to run a $50,000-a-day local lottery, as well as a  lucrative illegal logging and smuggling operation in one of the nation's  poorest provinces.  </P> <P> Aguinaldo's critics include 17 of the province's 29 mayors. They met Aquino in  Manila to demand his ouster for treason and corruption.  </P> <P> "He is destroying the province," Delfin Ting, mayor of Tuguegarao, the  provincial capital, said before Aguinaldo ended his defiance.  </P> <P> Indicating his own armed bodyguards, Ting added, "What we are worried about now  is assassination attempts against mayors."  </P> <P> Aguinaldo and his supporters, in turn, accuse the local mayors, congressmen and  other politicians of drug abuse, illegal gambling, smuggling and more.  </P> <P> "He's fighting to eliminate all graft and corruption in the province," said  Ferdinand Trinidad, vice mayor of Iguig and one of hundreds of Aguinaldo's  supporters who gather daily at the governor's compound. "The others are trying  to protect their interests."  </P> <P> "The governor is a phenomenon," agreed Felito Ramirez, a member of the  provincial board. "He is adored by the masses and hated by the elite."  </P> <P> But the long-festering local fight over provincial spoils 250 miles north of  Manila spilled into the national arena after Aguinaldo went on radio and  telephoned foreign news bureaus, including that of The Times, during the Dec.  1-9 coup attempt. He said he had sent 5,000 armed troops, plus tanks and  artillery down to Manila.  </P> <P> The troops, who apparently numbered closer to 50, were turned back at an army  barricade on a winding mountain road about 100 miles south of here, according  to military officials. Ever since, Aguinaldo has denied talking to reporters or  sending the troops.  </P> <P> "They have to prove it in court," he said. "How can they prove it?"  </P> <P> Aguinaldo has used the courts to fight Manila, filing motions and getting a  local judge to restrain Aquino's 60-day suspension order. When the nation's  Supreme Court overturned the local judge, Aguinaldo said the government needed  a new court order to break through barricades outside his compound.  </P> <P> Repeated visits and phone calls by Aquino aides, including Defense Secretary  Fidel V. Ramos, failed to resolve the crisis. Deadlines came and went. Daily  headlines rubbed salt in Aquino's wounds.  </P> <P> "He's making a fool out of the government," complained Ramon V. Mitra, speaker  of the House of Representatives.  </P> <P> The standoff produced the kind of theater that passes for politics here. In  meetings and rallies, Aguinaldo strutted and shouted, saying alternately that  he would wage "total war," go underground, or submit to the "will of the  people."  </P> <P> "The voice of the people is the voice of God," he shouted to his cheering  supporters.  </P> <P> Hundreds of Aguinaldo's supporters jammed the local airport last week to block  a plane bringing his replacement, Vice Gov. Melvin Vargas. Hundreds more  barricaded themselves into Aguinaldo's compound. The more fervent fans said  they were willing to die to keep him in office.  </P> <P> But 100 riot police from Manila and a single tear-gas shell sent the supporters  scampering last Saturday. Vargas took the oath as acting governor and  immediately denied allegations of corruption. And Aguinaldo retreated to his  bunker while his lawyers went back to court.  </P> <P> "I'm just using the law to defend myself," he said Monday by phone. "Plus, I'm  waiting for them to drag me away."  </P></p>

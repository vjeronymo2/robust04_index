			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CHIEF IN EGYPT IS MOVED ASIDE  </P> <P> President Hosni Mubarak, in a mini-Cabinet shuffle widely seen as a move to  consolidate his control over Egypt's military establishment, effectively  dismissed his powerful defense minister Saturday by naming him to a heretofore  ceremonial advisory post.  </P> <P> A brief presidential decree said that Field Marshal Abdel-Halim abu Ghazala,  Egypt's minister of defense for the past eight years and the principal  architect of its close military relationship with the United States, had been  appointed to the post of assistant president, a post that in the past has been  associated with protocol and other largely ceremonial duties.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Youssef Sabri abu Taleb, a close ally of Mubarak's who for the past  six years has served as the governor of Cairo, was named to succeed Abu Ghazala  as defense minister in a separate presidential decree.  </P> <P> While rumors of an impending Cabinet shuffle have been rife for weeks, Abu  Ghazala's removal from the Defense Ministry sent a political shock wave through  Egyptian government and military circles and took many foreign diplomats here  by surprise.  </P> <P> Abu Ghazala, 59, had been widely regarded as Mubarak's heir apparent and the  second-most influential man in Egypt after the president himself. His departure  from the most powerful ministry in Egypt thus also raised intriguing questions  about the scenario for political succession of Washington's most important ally  in the Arab world.  </P> <P> Some diplomats cautioned that it may be premature to characterize Abu Ghazala's  new appointment as a dismissal by noting other rumors that the defense minister  would also be offered the vice presidency, a post that would make him Mubarak's  constitutional successor.  </P> <P> However, most diplomats and foreign military analysts here regarded the field  marshal's appointment to the lesser post of assistant president as a stunning  political demotion.  </P> <P> "If they were going to name him vice president, they would have done it  immediately. Everybody knows that once you become an assistant anything here,  it's all over," said a Western military expert.  </P> <P> The fact that no other Cabinet changes were announced also re-enforced the  speculation that the appointment was not, in one diplomat's words, "intended to  further Abu Ghazala's political career."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Atef Sedki, whose job Abu Ghazala was reportedly offered but  declined to accept last month, told reporters after the decrees were issued  that the president decided to name the field marshal as his assistant because  he "needs at his side someone to help him in the huge tasks he has to  discharge." Sedki added that he did not expect any further Cabinet changes.  </P> <P> Vacant for the past three years, the post of assistant president was last held  by former Prime Minister Mamdouh Salem, whose main role was to represent the  president at ceremonial functions abroad.  </P> <P> Abu Ghazala was not immediately available for comment, but a source close to  him said he did not know what the field marshal's new duties would be.  "Everything is very vague right now. We don't know what he is going to do," the  source said.  </P> <P> Abu Ghazala, appointed defense minister by the late President Anwar Sadat, is  one of only a small handful of ministers remaining from Mubarak's original  Cabinet. His longevity at the Defense Ministry, however, is believed by most  observers to be less a consequence of his at times testy relationship with the  president than a function of his considerable skill in creating an independent  power base as head of Egypt's armed forces.  </P> <P> Through a combination of political acumen and extensive patronage, Abu Ghazala  turned the Egyptian military establishment into a virtual empire unto itself,  with an independent industrial, agricultural and service-oriented  infrastructure that has helped to insulate the officer corps from the many  economic vicissitudes of Egyptian life.  </P> <P> The president has tried on several occasions to take Abu Ghazala away from all  that by offering him the post of vice president, which has remained vacant  since Mubarak succeeded Sadat upon the latter's assassination by Muslim  extremists in October, 1981. Each time, however, the field marshal has  declined.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Close Ties to Washington  </P> <P> Another factor in Abu Ghazala's seemingly unassailable position has been his  close relationship with Washington, where he served as military attache from  1976 to 1979. A strong proponent of closer military ties to the United States,  Abu Ghazala was frequently referred to as "Washington's man" in Egypt.  </P> <P> Thus, the most interesting question raised by Saturday's Cabinet change was not  why Mubarak sought to move his field marshal from the Defense Ministry but why  he apparently felt he could do so now, when he has been unable to do so in the  past.  </P> <P> Stressing they were basing their conclusions on speculation, several diplomats  said they thought Mubarak finally may have moved against Abu Ghazala because of  the many unproven but disturbingly persistent rumors of corruption that have  come to be associated with his name.  </P> <P> The fact that his name has also been linked, in a case that is soon to come to  court in Sacramento, Calif., to an alleged Egyptian attempt to smuggle U.S.  missile technology to Egypt, may also have been a factor in the president's  decision, the diplomats speculated.  </P> <P> "Abu Ghazala's close relationship with Washington has been an asset in the  past, but if embarrassing revelations come out in court, he could turn into a  liability as far as managing relations with the United States is concerned,"  one diplomat said.  </P> <P> Other analysts looked to Abu Taleb, the new defense minister, for clues about  the motive behind the Cabinet shuffle.  </P> <P> One Western envoy noted that Abu Taleb, 60, is considered to be "very close to  Mubarak" and has earned a reputation both for honesty and efficiency as  governor of Cairo.  </P></p>

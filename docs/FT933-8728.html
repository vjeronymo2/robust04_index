			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fast growth lifts China's raw materials prices THE PRICE of raw materials in China shot up by almost 45 per cent in the first half, thanks to rapid economic growth, widespread speculation and the continuing construction boom, the official press reported. China's Economic Daily said prices of the 16 main industrial raw materials, including steel, timber, rubber, cement and chemicals, rose an average year-on-year 44.7 per cent. Domestic production rose by 13.7 per cent and domestic consumption by 16.2 per cent, while imports leapt 143 per cent. The newspaper put the steep price rises down to rapid economic growth and to the state's 70.7 per cent increase in fixed asset investment during that period. The price increase rose on a year-on-year basis from 31.2 per cent in January to 52.9 per cent in June. Steel product prices rose by 73 per cent in the first half, while consumption rose 33.9 per cent, and production 21.2 per cent. Imports of steel products more than tripled to 11.16m tonnes. The paper said fear of further price rises was leading to widespread speculative buying. The price rises did not reflect actual supply and demand.</p>

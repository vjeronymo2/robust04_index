			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by AL-QADISIYAH correspondent Karim al-Hamadani] </F>   [Text] In the presence of Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih,  minister of awqaf and religious affairs, and under the slogan:  "The Church in the Service of Peace and Humanity" a symposium  organized by the Church of Iraq, represented by all of its  communities, began in Iraq on 11 June. It will continue until  14 June 1994. In his opening speech, Dr. Salih conveyed the  greetings of the faithful struggler leader Saddam Husayn and his  wishes for the success of the symposium.    Dr. Salih said: We are pleased and honored that Baghdad is  hosting your world Christian symposium, which is one of the  fruits of religious tolerance and the fraternity of the faithful  from the religions that uphold this fraternity, as exemplified  by Iraq under the patronage of the faithful struggler leader  Saddam Husayn. You will personally experience the care and  attention given to the various religious communities in Iraq,  the atmosphere of piety that guarantees freedom of worship and  performance of religious rituals, and the financial support  given to places of worship and their various institutions.    Dr. Salih added: Iraqis are all equal on the basis of faith  and monotheism. The leader president said: "The most important  achievement, after winning almighty's God pleasure, is the  feeling that Iraqis are all equal on the basis of faith and  monotheism. Other than that, everyone is free to follow the line  and course he and his fathers and forefathers have chosen.  Iraqis respect each other's choice, while firmly holding to  their faith. Our main role is to preach faith."

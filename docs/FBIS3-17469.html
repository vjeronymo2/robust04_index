			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A constituent congress of Lithuanian left wingers is  taking place in Vilnius today. What kind of movement this is  and what are its aims? Here is an interview with one of its  leaders, Albinas Visockas.    [Begin recording] [Visockas] After the Landsbergis group was  removed from power by the Lithuanian nation and the Democratic  Labor Party [DLP] came to power we pinned great hopes on the  future. Unfortunately, not all our hopes have been justified. A  group of people, including former members of the DLP and  non-party people, decided that it was essential to form a new,  resolute, left-wing, workers' party that would represent the  strata of the population most frustrated in the material sense.  After a year of preparation, we have today a constituent  congress of such a resolute, left-wing, workers' party.    [Unidentified correspondent] But to recall our recent past,  the communists maintained that they represented the interests of  the workers -- above all, the interests of the working class and  peasants. May it not happen that you will follow the same path?    [Visockas] Of course, but the difference is that this time  the initiative came from below, that is, among the initiators of  this party are workers, unemployed, tractor drivers, housewives,  and other strata of the population who possess very little.    [Correspondent] What social group do you yourself represent?    [Visockas] I am a worker, although I have higher education.  I consider that this was the fate of many people in Lithuania  after competent and professional persons were removed from all  offices and institutions by the Landsbergis group. There are  such people. I am a worker, my comrades are also -- some of  them are night watchmen, some of them cleaners, etc. But we are  very glad that we have managed to acquire the initial rather  large intellectual potential, that is, there are doctors of  sciences, professors, candidates of sciences, lecturers in our  party. Thus there is a good basis for the formation of the  party.    [Correspondent] Do you intend to cooperate with other  parties  in Lithuania, including such public movements as the Workers'  Union?    [Visockas] Yes, we intend to cooperate with all parties and  movements that will not look down at us, that wish to cooperate,  but we are not going to be subserviant. We have no inferiority  complex. We do not feel any guilt, we are equal to other  political parties and movements in Lithuania.    [Correspondent] Your movement or party is of a socialist  orientation?    [Visockas] Yes.    [Correspondent] How many persons holding the same views as  you are there?    [Visockas} I can say exactly. We have 429 party members.  But they are those who have decided. Those who will decide  after the congress and in the following months, I think that  there will be very many of them. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras, Nov. 24--The designated court conducting  trial in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case today dismissed the  discharge petitions of all the 26 accused in the case and held  that prima facie case has been made out against them.    Passing orders today after the five-month-long pre-trial  proceedings about the involvement of the LTTE and the 26 accused  in the assassination, the judge, Mr. S.M. Siddickk, said that  after going through the materials submitted by the Special  Investigation (SIT) he was satisfied that sufficient grounds  existed to proceed against the accused. The court also framed  charges against the accused.    All the accused, barring Murugan and three others, heard the  charges with rapt attention as the Bench clerk read the charges  against each of the accused. While all of them pleaded not  guilty, Shanti, wife of another accused, Jayakumar, said she did  not follow the charges against her. When the clerk repeated the  charges she also pleaded not guilty and said there was no  connection between the assassination and her. "I am being kept  in the prison without any justification," she told the judge.    The 250-odd charges framed by the court broadly confirmed to  the charges listed by the prosecution in the chargesheet.    In the 62-page order Mr. Siddickk held that "under the law,  charges can be framed even on "strong suspicion" and here in  this case there is "overwhelming material of very determinative  character clearly indicating the offence complained against the  accused."    Applicability of TADA: The judge, while framing  charges, also answered all the legal questions that figured in  the lengthy arguments between the prosecution and the defence  lawyers. They included applicability of the TADA to the case,  validity of confessional statements, splitting of the case  between those arrested and absconding, the CBI's legal standing  in investigating the case and appointment of the Jain Commission.    The framing of the charges by the court might not  immediately  lead to the commencement of the trial as the defence lawyer, Mr.  S. Doraisamy, informed the reporters at the court that he would  soon go on appeal to the Madras High Court. He said that though  the TADA stipulated that only the Supreme Court was authorised  to take up appeals, he would request the Madras High Court to  invoke special powers to take up the case. The trial might  resume only after the disposal of the appeals by the High Court.    In his orders, Mr. Siddickk dismissed the defence arguments  that the TADA was not applicable to the case as the offences  alleged to have been committed were only against the individuals  for personal reasons and not against the Government.    'Common intention': He also dismissed as factually  and legally unsustainable, Mr. Doraisamy's argument that there  was no evidence to suggest that key accused, Nalini, and others  had any knowledge of the conspiracy or at any point of time they  had agreed to participate in the conspiracy. "Common intention"  was a rule of evidence and the charge under that Section could  always be framed if the fact and circumstances warrant that, he  said.    On Mr. Doraisamy's argument that the LTTE's intelligence  chief, Pottu Amman, and women's wing leader, Akhila, were  non-existing members, and therefore, there could not be any  conspiracy between the accused and non-existing persons, the  judge said that it was "frivolous and unwarranted" in view of  the materials placed before the court along with the charge  sheet and it did not merit any consideration.    The judge also dismissed the defence plea that the alleged  conspiracy by the LTTE was only to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi and  there was no conspiracy to kill other persons. If anyone had  died it was only incidental or accidental and not in pursuance  of the conspiracy, the defence argued. Sixteen persons,  including Rajiv Gandhi, died in the Sriperumbudur blast on May  21, 1991. Seventeen persons received grievous injuries and 27  simple injuries.    On defence counsel's argument that the CBI had no locus  standi to investigate the assassination case as the Centre  did not notify in the G.O. that CBI could take up TADA cases,  when the Act came into force in 1987, the judge said the Madras  High Court already dismissed this argument in 1992 and held that  the CBI was empowered to investigate cases under the TADA.    Therefore, it was futile to conclude that the CBI had no  statutory power to investigate the Rajiv Gandhi case.    Jain panel findings 'not binding': The court held  that the observations and findings of the Jain Commission are  not binding on the trial court proceedings.    Mr. S.M. Siddick, said, "The Jain Commission could not do  what the regular criminal court was already doing or might do in  due course."--PTI</p>

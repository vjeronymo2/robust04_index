			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "States or Corridor?"] </F>   [Text] The old joke -- "every rumor becomes a reality" --  has again proved its correctness. After repeated denials of  government and presidential spokesmen that the United States and  NATO were applying pressure on Bulgaria to agree to opening  corridors for the "Blue Helmets" on their way to Sarajevo, it  was eventually requested by [U.S.] Ambassador Montgomery.    Now Bulgaria is about to make a move in the diplomatic chess  game. Its future existence as a sovereign state depends on this  move.    Every involvement in an international conflict begins in  such  an innocuous manner. Along the same route in 1914-15 military  equipment for Turkey was transported by Germany and  Austro-Hungary through the territories of the still neutral  Romania and Bulgaria. In addition we received a loan from  "Diskontogesellschaft," a small territorial concession from  Turkey, and... we ended up in 1919 with Neuilly.    Now history seems to be repeating itself not as a farce but  as a new drama. This is so because if we give in to pressure,  after NATO military equipment we will have to make the next  logical step and allow Turkish "blue helmets" through our  country on their way to Bosnia. Against the background of  increasing pro-Turkish and Islamic propaganda in the mixed  population regions in Bulgaria this would be like pouring oil on  a fire.    In its modern history, Bulgaria has suffered much from  shortsighted or simply corrupt politicians. Today the issue of  Bulgaria being dragged into an escalating military conflict in  former Yugoslavia is again on the agenda. This would mean only  one thing -- a new Balkan war.    Montgomery's demand poses a test for our statesmen -- will  they find the courage to sustain the principled policy of total  noninterference in the conflict, or again jump on the bandwagon  of the one that appears to be strong at the moment. Whether  Bulgaria will remain a state or will become a "corridor" for  everyone who cares to cross the country depends on the answer.    For us Bulgarians, only one bitter consolation will be left:  Namely, that whoever took us as an ally or as a Vilayet [Turkish  province] did not prosper too much....</p>

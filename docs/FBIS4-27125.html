			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Opportunity for Reinvasion Must Not be Allowed" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities  are mobilizing news media in an effort to secure a permanent  membership of the U.N. Security Council. They are deliberately  building up at home and abroad the public opinion that Japan is  possessed of all qualifications for the permanent membership  and, therefore, should naturally become a permanent member. At  the same time, they are feverishly lobbying to gain support from  many countries.    NODONG SINMUN today brands this as an expression of the  arrogance of revived militarism and a mockery of the  international community.    The news analyst says:    Japan intends to become a political power and military power  and justify its military action overseas by gaining the seat of  a permanent member.    What is more serious is that Japan seeks to get the  international community to recognise its nuclear armament.    Japan, having made all material and technical preparations  for becoming a nuclear power, plans to overcome the opposition  of public opinion to and legal restrictions on nuclear armament  by securing permanent membership.    To become a permanent member is a spring-board for the  Japanese ruling quarters.    As seen above, the Japanese authorities' zealous effort to  become a permanent member is chiefly aimed at becoming a  military power and nuclear power, participating in the scrambles  for world domination and opening a favorable phase for realising  their dominationist ambition with strength.    To allow Japan which has not parted with its militarist past  to become a permanent member means to encourage it to repeat the  crimes of the blood-stained past.    Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member so long  as it fails to sincerely repent of its past aggression and atone  for it clearly.    Japan must liquidate the past before it tries to become a  permanent member.</p>

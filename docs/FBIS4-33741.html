			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] During a regular session of the Social  Development Coordinating Council (CCDS) on 7 June, President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy stated that the government already is  attending to practically all social problems in rural  settlements in San Pedro and Canindeyu Departments.    Accompanied by regional and church authorities, the head of  state visited several rural settlements in northern Paraguay on  5 June for first-hand knowledge of the most pressing problems  confronting the region's farmers.    It was precisely there that several peasants organizations  staged protest rallies and blocked highways to demand better  prices for their produce, greater financial and technical  assistance from the government, and the implementation of  education and health care programs.    The president said military personnel and Agrarian Reform  Institute officials surveyed several plots of land in rural  areas of several colonies located in that region. This will  contribute to expediting steps to grant property deeds to  farmers, an essential requirement to ask for agricultural  credits. [passage omitted]    During the CCDS session, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta  said the government already has granted some 2,000 property  deeds in several colonies so far.    He added that a national survey on rural needs conducted by  the departmental councils of each governorship in the country's  17 departments and 214 districts will be submitted at the next  CCDS meeting. This survey will serve as input for the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to put together a project  devised by Wasmosy--the Paraguayan Program on Social  Investment--that seeks to obtain a $100 million loan for rural  development projects.</p>

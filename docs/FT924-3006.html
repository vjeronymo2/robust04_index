			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Mexico furious over US drugs accusations FORMER Mexican interior minister, Mr Manuel Bartlett, has vehemently denied claims by US federal prosecutors that he was involved in drug-running and in the 1985 murder of Mr Enrique Camarena, an official of the US Drug Enforcement Agency. The accusations were made during the trial of Mr Alvarez Humberto Machain, a Mexican doctor kidnapped by DEA agents to face charges in the US of aiding the torture and murder of Mr Camarena. The fall-out from the allegations may damage relations between the two countries at a time when Mexico is keen to establish good terms with the incoming Clinton administration. US prosecutors accused Mr Bartlett, Mr Enrique Alvarez de Castillo, former attorney-general, and Mr Juan Arevala, former defence minister, of accepting money from the Guadalajara drugs cartel. They also claimed that some of them were present at meetings in which Mr Camarena's murder was planned. Mr Bartlett, governor-elect of the state of Pueblo, was education minister until this year, and interior minister throughout former President Miguel de la Madrid's administration. In the latter post he oversaw the controversial 1988 presidential elections that brought Mr Carlos Salinas to power. The president may thus go to some lengths to protect him. The US accusations drew a furious response from the Mexican government, already incensed at the kidnapping of Mr Machain. 'The prosecution has acted irresponsibly and immorally to involve people who have held important public offices based on the testimony of delinquents and criminals who do not merit credibility in light of their personal history,' the attorney-general's office said. Mexico also condemned Mr Machain's kidnap as contrary to international law, and an infringement of its national sovereignty. It thus argues that his trial is itself illegal.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The golden age of rail that never was: Once upon a time the UK's trains were clean, fast and always ran on time - or did they? THE GOLDEN age of rail, they call it: the days when the servants of the railways took pride in their work, when glorious steam engines were turned out for their journeys with paint gleaming and copper burnished brightly, when courteous porters carried people's bags to their carriages for 6d, and  -most of all - when you could set your watch by the departures and arrivals of the trains. Today, a journey by state-owned British Rail is more likely to be perceived as an ordeal than a pleasure. Trains and stations are dirty and run down; employees, where they can be found at all, are surly and unhelpful; the railways are riddled with inexplicable irritants, such as the closure of restaurant cars long before the journey's end; and - worst of all - services are delayed or cancelled, often without explanation. Now, at last, all this could seemingly change. The Conservatives are about to go to the country with a manifesto commitment to break up and privatise British Rail in the lifetime of the next parliament. The details have yet to be worked out, but prime minister John Major is said to favour splitting BR up into the old regional companies such as the Great Western and the London &amp; North Eastern. Whatever method is chosen, it will be sold to voters as the dawn of a new golden age for rail under private ownership. And yet . . . the suspicion remains that this is just too good to be true. Was the last golden age really all it is cracked up to have been? Was it not the prime minister's favourite author, Trollope, who, as long ago as 1869, observed in his novel He Knew He Was Right: 'The real disgrace of England is the railway sandwich'? Doubts are reinforced by recollections of the frequency with which railways, then as now, were ridiculed. A recent letter to a UK national newspaper recalled a pre-war music hall joke about the man who tried to commit suicide by lying across the tracks of the Southern Railway, only to die of starvation. And constant fun was had at the expense of the old railway companies' initials. The LNER (London &amp; North Eastern Railway) was known as the Late &amp; Never Early; the LMS (London Midland &amp; Scottish) as the 'Elluva Mess; the S&amp;D (Somerset &amp; Dorset) as the Slow &amp; Dirty; and the MS&amp;L (Manchester Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire) as the Money Sunk &amp; Lost. It would be unfair to draw comparisons with the earliest days of rail - the days of the 1830s when second and third class passengers travelled uncomfortably in open wagons, competing for space at the opposite end of the train from the steam locomotive for fear of an explosion. But even after the rapid expansion of the network, triggered by the railway mania of the mid-1840s, history suggests that the intense competition which resulted did little to promote either technological progress or higher standards of service for the customer. One vociferous critic of the Victorian railways was the novelist Charles Dickens. In Letters (1856), he describes a stop at Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire: 'The lady in the refreshment room . . . gave me a cup of tea, as if I were a hyena and she my cruel keeper with a strong dislike to me. I . . . had a petrified bun of enormous antiquity in miserable meekness.' Thus, the creation of the British Rail sandwich long anticipated the creation of British Rail. But railway catering, although a frequent source of complaint, was not the only one. Professor Jack Simmons, Britain's pre-eminent historian of the Victorian railways, tells of many more weaknesses and absurdities. In The Railways of Britain, for example, he describes the search for an effective way of telling passengers which station they had reached. Some companies put illuminated signs on the platforms, but the practice was not universal: on the Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow Railway, starlings and parrots were trained to scream the names of stations. 'This device did not meet with general favour,' Simmons notes. More important, standards of passenger accommodation lagged far behind the available technology. Always with an eye to profit, Victorian railway companies were loath to fritter away money on luxuries such as heating and lighting in carriages, still less on refreshment cars or even lavatories. As a result, big intermediate stations such as Swindon, Preston and York saw frenzied activity when main-line trains arrived as hundreds disembarked to seek comfort and relief. Eventually, long-distance trains did improve as companies began to emulate higher standards set by the aggressively competitive Midland Railway in the 1870s. But shorter-distance and commuter services remained impervious to such influences. As Simmons relates in The Victorian Railway: 'Two of the most notoriously intense competitors in this business, the South Eastern and the London Chatham &amp; Dover companies, were both also notorious for the badness of the accommodation they offered; their neighbour, the London Brighton &amp; South Coast, which competed with them too, was not in this respect much better.' Even in first and second class, heating and lighting were rare on commuter trains before 1900. As for third class passengers, they were probably in too much pain to notice that such amenities were missing. Trains in those days were divided into compartments, each intended to seat 10 or 12 people. In practice, they often held 30. Simmons explains: 'On the Walthamstow (north London) line, it was accepted that boys travelled in the luggage racks.' Timekeeping was equally poor. By the late 1880s, members of parliament had become so angry about poor punctuality that they forced the published arrival times of all trains at London terminals to be put back in an attempt to make them more realistic. The worst offenders - then, as now - were commuter services running into Victoria, Charing Cross and London Bridge There were many other sources of concern. Geoffrey Body, an author and former railwayman, records in his book The Railway Era that letters to newspapers complained of rude employees, cancelled trains, fare anomalies, and even having to show one's ticket too often (' . . . six times between Charing Cross and Maidstone . . . '). One letter, headed 'Sixty miles on a broken spring', protested about the discomfort of a journey from Faversham, Kent, to Herne Hill, south London. Significantly, the writer of this last letter went on to say that attempts to halt the train with the communication cord had proved futile. In The Victorian Railway, Simmons chronicles in disturbing detail how the companies were reluctant to give safety the priority it warranted. Cost was the reason, and frequent disasters the result. One victim was Dickens, who was shaken very badly by an accident that killed 10 fellow-passengers on the South Eastern Railway on June 9 1865. He never fully recovered, and died five years later to the day. Surely, though, some good came out of the competition? What about train speeds? What about those legendary races to the north in which rival companies vied to see which could get from London to Scotland the fastest? Alas, reality has become clouded by myth. Yes, there were two bouts of keen competition on Anglo-Scottish routes, in 1888 and 1895, but they were no more than stunts: the competition was much too costly to sustain. ('More haste, less dividend' was the caption to a Punch cartoon of 1888.) After 1895, the companies involved agreed not to undercut a journey time of 8 hr 15 min from London to Edinburgh or Glasgow. This stultifying bar on competition remained in force till 1932. Elsewhere, too, competition resulted more often in cartels than improvements in speeds. One example was Portsmouth, served by two companies using different routes from London. In spite of the scope for rivalry, the 1913 timetable shows that Portsmouth had the slowest train service of any city in Britain. Conversely, the fastest trains in the timetable were those running on the Great Western Railway between London and Bristol - a route on which there was no competition. Their manifest shortcomings aside, the Victorian railways did have one virtue: they made money. Facing little or no competition from other modes of transport, the larger companies usually managed to pay acceptable dividends to shareholders. Once the speculative frenzy of the mid-1840s had passed, railway shares came to be regarded as safe, if unspectacular, investments. But it was too good to last. Even before the First World War, the railways had started losing their suburban passengers to electric trams. Then came the war, during which the railways were put under state control and came under enormous strain. Afterwards, in 1923, an attempt was made to restore the railways' prosperity by grouping the 120 independent operators into four big regional companies: the London Midland &amp; Scottish, the London &amp; North Eastern, the Great Western and the Southern. Train-spotters look on the era that followed as the golden age of rail because they associate it with the last great steam locomotives and crack express trains such as the Flying Scotsman and the Golden Arrow. Shareholders, however, might have different memories. In British Railways 1948-73, Professor Terry Gourvish, of the London School of Economics, records that from 1935 to 1939 the GWR paid an average annual dividend of 2.8 per cent, the LMS 0.85 per cent, the SR 0.65 per cent, and the LNER nothing. The truth is that any 'golden age', if ever such a thing existed, had long since passed. Railways no longer enjoyed a monopoly over inland transport: instead, their profits were being eroded by the rapid growth in numbers of buses and lorries - and if that were not enough, by the Great Depression. Desperately short of cash and prevented by government edict from increasing fares, the railways lacked the money to invest. Apart from the electrification of the Southern Railway, improvements to services were nugatory: railway historian Michael Bonavia records in The Four Great Railways, for example, that it took almost until the eve of the Second World War for train speeds to recover their 1914 levels. Peter Butterfield of University College, Dublin, illustrates the realities of that era when, in the Journal of Transport History (September 1986), he writes of the LNER: 'Thanks to a handful of prestige trains - notably, the high-speed streamliners introduced in 1935 and 1937 - the LNER had managed to retain a good reputation among the travelling public at very small capital cost, even though its services in areas like East Anglia were poor and antiquated and its London services abysmal. 'What was lacking was any long-term strategy. The management were primarily concerned with immediate problems: the next bank holiday, the next summer season, efforts to get replacements for the most hopelessly obsolete rolling stock, saving candle-ends . . . ' It is an epitaph that could apply to any of the four companies. Their short, unhappy history came to an end after just 25 years when, crippled by the strains of the Second World War, they succumbed to nationalisation in 1948. And yet, the memories linger on - of the days when the guard's van was piled high with pigeon hampers and refrigerated Eldorado ice-cream containers; when every horsehair-stuffed seat was topped with a freshly-laundered antimacassar; when a five-course luncheon could be had in the dining car of the Flying Scotsman for 3s 6d; and - most of all - when the trains always ran on time. Ah, shall we ever see their like again?</p>

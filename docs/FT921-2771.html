			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong Bank kept China informed about deal THE Chinese authorities were kept abreast of the secret talks to merge Hongkong and Shanghai Bank with Midland Bank. These contacts emerged yesterday as authorities in the colony sought to play down suggestions that Hongkong Bank was insuring itself against the uncertainty surrounding the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, said in an interview that he had kept the Chinese authorities informed. It was understood that the contact had been at a high level, possibly through Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao affairs in the Beijing government. China, which assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in five years' time, is very sensitive to developments affecting the territory's financial health and business climate. There were fears in Hong Kong that the news could provoke a Chinese verbal onslaught if Beijing saw the merger as a desertion of the colony in the run-up to 1997. The initial indications, however, were that China's communist government would not seriously question the proposed deal. The Chinese embassy in London, though it admitted yesterday it did not have up-to-date information about the proposals, said the discussions between Hongkong Bank and Midland were between two British banks. Hongkong Bank performs some of the functions of a central bank in the colony and its chairman sits on the governor's most important decision-making body, the Executive Council. In 1990, Hongkong Bank defused the impact of the decision to move the domicile of its holding company to London by informing China's premier, Li Peng, in advance. Beijing appeared to give tacit approval, and it has not complained about foreign acquisitions by other big Hong Kong companies. However, China is thought to be upset that some British companies, like Jardine Matheson, have sought to distance themselves from Hong Kong before 1997. China believes these companies are threatening Hong Kong's stability after enjoying the benefits of Britain's colonial rule for many years. Mr Hamish MacLeod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, placed the merger proposals in the context of Hongkong Bank's long-term strategy of internationalisation. He said: 'Hongkong Bank will continue to play its important role within Hong Kong's financial system.'</p>

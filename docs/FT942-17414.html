			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Judgment day for the restorers - A 'new' Michelangelo is unveiled this week Ever since its completion during the papacy of Paul III in 1541, Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment' fresco in the Sistine Chapel has been the subject of criticism. The Pope's Master of Ceremonies, incensed by his cameo role as Minos at the Mouth of Hell, begged the pontiff to destroy it; unseemly baggy shorts were added to tone down the prevailing nudity while El Greco modestly volunteered to paint something better in its stead. Even among Michelangelo's supporters, the fresco, on the altar wall, has not enjoyed the celebrity of Adam, on the Sistine ceiling, or Moses on the Tomb of Julius II. Now, however, as the Pope prepares to celebrate mass on Friday to mark the unveiling of the newly restored 'Last Judgment', the attacks will be directed at a different target. The work of art itself will barely get a look in as every detail of the restoration will be pored over. Voices will be raised in protest against the destruction of a great masterpiece, echoing the clamour that surrounded the unveiling of the ceiling frescos four years ago after a decade of restoration work. Then, the prime objection centred on the claim that Michelangelo had combined true fresco, which is painted on to wet plaster and forms a chemical bond with it, and secco, which is painted after the plaster has dried. Critics argued that the Vatican restoration team had cleaned off the secco and that subtle layers of pigment had been eradicated. For the critics, Friday's unveiling is the last chance for a high-profile lament on the whole issue of restoration. The Sistine Chapel, and above all the ceiling, is so familiar that people commonly feel they have always known what it looked like. It is an old friend. This is particularly true of art historians, many of whom had recorded their descriptions of the frescos as sombre and sooty. Michelangelo had always been presented as no colourist, as a sculptor press-ganged into painting who preferred to work in monochrome. The Ancestors of Christ, depicted in lunette frescos, had been plunged into darkness, it was argued, because they lived before the light of revelation. Suddenly the restoration revealed them bathed in light and dressed in startling acid colours. The new Michelangelo was revealed to be far less the isolated genius than a recognisable child of his time - the pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio and the inspiration of Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, the next generation of Florentine painters. These colours were not unfamiliar: they were all around Michelangelo, but for some reason he was not thought to have used them. Maybe geniuses are not meant to conform to any norms of their age. The truth so conveniently ignored by the non-interventionists is that almost no painting or fresco has escaped tampering in the past. A vote for the status quo is rarely going to preserve the unadulterated patina of centuries. Rather it is often a preference for the unscientific messing about of the past as opposed to the marginally more informed approach of the late 20th century. Today's restorers not only tend to give a truer picture of the original but also frequently wipe away the misdemeanours of their predecessors, who were not above petty censorship or the concealment of signatures. Even the sternest purists have had to accept the necessity of conservation as opposed to restoration: works of art frequently require life-saving operations when they do not need facelifts. In the case of the Sistine Chapel, something had to be done. The glues and resins, used by restorers since the late 16th century to revitalise Michelangelo's ever darkening colours, were deteriorating and in the process detaching colour from the plaster. If nothing had been done, the master's work would simply have crumbled away. The 1980s restoration cleared the frescos of centuries of dust and smoke - from candles, oil lamps and the braziers formerly used for heating - as well as earlier restorers' glues and the blackish overpaintings added in desperate bids to accentuate lighter passages. The difference before and after was astounding. It is hardly surprising that cleaning should have divided opinion so radically. The idea that the work of art one grew up with and learned to love was not all that it seemed is invariably painful. But there is a real possibility that the transformation wrought by restoration can be for the best. In other media similar battles are all but won. The experience of a 'Messiah' played on original instruments and performed on the scale which Handel intended might be enough to set the old Huddersfield Choral Society turning in its grave, but few now would deem it an arid exercise in musical archaeology. The new 'Last Judgment' is bound to spring plenty of surprises, not least Michelangelo's more painterly technique and use of almost Venetian rich colour, but only the most deluded of observers can really believe that there was no room for improvement in its previous appearance. The Vatican team has proceeded with admirable caution, taking - at 14 years - four years longer over the restoration of the frescos than the the master took to paint them.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE BOTTOM LINE IS OFTEN TOP DOLLAR;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY HOMES FETCH SOME HIGH PRICES AT IRS' HIGH-PROFILE AUCTION OF  SEIZED PROPERTIES  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service is enlisting one of the world's oldest desires to  get the most from the properties it seizes from delinquent taxpayers.  </P> <P> It is the desire for a bargain, and the IRS is appealing to it by bundling up  real estate parcels and selling them at high-profile auctions. But bidders  looking for deals often end up paying top dollar.  </P> <P> "When you get a large group of people together, people get excited. Auction  fever is real," IRS auctioneer David Sherrell said before beginning an agency  auction Wednesday in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Property-hungry bidders battled for six homes seized by the IRS for unpaid  taxes. They paid a collective $500,000 for the residences, which included a  triplex at Big Bear Lake and single-family properties in San Juan Capistrano,  Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo and Tustin.  </P> <P> The day before, almost a hundred bidders gathered at the IRS impound lot in  Santa Ana to compete for three cars, including a 1973 Mercedes-Benz 450-SL that  went for $14,000 -- nearly top dollar in the current market.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, a $300,000 home in San Juan Capistrano sold for $212,500 and the  winning bidder said he still faces the cost of evicting the current residents.  </P> <P> Such relatively high prices are what the IRS auctions are all about.  </P> <P> "People come thinking they are going to pay 50 cents on the dollar just like  they used to and they end up paying 90 cents," said Gary Johnson of West Coast  Brokerage in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's auction almost 350 people -- two-thirds of them spectators --  had jammed into the Santa Ana Police Department auditorium by the time Sherrell  started the action at 11 a.m.  </P> <P> A number left after discovering that 12 of the 18 properties advertised for  sale had been pulled from the block because the owners coughed up enough of  their delinquent taxes to persuade the IRS to hold off.  </P> <P> But the bidding among those who stayed was hot. Hundreds of bids were made on  the six properties as more than two dozen IRS officers kept order in the crowd  during the frenetic 90-minute session.  </P> <P> But most of those who filled the room had come to study, not to buy.  </P> <P> "This was the first time I've been to one of these auctions and I'm ready to go  to a few more before I start bidding," said David Bland, an actor from Los  Angeles. "Right now I'm going in blind."  </P> <P> Those who bid and won generally were real estate brokers with experience at  auctions. But even they were caught up in the heat of the bidding.  </P> <P> "How much did I pay?" gasped Dod Bateman as Sherrell closed bidding on a  property and declared him the winner. The Irvine real estate agent made the  high bid and will pay $212,500 for a San Juan Capistrano house he says is worth  $300,000. "Feel my pulse, it's at about 185," he said as the bidding ended.  </P> <P> In recent months, the IRS Laguna Niguel district office, the nation's third  largest, has moved into high-profile marketing of items seized for tax liens.  </P> <P> The agency is peddling goods through newspaper advertisements, sealed-bid sales  and auctions of everything from jewelry to luxury homes.  </P> <P> "It used to be that we only had three or four people show up at an auction, but  now we count them in the hundreds," said Sherrell, an IRS revenue officer for  almost 20 years and, since January, the agency's only full-time auctioneer.  </P> <P> "We're getting 65% to 70% more now for land than we used to, and that means a  better deal for the taxpayer."  </P> <P> The IRS keeps only enough from the sale of a seized property to pay the federal  income taxes that are owed. Anything left over is given to the taxpayer, an IRS  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Prospective buyers are warned that, among other things, the foreclosed-upon  homeowner has the right to buy back the property for six months after the  auction. They also learned that they had to pay at least 20% down -- either  cash or certified check -- immediately after the sale.  </P> <P> The local bidding is part of a national "auction mania" among government  agencies, according to George Chelekis, a Florida-based author who recently  assembled a 700-page listing of auctions called "The Action Guide to Government  Auctions."  </P> <P> Government property holdings have exploded in recent years -- largely because  of drug-related confiscations and tax seizures -- and agencies have shown  increased savvy in peddling it, Chelekis said. Combined, federal agencies hold  more than $400 billion in seized property. The IRS holds liens on more than  800,000 properties, double the number it held in 1980, he said.  </P> <P> Orange County, because of its affluence and a correspondingly high debt level,  accounts for a substantial chunk of the IRS seizures, Chelekis said.  </P> <P> Sherrell said he was trained by two professional auctioneers in Kentucky last  year. So far, he has set up 30 auctions in the five counties covered by the  Laguna Niguel District -- San Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego, Imperial and  Orange.  </P> <P> To boost attendance at the auctions, the Laguna Niguel office has increased its  advertising budget and installed an auction hot line. And after more than 450  people showed up for the first of the IRS' large real estate auctions in Santa  Ana in March, the department put together a seminar for interested buyers.  </P> <P> That class, held last week, drew more than 700 people.  </P> <P> The IRS' next Orange County auctions are scheduled in September and November.  Auctions also will be held next month in Riverside and San Diego counties.  </P></p>

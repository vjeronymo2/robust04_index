			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Russian leftist leader Sergey  Baburin said on Friday that sanctions against Yugoslavia should  be scrapped. Baburin, a rather influential member of the current  and last parliaments, leader of the pro-Communist Russian  National Union, was speaking to reporters after his return from  Sarajevo, Belgrade and serb Krajina.    "It is necessary to boost the efforts of the Russian  Government, parliament and Foreign Ministry to lift the U.N.  sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia and fight for  a halt to Russia's participation in these sanctions", Baburin  said, adding that Russia should become more active with its  humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).    Baburin backed the idea of sending more Russian  peace-keepers  to Sarajevo, but rejected the idea of sending Turkish units to  the conflict zone under the aegis of the United Nations. "There  is a threat of Islamic domination, even of a rebirth of  fundamentalism (in the Balkans)", he noted.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: UK power stations draw Pounds 3bn financing THREE proposals to build gas-fired power stations are due to be finalised by the middle of next month, bringing to as much as Pounds 3bn (Dollars 5.28bn) the total raised to finance such projects in the UK. The power stations, operated independently from the two recently-privatised UK power generators, Powergen and National Power, together amount to one of the biggest project financing programmes undertaken in the UK. The biggest single project to date - the Pounds 700m Barking Power scheme, to build a 1,000MW plant on the banks of the Thames - was completed at the end of last week. It has received facilities of Pounds 200m from the European Investment Bank. It is the first time the bank has backed such a project from the outset rather than becoming involved at a later stage, according to advisers to the transaction. The Barking Power deal brings to six the number of independent gas-fired stations to have been financed in the past 18 months, following the move to privatise the UK electricity supply industry at the end of the 1980s. Three further projects to build stations are in the pipeline: at Medway, Kent; Keadby, Yorkshire; and Derwent, in the Midlands. Each has until April 14 to be completed, the target date set by British Gas six months ago when it agreed supply contracts with the promoters of the projects. On top of these nine stations - total financing for which amounts to nearly Pounds 3bn - Powergen and National Power have themselves started development of gas-fuelled power stations. Unlike the independent projects, these are understood to have been financed as straight corporate loans, with the full backing of the balance sheets of the two power generators. As such, they would have benefited from lower financing costs. In general, project financing currently attracts an extra margin of between 0.5 and 0.75 percentage points above normal corporate lending rates, according to Mr George Wadia, a director of Schroders, the merchant bank which advised on the Barking Power deal. Barking Power itself would pay a margin of 1.15 per cent over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in its construction phase, he said. For banks that have financed the power station deals, the projects have provided an enhanced margin while at the same time giving some degree of protection to the future cashflow of the projects. In each case, one or more of the UK's privatised regional electricity distribution companies has agreed to buy the stations' output at a pre-arranged rate, providing a hedge against future fluctuations in price. In Barking's case, three companies - Southern Electric, Eastern Electricity and London Electricity - have provided 15-year hedging arrangements. At the same time, they have taken a total of 49 per cent of the equity.</p>

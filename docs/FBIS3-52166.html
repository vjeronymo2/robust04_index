			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F> correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen at the Foreign Ministry in  Jerusalem on 30 December--recorded]    [Text] [Rosen] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, senior PLO  officials, Yasir 'Arafat, and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh are claiming  that an agreement was never reached at all. What is going on  here?    [Peres] I must note that the two men you mentioned did not  participate in the negotiations. However, Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas], who was appointed head of the delegation by Yasir  'Arafat, appeared publicly with me to declare that both  delegations had reached agreement.    [Rosen] When you arrived back in Israel last night, were you  convinced that an agreement with the PLO had been reached? Were  you surprised by the reactions and by what happened today?    [Peres] Not completely. The agreement is between the two  delegations. I knew it had to be approved by the PLO  leadership. I realized that there could be dissenting views  within the PLO leadership so I was not totally surprised.    [Rosen] Did the statements made in Cairo yesterday, and the  remarks made by Abu-Mazin lead you to understand that the PLO  team was satisfied with the budding agreement?    [Peres] I believe the delegation felt, just as we did, that  we had met each other half way after starting off from very  disparate positions. I imagine that they felt that this was the  most they could attain. I must say that most of the delegation,  including Abu-Mazin, understand that we cannot stray far from  the Declaration of Principles. It is impossible to constantly  renew negotiations over the negotiations. Therefore, my  assessment is that despite the various statements that have been  made, the situation has not changed in any fundamental way.    [Rosen] What is the state of things now? What are we  actually waiting for?    [Peres] The current situation is that the Taba committee can  resume its work, and we are waiting for an official and formal  notice from the PLO leadership regarding the joint communique  reached yesterday.    [Rosen] You usually avoid using the term crisis. But have  we not actually reached a crisis with the PLO? The PLO is not  sticking to the agreements.    [Peres] Look, that is the partner we have. The PLO is the  only partner we have to negotiate with, and we shall continue to  do this. This is the kind of thing that is neither final, nor a  total crisis. This is part of the negotiations process.    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at  1800 GMT on 30 December reports that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin is waiting for an official statement from the PLO  regarding the Cairo draft agreement before making any public  reaction. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that  Jerusalem is displeased with reports that Yasir 'Arafat has  rejected the draft." Israel Television goes on to note that  "Egyptian officials told our correspondent this evening that  President Mubarak was disappointed with 'Arafat's attitude and  has therefore decided to reduce the level of Egyptian  involvement in mediation efforts between the PLO and Israel.  Mubarak has therefore decided not to send Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa to Israel for talks on this matter."]</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Judge rules out claim by Mirror A judge has ruled that one of the late Robert Maxwell's companies had no right to a claim against the New York Daily News, the tabloid newspaper owned by Maxwell when he died, Reuter reports from New York. The ruling, made on Tuesday and released yesterday, settled the final dispute in the newspaper's bankruptcy that came shortly after Maxwell died in November 1991. Mirror Group Newspapers claimed the paper stole Dollars 92m (Pounds 63m) from the group, saying Maxwell and his son, Kevin, took the money to run the Daily News. The US bankruptcy judge denied the Mirror claim, saying the Maxwells lied to the tabloid's directors and their actions hurt the Daily News as well as the Mirror Group. The judge said the father and son engaged in an 'elaborate ruse', concealing the source of money to the newspaper and planned to strip the tabloid of even more money at a time when its ability to publish was in jeopardy.</p>

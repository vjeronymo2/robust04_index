			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aberfoyle placed in administration Aberfoyle Holdings, the agriculture and security products group whose shares were suspended earlier this month at 2 1/2 p, has been placed in administration. The company, with most of its operations in Zimbabwe, asked for the administration order 11 days ago saying its financial position had 'deteriorated to the point where it had insufficient sterling funds to enable it to continue to trade.' Touche Ross have been appointed as administrators. A group of dissident shareholders won control of the board last November promising to restructure the company. Mr Kojo Owusu-Nyantkyi, one of the dissidents and now a member of the board, and his private company, Crescent Africa, hold a 26 per cent stake in Aberfoyle. He said yesterday that he had a rescue plan of his own and suggested the company should be operating out of Zimbabwe. 'We are developing our own plans. I still believe the company has potential but it has been botched up by successive managements. It hasn't been developed properly from its base in Africa,' he said.</p>

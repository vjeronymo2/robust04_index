			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 10 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina arrived in this city today in continuation of his tour  of South America. He said, just as he did during his previous  travels to other regions, he has encountered understanding and  respect throughout this trip, which is what Cuba expected.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said the  objective of his trek is to communicate with the Latin American  community, of which Cuba is a member despite those who have  tried to tear her away from it.    After describing some of his previous tours to Africa, Asia,  and the Caribbean, he said Cuba, by no means, is dragging its  woes around the world, as some have said; on the contrary, Cuba  has many things to offer, as a result of her progress in the  fields of science, technology, education, tourism, and others.  There are many other nations interested in these achievements,  which pave the way for integration and trade.    Regarding Cuba's efforts to resolve its current problems,  Robaina spotlighted the opening of new areas to foreign  investment, in which Cuba has the raw materials but lacks the  capital, the technology, and the markets.    When asked about the importance of the scheduled "The Nation  and the Emigre Community" conference, to be held in Havana, he  said this is just another event that has no bearing on the  country's survival, because that is related more to the people's  efforts to resist and to their unyielding determination.    The meeting is directed more at promoting relations with the  emigre community, he said. He refused to comment on the  hysteria the meeting has triggered among extreme right-wing  sectors, as this hostile activity only confirms how appropriate  the meeting is.    Regarding the minuscule groups promoting such activity, he  said simply one can only tell the truth about Cuba through the  difficulties and needs, and those who have profited from these  needs do not even deserve acknowledgement.    His first event in Peru, where he arrived after visiting  Uruguay and after a short stop in Buenos Aires, was a meeting  with almost 100 Cuban physicians, sugar industry technicians,  and sports trainers working in Peru. He updated them on the  current situation in Cuba, the efforts to overcome the problems,  and the need to represent and defend the nation with strong and  credible arguments.    He told PRENSA LATINA that while he was in Argentina he  stressed the fact that each Cuban represents the island. He  took advantage of the stopover in Buenos Aires to meet Cuban  troubadour Silvio Rodriguez, who is touring the Argentine  capital. Robaina said singing to the Argentines is another form  of foreign policy, because Rodriguez is telling everyone about  the Cuban situation through his songs.    The Peruvian newspaper LA REPUBLICA, in an interview with  Cuban physician Dr. Milvio Ramirez, highlighted the importance  of Cuba's activities of cooperation. Ramirez is a heart surgeon  who has performed more than 100 operations in the northern city  of Chiclayo, 780 km from Lima.</p>

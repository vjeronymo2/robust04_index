			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Blockbuster diversifies into music BLOCKBUSTER, the expan-sion-minded US video rental chain which owns the Cityvision group in the UK, yesterday combined news of a move into the music retailing business via a Dollars 185m purchase of two store chains with a third-quarter profits increase of 50.9 per cent after-tax. Blockbuster, based in Florida, said it was buying the Sound Warehouse and Music Plus retail operations from companies controlled by Shamrock Holdings of California. Shamrock is the acquisitive investment firm controlled by Mr Roy E. Disney, one of the Walt Disney descendants. The two chains take in 236 stores and are described as being 'amongst the largest specialty retailers of prerecorded music in the US'. The purchase is being made through a mixture of cash and shares, and Blockbuster said yesterday that it anticipated issuing around 5m new shares to fund the deal. Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's chairman, claimed the relatively large size of the stores being acquired would allow Blockbuster to add 'complementary entertainment products' - a first step in developing 'our entertainment store of the future'. On the profits front, Blockbuster said that third-quarter earnings after tax were Dollars 41.3m, compared with Dollars 27.4m a year earlier. Sales were 24 per cent higher overall at Dollars 283.7m, and earnings per share increased from 39 cents to 50 cents. Some of the growth reflects Blockbuster's heady expansion, and sales on a same-store basis increased more modestly. Blockbuster stripped out the Summer Olympics and political convention periods - when, presumably, video usage was disrupted - and said that underlying same-store revenues rose by 7 per cent, year-on-year, in the third quarter. Cox Enterprises, the Atlanta-based media group which is underwriting the Pounds 36m investment costs of UK Gold, the new satellite television channel, is looking at the possibility of a wide range of investments in Britain, writes Raymond Snoddy. Cox, with turnover of Dollars 2.23bn last year, is making the UK its first base in plans for European expansion. The company says it is looking at cable television ventures in the UK and considering other media investments.</p>

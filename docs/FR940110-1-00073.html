			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monitoring of District Bank priority or priorities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(g) of the proposed rule sets forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for monitoring compliance with the District Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority or priorities established pursuant to proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.10(d)(4). Section 960.14(g)(1) of the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that if an applicant in its AHP application commits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund a project that meets a District Bank priority or priorities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank or its designee shall monitor the project to verify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it continues to meet the priority or priorities. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.14(g)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in its AHP implementation plan the nature, frequency and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration for monitoring compliance with the District Bank priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monitoring of economic mobility priority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(h) of the proposed rule sets forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for monitoring compliance with the economic mobility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> priority set forth under &sect;960.5(d)(5) of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(h) provides that if an applicant in its AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application commits to fund a project that meets the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;960.5(d)(5), the Bank or its designee shall obtain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification from the sponsor or the owner upon completion and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full occupancy of the project, as required under &sect;960.15(c)(4),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the sponsor or the owner has met such requirements, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.15 of the proposed rule sets forth the reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the Banks, the applicants, and the sponsors or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners of AHP-assisted projects. Section 960.15(a) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule provides that each Bank shall provide accurate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely reports and documentation to, and in the format requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by, the Board concerning the Bank's AHP, as the Board may from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time to time require. See 12 CFR 960.6(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.15(b)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall require an applicant receiving a subsidized advance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidy to report at least annually to the Bank on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner in which it has used the funds, with such reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing until the funds have been fully disbursed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant. See 12 CFR 960.6(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule eliminates the requirement in the Board's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing AHP regulation that the applicant certify that the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy has been passed through to the borrower and continues to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used for approved purposes because, as discussed previously in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the section on monitoring requirements, under the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants are not required to monitor the use of a subsidy in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted projects, except during the period when a subsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance or direct subsidy is used to finance construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation of a project or where the applicant has agreed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake monitoring. See 12 CFR 960.6(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.15(b)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that if subsidized advances or direct subsidies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to finance construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project, the Bank shall require the applicant to report to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank at reasonable intervals determined by the Bank, and described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, on the progress of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or rehabilitation, until completion. This reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement coincides with the requirement in &sect;960.14(d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule that the Bank shall require the applicant to monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the construction or rehabilitation of an AHP-assisted project and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make progress reports to the Bank where AHP subsidized advances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct subsidies are used to finance such construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Sponsor and Owner Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.15(c) of the proposed rule sets forth the reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for sponsors and owners. These requirements coincide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the monitoring requirements set forth in &sect;960.14(e) through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) of the proposed rule. Section 960.15(c)(1)(i) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides that where a subsidized advance or direct subsidy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to finance the purchase of an owner-occupied housing unit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household enters into a purchase contract for such unit or at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing on the financing for such unit that the unit has been sold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a household with an income at or below the level committed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the AHP application. Where a subsidized advance or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy is used to finance the rehabilitation of an owner-occupied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing unit, the Bank shall require the sponsor to certify at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time a loan or grant is committed to fund such rehabilitation that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household that owns and occupies the unit has an income at or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the level committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP is not subject to a deed restriction or other legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of ownership to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household with an income at or below the level committed to in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP application, the Bank shall require the sponsor to report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank or its designee, at least annually for the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term period, the number of any such units that are sold to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households whose incomes exceed the level committed to in the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, and to certify to the Bank that it is continuing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy its commitment pursuant to its legally binding agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.15(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank shall require the sponsor or the owner to certify upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing project, but no later than one year after initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disbursement of the subsidized advance or direct subsidy, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually thereafter, that the project's units, or portion thereof,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below the levels committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.15(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a project that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will provide housing units for persons with a special need, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will provide a continuing special service to occupants pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.10(d)(3) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor or the owner to certify upon completion and full occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the project that the project's units, or portion thereof, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by persons with such special needs or that a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service is being provided to occupants, as committed to in the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.15(c)(4) of the proposed rule provides that if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that meets the requirements of the economic mobility priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;960.10(d)(5) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sponsor or the owner to certify upon completion and full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy of the project that the sponsor or owner has met such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, as committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

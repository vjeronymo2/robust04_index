This action requires inspecting the flap system for cables with broken wires or pulleys with worn cable clips, replacing any damaged parts, and replacing the master pulley and cable with new parts of improved design. Reports of cable fatigue, particularly the master pulley cable, on several of the affected airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent flap system failure caused by cable fatigue, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective April 15, 1994.

This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Mike Pasion, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2594; facsimile (206) 227&hyph;1181.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Twin Commander 500, 520, 560, 680, 681, 685, 690, 695, and 720 series airplanes was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 19, 1993 (58 FR 38540). The action proposed to require inspecting the flap system for cables with broken wires and pulleys with worn clips, replacing any damaged parts, and replacing the master pulley with a new part of improved design. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander Service Bulletin No. 210, dated February 1, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, supports the proposed rule, and recommends wording the proposed AD to more closely coincide with Service Bulletin 210, dated February 1, 1991. The FAA concurs and has reworded the proposal accordingly. This change does not add any additional burden upon U.S. owners/operators of the affected airplanes than was originally proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other commenter states that a parts availability problem may occur if owners/operators of the affected airplanes find as many damaged pulleys in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cable system as this owner/operator did on a Model 690B airplane. This commenter feels that there is not sufficient parts inventory to coincide with the 50-hour time-in-service (TIS) compliance time, and recommends changing the compliance time to 12 months. The FAA does not concur. Twin Commander has assured the FAA that there will be adequate parts available for all required repairs. In addition, if a temporary delay in parts availability should occur, then an owner/operator could request an extension of the compliance time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through instructions specified in paragraph (d) of the proposed AD. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the wording changes referenced above and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 1,860 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 25 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,673,500. This figure is based upon the assumption that none of the affected airplane operators have accomplished the required actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Task force looks to the private sector: How restoration plans for Los Angeles offer a national model REBUILD Los Angeles, the task force created by Mayor Tom Bradley to take charge of efforts to restore the riot-ravaged sections of the city, has set its sights on creating a model for urban renewal throughout the US. To be headed by Mr Peter Ueberroth, whose ties to Los Angeles stem from his role as chairman of the 1984 Olympics organising committee, the task force aims to revitalise the economically depressed parts of the city that suffered most of last week's destruction. Private-sector investment will be the key focus of the group. State and local government funding is limited. California is already facing a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5bn) budget deficit that can only be worsened by the problems in Los Angeles, while the city is in the red to the tune of more than Dollars 800m. 'We will be out soliciting and wrenching out commitments from the private sector,' says Mr Barry Sanders, a prominent international business lawyer and counsel to the 'extra-governmental' non-profit group and a member of Rebuild LA. The task force will seek support from a wide range of businesses with established ties to Los Angeles, including foreign as well as US companies. 'We intend to reach out to the people who have investments in this community, or who ought to have, and that will include the British and the Japanese,' says Mr Sanders. 'There are Japanese car plants in southern California, for example. We want those companies to consider locating their next plant in Los Angeles. We will try to get tax breaks and low-interest loans for large and small businesses. We want them to go into this with a profit motive but at the same time train and employ people from this community.' But that will take time. 'By next week there are going to be people asking 'why hasn't this group done anything yet',' Mr Sanders predicts. Therefore, the initial thrust of the task force will be to have a visible impact on the hardest hit areas; to move ahead with demolition and clean up. Already there are tentative plans involving a landscaping industry group that has offered to plant grass and trees and install irrigation on demolition sites. Although such parks might be only temporary, at least they would improve the outlook of burnt-out neighbourhoods and, as Mr Sanders puts it, 'show that something is being done'. Longer-term efforts to attract investment to the area may prove difficult. 'The riots have dealt a serious blow to Los Angeles' image,' says Mr Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation. 'Foreign investors are hesitant. They are reconsidering the risks' in light of last week's events. Even US companies may 'sit back and assess whether they want to pump money into an area already besieged by problems of riots and earthquakes,' Mr Kyser adds. The more immediate problem may be to stem the outflow of businesses leaving the area, Mr Kyser suggests. In the past 18 months California lost half a million jobs, according to a report issued last month by the Council on California Competitiveness, chaired by Mr Ueberroth. Others are more optimistic. 'Los Angeles is still a huge market that will continue to attract investment,' argues Ms Mary Tuten, president of the Los Angeles World Trade Centre. 'Some businesses will leave, but some will view this as a tremendous new opportunity,' she predicts. 'In the long term you will see major reconstruction.' History would suggest otherwise. The Watts district of Los Angeles, the site of race riots in the 1960s, has never recovered despite reconstruction programmes. 'But they were driven by government spending and it did not work for business reasons. This is going to be different, this community is going to rebuild itself,' Ms Tuten maintains. Rebuild LA, however, has also yet to win the trust of key segments of the community. Black leaders, in particular, have voiced concerns that the task force may not provide opportunities for their people. 'Whatever we do, it must be done with the full involvement of all segments of the community,' Mr Sanders responds. 'This cannot be a bunch of downtown businessmen imposing their ideas on the community,' he stresses. People from all segments of the community will be invited to join the governing board of the task force. 'They have been at sword point with one another, but this is a chance for them to start over, to work together, if anything good is to come out of all of this.' Raising hopes are the commitments of Bank of America and smaller local banks to offer preferential loan terms to people affected by the riot. And other offers are 'flooding in' to Rebuild LA, says Mr Sanders. 'We have to capture this rush of enthusiasm and hope.'</p>

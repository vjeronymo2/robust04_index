			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 21, RIA-BNS -- "I don't believe U.S.  President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to Riga is likely to  speed up the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia,"  Estonian President Lennart Meri said in an interview with the  Russian RIA news agency.    In the president's opinion, the Russian leadership has long  ago adopted a political decision in this question. "It would be  incorrect on my part to consider President Clinton's visit to  Riga as putting pressure on the world power called the Russian  Federation," Meri emphasized.    Clinton is going to pay July 6 a six-hour visit to the  Latvian capital, Riga, during which he is scheduled to meet with  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and his Estonian and Lithuanian  counterparts, Meri and Algirdas Brazauskas.    Estonian Ambassador to the United States Toomas Hendrik  Ilves  told BNS Clinton had first mentioned his wish to visit the  Baltic states last September when he met with the three Baltic  presidents in New York.    White House officials unfortunately dropped Estonia from  Clinton's schedule after familiarizing themselves with the  blueprints of the Tallinn Airport: the airfield didn't have a  runway long enough to receive Air Force One.</p>

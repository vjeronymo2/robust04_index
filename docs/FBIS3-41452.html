			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An official from Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry has  denied writer Ales Adamovich's statement that a quantity of  plutonium had been dumped into one of the Siberian lakes.    Vladislav Kotlov, a senior official at the Atomic Energy  Ministry's press service, told Interfax that the statement of  Adamovich, who said on Thursday that about a ton of plutonium  was buried in a lake in Tomsk Region about 20 years ago, was  absurd because a ton of that material costs billions of dollars.    Besides, Kotlov said, the Siberian Chemical Plant, situated  in Tomsk Region, had been burying all its radioactive waste  underground, though in an area with subsoil waters. This was  confirmed by the Atomic Energy Ministry's press service, which  said the buried waste had a total radioactivity of one billion  curies.    Kotlov said laws were due to come out shortly banning the  burial of radioactive waste underground in areas with subsoil  waters. ``There are no guarantees that there will be no  earthquakes in areas where burial sites are located, which may  lead to the spread of radioactive substances,'' he said.    There are also underground burial sites near Krasnoyarsk  (Siberia) and Dimitrovgrad (Ulyanovsk Region), Kotlov said.    Sources in the Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources, Gosatomnadzor (the State Nuclear  Inspectorate) and the Tomsk Regional Environmental Committee  told Interfax those bodies had no data to confirm the  information of Adamovich, who said he had documents to prove his  statement.</p>

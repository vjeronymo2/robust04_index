			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bank cleans up from gold lending The Bank of England is profiting greatly from the upsurge in gold bullion lending, according to a study published today. London is the dominant market for gold lending and for metal to be of practical value to dealers it has to be located there. So those central banks which are providing most of the bullion for lending have been moving gold to the Bank of England for safe keeping. For this it makes a charge. This trend has seen more than 500 tonnes of gold previously held by the US Federal Reserve Bank in New York on behalf of other central banks moved to London in the past few years, says Mr Ian Cox, author of the paper published by the World Gold Council, a promotional body financed by gold mining companies. He suggests that the bullion lending market has trebled in the last ten years to about 2,000 tonnes, equivalent to one year's supply from all the world's gold mines. About 75 per cent of this is lent by between 45 and 50 central banks and other official monetary institutions. And they do it for the money. Their net annual earnings from lending gold - which not long ago was a non-earning asset - is between USDollars 100m and Dollars 140m. Most of the gold is borrowed by miners to support hedging operations and to finance exploration and extraction activities. All hedging operations need the support of borrowed gold. Mr Cox says the explosive growth in gold lending seen in the 1980s is unlikely to be repeated but demand will continue to increase for the next five to seven years. However, development might be slowed because several financial institutions have withdrawn from gold trading, reducing the number of counterparties likely to be regarded by central banks as acceptable.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Central Europe is plugged in to power trade - The linking of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland to west's electricity grid NEW possibilities for trade in electric power have been opened up by an agreement signed recently to link Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland with the west European electricity grid. The three central-east European (CE3) countries committed themselves at a meeting in Prague to higher standards of power transmission in exchange for admission to the west European electricity club by 1998. The CE3 will withdraw from the east European system, set up a central European electricity 'island' insulated from the weak and fluctuating supply from power stations further east and prepare to integrate with western Europe. Turning toward the west will cost about Dollars 500m, according to Mr Walter Fremuth, vice-president of the Union for the Co-ordination of Production and Transmission of Electricity, the western electricity grouping, which announced the Prague accord. Mr Fremuth, who also heads Osterreichische Elektrizitatswirtschaftsverbund, Austria's electricity utility, will host a meeting in Vienna soon to flesh out a financing programme. The CE3 countries will need to smooth out fluctuations in their own current frequency before they can be fully integrated. Western utilities expect that it will be 1998 before they can be connected without causing fluctuations as far away as Paris or Lisbon. But western electricity utilities are not waiting until 1998 to bring the CE3 into their camp. Germany and Austria are already building special convertor stations to smooth frequencies and facilitate transfers. Austria recently commissioned a Sch1bn (Pounds 58m) convertor at Vienna Southeast connected by a high-voltage power line to Gyor in Hungary. That complements Austria's existing facility at Durnrohr near the Czechoslovak border. Another plant for connecting Czechoslovakia is undergoing trials at Etzenricht in Germany. Conversion equipment could be moved eastwards along with the border of the west European grid when the CE3 join, according to Mr Fremuth. That would allow central-eastern Europe countries to retain electricity links with Soviet successor states even as they abandoned their common system. The CE3 at first pushed for integration of their electricity distribution systems with western Europe to increase their diversity of supply and reduce dependence on erratic deliveries from the former Soviet republics. That motivation, which has dimmed a little as falling industrial production has reduced electricity consumption, will strengthen again when the region's economy rebounds. The option of taking supplies from western Europe, even if never exercised, improves their bargaining position with Russia. 'Maybe the connection will never be used,' says Mr Tamas Jaszay, a senior energy official at the Hungarian industry ministry. 'But it makes it easier to push down the price in negotiations.' In the meantime the convertor stations will allow the CE3 utilities to export their temporary electricity surpluses to the west to earn hard currency. For their part, west European utilities foresee a need for electricity imports from their eastern counterparts because public environmental concerns are restricting their ability to expand capacity to keep up with demand. Austria, for one, became a net importer for the first time in 1991 because the public opposed new hydro and nuclear power stations.</p>

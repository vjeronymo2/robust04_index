			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: The Church and its finances Sir, I refer to your article, 'Unholy saga of the church's missing millions' (July 11). My wife and I are members of the Saint Margaret's parish church in Horsforth. We think the Archbishop of Canterbury should set up a commission to inquire into this disaster. In particular, this commission should do the following: Inquire into the reasons for this loss; Devise procedures to prevent the occurrence of a similar loss in the future. Alan Holme, 16 Hunger Hills Avenue, Horsforth, Leeds LS18 5JT</p>

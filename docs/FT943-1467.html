			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close firmer after an uncertain session - Market Report A choppy and uneasy session on the UK stock market yesterday saw shares close firmly in subdued trading volume. With global markets uncertain in their response to comments from the president of the Bundesbank and from the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the UK market turned its attention to domestic market factors. Rumours originated in the foreign exchange markets that overseas clients of one of the premier London discount houses had taken substantial positions at FT-SE 3,000 in stock index futures. These were said to be covered by stop-loss orders which would trigger instant selling of the December future if the Index touched that level. At mid-afternoon, a sudden dip in the German bond market sent the Footsie down to 3,008.6 and, with the December contract on the Footsie just below this level, nerves were stretched to the uttermost. But the market turned higher as Wall Street came in with a Dow gain of 6 points, and the moment of danger passed. But the market remained very nervous. not least because one of the big London names was said to have turned bearish on domestic interest rates and was predicting base rates of 10 per cent by end 1995. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Share Index stood at 3,021.2 for a net gain of 6.4. There was little sign of any change of view although a good performance in late trading in the stock index futures market raised spirits ahead of the opening of the markets this morning. Earlier, the stock market moved erratically, gaining more than 12 points on the Footsie as bond markets steadied behind favourable comments on German inflation prospects from Mr Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank. Trading volumes were unimpressive, however, and firmness in UK government bonds bore out suggestions from some analysts that investment funds, especially those from continental Europe, are switching from UK equities to gilts. The market remained prey to company results and a generally more cautious reading of boardroom trading statements underlined belief that City analysts are beginning to moderate their highly positive views on the outlook for corporate earnings. This could threaten the outlook for UK quities in the final quarter of this year. Higher first half profits and a higher dividend payout from Guinness did not save the shares from analysts' concern over references to price competition, which has become the touchstone for the food and consumer sector. However, British Aerospace rallied well from the setback of the previous day as some analysts took a more favourable view of the half time trading report, counter-balancing downgrades by two leading UK securities houses on the previous day. And there was a strong response to a highly successful first-half performance from RMC, which drew attention to the strength of recovery in the UK and in Germany. Much of the afternoon was passed waiting for reports from the appearance before the US Senate Banking Committee of Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. But the firm opening on the New York stock market left London to wait for news overnight. The second line issues were somewhat neglected and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index drifted off by a further 8 points to close at 3,562.1 as the smaller investors stayed away, waiting for the clouds over the blue chip market to clear. Seaq volume of 546.3m shares compared with 594.8m in the previous session. On Wednesday, retail or genuine customer business in UK equities, remained satisfactorily high, from the viewpoint of the London securities industry, and returned a value total of Pounds 1.36bn.</p>

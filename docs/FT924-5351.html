			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major gives cool response to France's threats MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, made a cool response in the Commons yesterday to France's threats to veto the draft farm deal reached by the European Community and the US, Ivor Owen writes. He predicted a change in the French attitude when account had been taken of the benefits to be derived outside the agriculture sector from the completion of the current round of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva. Mr Major said he was sure that an examination of every aspect of the Gatt deal would lead to a realisation that 'liberalisation of trade, services and manufactures is a very valuable prize for the French economy as well as for the economies of every other industrial nation in the world'. The prime minister emphasised that with a trade war averted and a single market of 340m people on their doorstep, British businesses had better opportunities than they had known for some time. They had the benefit of low inflation, the lowest interest rates in the EC and an extremely competitive exchange rate. Anxiety about France's attitude was expressed by Mr Gary Waller (C Keighley) who warned that if the Gatt liberalisation were to be jeopardised it would be against the interests of Britain and all the other members of the EC, as well being against the interests of international trade generally. He called on all the EC states to agree the Gatt deal with 'one voice'. Mr Major described the the farm deal agreed with the the US as being good for the entire EC and for the entire world trading community. It was desirable that it should be agreed by all member states as speedily as possible. The prime minister underlined the success of the UK in attracting inward investment and assured MPs: 'I intend to keep it that way'. He identified low inflation, low taxation and the absence of any involvement in the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty as key factors.</p>

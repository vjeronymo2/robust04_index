			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker report: "Bonn Plans To Reduce </F> Compulsory Military Service to 10 Months"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- The FRG Defense Ministry is planning  new, basic changes in the size and structure of the Bundeswehr  and also the duration of military service. Framework conditions  are currently being worked out.    Even though the Federal Government wants to avoid committing  itself to exact figures at the moment, according to information  obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, a reduction of the "present  strength" has already been decided: The overall strength of the  German armed forces of 370,000 men, which was set down by the  two-plus-four treaty, is to be reduced to 320,000 to 340,000  soldiers during the second half of the 1990's. At the same  time, compulsory military service is to be reduced from 12 to 10  months.    These targets are to be examined as part of the  "conceptional  guidelines" -- that is, the future structural and framework data  -- for the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian  Democratic Union [CDU], wants to present these guidelines to the  public at the end of April.    With these guidelines, the Defense Ministry wants to react  to  the drastically reduced defense budget and, at the same time,  take into account that -- according to internal calculations by  the Ministry -- as of 1996 there will be a deficit of 30,000 to  40,000 men eligible for military service for maintaining the  intended Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men. In addition, the  reductions are to bring about savings, with which the investment  share in the defense budget, which has been considerably reduced  over recent years, can be increased once again.    According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG,  Defense  Minister Ruehe plans to explain the details at a meeting behind  closed doors of the Defense Working Group of the CDU/Christian  Social Union Bundestag Group in Siegen on 24-25 April. One day  later defense politicians of the coalition partner, the Free  Democratic Party of Germany, are to be briefed on the matter.  The official presentation of the "conceptional guidelines" in  the Bundestag is planned for 28 April. It is still unclear  whether this will be done in the form of a government statement  with the participation of the chancellor or, for the time being,  as a briefing of the Bundestag Defense Committee.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Stefan Koskinen report: "Less Smuggling in the EU"] </F>   [Text] It will not only be possible to keep drug smuggling  to Sweden at the same level. Drug smuggling will actually  decrease if Sweden joins the EU [European Union]. So said  European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel (Moderate Coalition  Party), quite contrary to all the fears expressed in the past  about increased drug smuggling.    Yesterday Social Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg (Liberal  Party), Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik (Moderate Coalition  Party), and Ulf Dinkelspiel made public the government's program  for combating drugs in the event of EU membership.    "The aim is not to compensate for the removal of border  controls and achieve the same results as today; the aim is to be  better," Ulf Dinkelspiel said.    This will happen through increased cooperation and an  improved exchange of information among the policemen of the EU,  and through the increased scope to exert pressure on countries  like the Netherlands. In addition, the customs service will be  given more resources for investigation and spot checks, since EU  membership means that the customs service will not have to carry  out checks on trade between Sweden and the EU.    "Membership will free up major resources in the customs  service. That is why the government is taking the initiative  for an overhaul of the customs service to produce better  coordination with the police and the coast guard in the field of  combating drugs," Gun Hellsvik said.    Ulf Dinkelspiel also stressed that it is only a small part  of  the narcotics that are confiscated that get caught in the  customs filter [sentence as published].    "Nor do we want to tie our hand but want to try new methods.  The British, for example, have introduced narcotics surveillance  on their ferries with some success and this is perhaps worth  trying."    The increased international cooperation will take place  within the European criminal police bureau, Europol, which is  currently being set up. Europol will be a center for criminal  intelligence services.    "Europol will chiefly concentrate on narcotics and we can be  involved if we are not members of the EU," Gun Hellsvik said.    The ministers also declared that Sweden's restrictive  narcotics policy would remain in place in the event of  membership of the EU. Bengt Westerberg stressed that Sweden's  narcotics policy has been a success when compared with the rest  of Europe.    Bengt Westerberg also commented on the tendencies toward  liberalization that exist in a number of European cities with  regard to cannabis.    "This trend has no support at government level. Not even in  the Netherlands where people are becoming wary and are  tightening up their view of hash," Bengt Westerberg said.</p>

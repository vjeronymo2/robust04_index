The presidents of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan are expected to hold a meeting  there on January 11. This meeting will continue the work  started in Kyzyl-Orda last March when the leaders of the five  countries agreed on joint action to rescue the Aral Sea and help  the coastal areas.    The coordination committee of the Central Asian countries  has  drafted numerous documents for this meeting, notably guidelines  on the interstate council and its executive committee and a  concept of ways to revive the Aral Sea.    Informed sources close to the Uzbek government told Interfax  that the leaders of the Central Asian republics would discuss  numerous economic problems in introduction of national  currencies when they meet in Nukus. Cooperation in the  ecological or any other sphere is impossible unless these  problems are resolved, the sources believe.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / UK has to look ahead: Forward thinking over the EU could prevent long-term damage After their inevitable defeat over the European Union budget, Eurosceptics in the UK Conservative party have decided to turn their attention to the mega-European conference looming in 1996. That is the first good news from that quarter in many a moon. This is not a joke. All can see that the 1996 inter-governmental conference will be a large and contentious affair. Not everyone yet sees that the agenda now being piled up ahead of the conference is liable to raise the stakes over the future of Europe far higher than anything conceived of in the parochial anxieties of the UK Eurosceptics. So high, that there are real dangers it could go badly wrong, with long-term damaging consequences, and not just for Britain. What is needed to contain these dangers is an effort at a public debate that will mobilise some serious forward thinking. Until now, this has been virtually impossible in Britain: partly because John Major's government is hamstrung by scandals, sleaze and its own weaknesses; partly because it is mercilessly harried by the Eurosceptics on its right. If the Eurosceptics now concentrate on 1996, perhaps the government will have the room to map out a coherent strategic position before the conference. The dangers ahead cannot be wholly exorcised by forethought, but perhaps they can be contained. One potential danger is of being taken by tactical surprise. Since the pound was blown out of the exchange rate mechanism two years ago, John Major has taken refuge in a posture of denial: economic and monetary union will probably never happen, he says, and certainly not according to the Maastricht timetable. In fact, monetary union is once more not merely a possibility, but may be feasible within the original calendar. It is conceivable that an an inner group of countries could decide to go ahead with monetary union in 1996, in the midst of the inter-governmental conference. Britain has an opt-out, but the government would be uncomfortable if it had to use it, knowing that it is not in the UK's long-term interests to be outside the European currency. The more serious danger is that of strategic surprise. This would be a logical consequence of Euroscepticism, which prefers to reduce Britain's European dilemma to an ultra-simple antagonism of 'us' against 'them': 'they' want to create a super-state, but 'we' want to preserve the House of Commons - that sort of thing. The issues in 1996, will be quite different. The European Union was originally created for political and strategic reasons: to stabilise the western half of the continent. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, these political and strategic raisons d'etre have been reasserting themselves as never before, not least over what to do about eastern Europe. In principle, the European Union is committed to give membership to up to 10 countries from eastern and central Europe, just as soon as they can meet the political and economic conditions. They have given this commitment, because Germany has decided - and the other member states have accepted, with varying degrees of enthusiasm - that this is a vital political and strategic interest of the Union. There is just one problem: it is not obvious that such a large-scale expansion can, in practice, be negotiated on any terms that would be acceptable to the existing member states. The admission of so many new states that are relatively backward economically will require radical reforms in - perhaps even the abandonment of - existing redistribution policies, such as the farm policy or the regional fund, because the cost will be too great. Undoubtedly, the poorer of the existing member states will try to hang on to their budgetary benefits from these policies; but if they try too hard, they may prevent expansion into eastern Europe. The dilemma for Britain is that such a large expansion would also require a radical strengthening of the Union's central institutions, starting with more and easier majority voting. This UK government is opposed to such political moves towards a quasi-federal Europe. On the other hand, it will want to increase its overall voting weight in the Council of Ministers at the expense of the small countries, which enjoy a large voting premium. Bringing in the eastern European countries will be an immensely complex problem that will pit the interests of the north against the south, the east against the west, and the large against the small. It would be a terrible error if Britain, with its pretensions to strategic importance, were to give some petty fixation on majority voting a higher importance than the larger geopolitical context. The Eurosceptics, and even the government, sometimes give the impression they welcome expansion into eastern Europe, in the belief that this would help convert the European Union into what it ought to have been all along: a simple free-trade area. Such a view is only possible for those who totally discount what has been happening in Russian and US foreign policy. Both are quite difficult to predict, because increasingly erratic; but Moscow is obviously giving a lower priority to co-operation with the west than before, and the US is giving a lower priority to the Atlantic alliance. The implication is that it would be very dangerous for Europe to disintegrate into nothing more than a free-trade area. The Eurosceptics and the UK government both need to come to terms with the fact that the outside world has changed, and with it the argument about Europe. If they both spend the next 12 months thinking ahead, and planning a strategy, perhaps the worst will be avoided. It's not likely, of course; but it must surely be our best hope.</p>

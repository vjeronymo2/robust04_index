			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Signs of an upturn 'have fizzled out' THE GLOOM of recession has failed to lift after the general election, according to two surveys published today. The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey shows that high street sales last month were below those of June last year, while the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry reports falling output in the second quarter of this year. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said that a small boost to sales in shops and stores in the two months after the election 'now seems to have fizzled out'. The London chamber said that indications in its survey for the first quarter that the recession might have been coming to an end 'appear to have been premature'. Retailers covered by the CBI survey reported sales last month slightly below the level of a year earlier - by a balance of minus 3 per cent - the first decline since March. After three successive months in which the survey showed that 'strong annual sales growth had been expected, though not fully realised', the retail sector now believes future sales will remain flat and poor for the time of year. In contrast to the other sectors covered by the survey, wholesalers reported higher sales volumes than in June last year. Mr Whittaker warned, however, that the basis of the growth 'may be less secure, with retailers now reporting sharp cutbacks in orders'. The survey from the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry shows that domestic business continued to decline in the service sector during the second quarter, while manufacturing remained weak in spite of a slight rise in domestic orders. Although the survey shows that service-sector companies expecting a rise in domestic activity over the next three months exceeds those predicting a decrease by 19 per cent, Mr Malcolm Stephens, the chamber's chief executive, said that should be interpreted with caution. 'Companies have displayed some optimism in the past but we have yet to see this translate into improved levels of activity.' The surveys coincide with a research document from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, which argues that the underlying rate of GDP growth during the 1980s was just 2 per cent and that, on present trends, strong growth would now produce an 'explosive and unsustainable' deficit in the balance of payments. The document suggests that the UK is likely to slip down the international growth league during the 1990s. It says: 'Government policy, currently predicated on a 2 1/2 per cent long-term growth trend and higher recovery rates, will have to be completely recast over the next few years. Taxation will probably have to rise significantly to contain the budget deficit. Devaluation of sterling is a question of when rather than whether.' Distributive Trades Survey.

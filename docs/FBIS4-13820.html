			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "Evincing Weakness"] </F>   [Text] On paper our security and political situation looks  quite encouraging. Strategic balances being published by the  most respectable and serious international research institutes  unequivocally state Israel can successfully confront any  military threat, which means that its political bargaining power  is also better than ever. Experts assess this situation will  continue at least until Iran or Iraq purchase or develop nuclear  bombs. The military-technical assessment, however, does not  reflect the real situation, because it fails to take into  consideration the dangerous erosion since the Six-Day War in the  Israeli public's stamina during security crises and emergencies.    A public's or nation's endurance in emergency situations is  reflected in its ability to maintain normal life, in a  greater-than-usual willingness to join the national effort in  overcoming the crisis, and in high morale. What we witnessed in  Israel is the exact opposite.    The hysterical reaction to every terror attack indicates  that  a large proportion of the population -- actively encouraged by  the opposition -- refuses to recognize the fact that the peace  process is still not peace itself; that making peace is a  difficult and lengthy process; that the political and military  war of attrition being waged against us by the Palestinians and  Syria during the negotiations process itself, is an inseparable  part of making peace.    The historians who will research this phenomenon will  probably reach the conclusion that the role of occupier and  oppressor, forced on us after the Six-Day War, was one of the  main factors causing us to have no faith in our national cause  and harming our motivation to fight and suffer for this cause.  Even those who reject this interpretation will find it hard to  ignore or deny the symptoms: Instead of the public volunteering  en masse to the Civil Guard, thus helping foil terrorism, we  find that school trips are being canceled (even to places where  there is no danger at all); instead of wide- scale  demonstrations of national unity and determination, every terror  attack results in whining, hysterics, and boundless abuse hurled  at the government.    It does not take a military expert to realize that  Palestinian and Lebanese terrorism is currently receiving a lot  of positive feedback, a thing which only increases its activity.  It also does not take a political expert to recognize the  damage done to Israel's bargaining power in the negotiations.    The Likud and the right-wing parties, which encourage these  demonstrations of national weakness and try to score political  points from them, are evincing extraordinary shortsightedness.  The erosion in public endurance will boomerang against them if  and when they come to power. The same holds true for the  settlers. Meanwhile, however, it is the government which is  under pressure -- and those who come under pressure make  mistakes. The eroding public support and the nearing elections  are pushing Rabin and Peres into a corner from which they make  decisions and issue statements which do not always serve  Israel's vital interests. Rabin's statement on his agreement in  principle to disband settlements on the Golan Heights is an  excellent example of a premature concession made under pressure.    In war as in peace, he wins who has the higher motivation  and  endurance, even if the military balance of power is against him.  Britain, for example, won World War II thanks to the British  public's endurance during the German blitz on London; The Afghan  Mujaheddin organization managed to beat a vastly superior  Soviet- Afghan army; and let us admit: the Palestinians brought  us to the negotiating table because they evinced great endurance  and stamina during the intifadah. The ongoing erosion in the  Israeli public's endurance harms our ability to achieve  reasonable peace and security in the negotiations. This  situation, however, is not irreversible. With the help of an  intensive information campaign, the government can change the  national mood and cause the public to show more understanding  toward its moves and a situation wherein political negotiations  are being conducted alongside a war of attrition.</p>

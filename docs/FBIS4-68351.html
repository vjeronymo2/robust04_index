			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rodion Morozov under the rubric "Company </F> Secret": "FAPSI Avoids Chance Liaisons"]    [Text] In our times perhaps only children have not  heard about such things as "government communications," "the  Kremlin circuit" [kremlevka], and "the dialing circuit"  [vertushka]. However, even those who use the services of special  communications usually do not surmise how they operate and in  what way the confidentiality of conversations between its  subscribers is ensured. Secret communications are what the name  says. Nonetheless, certain things may be learned about them  anyway. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent was assisted in this  by a colonel of the FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government  Communications and Information], who naturally wished to remain  anonymous.    [Colonel] In conventional terms, the entire telephone  network  may be divided into a few categories: the first, the second, and  the third. The regular urban network is the third category;  operational networks used for in-house communication between  employees of special, classified establishments, for example,  the General Staff, are the second category. In this instance, a  certain degree of protection for communications is employed.  Communications of the first category are so-called "government"  communications--ATS [Automatic Telephone Exchange]-1, ATS-2.  Similarly, ATS-1 has a narrower circle of subscribers than  ATS-2. Previously a man who held the position of deputy minister  at a minimum, and not just any deputy minister, was supposed to  have ATS-1. Besides, other types of special communications  exist: HF communications (high-frequency)--for long-distance  conversations, satellite communications....    Naturally, various degrees of protection are established  depending on the status of the subscriber position. For example,  there is a type of communication--previously it was called  Metal--which envisions restricted access to telephones. That is  to say, the telephone is "enclosed" in a box and sealed; the  seal needs to be broken first in order to make a call using it.  The telephones are opened only in extreme situations; the  president, the minister of defense, and some other individuals  are supposed to have them "by virtue of rank." I remember the  horrible panic that we had and how everybody hustled when this  communications line was damaged.    [Morozov] Do faults occur on government communications  lines,  too?    [Colonel] Of course. On occasion some excavator would begin  to dig where it should not, and sever the cable. Do not worry,  repair complications do not influence subscribers in any way:  They do not have to wait until we patch up faults. Some other  network is used in all such situations.    [Morozov] Could you tell us about ways to protect special  communications?    [Colonel] There are quite a few ways. For example, highly  pressurized air is pumped into a cable. When a "malefactor"  tries to tap the cable, we learn about this virtually right  away. Electromagnetic manometers are installed at all of our  switching centers; as soon as air pressure within the cable  drops, an alarm is activated. A command is given right away, and  an operations group moves out toward the leak.    Besides, such a thing as encoding devices exists. If  information is classified, secret, it is encoded first: The  telephone is connected to the scrambler, and all the words turn  into absolutely unintelligible, untranslatable "garble." After  passing through the descrambler at the receiving end, the  "garble" turns into words once again. This is why if someone  tries to tap the line it will make no sense at all: Years will  be needed to decode even a few sentences.    A precaution such as noise masking [zashumlenie] is also  used. A cable has, say, 20 cable conductors; five carry  information, and noise from a special generator is piped into 15  cable conductors. As a rule, noise masking is used for sections  of cable between the telephone and the coding machine. Why is  this necessary? I will give a very simple example. Imagine that  you sitting in your office and typing. Each typewriter key (the  typing plate with a letter) is located at a certain distance  from the sheet on which you type. Consequently, different time  intervals for keystrokes are characteristic of different  letters. This is why if a sensitive microphone is installed in  your office, a wiretapping service will subsequently easily  reproduce, word for word, what you typed by using a special  program. (This is why typewriters on which secret information is  typed are screened in a special way in certain offices.) The  same is the case with cable. With the use of special equipment  the signal may easily be read, even from a distance of a few  dozen meters, off an unprotected section of the cable which  carries uncoded information. Subsequently, this signal may be  transformed into information. With noise masking, the likelihood  of this is reduced to virtually zero.    [Morozov] Have the general economic difficulties affected  your service?    [Colonel] Very unfavorably. Previously we were served on a  priority basis: How else, these were the needs of government  communications! At present, they fill on a priority basis the  orders of those who pay the most. The things we have at our  disposal are gradually growing obsolete, but there is nothing  with which to buy new equipment. For a while people were held  back by the hope that "everything will change for the better  soon." Later, that was it, the hope was gone, and people fled in  every which direction, one after the other. Officers who had  served for 15 years quit. They abandoned everything and  went--without retirement benefits, without anything. At present,  many people understand that the things that are happening may be  called the beginning of the end.    [Morozov] The end of communication?    [Colonel] Perhaps so. I recall now how we rejoiced at first  when we were removed from the Committee for State Security to be  a separate structure--the Federal Agency, and then under the  president. Some hazy prospects began to emerge. There was talk  about merchants--those who are capable of paying big money--also  becoming our clients and this, correspondingly, affecting our  salaries. No sooner had we started dreaming then they hit us  with a tonne of bricks: Really, guys! These are government  communications, and you are turning them into a commercial  venture!    Now we have a feeling that we have been left high and dry:  There is neither the money nor the prestige. After all,  previously there was the system, and whatever they might say,  this system needed us, and it took care of us. We were  respected, which is important. We would come to a ministry and  say: "I am such and such, from the USSR KGB." They would  accompany you, show you around, and look you in the eye.... What  about now? Our prestige has ultimately dropped, and not only  ours but that of all former services of the committee. So, many  people would like to go back now. However, where is the system  now?</p>

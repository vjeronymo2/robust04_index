This has been proven once again with the  latest success of the Ljubljana criminal police who, after  several months of cooperation with the Italian security organs,  arrested a 49-year old Turkish citizen, Alija, in one of the  rooms of the Hotel Lev in Ljubljana yesterday. During the  search they discovered 5 kg of heroin in a secret place in the  toilet, which is worth nearly 400,000 German Marks. [passage  omitted]    Simultaneous with this success of our criminal police a  question poses itself as to how the aforementioned group of drug  traffickers managed to smuggle 5 kg of heroin through the  customs control at Brnik airport [near Ljubljana] without being  spotted by an X-ray machine or customs officers. It seems that  the airport is well known to the international drug traffickers,  as allegedly being the place where one can dodge customs  controls from time to time. However, we must recall the case  from the recent past when policemen, with the help of dogs  trained to search for drugs, managed to discover 11 kg of heroin  at Brnik airport. Of course, this is not the last seizure of  this type here, as the criminal police hold information about  new smugglers. [passage omitted].</p>

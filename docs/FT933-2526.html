			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / New Nigeria bank chief MR Paul Oguma was nominated as governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria yesterday, in the latest key official posting by the interim government. It is unclear whether the appointment will survive the government, which is due to stand down next March. Mr Oguma succeeds Mr Abdulkadir Ahmed, who had held the post for more than a decade, during which time there were steep devaluations of the naira, balance of payments crises and uncontrolled public spending. Mr Oguma has held two previous banking appointments - as managing director of two of the top commercial banks, Union Bank of Nigeria and United Bank for Africa - before he recently set up a consultancy. He is thought to favour free market policies, but inherits an inefficient foreign exchange system and insufficient money supply controls.</p>

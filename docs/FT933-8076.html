			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Nurses strike at London hospital MORE THAN 40 nurses staged a one-day strike yesterday in protest at plans they claim could close London's busiest casualty unit. The dispute at University College Hospital centres on the government's healthcare reforms and growing fears that the local health authority will take away the hospital's funding. Camden and Islington Health Authority plans to withdraw its service contracts from UCH and the Middlesex Hospital as a result of the new internal healthcare market. Unison, the public services union which represents the nurses, claims that this would close both hospitals. Mr Chris Hart, London health officer for Unison, said the strike was 'a great success.' UCH denied it had caused problems.</p>

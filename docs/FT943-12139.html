			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Cautious line on Japanese recovery hopes The recovery of the Japanese economy is continuing, but could be knocked off course, according to a report presented to the cabinet yesterday by the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA). In a wide-ranging review of the country's longest recession since the second world war, the EPA's economic survey of Japan argues that structural reforms are needed to lift long-term economic prospects. The report is highly circumspect about immediate prospects. While it points to recent increases in consumer spending and falls in stock levels as encouraging signs, it fails to endorse the optimism of the Bank of Japan, which stated last week that the economy was headed for recovery. 'We hope that bright spots will spread through various sectors of the economy and we think that is possible,' was as far as one official was prepared to go. This time last year the EPA argued that the economy had almost hit bottom, only to see its forecast derailed by the sharp rise of the yen in the second half of the year. Anxious not to repeat the error, the report this time says the yen's further appreciation in the last few months again threatens the recovery. However, agency officials pointed to several factors likely to limit the damage done by the high yen. The yen's rise has been smaller than last year and has been principally against the dollar. The world economy is also much stronger this year. But the EPA is less optimistic about another threat to the recovery: the weak state of corporate balance sheets. Debt-burdened companies are reluctant to undertake big investment projects, and those that have done so have found banks unenthusiastic about lending, given their own asset quality problems. The EPA also says 'disinflation' - defined as a low or negative rate of inflation - has gone beyond the extent normally seen in a recession, as weak demand was compounded by a strong currency and the growth of discounting. Though falling prices were good news for consumers, they threatened profit margins and led to a further deterioration of corporate balance sheets. The report says the protracted recession has exposed a number of structural weaknesses in the economy that had been masked by the rapid expansion during the so-called bubble years. Companies need to review shibboleths such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay if they were to grow, the report says. The EPA also announced yesterday that a key economic activity index stayed above the 'boom or bust' line for the third successive month in May. The coincident indicator index stood at a preliminary figure of 60 per cent, unchanged from April's figure. The index comprises a basket of figures such as industrial production and consumer demand. However, agency officials warned that early indications for the June figure suggested it would slip below 50 per cent.</p>

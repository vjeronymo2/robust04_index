			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  reconfirmed his policy of close cooperation with the United  States in handling the North Korean nuclear issue and explained  the results of his recent trip to Russia and Uzbekistan in a  telephone conversation with President Bill Clinton Friday  morning.    In the hour-long call placed by Kim at 11:08 A.M., the two  presidents agreed that U.N. Security Council sanctions hold the  key to settling the nuclear row with North Korea and that they  would seek sanctions through cooperation among Korea, the United  States and Japan, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said.    Clinton promised to see to it that the Security Council  refrains from taking steps opposed by South Korea, saying what  is most important for North Korea now is to alter its stance  toward atomic power development.    On former President Jimmy Carter's plan to visit North  Korea,  the incumbent American president said Carter would be going to  Pyongyang as a private individual having nothing to do with him  or the U.S. Government.    Carter will not carry any U.S. Government messages to  Pyongyang, Clinton said, stressing that his support for U.N.  Security Council sanctions against North Korea would not swerve  even if Carter brought back a message from Pyongyang.    When he meets Kim Il-song in Pyongyang, the former president  will explain the feelings and concerns of the international  community about North Korea's nuclear development program.    Kim, explaining the outcome of his Russian trip including  Russia's decision to suspend arms sales to Pyongyang, kill the  Pyongyang-Moscow mutual assistance pact and hand over Russian  documents on the Korean war, said the Kremlin appeared to have  made a decisive change in its policy toward North Korea.    Kim and Clinton also exchanged views on China's position on  Security Council sanctions against North Korea, while agreeing  to hold another telephone talk on the nuclear issue.    On June 3 when Clinton was touring Europe, he phoned Kim in  Moscow to discuss joint measures the two countries should take  on the nuclear standoff.    Before his departure for Moscow on June 1, Kim called up  Clinton to discuss the same issue.</p>

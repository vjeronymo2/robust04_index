			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Hurry home, Mr Bush SADLY, Japan-bashing has now become a presidential activity, to the world's regret and Mr Bush's shame. The ostensible purpose to his current visit to Japan is to secure better access for US products in Japanese markets. But the real reason is to divert responsibility for the US's current - and deep-seated - economic ills away from his administration. To blame any one president for America's relative economic decline would be absurd. But Mr Bush can, and should, be roundly condemned for descending to the depths of xenophobic, economic nationalism reached by so many of his Congressional opponents. US elections should not be fought at the expense of relations between the world's most important economic powers. One depressingly familiar sign of the Bush administration's desperate slide towards mercantilism is its obsession with the size of Japan's trade surplus. The fact that Japan exports more to the rest of the world than the rest of the world exports to Japan does not mean that Japan's markets are not open to foreign producers. Japanese trade policy is neither depressing US manufacturing output nor cutting American jobs, as Mr Bush well knows. Japan has a trade surplus because, as a nation, it saves more than it invests. The US has a trade deficit because it invests more than it saves, largely because the fiscal deficit is such a drain on American savings. Bullying Even less relevant as proof of unfair trade practices is the bilateral US deficit with Japan, which has, in any case, remained roughly constant over the past year. There may well be non-tariff barriers against exports to Japan. But the Gatt is the forum in which to seek redress for anti-competitive trade distortions. Bilateral bullying for specific and self-serving trade concessions is not the right way. Yet bullying the Japanese serves a particular, political purpose for Mr Bush. The US public remains worried by the lack of economic growth, in spite of repeated cuts in interest rates, and the failure of US companies to stand up to foreign competition. The electorate is looking for a scapegoat, and Mr Bush would do anything to avoid its being him. So the Japanese are to get the blame. Hence Mr Bush's decision to take 21 professional scapegoat hunters with him. The inclusion of the chief executives of the US's failing big three car manufacturers is particularly pertinent. Few have been more shrill than Chrysler's Mr Lee Iacocca in their demands for state subsidies and protectionism. His lectures to the Japanese on the need for free and fair trade will have a certain irony. Marked contrast The CEOs of the US car industry, in fact, embody many failings of US corporate, capitalist culture. Over the years they have paid themselves too much, collaborated with trade unions in short-term thinking which failed to create a well-trained and flexible workforce and underestimated the importance of product quality. Not merely in these respects, but, above all, in the relatively poor performances of their companies, do they stand in marked contrast to their Japanese counterparts. The fact that the average US CEO earns 125 times the annual remuneration of a manufacturing worker, compared to just 16 times in Japan, is one indication of the contrast. The failure of the US corporate culture is just one part of America's structural impediments to efficiency. Add the poor record of US education, and the low savings rate, and the causes of the US's relative decline begin to emerge. It would be naive to suggest that Mr Bush can solve any of these problems. But he should go home determined to look for ways to address them, rather than try to paint as the devil the very nation from which the US has most to learn. In so doing he risks shifting the parameters of next year's presidential campaign from whether the US should embrace protectionism to how tight the embrace should be. Mr Bush, once an ardent free-trader, knows how dangerous that would be, not just for the US but for the world.</p>

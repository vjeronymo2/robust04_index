			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar: "An Open Letter </F> to the Human Ekeus"]    [Text] On your previous mission in Iraq, I addressed you  with words full of hope, appealing to the human and civilized  side of your esteemed self. I did that on the occasion of your  visit to the victims of the fiercest barbaric campaign in  history against an entire nation under siege, in which thousands  of people are suffering slow death from hunger, disease, and  sadness. I reminded you that the "civilized" people of the West  care about animals and birds and form organizations to protect  them, despite the fact that those "civilized" people spend a lot  of time thinking about new ways to annihilate other nations  without showing any mercy or having any second thoughts.    At the time, I did not expect Your Excellency to respond,  comment, or react immediately, for many reasons. Primarily, the  nature of your mission, which is to supervise the dismantling of  Iraq's strategic weapons, in the name of the United Nations.  This mission requires a person who has no heart and no feelings  in order for him to pass by piles of bodies without showing any  sign of sadness.    Indeed, yours is a tough mission. And a very sensitive one.  You know very well that the embargo is daily claiming lives of  men, women, children, and elderly. It is also undermining  family ties and destroying the foundations of natural life. The  embargo is said to be justified against the backdrop of the  "Kuwait problem." However, the human that lurks in the depth of  the international envoy can never disregard the fact that this  embargo has taken a course that has nothing to do with the  Kuwait issue and entered into the labyrinths of international  politics and its games, which can get very ugly.    Yesterday, I was heartened to see that the human lurking  deep  within you could not be suppressed by your "international  mission." This human shouted loud in protest and shed the robe  of callousness and disregard for the inhuman effects of the  embargo, when tears filled your eyes while you were listening to  the mother of a martyred child that did not complete its first  year and the wife of a martyred young man who had not yet turned  30. The woman was telling you about her tragedy and that of  thousands of Iraqis who were killed by a hand wearing a velvet  glove with the letters UN imprinted on it.    A Belgian reporter commented on your tears by saying:  "Impossible. Can Mr. Ekeus shed real tears? How can this  cold-hearted person cry?" I felt that this reporter was unfair.  I am very confident that your tears were true and that your  sympathy toward the noble Iraqi woman, Zahra' Yahya, was also  true. I am also absolutely confident that that moment was one  of your most painful experiences. All of this is good and  proves that the seeds of good and humanity are still alive, even  in the hearts of those assigned inhuman missions.    Allow me, Ambassador Ekeus, to pursue this civilized  dialogue  by asking a question which obsessed me for quite a while. Do  Mr. Ekeus's tears signal that he will not separate his feelings  and convictions as a human being from his mission as an  international official? We have heard about, and seen, humans  whose words and feelings are full of humanity but their deeds  are alien to their feelings, as if they are done by other  people. Yet, they smile confidently and say: Our feelings are  one thing; our duty is another.    This answer sums up the tragedy of the Western mind that  separates job requirements and personal beliefs. Such a  separation could be acceptable if there was no other choice.  But how can we understand the obvious contradiction between a  person's feelings and his job requirements, when this person can  choose one of a thousand jobs in which he can reconcile his  beliefs and job requirements?    I am sure that Your Excellency, by virtue of your high  qualifications, will not die of hunger if you speak up and say:  Enough. The United Nations should decide tomorrow, and not  after tomorrow, to lift the embargo to stop the tragedy of death  and suffering in Iraq.    Perhaps, Your Excellency might reply: The United States will  not respond. This might indeed be the case. However, your  testimony will deliver the coup de grace that will put an end to  the U.S. reasoning and deprive the bloodsuckers in Washington of  any covers in the face of the United Nations and an angry world  public opinion that rejects the annihilation of nations.    Are you going to settle the contradiction between your  beliefs and duties, Mr. Ekeus? We in Iraq are resolved to end  the blockade. We have done a great deal toward achieving this  objective. But we want the good-intentioned, and you are one of  them, to win their humanity before the blockade is lifted while  they are still captive to a destructive contradiction between  human feelings and job requirements.</p>

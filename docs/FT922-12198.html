			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Call for clarity on asset values AN ACCOUNTING practice allowing companies not to show as losses falls in the value of unsold assets should be outlawed, the Accounting Standards Board has argued in a preliminary statement. Any transfers of assets from current to fixed assets should be made at the lower of cost or net realisable value of the asset at the date of transfer. Post-retirement benefits apart from pensions should in principle be recognised as liabilities, it said in a second initial ruling on contentious practices being considered by its Urgent Issues Task Force. Both interim recommendations are still open to discussion, but they have been released as part of a process of glasnost initiated by the task force after criticism of its operations by companies. The task force hopes to reach a consensus on the subject at its next meeting on May 1 this year, after which its opinion will be binding in UK company accounting policy. It says in the second ruling that all post-retirement benefits - such as health care - should be treated using SSAP 24, the existing accounting guideline on pensions. It is still considering the details of disclosure requirements, and at what stage the liabilities of benefits should be included in consolidated accounts. Recommendations on the role of auditors and the future direction of their profession will be published this autumn, the Auditing Practices Board has said. A working group chaired by Mr John McFarlane, head of Citibank in the UK and Ireland, has been set up to examine how far auditors meet the needs and expectations of users of financial information.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Rehabilitation aid urged THE EUROPEAN Commission wants to earmark Ecu1bn (Pounds 790m) of central and national EC funds for rehabilitating developing countries which have been crippled by civil war or natural disasters. The Commission yesterday proposed an initiative aimed at filling the gap between short-term emergency aid and long-term development funding. Some 60 per cent of the planned funding would come from existing EC resources, including the Lome Convention of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the Community budget, and the rest would have to come directly from the 12 EC members. Rehabilitation aid is supposed to prepare the way for economic recovery and political and social development after upheavals such as civil war. But although the Commission has already launched rehabilitation schemes in areas such as Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia, existing aid instruments are not tailored to economies which are still too fragile to support long-term aid programmes. Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, has been pressing for a Commission initiative, and development ministers from the 12 EC members will discuss the proposal at their May 25 meeting. EC rehabilitation support would be used to help restore production, repair basic infrastructure and restore administrative institutions, and prepare the way for retraining, resettlement and job creation.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Moslem enclaves may fall to Serbs SERB forces are close to seizing control of some of the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia targeted for air drops of emergency relief supplies, according to western diplomats in the Serbian capital. They said a string of hamlets around the village of Cerska, where thousands of Moslem refugees may be located, is the most vulnerable to Serb forces. The town of Srebrenica is also under threat. Diplomats say it may house as many as 70,000 people, twice its pre-war population. Despite earlier warnings by Serb military leaders that the air drop risked spreading the war, Bosnian Serb commanders yesterday issued an order not to shoot at US aircraft, according to Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency. The statement coincided with intensified preparations for the US operation. Western diplomats in Belgrade said leaflets written in Serbo-Croat describing the operation could be dropped in a matter of hours. Meanwhile relief workers returning from the north-eastern city of Tuzla said conditions were rapidly deteriorating in the largest of a handful of government strongholds in the area. Bosnian military leaders said support to Tuzla is essential and pleaded for the opening of the city airfield for humanitarian relief. 'It would provide immediate access for aid to hundreds of thousands of people,' said a western diplomat. Swamped with refugees forced from their homes by Bosnian Serb forces, Tuzla's population of 720,000 is barely coping, even though it has received 10 UN convoys in the last few months. It is not under direct attack, but it has been cut off by Croat and Serb forces. Relief workers estimates energy reserves will last six weeks. If Tuzla is not opened up, diplomats are worried that the city will descend into chaos. Limited ground-based relief operations continued elsewhere in eastern Bosnia.</p>

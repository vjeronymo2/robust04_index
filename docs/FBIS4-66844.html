			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arun Shourie: "We Need to Face GATT With an Open </F> Mind"]    [Text] The Americans have a term for it, IRI, which stands  for instant rejection instinct. Whenever a new idea is  presented, especially if it calls for changes, we instinctively  jump up to dismiss it.    Our intelligence works to make this tendency stronger. We  suddenly create a network of aspects that would be adversely  effected by the new idea. After visualizing all those  possibilities, this proclivity is further strengthened. The  whole burden of proving something is put on the person who had  proposed the change with, "What proof do you have of the  benefits of this idea? What guarantee is there that A or B or C  will not be decreased?"    The result is further helped by another habit that we have  adopted. We begin to look for various principles behind every  bush even when we do not follow these principles in our own  lives. The less our leaders or commentators know about that  subject--new technology, patents, for example--the more these  basic principles they try to apply.    While looking for these theories, which we insist that we  must fully explore before we put them to practice, we do not  think about any restrictions or morals. We drag in unrelated and  far-fetched ideas whenever we can. For example, during the  recent campaign against Dunkel [GATT proposals], efforts were  made to convince some chief ministers to take this issue to the  Supreme Court. This is a strange argument. The argument is that  although the Center has the right to have treaties, it cannot  have a treaty which effects areas that are under the state list  in the Constitution. Can the Center agree to a treaty which  affects the basic form of the Indian Constitution? You can  imagine the questions that will be raised: The form of  autonomous union, what is it? What is the difference between the  Indian union and other nations? If it is different, then how  much so? What is its power to have treaties? How appropriate is  the state list in the 7th article of the Constitution?    Then, of course, there are the moral questions which we  never  forget. Is it appropriate that meals be patented? Is it  appropriate that life be patented? Are not there contradictions  in these words? Is it not the lowest deterioration brought about  by capitalism? How can you treat intelligence as a commodity?    Two results are clear. The debate is stretched into such  questions that one gets farther and farther from the issue under  debate and time is wasted.    If we move on Dunkel following our usual method, we will be  entangled in spiritual questions while the others are taking  over patents.    Supplementary Specialties: These bad results become even  more  complex because of the special skills that our intellectuals,  bureaucrats, and politicians share.    The question has not even been raised and we announce our  overstated attitude. This is neither a yes nor a no and the  negative or positive aspects of the issue do not affect either  of these responses; it is our stand compared to the other party  that decides it. If we are in the government, we say yes and if  we are in the opposition, we will scream no. We would have  embraced this idea gladly if we were sitting on the government  side. This tendency works in the minds of people on each side.  If our opponent says yes, we scream no. If the opponent is  taking a moderate stand, we will declare our stand to be clear,  unambiguous, and bold.    We not only adopt exaggerated attitudes, but also take  aggressive and extremist stands. Sit-ins, rallies, and demands  to do-or-die become a daily occurrence in no time. All this  happens even before one of the sides tries to explore the issue  further. Once we adopt that attitude, it is natural that we kick  out facts that create doubts. We rush to the facts or arguments  that strengthen our stand.    In addition, we do not examine that "fact" or argument; we  just throw it in the air and run with it. I had given a strange  example of criticizing Dunkel earlier. Making the period of a  patent 20 years (our present law allows a patent to be effective  from 7 to 14 years), will force us to pawn ourselves to  multinational companies for longer periods. This is unfair and  would be hard to bear in this period of fast changing  technology. A little thinking can show that the logic works for  the other side. Since technology changes fast, there will be  less effect of a longer period for a patent, because a new  product will leave the patented item behind.    Another strong but curious example emerges in this debate.  Advocating the implementation of the rights to intellectual  property more strictly, the United States and other countries  emphasized that this is because manufacturing companies spend a  lot of money on new drug and inventions. We argued (for example  in the book, Intellectual Property Rights Flawed), that  invention of new drugs does not really cost much since the U.S.  drug companies charge 35 percent profit over their cost.  However, it means that if it does not cost as much as we are  told then we can also try to invent those drugs by spending less  money.    Then there is the sickness of forgetting. We suddenly forget  the argument that we gave only yesterday, and begin to advocate  something entirely different just because the new argument  protects us from change. Until yesterday, the Indian drug  industry was the villain in this story. Its picture was  presented in such a way that all government efforts to formulate  a new drug price policy were wasted. This was the industry that  was trapping us into its system of poisonous, harmful, and  addicting drugs. This was also the industry that was cutting us  off from our medical heritage--the Ayruvedic and Unani  medicines--which are most beneficial and appropriate for us. The  treatment and drugs in these systems agree with our bodies and  habits. Since the ingredients for these drugs were collected  from jungles, the aborigines also benefitted from them.  Suddenly, all this is forgotten now. Now the argument is that  Dunkel is dangerous because it will hinder Indian drug industry  from competing with its Western counterparts. Until 15 December,  it was said in the arguments related to GATT that many awful  things will happen if the agreement is not amended. A  destructive trade war will start and so forth. The agreement was  not even signed and we started to express opposing fears in our  debates how signing it would cause catastrophes.    Therefore, I not only look for the instinct with which I  began this article but also for another staple habit: It is our  hobby to worry about one or the other thing.    Our opposition parties oppose every position that our  government takes and reduce the possibility of any astute debate  on that issue and the government, by not sharing facts with the  people, reduce this opportunity for debate even further. The  Indian representatives tried hard to get some of the provisions  during the discussions on Dunkel changed. However, they gave up  this struggle last March. It was possibly done after we saw that  no one supported us, but this change in stand was never  explained to us. Now when the government says that we have been  forced to agree with everyone because we had isolated ourselves  in the past, it appears to justify something after it has  already happened. This impression is even further magnified  because during this time the eardrums of people have been burst  from all the noise they have been hearing about the accusation  that the government is working under pressure from multinational  companies, IMF, the World Bank (and we do not know what else).    What should we do? We have to pay a high price for this all.  Since we adopt an exaggerated attitude--either yes or no--we  never could even come close to those reforms which we could have  implemented otherwise. Since we jump to adopt an attitude based  on enmity--if someone supports something then I must oppose it.  We lose the opportunity to benefit from those reforms which we  could implement if we worked together. Because we take the path  to violent activities in a hurry--do or die declarations,  violence, and other such steps, moderate or middle-of-the-way  solutions are pushed away from our reach. Our politicians'  apathy toward general ideas and the weakness of the  government--meaning weakness of the bureaucracy regardless of  which party is in, the government--makes us lose access to those  reforms which we could have had.    Therefore, to change things, we have to change our form of  debates and discussions. Especially, we should:     -  Listen more to those who work than leaders and  intellectuals.    -  Listen to those who have studied the issue and those who have  special knowledge about it instead of the status-quo  commentators, people actively looking for some issue, and  people's politicians.    -  Investigate the subject methodically before deciding on a  stand  and understand "facts" and arguments thoroughly.    -  Instead of the quick jump to "yes" or "no", we should keep  our  minds open for moderate suggestions.</p>

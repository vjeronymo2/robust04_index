			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: TEST PLASTER WALL CRACK BEFORE STARTING REPAIRS  </P> <P> QUESTION: We have a very old house with real plaster walls. A long crack  recently showed up on the living room wall. Since the house is so old, we have  ruled out the possibility of it being a settlement crack. We have checked with  neighbors and find nobody else has the same problem. Any ideas?  </P> <P> ANSWER: What might be called a resettlement sometimes can occur in an older  house. Maybe some repairs were done by the community that have affected the  soil under your house. There are other technical reasons why a settlement crack  can take place even in an old house.  </P> <P> If the crack doesn't get any larger or longer, you can patch the damage without  much fear that the opening will reappear. One way to make a test is to mark the  ends of the crack with chalk or any other marking material that can be erased.  Wait a few weeks and see whether the crack is lengthening or widening. If it  is, you will need a professional inspection and treatment. If not, go ahead  with the patching.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Chimney Screen Cap Will Keep Out Animals  </P> <P> Q: I've had trouble recently with birds and even a squirrel getting into our  chimney. I have been told we should put a cap on the chimney. Is this something  I can do myself? Won't the cap interfere with the draft?  </P> <P> A: A cap is merely something that will keep out the animals, but permit air and  smoke to move freely through the top of the chimney. You can make one yourself  out of ordinary mesh. Attach it so it won't be disturbed by the wind or smoke,  yet can be taken off and replaced if the need should arise. The need will arise  if the mesh gets clogged with leaves or other debris.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Household Bleach Can Clean Dirty Tile Grout  </P> <P> Q: The grout in a floor of clay tiles has become very dirty. We have washed it  with soap and water without much result. Can the grout be painted?  </P> <P> A: Yes, but it is a tedious task, since you will have to use an artist's brush  and enamel that will resist water. Try using a household bleach. It usually  does an excellent job.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shellac-Alcohol Mix Will Vary as You Use It  </P> <P> Q: I have never used shellac before, but expect to use it soon. How much  denatured alcohol should be mixed with it?  </P> <P> A: The mixture differs according to the use to which it will be put. Start with  a 50-50 mixture. As you work with it, you will be able to make changes and  judgements.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Borax Will Remove Grime from Marble  </P> <P> Q: Some time ago you told someone about going to a marble dealer and getting  material for the removal of stains. I have no doubt this was good advice, but I  thought you would be interested in knowing how my grandfather removed stains  from marble. He applied borax to the stain, then rubbed it with a wet cloth. It  always seemed to work.  </P> <P> A: Thanks. This is an old solution, usually only for cleaning the marble of  dirt and grime rather than stains. Dry borax is applied to the marble and then  rubbed with a damp rag. The marble is then rinsed and buffed. But I repeat:  This will clean the marble but may not affect a stain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adhesive Will Bond Hardboard to Wall  </P> <P> Q: I am preparing to finish an attic. I intend to use prefinished hardboard. I  was told the panels can be attached with a special wall adhesive if there is no  moisture problem. There is no such problem in our attic. How is the adhesive  applied? The panels will be attached to furring strips.  </P> <P> A: Apply the adhesive in one-eighth- to one-quarter-inch beads. Get the  adhesive where you buy the hardboard panels and you will get the proper kind.  If it is not available there, tell another dealer how it will be used and ask  him if he has a brochure on the proper use of the adhesive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Make a 'Tack Rag' or Buy One Instead  </P> <P> Q: I have seen the expression "tack rag" used several times when the  application of varnish is discussed. I understand it is for lifting up specks  of dirt and dust that get on a newly varnished surface. Can you tell me how to  make one?  </P> <P> A: Take a piece of clean cloth and wring it out in lukewarm water. Then soak  the rag in turpentine and wring it out. Put a little varnish on the rag,  dripping it on slowly. Once again, wring out the rag.  </P> <P> Apply more small quantities of varnish two or three times. Each time, wring it  out. The tack rag is then ready for use. But you need not go to all this  trouble if you don't mind spending a small amount for a professional tack rag.  It is available in most hardware stores and home centers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Green Lumber OK If Shrinkage No Problem  </P> <P> Q: I have a project coming up where it will be necessary to use quite a bit of  lumber. I presume I will save money if I use green or freshly cut lumber.  </P> <P> A: Yes, but be sure it is the kind of project where wood shrinkage will not  cause problems. Green lumber shrinks and causes all kind of construction  problems if you are not aware of exactly what you are doing. If you aren't, the  possibility of shrinkage is minimized when you use air-dried or kiln-dried  lumber.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Is Spacing for Steel Reinforcing Rods  </P> <P> Q: I want to build a retaining wall at the rear of our house. I will be using  poured concrete and vertical reinforcing rods. How far apart should the rods be  placed?  </P> <P> A: Generally, every 2 feet. But you actually aren't going to have too much say  about the matter. Your local codes will specify how the retaining wall should  be built, including the kind of vertical rods that can be used and how far  apart they should be. You will need a building permit.  </P> <P> The techniques of using varnish, lacquer, shellac, bleach, stain, remover,  etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the Home," which  can be obtained by sending $1 and a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope to  Know-How, P.O. Box 477, Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest  will be answered in the column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

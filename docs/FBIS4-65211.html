			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "M. La.": "Suspicion That Boeing May Launch </F> Own Project Prompts Airbus To Continue Studies on High-Capacity  Airliner"]    [Text] The Europeans and the Americans mistrust each other  with respect to their high-capacity aircraft project. As a  result, in the coming weeks Airbus Industries will start the  second study phase of its own project, referred to as A3XX,  without interrupting the joint feasibility studies it has been  conducting with Boeing. This announcement was made by  Aerospatiale Aircraft Division Director Claude Terrazzoni on  Saturday, 7 May. Participants in this program are the world's  three largest aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, and  McDonnell Douglas): None of them intends to risk being left  behind.    For the time being, the A3XX project is at a very  preliminary  stage, that of feasibility studies. According to Aerospatiale,  the market, which is primarily located in Southeast Asia, could  require annual production rates of 60 aircraft by 2010 and  remain roughly at this level until 2020. The French  manufacturer fears that the joint work it has been doing with  Boeing might turn out to be "no more than a smoke screen,"  according to Claude Terrazzoni. Two months ago, the  announcement that cooperation would continue had been received  with some skepticism by Airbus Industries, which felt  uncomfortably constrained.    Today, the French worry that the Americans might launch  their  own high-capacity aircraft based on Boeing's 747-400. They  believe Boeing's recent announcement of a longer-range,  stretched version of the new twin-engined 777 confirms such a  theory. This aircraft "would be a direct competitor to the  existing four-engine 747-400," Mr. Terrazzoni said. "Therefore  Boeing would have no choice but to put out new versions of the  747-400 and study a new wing unit for a bigger machine." With  an estimated price tag of $220 million (Fr1.25 billion), the  French are determined not to miss this market. For the time  being, however, only two airlines (British Airways and Singapore  Airlines) have shown interest for an airliner able to carry over  500 passengers.</p>

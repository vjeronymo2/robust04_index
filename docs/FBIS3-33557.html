			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta Avila; from the "ACIR Radio </F> News" newscast]    [Text] [Armenta] Today's negotiations have extended, and  the statements to the press by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho  Solis and Subcommander Marcos will take place at 2000 at the San  Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, which has been renamed the  Cathedral of Peace.    We have been informed the negotiations extended because the  peace commissioner and Subcommander Marcos held a meeting with  representatives of nongovernment organizations who have staged a  security siege around the cathedral since 19 February.    We have been informed reporters will have access to the  cathedral at 1930, 30 minutes before the participants give  statements.    [Unidentified announcer] Is that within one hour?    [Armenta] Correct.    In the meantime, Subcommander Marcos said this morning the  political parties are more interested in leading the talks than  in resolving problems. Subcommander Marcos met again this  Thursday with representatives of the media, particularly radio  media, which did not have access to the San Cristobal de las  Casas Cathedral yesterday.    The EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] subcommander  said the representatives of the parties with whom he met on 22  February never heard his demands and just argued among  themselves, as if they were at the Chamber of Representatives.  Marcos explained no agreement was signed with representatives  of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], PDM [Mexican  Democratic Party], Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction  Party, Mexican Green Ecologist Party, and the Labor Party to  incorporate the EZLN demands to the political platforms of each  of these parties. He added: It seems they only came to have  their pictures taken with the EZLN delegates.    [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] Certain parties did  not  come due to the masks with which we are covering our faces.  They think that is not hygienic. Others prefer to wait and see  what will happen or perhaps fear the movement wants them here to  accuse or attack them.    We expected those who came would listen to us; instead, they  came and said hello. We tell them we want them to monitor the  talks and not leave us alone. We told them we are ready to  follow the path of peace, if it will lead to an obtainment of  our demands. Then they started to talk and discuss, as if they  were at the Chamber of Deputies. We then waited until they  stopped talking. They were not talking to us at that point.  Then, one of them said we, the party of national or  international journalists, want.... [pauses] Then another party  official got upset and said we.... [pauses] Then they started a  debate [words indistinct].    We waited to see when they would become tired, and when we  realized they would never become tired, we told them we had to  go, because the beans were getting cold. [end recording]    [Armenta] The EZLN subcommander insisted on the need for the  presidential candidates to commit themselves to respecting the  accords that may be signed here at the San Cristobal table, so  that whoever wins the elections follows up on these commitments.    I can also report the members of the Special Commission for  Peace of the Mexican Bishops Conference are here in San  Cristobal de las Casas. They are six bishops, led by Adolfo  Suarez Rivera. Also here is Oaxaca Bishop Hector Gonzalez;  Carlos Talavera of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz; Raul Vera, dominican  bishop; Francisco Aguirre, Tuxtla Gutierrez bishop; and Felipe  Arizmendi of Tapachula.    We have been informed the bishops will speak to reporters  tomorrow to give their viewpoints of the peace and  reconciliation negotiations. Within 30 minutes, the six bishops  who form the Special Commission will hold a mass here at Santo  Domingo Square.</p>

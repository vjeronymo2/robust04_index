			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The Federation Council of the  Russian Federation has approved the Russian president's edict on  a state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The  chamber received the decree today and discussed it behind closed  doors.    Valeriy Fateyev, chairman of the commission of deputies  which  worked in the zone of state of emergency, told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that the decree "amended the mistake made in the  similar edict of 5 April, whereby four populated areas were  excluded from the emergency zone." This resulted in a sharp  aggravation of the crime situation in the area and victims. The  president amended the edict in relation to the zone of state of  emergency at the Federation Council's proposal.    The problem of the conflict, however, has not been solved,  the deputy stressed, and the central authorities should change  the forms of administration in that area. Fateyev and some  other deputies are convinced that all executive power should  rest with the federal center, that is the Russian president and  a local body of power authorized by him, whereas representative  bodies of power, whoever they belong to, should temporarily  suspend their activity.</p>

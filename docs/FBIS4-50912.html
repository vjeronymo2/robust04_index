			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Arbitration Rules of the China International Economic and </F> Trade Arbitration Commission"]    [Text] The rules were amended and passed by the first  session of the second standing committee of the China Council  for the Promotion of International Trade (China Chamber of  International Commerce) 17 March 1944.  <H5>  Chapter I -- General Rules </H5>   Section One: Authority    Article 1. These arbitration rules were formulated in  accordance with the relevant provisions in the PRC laws, the  "Decisions" of the Administration Council of the central  people's government, and the "Circular" and the "Official Reply"  of the State Council.    Article 2. The China International Economic and Trade  Arbitration Commission (first called the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade-Foreign Trade Arbitration  Commission, later called the China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade-Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration  Commission, now called the China International Economic and  Trade Arbitration Commission; hereafter referred to as the  Arbitration Commission, for short) independently and impartially  solves, through arbitration, the disputes arising from  international or foreign-related contractual or non-contractual  economic matters and trade, including those between foreign  legal entities and/or natural persons, on the one hand, and  Chinese legal entities and/or natural persons on the other;  between foreign legal entities and/or natural persons; and  between Chinese legal entities and/or natural persons; so as to  safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of those involved  and to promote the development of domestic and foreign economic  activities and trade.    Article 3. The Arbitration Commission handles cases in  accordance with either the arbitration agreement reached by the  parties involved -- before or after the dispute occurs -- that  their disputes are to be submitted to the Arbitration Commission  for arbitration, or with a written application presented by one  of the parties involved.    The arbitration agreement refers to the arbitration clauses  specified in the contract made by the parties involved, or to  the written agreement reached in a certain way that any disputes  are to be presented to the Arbitration Commission for  arbitration.    Article 4. The Arbitration Commission is entitled to make  decisions about the existence and validity of arbitration  agreements and the authority [guan xia quan 4619 6561 2938] of  arbitration cases.    Article 5. The arbitration clauses in a contract should be  regarded as independent of other clauses in the contract, and  the arbitration agreement attached to the contract also should  be taken as a part that is independent of other clauses in the  contract. When the contract is changed, dissolved, annulled, or  ceases to be effective or becomes invalid, the effectiveness of  the arbitration clauses or arbitration agreements will not be  affected.    Article 6. The authority over the arbitration agreement  and/or the arbitration cases is not to be challenged after the  accused gives the first substantial reply. The argument against  the authority over the countercharge is not to be advanced after  the party to whom the countercharge is addressed gives the first  substantial reply to the countercharge.    Article 7. If the parties concerned agree to submit their  disputes to the arbitration committee for arbitration, they are  regarded as agreeing to settle their disputes in accordance with  these arbitration rules.    Section Two: Organization    Article 8. The Arbitration Commission is to appoint an  honorary chairman and several advisers.    Article 9. The Arbitration Commission consists of one  chairman, a number of vice chairmen, one secretary general, and  a number of other members. The chairman performs the duties  specified in these rules, while the vice chairmen performs the  chairman's duties at the latter's request.    The Arbitration Commission is to set up a secretarial bureau  to handle day-to-day work.    Article 10. The Arbitration Commission is to draw up a  namelist of arbitrators. The China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade (the China Chamber of International  Commerce) is to appoint as arbitrators Chinese and foreigners  who have special knowledge about and practical experience in  law, economics, trade, and science and technology.    Article 11. The Arbitration Commission is to be set up in  Beijing. The Arbitration Commission is to set up branches in  both Shenzhen and Shanghai. The Arbitration Commission and its  branches are an inseparable whole.    The branch is to set up a secretariat to handle the branch's  routine work.    These rules apply to the Arbitration Commission and its  branches, without exception. In settling disputes by  arbitration, the chairman and secretariat of the branch perform  the duties of the chairman and the secretarial bureau of the  Arbitration Commission, as stipulated in the rules.    Article 12. The two parties involved, by agreement, may  submit their disputes for arbitration in Beijing, Shenzhen, or  Shanghai. If they do not make an agreement about this, it is up  to the declarant to make a choice, and the first choice prevails  if there is more than one. The Arbitration Commission is to  make a decision about the dispute, if any, arising therefrom.    Chapter Two -- Arbitration Procedure    Section One: Application for Arbitration, Reply, and  Countercharge    Article 13. The arbitration procedure begins the day the  accused receives an arbitration notice from the Arbitration  Commission; if the accused party is composed of more than one  person, the procedure begins the day the last person accused  receives his notice.    Article 14. When applying for arbitration, the declarant  must:    1. Submit an application, in which he must supply:    a. The names and addresses of the declarant and the accused  (ZIP codes, telephone numbers, telex and fax numbers, and cable  addresses, if any);    b. The arbitration agreement supporting the application;    c. The details of the case and the main points at issue;    d. Requests for instructions, and the facts and the evidence  in support of the requests.    The application for arbitration must be signed and/or sealed  by the declarant and/or his authorized agent.    2. When submitting an application for arbitration, the  declarant must attach to the application the certificate of the  facts supporting his request for instruction.    3. Choose -- or ask the chairman of the Arbitration  Commission to choose -- an arbitrator from the namelist of  arbitrators to arbitrate the dispute.    4. The arbitration fee must be paid in advance according to  the tariff set by the Arbitration Commission.    Article 15. The Arbitration Commission may ask the declarant  to supply more materials if, after examining the submitted  application and its annex, it considers the declarant has not  gone through the necessary procedures; if it considers the  declarant has gone through the necessary procedures, it must  immediately serve the accused with an arbitration notice,  together with a copy of the declarant's application and its  annex, the arbitration rules of the Arbitration Commission, the  namelist of arbitrators, and the table of arbitration charges.    Article 16. Within 20 days of the date of receipt of the  arbitration notice, the accused must choose -- or ask the  chairman of the Arbitration Committee to choose -- an arbitrator  from the namelist of arbitrators to arbitrate the dispute.    Article 17. Within 45 days of the date of receipt of the  arbitration notice, the accused must submit his reply to the  charge, in writing, to the Arbitration Commission's secretarial  bureau, along with relevant certificates.    Article 18. The accused must submit his written  countercharge, if any, to the Arbitration Commission's  secretarial bureau within 60 days of the date of receipt of the  arbitration notice.    Article 19. The declarant may amend his request for making  complaints and the accused may amend his request for making  countercomplaints, but the arbitration tribunal is to reject the  amendment if it considers the amendment came too late and thus  would affect the arbitration procedure.    Article 20. When submitting to the Arbitration Committee an  application for arbitration, a written reply, or a written  countercharge -- together with the relevant certificates and  documents -- the party involved must send a copy of the above to  his counterpart(s) and to every member of the arbitration  tribunal.    Article 21. The arbitration procedure will proceed as  necessary in the absence of the written reply made by the  accused or the written reply made by the declarant to the  countercharge made by the accused.    Article 22. The party involved may authorize an agent to  handle matters relating to the arbitration, and the agent must  submit his letter of authority to the Arbitration Commission.    Either Chinese or foreign citizens may act as agents.    Article 23. If a party involved applies for action to keep  the property involved intact, the Arbitration Commission is to  pass the application on to the intermediate people's court in  the counterpart's place of residence or in the place where the  property is located.    Section Two: Composition of the Arbitration Tribunal    Article 24. When either party involved has chosen -- or has  asked the chairman of the Arbitration Commission to choose -- an  arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators, the Arbitration  Commission must immediately choose a third arbitrator as the  chief arbitrator so that the three will form an arbitration  tribunal to hear the case.    Article 25. The two parties involved may jointly choose --  or jointly ask the chairman of the Arbitration Commission to  choose -- an arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators as a  single arbitrator, who is to set up an arbitration tribunal to  hear the case on his own.    If the two parties involved have intended that their case be  heard by a single arbitrator, but fail to reach agreement on the  choice of the arbitrator within 20 days of the date of receipt  of the arbitration notice by the accused, the Arbitration  Commission is to appoint one.    Article 26. If the accused fails to appoint -- or fails to  ask the chairman of the Arbitration Committee to appoint -- an  arbitrator, as required by Article 16 of these arbitration  rules, the chairman of the Arbitration Commission is to appoint  one for him.    Article 27. If there are two or more declarants and/or two  or more defendants, the two parties must, after consultation,  separately choose an arbitrator from the namelist of  arbitrators. If the declarants fail to jointly appoint an  arbitrator when they submit the arbitration application and/or  the defendants fail to jointly appoint an arbitrator within 20  days of the date of receipt of the arbitration notice by the  last defendant, the Arbitration Committee is to appoint one  arbitrator for either of them.    Article 28. If the appointed arbitrator has been involved in  the case, he must inform the Arbitration Commission of that and  ask for permission to stand clear of the case.    Article 29. If the party involved has any reasonable  doubt concerning the fairness and independence of the appointed  arbitrator, he is to give the Arbitration Committee a written  request for the arbitrator to stand clear of the case, stating  the specific facts and reasons supporting the request.    The written request is to be advanced 15 days before the  first hearing of the case; if the reason for the arbitrator to  stand clear of the case is available only after the first  hearing is held, the request is to be advanced before the last  session of the first hearing closes.    Article 30. Whether the arbitrator should stand clear of the  case is decided by the Arbitration Commission.    Article 31. If an appointed arbitrator stands clear of the  case or fails to discharge his duties for other reasons, a new  arbitrator must be appointed according to the procedures by  which the defunct arbitrator is appointed.    When a new arbitrator is appointed, the arbitration tribunal  must decide whether the previously held hearing must be repeated  in part or in full.    Section Three: Hearing    Article 32. The arbitration tribunal should try cases in  court, but on the application of the two parties involved -- or  their agreement -- and on condition that the arbitration  tribunal also considers it unnecessary to try the case in court,  the arbitration tribunal is to try the case and give a verdict  on the basis of written documents.    Article 33. When the arbitration tribunal has assigned the  date for the first hearing, after having consulted with the  Arbitration Commission secretarial bureau, the secretarial  bureau must give notice to the two parties involved 30 days  before the hearing is held. The parties involved may seek a  postponement of the hearing, but must submit a written request  to the secretarial bureau 30 days before the hearing, stating  the reason. Whether the hearing will be put off is decided by  the arbitration tribunal.    Article 34. The notices of the dates for subsequent court  sessions following the first hearing are not subject to 30-day  time limit.    Article 35. The cases accepted by the Arbitration Commission  are to be heard in Beijing; they may be heard in other  localities with approval of the chairman of the Arbitration  Commission. The cases accepted by the branches of the  Arbitration Commission are to be heard locally; they may be  heard in other localities with approval of branch chairmen.    Article 36. The arbitration tribunal is not to hold an open  hearing of cases; if the two parties involved ask for a public  hearing, the arbitration tribunal is to make a decision  concerning the request.    Article 37. If a case is not heard openly, the two parties  involved and their agents -- as well as the witnesses,  arbitrators, experts whose expertise is called upon by the  arbitration tribunal, appointed appraisers, and members of the  Arbitration Commission and its secretarial bureau -- are not  allowed to divulge the actual situation and relevant procedures.    Article 38. The parties involved are to provide evidence  supporting their complaints, replies, and countercharges. The  arbitration tribunal is to conduct investigations to collect  evidence on its own, as necessary.    When conducting investigations to collect evidence on its  own, the arbitration tribunal is to ask the two parties involved  to turn up in time if it considers their presence necessary.  The investigations are not affected by the absence of either or  both of the parties involved.    Article 39. The arbitration tribunal is to call on the  expertise of experts on special issues in the case or to assign  a appraiser to give an appraisal. Either Chinese or foreign  organizations or citizens may act as experts or appraisers.    The arbitration tribunal is entitled to ask the parties  involved to provide relevant materials, documents, assets, or  goods to experts/appraisers for inspection and/or assessment,  and the parties involved are duty-bound to act as requested.    Article 40. Copies of reports by experts and/or appraisers  must be sent to the two parties involved, and the two parties  involved must be given opportunities to express their opinions  on the reports. If any party involved asks the expert/appraiser  to attend the court session, the latter may do so with approval  of the arbitration tribunal and give a explanation on the report  if the arbitration tribunal considers it necessary and  appropriate.    Article 41. The evidence provided by the parties involved is  examined and approved by the arbitration tribunal; whether the  reports made by experts and/or appraisers is acceptable will be  decided by the arbitration tribunal.    Article 42. When either party involved fails to attend the  court session, the arbitration tribunal is to conduct the trial  and give judgment by default.    Article 43. The secretarial bureau is allowed to take notes  on and/or record the court session. The arbitration tribunal is  to make a statement of the key points of the court session, and  ask the parties involved and/or their agents, witnesses, and/or  other relevant personnel to sign the statement, when necessary.    The notes and/or recording made by the secretarial bureau  are  for the arbitration tribunal's reference only.    Article 44. If the two parties involved effect a  reconciliation out of court, they are to ask the arbitration  tribunal to give a verdict on the basis of the contents of the  reconciliation agreement and then close the case; they also are  to apply to withdraw the case. The chairman of the Arbitration  Committee is to make a decision on the case if the two parties  involved apply to withdraw the case before the arbitration  tribunal is set up; the arbitration tribunal makes a decision on  the case if the two parties involved apply to withdraw the case  after the arbitration tribunal is set up.    If a party involved applies for arbitration after the case  has been withdrawn, it is up to the chairman of the Arbitration  Committee to make a decision whether or not the case will be  heard.    Article 45. If a party involved knows -- or is supposed  to know -- that any articles laid down in these arbitration  rules or in the arbitration agreement are not being observed,  but still participates in the arbitration or continues with the  arbitration rather than raising a timely and clear objection, he  is regarded as waiving his right to raise an objection.    Article 46. If both parties involved desire to make peace,  or only one party desires to do so and succeeds in securing an  agreement with the other party through the arbitration tribunal,  the arbitration tribunal is to mediate in the dispute on trial  when the arbitration procedure is in progress.    Article 47. The arbitration tribunal is to mediate in the  way it considers appropriate.    Article 48. If one party involved proposes to suspend  mediation, or if the arbitration tribunal considers that its  mediation will not go anywhere, the arbitration tribunal is to  suspend the mediation and continue to settle the dispute by  arbitration.    Article 49. If the two parties involved reach a compromise  out of the arbitration court while the court is mediating in the  dispute, the compromise should be regarded as having been  reached through the mediation by the arbitration tribunal.    Article 50. If the two parties reach a compromise through  the mediation of the arbitration tribunal, the two parties must  sign a written compromise agreement; unless the two parties make  a separate agreement, the arbitration tribunal is to close the  case by giving a verdict in light of the compromise agreement.    Article 51. If the mediation proves unsuccessful, then in  support of his complaint, reply, and/or countercharge neither  party involved is -- in the arbitration procedure, or the  judicial or any other procedures thereafter -- to quote any  opinion, viewpoint, suggestion, or fact the other party or the  arbitration tribunal has expressed, advanced, proposed,  admitted, shown willingness to accept, or rejected in the course  of the mediation process.    Section Four: Handing Down a Ruling    Article 52. The arbitration tribunal must give a written  ruling within nine months of the date of its formation. On the  demand of the arbitration tribunal, the Arbitration Committee is  to extend the time limit if it considers this necessary and  reasonable.    Article 53. The arbitration tribunal must give an impartial  verdict on its own, according to the facts, the law, the  contract, and international practice, and in line with fair and  reasonable principles.    Article 54. The arbitration tribunal must give the reasons  for its verdict, except for a verdict given according to the  content of the compromise agreement reached by the two parties  involved. All or most members of the arbitration tribunal must  sign the written verdict and the Arbitration Committee must  affix its seal to it. The date and place of the verdict's  delivery must be given.    The date when the verdict is given is the date when the  verdict comes into effect.    Article 55. The majority of the three-member arbitration  tribunal is to decide on the verdict, but the minority opinion  may be noted down and attached to the verdict. The arbitrator  who holds a dissenting opinion may or may not sign the verdict.    Article 56. If the arbitration tribunal fails to reach a  majority decision, the verdict is to be based on the chief  arbitrator's opinion.    Article 57. The arbitration tribunal is to give an  intermediate or partial ruling on any issue in the case if it  considers this necessary or if the parties involved -- with  approval of the arbitration tribunal -- propose to do so. Any  relevant party's failure to accept the ruling is not to affect  the arbitration procedure or the final verdict given by the  arbitration tribunal.    Article 58. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to decide  on arbitration charges and other expenses the two parties  involved must pay to the Arbitration Committee.    Article 59. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to decide  on the amount the losing party should pay to the prevailing  party to cover a part of reasonable expenses the prevailing  party incurs in filing the case, but the damages must not be  more than 10 percent of the amount recovered by the prevailing  party.    Article 60. The ruling given by the arbitration tribunal is  final, and is binding on the two parties involved. No party is  allowed to sue in court or to ask any organization to change the  ruling.    Article 61. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the  written verdict, any of the parties involved may send a written  application to the arbitration tribunal asking it to correct  errors in writing, printing, calculation, and other errors of  similar nature in the written verdict. If there really are any  errors, the arbitration tribunal must make written corrections  within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written  application. The arbitration tribunal also is allowed to make  written corrections itself within 30 days of the date of issue  of the written verdict. The correction in writing is an  inseparable part of the verdict.    Article 62. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the  written judgment, if the arbitration tribunal is found to have  left some issues unjudged in its written judgment, any of the  parties involved is entitled to send a written application to  the arbitration tribunal asking it to give rulings on such  unjudged issues.    If certain issues really are left unjudged, the arbitration  tribunal must deliver rulings on the unjudged issues within 30  days of the date of receipt of the written application. The  arbitration tribunal is also allowed to give rulings on such  unjudged issues of its own accord within 30 days of the date of  issue of the written judgment. The additional judgment is an  inseparable part of the original judgment.    Article 63. The party involved must fulfill the verdict of  his own accord within the time limit set by the written  judgment; if a time limit is not set in the written judgment,  the verdict must be fulfilled immediately.    If a party refuses to fulfill the verdict, the other  party is allowed to apply to the Chinese court for fulfillment  of the verdict in accordance with Chinese law, or he may apply  to a relevant foreign court, which carries authority, for  fulfillment of the verdict in accordance with the 1958  "Convention on Acknowledging and Implementing Arbitration  Verdicts Given by Foreign Countries" or with other international  conventions to which China is a signatory state or to which  China has acceded.    Chapter Three -- Simple Procedures    Article 64. Unless the two parties involved have a separate  agreement, the simple procedures apply to a case involving a sum  less than 500,000 yuan, or a case involving a sum over 500,000  yuan on condition that a party has sent in a written application  for arbitration and has secured the another party's written  approval for the application.    Article 65. If a party involved has applied to the  Arbitration Committee for arbitration and the Arbitration  Committee -- after examination -- has agreed to handle the case,  the chairman of the Arbitration Committee must immediately  choose a single arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators of  the Arbitration Committee to set up an arbitration tribunal to  hear the case, unless the two parties involved have jointly  chosen a single arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators of  the Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee  secretarial bureau must immediately serve an arbitration notice  to the other party.    Article 66. A party involved must supply the Arbitration  Committee secretarial bureau with his reply and relevant  certificates within 30 days of the date of receipt of the  arbitration notice; if he has any countercharge, he must supply  the written countercharge and relevant certificates within the  same time period.    Article 67. The arbitration tribunal is to hear the case in  a way it considers appropriate. It may hear the case in written  form [shu mian shen li 2579 7240 1399 3810] on the basis of the  written materials and documentary evidence submitted by the  parties involved, or may hear the case in court.    Article 68. The parties involved must submit written  materials and written evidence necessary for arbitration as  required by the arbitration tribunal and within the time limit.    Article 69. When a date has been appointed for hearing a  case in court, the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau must  notify the two parties involved of the date 10 days before.    Article 70. If the arbitration tribunal decides to hear the  case in court, it is to do so only once, and not twice, unless  necessary.    Article 71. In the process of following the simple  procedure, the procedure -- as well as the arbitration  tribunal's power to deliver a verdict -- will not be affected by  the failure of any party involved to act according to the simple  procedure.    Article 72. The procedure will not be affected by a change  in the application for arbitration or by the presentation of a  countercharge, unless this contradicts Article 64.    Article 73. The arbitration tribunal must pass a written  judgment within 30 days of the date it begins hearing a case; if  the case is heard in a written form, the arbitration tribunal  must give a written verdict within 90 days of the date it is set  up. If necessary, the Arbitration Committee is to extend these  time limits.    Article 74. Relevant provisions in other chapters of these  rules apply to matters not covered in this chapter.    Chapter Four -- Supplementary Articles    Article 75. The Arbitration Committee uses Chinese as its  formal language. If the parties involved have a separate  agreement on the language to be used, the agreement will prevail.    If any party involved -- or his agent or witness -- needs an  interpreter when the arbitration tribunal is hearing a case in  court, the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau will provide  one; the party involved also is to provide an interpreter  himself.    The Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau is to ask the  parties involved to supply Chinese versions or versions in other  languages of various written materials or documentary evidence  submitted, if it considers this necessary.    Article 76. Unless the parties involved have a separate  agreement or the arbitration tribunal has made a separate  decision, all documents, notices, and other materials are to be  sent to the parties involved and/or their agents by hand,  registered mail, express delivery, fax, telex, telegraph, or in  other means the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau  considers appropriate.    Article 77. If any written correspondence has been delivered  to the recipient in person; or has been sent to the recipient's  business address, regular dwelling place, or communication  address; or has been sent -- when any of the above three  addresses is unavailable, despite reasonable inquiry -- to the  recipient's latest known business address, regular dwelling  place, or communication address by registered mail or other  means by which it can be proved that the written correspondence  was sent, the written correspondence is regarded as having been  sent.    Article 78. Apart from collecting arbitration charges from  the parties involved according to the tariff set by the  Arbitration Committee, the Arbitration Committee is to collect  from them any additional and reasonable charges, including the  special rewards and travel and boarding expenses for the  arbitrators, as well as expenses for engaging experts,  appraisers, and interpreters by the arbitration tribunal.    The Arbitration Committee is to charge the two parties  involved a fee if they apply to withdraw the case after reaching  a compromise on their own; the amount of the fee will be  determined by the workload involved and the money actually spent.    Article 79. If the arbitration provisions in the arbitration  agreement or in the contract make it clear that any disputes are  to be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee or its branches or  its predecessors -- the China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade-Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission or the  China Council for the Promotion of International Trade-Foreign  Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission -- the two parties  involved are regarded as having unanimously agreed that their  disputes be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee and its  branches.    Article 80. These rules come into effect 1 June 1994. The  arbitration rules which came into force 1 January 1989 apply to  cases handled by the Arbitration Committee and its branches  before 1 June 1994. These rules will apply to the above cases,  subject to approval of the two parties involved.    Article 81. The power of interpretation of these rules is  vested in the Arbitration Committee.</p>

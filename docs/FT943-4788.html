			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK contracting A note of despair tends to enter the voices of contracting industry bosses when they are asked when margins will improve. Mr Joe Dwyer of Wimpey put on a brave face yesterday but the best he could offer was that his contracting business would hold its own this year. Last year it made just Pounds 2.2m on turnover of Pounds 658.8m. The bind is that even if volumes pick up, there will still be too many companies bidding for the available work. The recession has caused few casualties among leading companies, with several of the near-dead kept alive by their bankers. The barriers to entry are also low, thanks to the system of up-front payments which means contractors operate with negative capital employed. Although it requires enormous cultural change it is in the interests of the large contractors to encourage a trend away from high up-front payments, so squeezing out financially weaker rivals. Some customers, including the government, are making modest moves in this direction. Strong balance sheets will be more important still if the hoped-for growth in privately-funded infrastructure projects materialises. Raising the barriers to entry could then lead to consolidation in what is, by international standards, a fragmented industry. Some observers even dream of the day when UK utilities will follow the continental model and acquire large contractors. Given the utilities' dismal record in contracting, the City would view this with alarm. Yet without some structural change the prospects for the UK contracting industry are grim.</p>

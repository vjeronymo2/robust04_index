			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY IN JAIL 'POT' CASE WON'T FACE  TRIAL  </P> <P> A defense attorney who allegedly handed a client cigarettes stuffed with  marijuana during a visit to a Los Angeles County Jail will not face criminal  charges because of a lack of evidence, county prosecutors said this week.  </P> <P> In January, Paul Potter was arrested and booked for felony smuggling of  narcotics into a jail and possession of a drug in jail after he allegedly  handed a package of cigarettes to an inmate in the attorney's room of the Men's  Central Jail.  </P> <P> A subsequent search of the inmate, Steven Young, revealed that the seal was  broken on the package of cigarettes, and that they were stuffed with marijuana  with tobacco plugged at each end, authorities said.  </P> <P> "There is some evidence that perhaps he should have known better, but basically  there is not enough evidence to take it to a jury," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Michael Knight.  </P></p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Dow switches to D-Mark invoicing after ERM turmoil DOW, the US chemical giant, yesterday announced its European chemical operations would begin invoicing in D-Marks immediately, abandoning the use of local currencies. The action appears to be the first time an international company has required payment in a single European currency from its customers, and comes in response to recent turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism. Dow said margins of its chemical businesses, with an annual turnover of Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.6bn), had been hit by the currency fluctuations this month. A third of the group's sales had been affected by devaluations. The group's main costs, energy and hydrocarbons, were dollar-denominated, while two-thirds of its fixed costs were in D-Marks or Dutch guilders. Mr Fernand Kaufmann, sales and commercial vice-president at Dow Europe, said: 'Most of our costs are stable. But the devaluations have knocked between 2 and 3 per cent off our European margins. For the first time in 10 years, European operations made a loss in the second quarter. Quite simply, margins are so depressed we cannot afford to absorb the devaluations.' The company, which is attempting to impose price increases for its products during the fourth quarter this year, said the aim of the D-Mark move was not to make extra money. 'We also need to act out of fairness to our customers in markets with strong currencies and avoid price differentials brought about by currency fluctuations,' said Mr Kaufmann. 'The benefits of devaluations wear off quickly,' he added. He admitted the company was taking a risk that competitors would not follow its example, and would use lower prices to gain market share. The move was effective from yesterday. Mr Clive Johnson, a partner in the treasury group at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, said he believed Dow was the first company to bill in a single European currency. A few companies operate partial billings in ECUs, and the aviation industry  -including fuel and aircraft leasing - tends to operate with dollars, he said. He said in the long-term Dow's move might offer stability, but in the short-term it would add to its currency exposure.</p>

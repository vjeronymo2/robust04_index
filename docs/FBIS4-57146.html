			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 12 May (EFE) -- In an interview published  in LA EPOCA today, Argentine Economics Minister Domingo Cavallo  said that the large deficit in his country's trade balance "is a  symptom of health" because the increase in imports corresponds  to capital goods.    Cavallo, who yesterday concluded a two-day visit to  Santiago,  said: "The impressive pace of investment in Argentina has meant  a significant increase in machinery imports."    He added that the trade balance deficit "does not worry us  at  all" because imports are financed, and the deficit is being  compensated with the capital account surplus of the balance of  payments.    Cavallo explained that the government of President Carlos  Menem is working on the regulations for labor negotiations,  which he labeled as "a more flexible operation of the labor  market."    Cavallo added: "We are addressing health, social welfare,  and economic reforms in the provinces. The provincial  governments have a great responsibility in the areas of  security, justice, health, and education."    He asserted that the reforms are greatly supported by the  Argentine people, and will continue no matter who heads the next  government. He added, however, that if the Constitution is  reformed President Menem will probably be reelected.    Asked about the fact that Argentina is becoming an example  for Brazil, Cavallo said: "The future of the Latin American  countries is closely linked, and therefore it is important for  everyone that Brazil do well."    Cavallo noted: "I believe that being able to contribute our  experience to the future of such an important country as Brazil  is for me very pleasing."</p>

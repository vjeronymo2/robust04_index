			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIVING IN OBSCURITY;  </P> <P> ALTHOUGH FAR OUTSIDE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN SPORTS, BADMINTON STILL FLOURISHES  AT CLUB, HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL  </P> <P> As obscure as the international sport it serves, the ivy-shrouded Manhattan  Beach Badminton Club rises on a hill overlooking the downtown shoreline. Most  of this bustling community's residents don't know it exists.  </P> <P> The 250 club members like it that way.  </P> <P> "We're not even listed in the Yellow Pages," club president Stan Johnson said.  </P> <P> But internationally, "everyone in the world knows about this little outpost,"  said Joy Kitzmiller, a two-time national singles champion and the gold medalist  at last year's Olympic Festival. "We've put Manhattan Beach on the badminton  map."  </P> <P> Over the years the Manhattan Beach facility, which sports a swimming pool, hot  tub, two barbecue cabanas and a meeting hall, has evolved into more of a social  club, yet it serves as a training ground for selected U.S. National Team  members.  </P> <P> Some club members lament that the seclusion they cherish helps isolate the  sport from mainstream America. To most Americans, badminton is synonymous with  back-yard barbecues and Fourth of July picnics.  </P> <P> That is not the case internationally. In England, for example, there are  200,000 registered badminton players. In the United States there are only  2,000.  </P> <P> "Participation in the world is in the millions," said Dean Schoppe, a U.S.  National Team member and a member of the Manhattan Beach club.  </P> <P> There are only two indoor facilities in the West, Manhattan Beach and at  Arizona State University, although the sport flourishes in the high schools of  Orange County and in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The CIF Moore League -- composed of Poly, Millikan, Lakewood, Wilson, Jordan  and Compton high schools -- plays a coed schedule. Jordan is the defending  Southern Section champion.  </P> <P> Dues in the Manhattan Beach club are cheap, but there is a two-year waiting  period to become a member. Each year every member is required to put in 16  hours of volunteer work to help maintain the club.  </P> <P> Guest numbers are limited and they must pay to play on one of the club's five  courts. Kitzmiller said that limiting guests makes it difficult for her to  train, because there are no female players of her caliber in the club.  </P> <P> Badminton is a strenuous sport, club members say. To elite players, badminton  requires six to eight hours of daily practice. Schoppe estimates that in an  average match, which is scored much the same as volleyball, a player runs the  equivalent of 9 to 12 miles of wind sprints and hits between 600 and 2,000  shots.  </P> <P> Even those who enjoy the club's social atmosphere cite the benefits of  badminton on their cardiovascular systems. "We gather and play badminton for  several hours (on Friday nights) and then go into the (meeting hall) and drink  wine and eat hors d'oeuvres," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Internationally, it is estimated that badminton is second only to soccer in the  number of participants. In Asia, title matches often draw standing-room-only  crowds of 20,000 to arenas designed specifically for the sport.  </P> <P> "When I play in Asia, I go out for a jog on a Saturday morning, and in any  town, on every piece of flat land, there are people playing it," Schoppe said.  </P> <P> "The potential in this country for this sport is huge," said Martin French,  president of the U.S. Badminton Assn. and a club member. "But as far as this  sport getting recognition (from the general public) we are eons away."  </P> <P> According to Wilson High Coach Dan Heston, the high school game is dominated by  foreign students. "Nine out of 10 players are Asians," he said.  </P> <P> The game is also popular in the Middle East, as well as in England and its  former colonies. Tariq Wadood, a top pro player from Pakistan, is the U.S.  National Team coach.  </P> <P> Founded in a roadside bathhouse in 1936, the secluded badminton club in  Manhattan Beach is in a residential neighborhood at 18th Street and Valley  Drive. The facilities are considered to be among "the best in the world,"  according to Wadood.  </P> <P> Yet the courts are rather stark. There are five side-by-side inside a cavernous  gymnasium. Each serves for both singles or doubles, much like a tennis court,  but the dimensions are about half the size. Nets are tautly drawn five feet  above the playing surface.  </P> <P> Six fluorescent lights hang down on long cords from the ceiling, providing what  Schoppe said is the perfect amount of indirect light needed to see a  shuttlecock that can travel at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The walls and ceilings are painted a drab green. The playing floor is designed  specifically for the stress a badminton player receives on his knees and  joints. It is composed of soft wood, painted with a gum-tar surface.  </P> <P> "You couldn't play basketball on it because the wood would crack under the  pressure of a bouncing ball," Schoppe explained.  </P> <P> While members like their privacy, some would like to see badminton take off in  this country. Said Wadood, the club pro: "In the United States it gets no media  attention. Little kids (in my country) see it on TV and they make idols. Here,  they don't see it so the image is bad."  </P> <P> However, the facility is lacking in some of the things it would take to  publicize the sport. "It's God awful when we do television in here," Schoppe  said of the lighting.  </P> <P> Although the U.S. Open has been held there three times, there isn't space for  bleachers.  </P> <P> "For training this is the best facility," Wadood said. "But for tournaments we  can't seat enough people."  </P> <P> At major events, according to Johnson, "When we get down to the finals we bring  in some portable bleachers and set them up on the other courts. That's not the  best way to do it."  </P> <P> In 1974, the club's board of directors was rebuked by the Manhattan Beach City  Council when it asked for a permit to expand. Nearby residents feared increased  noise and parking problems if the additions of two more courts and a viewing  loft were allowed. Later, the city acted on residential complaints and limited  it from issuing more than 250 memberships.  </P> <P> The club's atmosphere is different from that at a tennis club, according to  members who turned out on a recent Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> "A tennis club has a parking lot filled with Mercedes-Benzes and other yuppie  cars. That isn't the case here," Johnson said. "Here, most people don't even  know what vocation you are in. It's a different culture, a family  organization."  </P> <P> But their interest in such an obscure and misunderstood sport often leads to  ridicule. Johnson remembers the ribbing he took from fellow insurance agents  when they heard he had joined the club eight years ago.  </P> <P> "They wanted to know if I was going to try out for the wimp Olympics," he said.  </P> <P> He then invited a couple of them to play a game or two at the club.  </P> <P> "I watched them die on the court," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A recent example of this situation is a pacifier that failed to comply with the Commission's safety requirements. The Commission and firm negotiated a recall and attempted to describe the pacifier in a joint press release. However, this pacifier was virtually indistinguishable from many other pacifiers unaffected by the recall, and therefore was difficult to describe meaningfully to consumers. The press release described the affected pacifier as ``consist[ing] of a pink, yellow, or blue guard or shield and ring with a rubber nipple.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A similar situation arises when nearly identical products are distributed by different firms, and many brands are recalled. For example, numerous brands of metal tubular bunk beds were recalled earlier this year, but the beds had no identifying marks. Many consumers did not know whether their beds were involved in the recall. And, even if consumers knew that their beds were recalled, they could not easily determine what firm was responsible for manufacturing particular beds. This problem occurs frequently with a variety of products. The problem of describing recalled products to consumers is compounded because the media often shorten, and may reword, the description contained in the press release announcing a recall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even when recalled products are still in the hands of retailers, it can be difficult to identify the products. The manufacturer or importer of a recalled product may not notify its retail customers because it is no longer in business, is unwilling to do a recall or lacks complete records of its customers. In such situations, the Commission publicizes the recall, usually by issuing a press release. When the identifying information provided in the release is on the packaging of the recalled product, retailers can quickly remove the affected product from their shelves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission knows from experience that recalls sometimes have to include products that do not present a safety problem because the products are not marked in a way that allows those that present the risk to be distinguished from the same model of products that do not. For example, a quality control problem during a particular week may have caused a defect in only a few thousand toys. If those toys cannot be distinguished from the same toys manufactured during different weeks, they would all require recall. On the other hand, if the defective toys are marked with a code that pinpoints the problem week, the scope of the recall can be limited and its expense reduced. This result may be helpful to industry, consumers and the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission enforces safety rules for thousands of different consumer products, and products that fail to comply are generally recalled. Even if no specific rule applies to a product, all consumer products are subject to recall if they present a substantial hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the Commission's safety rules and recalls involve children's and fireworks products. Moreover, these products often place at risk children who are less able to protect themselves from unsafe products than are adults. Accordingly, at this time the Commission is considering a product identification rule only for children's and fireworks products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. A Possible Product Identification Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section discusses the specific provisions of a possible product identification proposal. The provisions are all subject to change, particularly if information received from the public during the comment period supports different provisions that would accomplish the Commission's objectives while imposing smaller economic burdens on industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

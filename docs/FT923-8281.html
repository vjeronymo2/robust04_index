			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: Demerger of ICI and long-term planning Sir, As a former employee of ICI, and having worked in both Britain and Germany, I was not altogether shocked to learn of ICI's demerger plans. Such things were discussed frequently in 1982-1984, when I was an ICI-supported PhD student at the old corporate research laboratories. The question of whether the demerger argument is spurious in the eyes of the German 'Big Three' (Letters, August 10) must also be looked at from (yet) another angle. The acknowledged industrial advantage held by BASF, Bayer and Hoechst is that a high percentage of their respective businesses is generated from just one major chemical plant, with the associated economies of scale in basic utilities, as well as human and financial capital. ICI has from the start been a collection of separate plants, which served to reinforce the divisional differences. The future ICI Bio businesses have done most to break down these old barriers. This problem of geographically dispersed plants is not exclusive to ICI. The French chemical industry is similarly structured. In this respect the management of human capital is made more complex by questions of mobility. One can only hope for the employees of the future ICIs that the new structures will allow the management to plan more long term, and remove the pressure on the cyclical businesses to produce 'pharmaceutical' profits, a pressure which is, as stated by Dr Sally, purely external.

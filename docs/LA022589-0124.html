			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 5-A;  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY SLOWS PACE, THEN RUNS OFF WITH 84-71 VICTORY  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School won a battle of fast breaks with Buena in the  Southern Section 5-A boys' basketball semifinals Friday night, not by speeding  up but by slowing down.  </P> <P> For a while, Capistrano Valley was out of sync trying to keep up with Buena's  hectic running game. Only when the Cougars slowed down a few RPMs and seized  control of the pace were they able to play effectively.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley even managed to run a more efficient fast break in defeating  Buena, 84-71, at Moorpark College.  </P> <P> The Cougars (23-4) got an impressive second-half performance by forward Scott  McCorkle, who had a game-high 32 points and 12 rebounds. Capistrano Valley also  made 13 of 16 free throws in the fourth quarter to thwart any chance Buena had  of rallying.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley advances to the 5-A championship game, where it will meet the  winner of tonight's Irvine-Pasadena game. It marks the Cougars' second  consecutive championship appearance. Last season, they fell to Simi Valley in  the 4-A final. Buena finished its season 21-5.  </P> <P> For most of the first quarter, it appeared as if Capistrano Valley's hopes for  a title berth would be run over by Buena's running and gunning.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs made five three-pointers in the first quarter and ran the Cougars'  man-to-man defense silly. Capistrano Valley also looked shaky against Buena's  full-court press, turning the ball over six times in the quarter. Things looked  even worse when McCorkle missed his first three shots and point guard Chris  Kostoff tossed up a free throw that hit nothing but air.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 thing was that we didn't panic when they made that run," Capistrano  Valley Coach Mark Thornton said.  </P> <P> Still, Capistrano Valley trailed, 19-8, after yet another three-pointer, this  one by reserve David Carpenter.  </P> <P> But the Cougars finally found the right gear and went on a 8-0 run to end the  first quarter down 19-16.  </P> <P> When McCorkle scored on a move inside with 4:11 left in the half, Capistrano  Valley took the lead for the first time and never relinquished it. The Cougars  maintained a two- to five-point lead until late in the game when Buena was  forced to foul in order to get the ball back.  </P> <P> But Capistrano Valley made its free throws down the stretch and suddenly Buena,  which appeared worn out by its own early pace, began missing three-pointers.  </P> <P> Guard Jeff Oliver, who led Buena with 17 points including five three-pointers,  went scoreless in the fourth quarter as Capistrano Valley pulled away.  </P> <P> McCorkle had 12 in the fourth quarter, including a run of six in a row to start  the period. He finished off the scoring with a two-handed monster dunk in the  final seconds that set off a celebration among the Capistrano Valley fans.  </P> <P> "I guess we were a little lax (early in the game)," McCorkle said. "We didn't  come out as strong as we should have. We played their game with all that  running."  </P> <P> Kostoff bounced back from his air ball at the free throw line to add 21 points,  including three three-pointers. Nick Kost, a reserve guard, played a steady  game and added 11 for the Cougars.  </P></p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / A revolution on the Russian airwaves: Ian Hargreaves visited Moscow's television stations where he found broadcasters who had craved freedom learning that viewers want US game shows and Mexican soaps HERE ARE the ratings for Moscow TV: number one, Field of Dreams, a game show; number two, The Rich Also Cry, a Mexican soap opera; number three, another Mexican soap. Disney cartoons are at four, with news at five, six and seven. Russia, it seems, is already a paid-up member of the western world's armchair society. 'The country is fed up with politicians,' says Yegor Yakovlev, the 62-year-old journalist and biographer of Lenin who for the past year has been boss of Ostankino, formerly Gostelradio, monopoly broadcaster to the Soviet Union. 'From 1985 to August 1991, any move away from politics would have been against the interest of the audience. That period is over. Politics today takes place in everyday life. The more people realise that, the more normal the country will become.' This is a message you hear constantly in the journalistic salons of Moscow. Those who spent years yearning for the freedom to write without censorship are recognising that the public demands to be entertained as well as hectored. As newspaper cover prices soar in response to inflation, circulations are tumbling and competition intensifying. It is in television, though, where the struggle is fiercest because in TV the limits of the broadcasting spectrum combine with the medium's power to demand that government shapes its future. Russia thus finds itself addressing, at fast-forward speed, the three big questions over which the west has disagreed at leisure in the 60 years since the industry was born. What role will the state play in owning TV stations? To what extent will it regulate broadcasters it does not own? And how will TV be financed: through taxation, advertising, a BBC-style licence fee, or a mixture of all three? In Moscow, there is also a unique fourth question: to what extent can Ostankino, state broadcaster to the Russian empire, continue to function beyond the borders of Russia? Yakovlev needs no reminding of the heat these questions generate. In July, Ostankino's once impregnable premises were stormed by communists and nationalists protesting about their lack of access to the air-waves. 'Our people were dispersed with sticks,' says Gennadiy Seleznev, editor in chief of Pravda, the former party newspaper where circulation has collapsed from its peak of more than 11m to 1.4m and continues to fall. 'All our TV is one-sided: it's fantastically pro-Yeltsin and pro-government. There is no culture of opposition in Russia.' The atmosphere is distinctively post-revolutionary. Those in charge are mostly those who grabbed effectively in or around August last year when the anti-Gorbachev coup collapsed. 'We made a big mistake in not demanding more in terms of buildings and equipment,' says Sergei Skvortsov, deputy general director of Russian Television, the scruffily housed Moscow station set up by Yeltsin in 1991 as a rival to Gorbachev's Gostelradio. The breathless months following the coup's defeat have also left large gaps in the legal framework. There is, for example, no copyright law although Professor Mikhail Fedotov, burly director of Yeltsin's intellectual property agency, says he has a draft in his computer and that Russia will be ready to sign the Berne convention on copyright next year. Fedotov also has a pair of handcuffs hanging from his desk lamp as a warning to the pirates. 'Russia is no Africa,' he bellows. Western investment advisers say that, without a copyright law, Russia will remain bandit country, shunned by serious western media money and a haven for the country's hundreds of cable TV operators, some no more than a VCR connected through a single apartment block and illicitly showing American movies. Russia does have a mass media law, judged widely in Moscow to be progressive, although it contains clauses on newspaper registration, privacy and the definition of journalism which some think may yet prove dangerous, particularly since factions inside parliament continue to talk of a committee to 'supervise' the media. Parliament has not, however, got round to serious work on a broadcasting law to specify either the governance of the state TV companies or a regulatory framework for independent operators, such as the channel six service proposed as a 50-50 joint venture by Ted Turner (owner of CNN) and local interests. Through the chaos, however, patterns are emerging. The clear leader is Yakovlev's Ostankino, although many think he has gambled his future foolishly on trying to retain Ostankino's position as a broadcaster across the whole of the former Soviet Union where its relatively polished fare is more popular than the drab, politician-speak nationalism of organisations such as TV Ukraine. 'I am trying to save the company,' says Yakovlev. 'I dream of preserving a single information space (for the CIS). That is not just my official duty, it's my civil duty, my principal task.' This must rank as one of the more ambitious undertakings in broadcasting history: to maintain a Moscow-based, Russian language TV service across the schismatic vastness of the Commonwealth of Independent States. So far, Yakovlev has obtained provisional agreement to create an interstate joint stock company, but the matter is still to be debated at a CIS summit next month. What he has not received is money, other than from the Russian government and that part of advertising revenue (10 per cent, he has estimated) which filters through a corruption-prone system which permits producers of individual programmes to sell commercial time around their own slots. Apart from news and soaps, a typical midweek evening on Ostankino's channel one takes in sport, discussion programmes and films. One popular show, of which Yakovlev is proud, is called Tema (Themes) and features a US-style talk show host coaxing a lively studio audience to interrogate suitable victims. During my visit, the targets were two entrepreneurs, members of what Russians call 'the new class.' These men declared themselves in favour of 'the American style' and fielded questions of innocent savagery, such as: 'If you make profits, you take money from others. How can you justify this morally?' and, 'You sell a Ford car for 2m roubles. I cannot earn this sum in a lifetime. How can this be right?' Not all of prime time is this much fun. On a wet Wednesday evening this month, alongside Ostankino, Russian TV's channel two was offering Opposition in which the leader of the farmers' union put his view at Gorbachevian length, followed by The Count of Monte Cristo. A late-night hit for channel two is the constitutional court's inquisition of the communists. Moscow TV, funded by the city council, was meanwhile showing dull local current affairs and St Petersburg TV offered a similar brew. This channel is most famous for 600 Seconds, a programme which gives vent to communist, nationalist, monarchist, even anti-semitic views and refers habitually to Yeltsin's 'government of occupation.' The authorities tried to kill it off but it was restored after public protest. A fifth channel is an educational service of a gravitas which would delight the ghost of John Reith. There is vigorous debate about just how politically free the broadcasters are. Alexei Salmin, a leading social scientist at the Gorbachev Foundation, says television offers 'a plurality of organised opinions. This reflects the pluralism of political power. TV is independent from everybody, including the government and the parliament, but this is mostly due to the ad hoc nature of the situation.' Ostankino is regarded as dull and respectable in its news service, whereas Russian TV gives a large amount of power to the news anchors, who determine running orders and write scripts. In the old days, Gostelradio's evening news was rehearsed in the afternoon to make sure the party bosses were happy with it. 'There is too much opinion of the anchormen when they should just be explaining things,' says Vladislav Starkov, editor-in-chief of the booming weekly Argumenty &amp; Facty where 'real life' journalism attracts 6,000 readers' letters a day. Inside the TV companies, everyone insists that censorship is gone. Yakovlev points to three silent phones on his desk which connected his predecessor to the party. But inside Yeltsin's entourage, I was told that when the president does a TV spot, the interviewer is selected by the president's men. At Russian TV, parliament still has the right to insist that its proceedings interrupt other programmes. All the broadcasters say life is getting harder. Russia's budgetary problems have constrained finances and the collapse of the rouble has made foreign material expensive. In this ferment, a handful of foreigners pick their way. Turner is the most ambitious, with his proposed mix of CNN news, children's programmes, geographical documentaries and films. 'Channel six will help change the selling mentality of Russian television,' says Bruce Macdonald, Moscow boss of the US-based BBDO advertising and marketing agency. 'We are on the edge of a massive development in advertising here. This used to be a country where, to do a deal, you needed to know three people and hold two alcoholic dinners. Now, it's 15 countries and 30,000 enterprises. Western advertisers have the chance to block up the next generation's mentality on a TV system which is, by western standards, uncluttered and cheap.' In recent months, the price of a prime time minute has fallen from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 6,000, which represents perhaps five cents per 1,000 viewers compared with more than Dollars 5 in the US. Among companies which have joined the fray are Pepsi, Wrigley, Rank Xerox and Avon. Macdonald is more aware than most of the system's frustrations: the failure to understand audience targeting, the fact that TV companies do not log their advertising output, or publish advance schedules, or research the ratings properly. 'There are one hell of a lot of exclusive agents,' he warns. 'Their deals are exclusive till tomorrow lunchtime, and the money can easily end up in a Swiss bank account rather than at Ostankino.' Thus, as Russian TV points its cameras at society, what viewers see is an exotic pluralism let loose around a staid, statist formalism - just as Moscow's vast roads and grave institutional buildings have become a backdrop for a teeming kerbside market in which everyone has something to sell. 'Commercial TV development so far has not been good,' says Yakovlev. 'A lot of it is in bad taste and of low quality, reflecting the desire of those running it to make as much money as possible as quickly as possible. Perhaps such TV equates with our society now.'</p>

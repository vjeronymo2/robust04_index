			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The scene is set for a volatile week in the bund market. Sandwiched between the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday and the G7 session on Friday comes the meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council on Thursday. This is the penultimate meeting before the summer break and possibly the last opportunity for the central bank to deliver a cut in the discount rate; the July 21 meeting will be taken up with the annual review of money supply. Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets Research thinks that in the context of foreign exchange market turmoil there is a chance of a co-ordinated move on interest rates - with the Fed raising rates while the Bundesbank does the opposite. If both move by  1/4 percentage point the impact would be 'economically insignificant but psychologically important,' she says. Following last Friday's weaker than expected west German industrial output figures, this week's manufacturing orders are likely to confirm the pattern of a flattening recovery path, says Mr Adolf Rosentock at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt. In theory this should be good news for the bunds, but the market has long stopped being driven by domestic fundamentals.</p>

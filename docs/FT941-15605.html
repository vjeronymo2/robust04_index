			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Manpower signs deal over strikes Unison, Britain's largest union, has signed a no-strikebreaking agreement with Manpower, the employment agency. Manpower, which placed 66,000 people in temporary employment last year, said it had agreed not to support strike breakers or to allow agency staff to cross picket lines. In return, the union has agreed not to obstruct commercial opportunities open to Manpower. In effect, the deal is something of an employment peace treaty designed to keep the agency and the union on friendly terms. Manpower said it would not encourage its employees to join the union but agreed that it would issue union enrolment forms at the time of interviews and 'point out the benefits of union membership'. Manpower said: 'We offer them the opportunity to join a union appropriate to the work they are doing. 'It is entirely their choice but we draw people's attention to it.' The company said that as a matter of policy it did not allow itself to be used for strike-breaking. The union signed a similar agreement with the Reed Care employment agency in June which covered care assist-ants. Mr Keith Sonnet, assistant general secretary, said: 'The agreement widens our influence over the treatment of temporary staff and will enable us to look after their conditions of work more closely. 'It guarantees temporary staff will not be used where industrial action is taking place or be substituted for permanent staff.'</p>

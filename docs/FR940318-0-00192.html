(a) C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute (i) where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements: (a) Due to their physical or chemical properties or (b) where human exposure to the agents may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating conditions. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the preceding discussion concerning use to total flooding agents in the workplace. In addition, because this agent can be used in high concentrations due to its cardiotoxicity profile, the design concentration must result in oxygen levels of at least 16%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  can extinguish fires in a total flood application at concentrations of 5.5 percent with a design concentration of 6.6 percent. The cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 40 percent for this agent is well above its extinguishment concentration and therefore is safe for use in occupied areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level of 21 percent, a design concentration of 22.6 percent may reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 percent, the minimum level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgement or other physiological effects. Thus, the oxygen level resulting from discharge of this agent must be at least 16 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has a no ODP, it has an atmospheric lifetime of 2,600 years. Due to its long atmospheric lifetime, the Agency is finding this chemical acceptable only in those limited instances where no other alternative is technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements. In most total flooding applications, the Agency believes that alternatives to C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exist. It is EPA's intention that users not select C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  out of simple preference, but out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine that the requirements of the specific end-use preclude utilization of other available alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users must observe the limitations on PFC use by undertaking the following measures: (i) Conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may approach or result in cardiosensitization or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions; and (iii) determine that the physical or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some examples of potential end-uses where toxicity may possibly be of concern are: i. Applications involving confined spaces where egress is difficult, such as in civilian and military transportation applications including aircraft engines, armored vehicles (engine and crew compartments), and ship engines; ii. Applications where public safety or national security necessity may preclude personnel from evacuating, in event of emergency, such as nuclear power plants or guard/security facilities; iii. Explosion and fire protection applications where high suppression or inerting concentrations are required such as processing and pump stations, flammable liquid processing areas, and flammable metal processing areas; iv. Health care facility applications involving impaired populations, such as hospitals and nursing homes where there may be a preference for use of this agent due to the unique concerns within the facility; v. Military mission critical applications which are vital to national security; vi. Other applications where, due to physical or chemical properties, there are no other technically feasible alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions by limiting testing of C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recovering C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroying or recycling C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for later use. In addition, EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unacceptable substitutes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Streaming agents. (a) (CFC&hyph;11). CFC&hyph;11 is unacceptable in its proposed application as a Halon 2402 substitute or for use in controlling large outdoor fires. This agent has been proposed as a substitute for Halon 2402, as well as for use in controlling large outdoor fires, as when dropped from helicopters. Halon 2402 is not used in the U.S. and thus does not require a substitute agent. Other nonozone-depleting methods are already in use in fighting these large outdoor fires and, thus, EPA does not believe that introduction of this substitute is warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Total flooding agents. There are no total flooding agents listed as unacceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Sterilants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CFC&hyph;12 is widely used in combination with ethylene oxide (EtO) to sterilize medical equipment and devices. The most prevalent combination consists of 12 percent EtO mixed with 88 percent CFC&hyph;12; the mixture is therefore referred to as ``12/88''. EtO serves as the actual sterilant in this mixture and can be used alone as a sterilant, but by itself, EtO is highly flammable. CFC&hyph;12 acts as a diluent to form a non-flammable blend. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sterilants, including 12/88, are used in a variety of applications. These include hospital sterilization, medical equipment sterilization, pharmaceutical production, spice fumigation, commercial research and development, and contract sterilization. Hospitals are by far the most numerous users of sterilants. Within hospitals, 12/88 is the most popular sterilant. Estimates indicate that in 1989, EtO/CFC&hyph;12 was used for over 95 percent of all sterilization in hospitals. Other individual users of sterilant such as contract sterilizers and pharmaceutical producers, while less numerous than hospitals, typically consume more sterilant than the average hospital but are more likely to use other alternatives such as pure EtO sterilization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

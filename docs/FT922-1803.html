			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Fashionable answers Sir, I was unaware that leading figures in corporate life were threatening British enterprise in their refusal to follow new quality standards in packaging ('Personality comes into fashion', June 15). The bizarre outcome of the Blue Arrow trials now makes perfect sense in the knowledge that our current director of public prosecutions had earrings which are judged by a leading consultant to be 'too small'. And many must feel that Frances Heaton of the Takeover Panel is sailing close to the wind by not wearing contrasting clothes and large scale jewellery. Anne Simpson, joint managing director, PIRC, Challoner House, 18-21 Clerkenwell Close, London EC1R 0AA</p>

Gen.  Matos said government soldiers were becoming impatient over  delays in the Angolan peace negotiations in the Zambian capital  of Lusaka. He said it was necessary to put an end to the  tension being experienced in various parts of Angola as a result  of the civil war. Gen. Matos said earlier that the recent  agreements between UNITA and Angolan Government peace  delegations in Lusaka were a mere propaganda exercise and that  no significant progress had been achieved.</p>

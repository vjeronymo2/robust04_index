			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Falling back to earth with a bump: Turkey has taken steps to avert economic crisis - but the price may be a political backlash After teetering for two months on the edge of an economic precipice, Turkey this week has tried to pull back from the brink. Under pressure from a plunging lira and dramatic gains by Islamic radicals in last week's local elections, Turkey's conservative-led coalition on Tuesday announced an austerity package in an effort to restore economic health. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, warned that Turkey faces Latin American-style hyperinflation unless the programme is implemented. The measures include unpopular moves to raise taxes and state-controlled prices and close public sector companies, as well as an effective further devaluation of the lira. This fell yesterday to 39,900 to the dollar against 32,050 on Tuesday, after the central bank stopped supporting the currency. In launching Turkey on an uncomfortable economic journey, Mrs Ciller, a 48-year-old former Istanbul economics professor, seems to have little clear-cut idea of the destination. In her televised address on Tuesday, she said she hoped the measures would spur export-led growth and would not 'stop the economy'. In fact, if the austerity package is to work, a sharp economic slowdown - and a possible political backlash - may be difficult to avoid. Ominously, workers from the Zongludak coal works, and from the Karabuk iron and steel factory - both earmarked for possible closure - launched protest marches on Tuesday to voice opposition against expected large-scale lay-offs. The immediate cause of Turkey's economic crisis was the decision in January to devalue the lira by 12 per cent, in an early attempt to correct economic problems. This sparked a self-fuelling fall in the currency and rising concern among foreign creditors, in spite of domestic interest rates which were raised at one point to 1,000 per cent. The reasons for Turkey's problems, however, go much deeper. For most of the past decade, annual inflation rates have rarely been lower than 50-70 per cent. At the same time Turkey has registered annual economic growth rates well above those of other countries in the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As an OECD official put it this week, 'Turkey has been defying the law of gravity for years. But you can't run an economy with a 50-60 per cent inflation rate without it collapsing.' The public sector borrowing requirement last year was running at 16 per cent of gross national product. To bring down the deficit, the government plans widespread price rises for commodities such as petrol and sugar. It wants to step up privatisation by selling Dollars 3.5bn worth of state assets in 1994  -a forecast which may turn out to be heavily optimistic. Overall, Mrs Ciller envisages cutting the central government's budget in the next three months by TL38,000bn through revenue increases and cost savings. With an inflation rate of 74 per cent in March, the time of reckoning has clearly arrived. However, while the government realises the pressing need to cool the economy, it also fears the possible consequences. An important reason for Mrs Ciller's failure to take remedial action earlier was the memory of the effects of Turkey's last big austerity package, announced in January 1980 by her predecessor Mr Suleyman Demirel, who took over as Turkey's president in May last year. The 1980 measures, launched at the behest of the International Monetary Fund to boost exports and control inflation, led to months of social disruption which eventually sparked a military coup d'etat in September 1980. Mr Mesut Yilmaz, the leader of the main opposition Motherland party, Anap, this week called Mrs Ciller's package 'a bad copy' of the January 1980 measures. Since the reinstatement of democracy after a change of constitution in 1982, Turkey has made an impressive political and economic recovery. But anxieties about political stability have resurfaced in recent weeks as a result of violent unrest in the Kurdish speaking south-east of the country and the surprising gains made by the Islamic-based Refah party (RP) in the municipal elections on March 27. The RP gains, particularly its victories in Istanbul, the largest city, and the capital Ankara, unsettled Turkey's pro-western secular political class. Coupled with reports of Islamic vigilantes imposing Islamic rules on the streets of Turkish cities, the election results have heightened the risks if Mrs Ciller's economic package fails. In some ways, however, Mrs Ciller emerged strengthened from the elections. After campaigning on a platform of tough law and order measures against Kurdish rebels, her True Path party finished with a narrow overall victory over the Anap opposition party. Nevertheless, the suggestion that the secular reforms established by the new Republic could now be at risk sets off alarm signals among Turkey's western allies. Turkey remains a vital strategic partner for the west in a troubled part of the globe bordering the Balkans, the Caucasus and northern Iraq. Also, the country is an important source of business for the European Union, with trade between Turkey and the EU reaching Dollars 20bn in 1993, making it the Union's ninth largest trading partner. Turkey is making an all-out attempt to increase the competitiveness of its economy in preparation for the planned customs union with the EU in 1995. Its application for membership of the EU was made as long ago as 1987. However Turkish ministers are resigned to countries from central and eastern Europe joining the EU some time around 2000, perhaps a decade before the date when Turkey will be allowed to accede. One important factor clouding relations with the EU is Turkey's heavy-handed military clampdown on Kurdish unrest. Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, has also warned, during a visit to Ankara in February, that Turkey would benefit from the customs union only if it took firm action to control state finances. With international credit agencies this year having twice downgraded Turkey's debt rating, EU officials believe Turkey can ill afford to delay its customs union commitment. But industries such as the powerful automobile sector - hard hit by this year's steep rise in borrowing costs - are looking for exemptions to the customs union timetable. EU Commission officials warn that this will be countered by calls from European textile producers to retain quotas against Turkish textiles. The government's most important short-term priority is to implement Mrs Ciller's programme and make it work. All too often since she took over as prime minister last summer, her economic policy achievements have failed to match her rhetoric. However western economists point out this is the first time the government has explicitly envisaged the closure of loss-making state industries. 'If this is what is needed to keep the fundamentalists out of power that's fine, I think people are prepared to pay the price,' was how one Istanbul banker put it. Western diplomats believe Anap will eventually endorse the measures - above all because, after its lack-lustre performance in the municipal elections, Anap is in no mood to force an early general election. The prospect that Turkey could fail to implement the package is, however, deeply worrying - not just for Turkish industry and for holders of the country's Dollars 64bn foreign debt. A severe economic crisis would give further support to Islamic radicals - raising the prospect of a shift in Turkey's western orientation that would further unsettle one of the world's most volatile regions. As Mrs Ciller in coming weeks struggles to deliver the economic medicine Turkey urgently needs, much more than the fate of the Turkish economy will hang in the balance.</p>

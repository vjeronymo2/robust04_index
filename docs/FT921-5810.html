			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Politicians reach deal on Quebec CANADA'S three main political parties have agreed on constitutional proposals aimed at forestalling a break away by French-speaking Quebec. The package drawn up by a 30-member parliamentary committee after five months of cross-country hearings provides for the transfer of various powers from the federal government to Quebec and to other provinces which want them. Quebec would also gain a veto over future changes in the constitution. To mollify other provinces, the committee has proposed turning the upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, from an appointed to an elected body with limited veto powers and wider representation from western and Atlantic Canada. New measures are suggested to accelerate the lowering of pervasive non-tariff trade barriers between the provinces. The committee's report will form the basis of complex negotiations in coming months between the federal government, Quebec and the other nine provinces. Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister, aims to finalise the 'offer' to Quebec within the next six months.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING KIDS HANDLE 'DAY-CARE DILEMMA'  </P> <P> There is a point in the excellent article "Day-Care Dilemma" that needs some  clarification. Providing quality care for our nation's future decision-makers  is certainly an area of utmost concern and a complex problem.  </P> <P> However, we are not fortunate enough to be experiencing a dropping birth rate,  as suggested by Audre Engelman of the Women Lawyers' Assn.  </P> <P> Because of the "echo-boom" and other mitigating factors, Los Angeles County,  for example, has gained three times as many people during the 1980s as during  the 1970s, an average of 120,000 a year.  </P> <P> This growth is attributable, first, to an increase in births, and only second  to new immigrants.  </P> <P> Result? The sheer numbers mean there is vastly increased pressure on an already  fragile system of child care . . . and vastly increased pressure on an already  fragile planetary environment.  </P> <P> Prognosis? The future is hanging in the balance as we dare to face the  potential significance of universally considering a small-family goal.  </P> <P> CAROL BENSON HOLST, Glendale  </P></p>

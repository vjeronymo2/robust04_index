			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY IMPOSES CONTRACT DESPITE POLICE  PROTEST  </P> <P> Under protests from police union officials, the Long Beach City Council Tuesday  declared an impasse in labor negotiations with the Long Beach police union and  adopted the city's last contract offer.  </P> <P> The attorney for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. planned to seek a  restraining order today to block the city from imposing the new one-year  contract, which greatly increases management clout in the 650-member Police  Department. City management has insisted that major changes in personnel  policies are necessary to more efficiently manage the understaffed department  and improve police service.  </P> <P> Union officials have said there will be no job actions, but vow they will fight  the new contract legally and politically. "Unconditional surrender is what they  want and they aren't going to get it," said union President Mike Tracy.  </P></p>

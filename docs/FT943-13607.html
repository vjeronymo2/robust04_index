			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / People: London Securities The London Securities board of directors has effectively been turned over to its 29 per cent shareholder; yesterday an extraordinary general meeting put forward a third Nu-Swift director to its four-man board. Andre Chudnoff, a long-time associate of Nu-Swift's majority shareholder Jacques Murray, was voted on to the board at a meeting which was initially called to vote on the removal of the company's chairman and executive director. This move was forestalled by the resignation earlier this month of David Pearl and Richard Prickett. Chudnoff said London Securities did not expect to pay any compensation for their resignations. Michael Evans, a director of Nu-Swift, was appointed non-executive chairman last Wednesday, and Jean-Jacques Murray, another Nu-Swift director, joined as an executive director earlier in July. Nu-Swift, the parent company, was only privatised in March, but it is planned that London Securities will act as its listed property arm. Proposals are currently being finalised for the acquisition of a number of Nu-Swift properties by London Securities, in order to reactivate it from its current position as a cash shell. Two independent directors are due to be appointed to the board later this month.</p>

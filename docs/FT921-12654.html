			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Letter: Complications of a relief plan for Lloyd's Names and a need for better marketing (2) Sir, The debate about the future of Lloyd's need not be complicated. It is not an institution comparable to the MCC. It is a commercial institution. It exists to make money for its members. In recent years it has failed lamentably. It has been more concerned with self-regulation than marketing. As an external member for 25 years and a former member of the council, I support Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director of the Octavian Group, in his spearheading of a movement to get the present council to adopt the recent proposal for a market committee. The council at present contains a former Inland Revenue official, a retired ambassador and a galaxy of lawyers and accountants. They are not money-makers. Unless Lloyd's devotes its particular expertise to making profits for its members, those members will desert it, just as shareholders unload their holdings in an ailing company. It would be tragic if the mandarins of the council continue to fiddle with legislative documents while Lime Street burns. The proposed market committee is a vital component of any strategy for growth at Lloyds. John de Courcy Ling, Lloyd's, Lime Street, London EC3</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by special reporter Li Hai (6849 3189): "China </F> Invests 35 Billion Yuan in Construction of Railroads,  Expressways in Southwestern Region"]    [Text] Nanning, 14 May (WEN WEI PO)--This reporter has  learned from the Chinese Government department concerned that,  to promote and speed up the economic development in the western  and southwestern regions and to open the regions wider to the  outside world, during the "Eighth and Ninth Five-Year Plans,"  China will invest huge sums of money in the construction of main  lines of communication including railroads and highways. Of the  total amount of funds for construction, 20 billion yuan will be  provided for railroads and 15 billion for highways.    China will build or rebuild a total of 3,000 km of railroad  in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The Nanning-Kunming  Railroad, which is now being built at a greater speed, will  probably go into service in 1996. The Yangpingguan-Chengdu  section of the dual-track Baoji-Chengdu Railroad, which  constitutes the northern passageway running through the  hinterland of the northwestern region; the Chengdu-Daxian County  Railroad, which constitutes the eastern passageway; and the  Yunnan-Guangda Railroad, which constitutes the western  passageway, are now all under construction and are scheduled for  completion in late 1995. In addition, the project to electrify  the Chengdu-Kunming Railroad, costing 2.6 billion yuan; the  Chongqing-Daxian County Electric Railroad; the Wanxian  County-Daxian County line; and the Neijiang-Kunming line, are  under construction or will begin construction shortly and they  are scheduled to go into service within this century.    China will also build or rebuild 5,000 km of trunk highways  in the three provinces and one autonomous region. Sichuan will  invest 11.3 billion yuan in construction by building new  highways and rebuilding old highways in an advanced principal  highway network, which will be supported by water transport on  the Chang Jiang, making key ports its joints and Chengdu and  Chongqing the centers from which the network will extend in  various directions. Sichuan will also build second-class (or  first-class) highways which will be connected with the  land-and-water coordinated transport networks in various  prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities across the  province. The networks are now connected by expressways and  outbound waterways. The main highway linking Shanghai with  Chengdu planned by the Communications Ministry will extend from  Chengdu to Chongqing and Wanxian County and then proceed beyond  Sichuan to other places. The highway will link Chongqing,  Guiyang, Nanning, and the sea outlet in the Bacho Gulf. Under  this plan, the first phase project will involve the building of  800 km of advanced highways, which will serve as the main  framework, and the building or rebuilding of 2,000 km of  regional trunk highways.    The department concerned said foreign businessmen are  welcome  to invest in these projects.</p>

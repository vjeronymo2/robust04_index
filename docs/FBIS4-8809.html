			<p>BFN     [Text] Serb forces in Baranja, in east Croatia, have taken  part of the heavy weapons which were under the control of the UN  Protection Force, according to Belgian military spokesman  Colonel (Fredi Van Weg).    A group of 520 Belgian soldiers is deployed in Baranja,  which  has been under Serb occupation for two years. In early April,  Croatia agreed on a cease-fire with the rebel Serbs and, under  the agreement, the Serbs placed their heavy weapons under UN  control in six warehouses.    The fact that a certain number of weapons have been stolen  should be condemned, because this will have a negative impact on  the peace process which has taken off well, Colonel (Van Weg)  said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 16 (AFP)--Iran could break ties with  Britain if London failed to provide a convincing explanation  over the alleged bugging of the Iranian embassy, MP [Member of  Parliament] Majid Naderi said Monday [16 May].    Tehran said last Wednesday that a listening device had been  found late April inside a wall at the Iranian embassy in London.  Britain has refused to comment on the affair.    Naderi, a member of parliament's foreign affairs  subcommittee, told ABRAR newspaper there was a possibility "of  any kind of conflict" with London, but that the National  Security Council would have to give its opinion first.    "If the British government does not come up with a  convincing  explanation over the spying, a break in relations is possible,"  he said.    Tehran has strongly protested against the bugging and said  it  would "weaken relations with Britain."    Several newspapers here have urged the government to  reconsider economic ties with Britain, which is Iran's fourth  biggest trade partner.</p>

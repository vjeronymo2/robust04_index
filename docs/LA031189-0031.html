			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EASTERN BANKRUPTCY;  </P> <P> THE GAME PLAN;  </P> <P> AIRLINE MOVES TO RESTORE SOME FLIGHTS  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines, operating under the cover of bankruptcy law, moved Friday to  restore some of its flights even as it continues to face the pickets of  striking machinists and the anger of ticket holders seeking refunds for  canceled flights.  </P> <P> On Friday, the airline said its shuttle flights in the New  York-Washington-Boston corridor were packed with passengers lured by bargain  $12 one-way fares.  </P> <P> This weekend, Eastern said, 40 round-trip flights on other routes will be  restored. The carrier said it will resume flying to 13 of the 18 cities it  serves in Central and South America.  </P> <P> Before the weeklong walkout by its machinists and pilots and the carrier's  Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Thursday, Eastern operated 1,040 flights a day.  </P> <P> "This is the beginning of a new, smaller, restructured and viable Eastern  Airlines," Eastern Chief Executive Phil Bakes said in a prepared statement. "We  will continue to expand operations in prudent, substantial increments."  </P> <P> Eastern said it will begin its new schedule on Sunday with service to Latin  America from Miami. On Monday, Eastern will operate three daily round trips  between Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico; one round trip each between Miami and  LaGuardia Airport in New York and between LaGuardia and Montreal; and 14 daily  round trips between between Boston and Washington. Eastern is also operating a  full schedule of 62 shuttle flights each weekday.  </P> <P> Eastern officials said there will be enough personnel to fly the planes needed  for the announced schedule because some pilots who had honored the pickets of  striking machinists are now seeking to return to work. The union representing  pilots strongly denied that claim.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said that as of Thursday, when the bankruptcy filing  had been made, Eastern had 200 pilots who flew the shuttle and one  three-day-a-week flight to South America.  </P> <P> "Since then, the pilots have been calling in and asking how to report back to  work," she said. "We have more than enough pilots to fly the new schedule."  However, managers were still filling in for striking mechanics, baggage  handlers and other ground personnel, she said.  </P> <P> Some analysts noted that pilots came back to work at Continental Airlines,  Eastern's sister carrier under the ownership of Texas Air Corp., when  Continental was placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983 -- apparently out of  fear of losing their jobs.  </P> <P> Ray Neidl, analyst with the New York brokerage McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei,  said the availability of pilots "is much tighter" now. Nevertheless, he added,  pilots who move to another airline must start at the lowest seniority level and  accept much lower pay.  </P> <P> But the Eastern Air Line Pilots Assn. disputed the notion that enough of its  members are crossing picket lines so that the airline can increase its  schedules. Rather, the union said, the number of pilots reporting for work was  "decreasing."  </P> <P> In a statement, the Air Line Pilots Assn. said Eastern had fewer than 100  pilots available for flight operations, a number that has remained virtually  unchanged since the beginning of the machinists' strike, and that some of those  pilots are management personnel.  </P> <P> ALPA also charged that the company has "stepped up its campaign to threaten,  coerce and otherwise entice pilots to cross (machinist picket lines). This  includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers, which are in  particularly short supply, and phone calls to pilots' homes, attempting to  intimidate pilots, their spouses and even their children, with threats that  their breadwinner will never be able to work again for Eastern."  </P> <P> A ruling late Thursday by a federal bankruptcy judge effectively cleared the  way for Eastern to continue its operations. The judge gave the airline  permission to pay its working employees but made no provision for paying  workers who are honoring machinists' picket lines.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the machinists said they will mount a legal battle to get wages  owed to striking union members. While the airline reorganizes under bankruptcy  court protection, a federal judge must approve all of the company's  expenditures and transactions.  </P> <P> The new crowds on Eastern's shuttle came after the carrier held out the lure of  special fares for business travelers during the week and $12 on weekends.  Previously, shuttle traffic had been almost non-existent with some flights  carrying as few as six passengers. The shuttle normally flies between 4,000 and  6,500 passengers daily.  </P> <P> By Friday morning, an Eastern spokeswoman said, planes were half-filled and by  the afternoon they were going out full.  </P> <P> On other routes where Eastern had maintained a strong presence, competitors  were picking up some business. But other airlines were making no extraordinary  efforts to profit from Eastern's difficulties by adding extra flights or routes  -- primarily because they already had plenty of seats available on existing  flights to accommodate extra passengers and because they don't have aircraft or  crews to spare.  </P> <P> The carrier adding the most flights was Continental -- on routes to Florida  from Newark, LaGuardia and Washington's National Airport.  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines spokesman James Lundy said his carrier has available for sale  63,000 seats out of Atlanta each day and those flights average about 60% full.  On its entire system, Delta's flights are 50% full. "As you can see, we have  plenty of space available," he said. He said Delta is adding two flights this  weekend to San Juan to accommodate cruise ship passengers.  </P> <P> American Airlines was also adding several flights this weekend to San Juan for  the same reason.  </P> <P> In other Eastern matters, a federal judge in New York extended indefinitely his  temporary ban to prevent railroad workers from striking in sympathy with  airline workers. The ban imposed by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr.  will stay in place until he renders a final decision.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday that  the White House staff was continuing to monitor the situation but that  President Bush "is not rethinking" his decision to stay out of the strike.  </P> <P> "I've not heard any discussions" of changing policy and invoking the federal  law that would allow a 60-day cooling off period in the strike, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> "We are disappointed that they haven't been able to work out an agreement with  the unions," he said, "but otherwise, I don't think we have any comment at this  point."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASH SHORTAGE LEADS BRANIFF TO CANCEL PASSENGER SERVICE  </P> <P> Braniff Inc. announced Monday it was ceasing all scheduled passenger service  immediately because a severe cash shortage doomed the airline's bankruptcy  reorganization plan.  </P> <P> William G. McGee, the company's chairman, president and chief executive  officer, said the action was taken to preserve assets while Braniff continues  to develop alternatives, which might include selling the airline.  </P> <P> Braniff halted all passenger service at midnight Monday but will continue and  expand its charter airline service while Merrill Lynch Capital Markets explores  strategic alternatives, McGee said in a written statement.  </P> <P> McGee said Braniff employees would be notified of their individual status.  </P> <P> Braniff filed for bankruptcy court protection Sept. 28.  </P> <P> Braniff, which operated 46 of its 256 pre-bankruptcy flights Friday, was the  first major carrier to file for bankruptcy after airline deregulation in the  early 1980s.  </P></p>

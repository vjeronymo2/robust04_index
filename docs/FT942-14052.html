			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Strong retail sales dash hopes of early reduction in rates Strong growth in UK retail sales in March was yesterday seen as further evidence of a buoyant economic recovery, reducing the chance of an early cut in base rates. The volume of retail sales grew by 0.8 per cent between February and March, compared with market expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise. February's monthly fall in sales was revised to 0.3 per cent, from the 0.5 per cent reported earlier. The changes mean retail sales in March were 3.8 per cent higher than a year earlier, against a revised figure of 2.8 per cent for February. The figures follow the decline in unemployment, announced on Wednesday, and an upbeat survey from the British Chambers of Commerce. Mr John Major, the prime minister, told parliament that 'we are poised for a long period of sustained, non-inflationary growth'. However, the strength of the economy appeared to make it less likely that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, would agree to a further cut in base rates. 'Combined with the other recent signs of robust recovery - manufacturing output, unemployment, business surveys - and the upward revision to average earnings growth in January and February, these figures mean that an early base rate cut is effectively ruled out,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel. The figures came as something of a surprise after the Confederation of British Industry published a downbeat survey of the distributive trades sector earlier this week. This indicated annual retail sales growth in March was slow, as it had been in February. Analysts said that Easter, which straddled March and April this year, may have distorted the seasonal adjustment of the official figures. This may mean that sales will fall back this month when, in addition, the tax increases take effect. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, said: 'The CSO results confirmed our views that March was an excellent month for retail sales. Trading was better than might have been expected in the light of pending tax increases.' Details, Page 11; Lex, Page 18; Bonds, Page 29; Currencies, Page 31; London stocks, Page 40</p>

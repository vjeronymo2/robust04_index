			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 3i and institutions in Pounds 200m link - Co-investment scheme to oversee MBOs and buy-ins over Pounds 10m 3i, the UK's largest venture capital group, yesterday announced a fundamental change in the way it invests in management buy-outs that will involve it for the first time in managing funds provided by UK institutions. In future all of 3i's investments in management buy-outs and buy-ins larger than Pounds 10m will be made alongside five blue chip UK institutions. The co-investment scheme is likely to raise Pounds 100m from the institutions, a sum which 3i will match, giving it an initial Pounds 200m fund. 3i has a policy of not taking controlling stakes in its investments and consequently has passed Pounds 250m worth of deals to other venture capital companies by way of syndications over the past 10 years. The new scheme will allow 3i to retain a greater amount of deals for its own benefit and will increase security of supply of capital for the larger deals. The move follows the group's launch of an Ecu300m (Pounds 227m) European private equity fund last month and signals its increased desire to manage funds for other institutions and not just investments it makes from its own balance sheet. The move could also have implications for other venture capital companies trying to raise new funds but facing growing resistance from institutions unwilling to pay large management fees. The institutions will pay no management fees to 3i. Instead 3i says it will 'share in the performance' of the investments it makes with the institutions, with the greatest part of that remuneration arising when the investment either floats or is sold. 3i has also undertaken to continue managing any investments still within the portfolio after 10 years, the time at which most funds would hand responsibility and direct share ownership to the subscribers. Mr Rupert Wiles, 3i director, said that had the co-investment scheme been in place over the last 10-year period, 3i would probably have passed deals worth only Pounds 100m to other venture capital companies. 'I suspect we will still provide more than we receive in the large management buy-out market, but it will be much closer to parity,' he said. 3i, which is seeking a flotation later this year, has led 35 MBO's of more than Pounds 10m in the four years to the end of 1993. 3i said yesterday its institutional partners in the 3i 94 Large Management Buy-out Plan had declined to be named. It is likely to raise further funds in a similar manner.</p>

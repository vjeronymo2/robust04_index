			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Rabin to avoid radical budget THE FIRST annual budget drawn up by Israel's Labour-led government, to be presented to the cabinet on Sunday, will contain no radical departures from the policies of the previous coalition ousted in the June election, finance ministry officials said. But they said they were drawing up an extensive accompanying package of structural reforms which, taken together with the 1993 budget plans, could help produce the long-term growth promised by Labour when Mr Yitzhak Rabin defeated the Likud party. The ministry's Shk98bn (Pounds 20.4bn) budget proposal, at this stage framed in 1992 prices, is almost Shk5bn less than expected expenditure this year thanks mainly to a sharp fall in Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, an associated cut in housing plans - including Jewish settlements in the occupied territories - and lower debt servicing costs. Labour's promise to channel greater investment to development projects is reflected in a 26 per cent increase in infrastructural spending to Shk1.45bn. But the plan avoids cuts in social and defence spending which together account for more than Shk40bn. The budget deficit is projected at 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with an anticipated 4 per cent this year. Details of the reform package have not been released, but officials said it would include tax reforms, liberalisation of the capital markets, breaking existing monopolies in telecommunications, transport and agricultural marketing, loosening the state's grip on land sales and extending import liberalisation. Jewish immigration to Israel from the former Soviet Union last month was the highest for four months, continuing a trend of gradual recovery from a low point in May, but still only at half the level of a year ago. The Jewish Agency said 4,933 immigrants arrived, a small increase over July but a significant rise over the 3,361 who arrived in May, the lowest monthly total since the wave of immigration began in late 1989.</p>

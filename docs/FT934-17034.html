			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Gardening: The rehabilitation of Stowe's great landscape garden - An 18th century quest for perfection and beauty IT WAS a sale to remember. But luckily lot 3802 did not sell. It was the year 1921, and the end-of-an-era auction of furnishings at Stowe, the ducal palace in Buckinghamshire that had been a powerhouse of 18th century English politics. Lot 3802 was a bridge, Palladian in style, standing at the end of the house's Octagon Lake. Auctioneers Jackson-Stops, of Northampton, gave the bridge an enticing entry in its 1921 catalogue: 'An elegant structure after the bridge at Wilton.' But on the 18th day of the sale were the buyers so sated with statues and furniture that whole buildings were too much? The Temple of Friendship (lot 3804) was among several structures not to sell. Today, Gervase Jackson-Stops, architectural adviser to the National Trust and one of the team rehabilitating Stowe's great landscape garden, searches his grandfather's catalogue for clues to where buildings and statues used to be. Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, and his Grenville heirs never stopped moving them - and renaming them - in their quest for the perfect garden, which would symbolise the blessed union of wealth, power, beauty, intellect and artifice that they and their political allies thought they had bestowed on England. At Stowe every temple and every statue carries its message, often anti-French, sometimes hard to decode, often whimsical, and always extolling enlightenment and liberty. The Temple of British Worthies is a semi-circular exedra, with busts of Bacon, Alfred ('crush'd Corruption, guarded Liberty, and was the Founder of the English Constitution'), Hampden, Sir John Barnard ('an active &amp; firm Opposition to the perncious &amp; iniquitous Practice of Stock jobbing') among its heroes. At the back is a memorial to 'a perfect Philosopher; a faithful Friend, an agreeable Companion, a loving Husband, distinguished by a numerous Offspring' It cautions, 'Reader, the Stone is guiltless of Flattery, for he was not a Man, but a Grey-Hound.' To make a place of pleasure and recreation, that still takes us straight into the mind of the 18th century educated nobility, the best people that money and taste could find worked on the Stowe gardens - Vanbrugh, Bridgeman (the king's gardener), Capability Brown (who began as an under-gardener at Stowe), Kent and Gibbs. Cobham's motto of a pun from the Psalms, Templa quam dilecta (How amiable are thy temples) is apt. What costly fun it must have been to make the gardens and show them off to the smart world. Such play emptied the purses twice. The place was parlous when Lady Kinloss, daughter of the last Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, auctioned the furnishings in 1921 and the new Stowe School bought the house and grounds. Already in 1848 there had been a sale in bankruptcy, after generations of prodigious expenditure on Stowe - plus the burden of entertaining Queen Victoria in 1845. With an anonymous gift of Pounds 2m as a starter, Pounds 4.5m from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, grants from English Heritage, an appeal and a kitty that has reached Pounds 11m - although more is needed to complete Phase I by a 2005 - the trust has been hard at work resurrecting the 18th century temple of delights. The first task was to map any structures that survive or remnants of them, with test digs by trust archaeologist Angus Wainwright as checks. He has found, for instance, the site of the Pyramid, which Cobham started building in 1726 to honour Vanbrugh. By 1786 Thomas Jefferson noted that it had been: 'Almost entirely taken down by the late Lord Temple, to erect a building there, in commemoration of Mr Pitt, but he died before beginning it.' Wainwright proposes a square mound to mark the site of this unusual short-lived building. One statue site was easy to find 'because it has been hit by mowers so often', said Jackson-Stops. It was less clear if the figures had been The Wrestlers or Hercules and the Lion. In this detective work old hollies and yews are a clue to where the walks were, and the Stowe papers in the Huntington Library in California (which bought them after they had circulated for years on the London market in the 1920s) are a rich source, which Jackson-Stops and his team are quarrying. If you saw Stowe three years ago, it is astonishing how much the trust has done since work started on the ground. Vistas have reopened - by trimming trees and clearing undergrowth - that tie the monuments to each other and impose a conceptual and visual unity across the acres. Look through the Aurelian Arch (or Doric Arch) to the graceful Palladian Bridge and you see on the horizon the contrast of Stowe Castle - an edifice emblematic of English martial virtue - in a blend of might and art that we know in Pericles's Athens and Louis XIV's France. The trust has also cleaned the lakes and the infant River Alder that flows through the glade of the Elysian Fields and relates the Temple of the British Worthies to the Temple of Ancient Virtue, linked by the Monument to Captain Cook who, in a sense, gave Britain the world. The Cook Monument has been moved. 'We must put him back on his island,' Jackson-Stops said. And Cobham's ha-ha wall, designed to resemble fortifications in the early days of artillery, is being rebuilt at Pounds 150 a yard by a community action team of unemployed under a paid staff member. Bath &amp; Portland Stone is supplying the stone. There are only three miles to go. From the hill behind the Worthies, the Gothic Temple (a building derived from the symbol-packed Triangular Lodge at Rushton) the only monument at Stowe in ironstone, looks across the Octagon Lake to the Temple of Friendship, with its busts of Cobham and his political allies epitomising the Whig coterie that ran the country. Ancient Virtue is now restored, with statues of four great Greeks to suggest that concept dear to the English; that life's standards never change. Next is Concord and Victory, originally the Grecian Temple but altered to commemorate successes over the French in the Seven Years War. Its sculptured pediment, showing the four corners of the earth bringing tribute to Britannia, was lifted from the Palladian Bridge, and cut to fit the new space. This temple is in a desperate state and will cost Pounds 1.6m to restore which, even so, will not retrieve its columns which the school took to put in the chapel. The papers in the Huntington Library give a vivid picture of the garden in its heyday (before the school tuck shop had replaced the menagerie or the sports ground poached the site of the walled garden). In 1809 a man was convicted of stealing 'the whole of a (lead) hand from the statue of Neptune' and 'the trumpet from the hand of one of the muses at the Aurelian Arch'. Given the choice of transportation or joining the 14th regiment, he signed up. Frank Thomson, the head gardener, standing in his office, beside the head of Lord Cobham which fell off his Monument when lightning struck in 1957, told me he had recognised gardeners' names in the 18th century that still carry on at Stowe. And he could explain to befogged academics in the Stowe group the practicalities of 18th century gardening - even if he cannot now marshal the labour that planted 13,200 larches one year. The nurserymen's bills among the Huntington papers will help the trust in replanting. It is a surprise how much colourful planting Stowe had under the trees. In a few years our notions will change when we see dogwoods, roses and honeysuckles as they were 200 years ago. Stowe followed the fashions in planting and was eager for new species - such as pineapples, snowberries and fern-leaved beeches and limes - which were tried first in the kitchen garden. An American border was kept for transatlantic introductions such as 100 'Accacia of Virginia' which cost Pounds 2.10s in 1755. The plants from abroad are yet another sign that, already in the 18th century, the world was Britain's oyster. Stowe Landscape Garden (National Trust) is open in school holidays and breaks, 10am-6pm (or dusk, if earlier) and, until October 20, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 10am-5pm. The House (Stowe School), with a grand view of the gardens from the South Loggia, is closed until next year.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OFF STAGE  </P> <P> British actress Julie Covington, whose recording of "Don't Cry for Me,  Argentina" was a worldwide hit, has pulled out of an Australian production of  "Evita" where she was to play Eva Peron for the first time. Covington, 42,  suffered a stress fracture, the show's producers said Sunday without being more  specific. Covington, who recorded the original "Evita" album 13 years ago,  arrived in Sydney, Australia, in a blaze of publicity. However, the Australian  media of late has been carrying reports of friction with producer Thomas  Guerra. Stephanie Lawrence, who played Eva Peron for three years on the London  stage, will take Covington's place in the show, which is scheduled to open July  18. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

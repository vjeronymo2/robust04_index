			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATORS SEARCH DESTROYER FOR CLUES TO FATAL FIRE  </P> <P> Naval investigators searched the fire-scarred interior of the guided missile  destroyer Conyngham on Wednesday in an effort to determine what set off the  blaze that killed one sailor and injured 18 others.  </P> <P> A team of investigators and Naval Investigative Service agents were  interviewing crew members and examining the ship.  </P> <P> The fire erupted in one of the Conyngham's four boilers as it was being lit  during routine maneuvers early Tuesday about 80 miles off North Carolina.  </P> <P> Capt. Paul Hanley, senior public affairs officer for the Atlantic Fleet, said  the ship was preparing for an inspection when the fire occurred. He did not  know of any previous mechanical problems aboard the ship.  </P> <P> The investigation will focus on equipment, procedures and events leading up to  the fire, he said. The investigative team is headed by Capt. Raymond Sharpe  Jr., commander of Destroyer Squadron 10 in Norfolk.  </P> <P> The crippled 437-foot destroyer was towed into Norfolk by the Opportune, a Navy  salvage ship, early Wednesday morning. About 200 family and friends greeted the  crew members in what Navy officials called an emotional reunion.  </P> <P> A dark, blistered area on the ship's starboard side bore evidence of the  roaring fire. One sailor told his mother the flames became so hot that metal  decks bubbled and firefighting masks on sailors melted.  </P> <P> The fire started in the forward boiler room and was fed by diesel fuel, said  Capt. Joseph Perrotta Jr., skipper of the Normandy, which assisted the  Conyngham.  </P> <P> Perrotta praised the Conyngham crew, saying crewmen's firefighting efforts kept  weapons and ammunition areas cool. At no time was ammunition in danger of being  set off, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Moves to make UK more attractive - Non-residents Changes are proposed to the rules for taxing the income of non-residents from transactions carried out through investment managers and brokers in the UK. The changes will ensure that the non-resident faces no liability to tax beyond tax, if any, deducted at source. They will apply to income arising on or after April 6, 1995. The chancellor's intention is to enhance further both the attractions to non-residents and the international competitiveness of the UK investment management industry. At present, tax chargeable on a person not resident in the UK can be assessed on a person acting as agent for the non-resident in the UK. This rule does not apply to income from either: Transactions carried out through a broker, or Investment transactions carried out by an investment manager, provided those services are rendered in the normal course of the trade as a broker or investment manager and for full remuneration. The exclusion of investment transactions from the rule above does not apply if the non-resident is either the sole client of or connected with the investment manager. The chancellor proposes in his Budget to correct a technical defect in the provisions in the Finance Act 1993 permitting members of Lloyd's to set up a new-style special reserve fund. As no arrangements permitting new-style funds have been approved by the Inland Revenue the amendment can be treated as always having had effect.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Zhanna </F> Oyshibayeva: "Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council Explains  Position of Deputies"]    [Text] Our readers are now familiar with the text of the  statement of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan  which expresses a lack of confidence in the socioeconomic and  legal policy of the government and contains a call for dialogue  among all branches of power. On 31 May in the Supreme Council a  news conference was held by Deputy Chairman of the Supreme  Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan Marat Ospanov with  journalists. As he admitted, this was his first meeting with the  press. The occasion was Marat Ospanov's desire to explain to the  mass media certain details and circumstances related to the  aforementioned statement.    What factors motivated the members of parliament to do this?  At the news conference Marat Ospanov gave these explanations.  The Supreme Council is in favor of market reforms and in general  supports the president's course. But our economy is in a  lamentable condition today. In its statement the Supreme Council  notes that this is blocking the movement toward the market. The  work of the government has become ineffective; it has no unified  team. Good ideas are quickly dispersed as the team members pass  them on from one to the other. Taking these and other facts into  account, the members of parliament decided to make the  statement. The draft of it was discussed in two stages. In the  first it was decided how constitutional the statement would be.  In the second they discussed the form for transmitting it. The  discussion, in Marat Ospanov's words, was lively and  interesting. First the document was brought up for discussion by  the committee; after that it was considered by the deputies, and  then the plenary session and the editorial commission.    It was also noted that the Supreme Council cannot work in  isolation; it needs contact with the president and his team.  After all, the Supreme Council is not calling for the  resignation of the government, since it does not have the  constitutional right to do that. Now the authors of the  statement are impatiently awaiting the response from the  president.    How did Nursultan Nazarbayev react to the statement? This  question was answered by Konstantin Kolpakov, the president's  personal representative. "At my own risk," Konstantin  Anatolyevich remarked, "I will say that the president addressed  the statement calmly and attentively. And in general this  expression of a lack of confidence in the government  socioeconomic and legal policy was not a surprise to Nursultan  Abishevich. He supports the desire for cooperation and dialogue."</p>

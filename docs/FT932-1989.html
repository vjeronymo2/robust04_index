			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Earnings warning from Nike hits shares NIKE, the US sports footwear manufacturer, expects to report earnings in the year ending May 1994 significantly below Wall Street expectations, due to weakness in European economies and a sluggish US retail sector. The news, issued after the New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, sent Nike's shares plunging by some Dollars 4 7/8 in late, off-exchange trading, to around Dollars 62. The shares had ended the regular session up around Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 67. The company said Wall Street analysts had been expecting it to make around Dollars 5.50 a share. Its announcement followed bad news from Reebok International, one of Nike's leading rivals, which said last week it expected to report second quarter earnings of 44 cents to 48 cents, compared with analysts' expectations of 56 to 60 cents. Factors behind Reebok's warning included a lack of a product in the key basketball area and European weakness. Mr Philip Knight, chairman of Nike, said the European economic problems, combined with a stronger US dollar, had made the company cut its international growth expectations for the year.</p>

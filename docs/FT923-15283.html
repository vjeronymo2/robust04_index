			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (5): Turn of the tide - The long war against the left is over WARFARE is not too strong a word to describe what has been going on in Liverpool politics these past 10 years. The good news is that the war probably passed its turning point on May 7. The bad news is that the resultant political stability is at best fragile. Yet confidence of every sort depends on it. May 7 was local government election day in England and Wales. In Liverpool, 20 left-wingers stood against official Labour candidates. A year before, six had stood and five had won - at a time when Liverpool city council was engaged in a series of bitter strikes by town hall trade unions opposed to 3,000 redundancies needed to reduce overstaffing. This year's battle was a Pyrrhic victory for Labour: only one of the left-wingers was elected but enough of them split Labour's vote to let the Liberal Democrats through in seven seats. With a Labour net loss of two seats, the new council has 40 Labour members, 37 Liberal Democrats, 18 left-wingers, two Conservatives, one Liberal and one Social Democrat. The centre - Labour and Liberal Democrats - can therefore control policy. Thus, the crucial question for the governability of the city is: will the centre hold? There is no formal alliance and consensus is not easy. Labour leads and is opposed by the left. The Liberal Democrats can decide, issue by issue, whether or not to support Labour and have already carried out one damaging ambush at sub-committee level. To make matters worse for Labour, the party whip is currently withdrawn from five of its 40 members over past refusals to toe the party line. To run the council - and be allocated the majority of committee and sub-committee seats - the five have had to 'sign up' with the Labour group, even though they face disciplinary action by the party's national executive and possible expulsion. A rash of probationary forgiveness of past political sins now seems likely. This is essential for Labour. Next year is a blank in the local government election cycle, so there will be no opportunity to defeat any more of the remaining 18 left-wingers before 1994. While uncertainty may therefore appear the only certainty, there has nevertheless been a decisive shift of power from the left to the centre. Moreover, management - led by Mr Peter Bounds, an able council chief executive who earned his spurs in the strikes - has re-established control over the council's workforce. In effect, Liverpool is governable again, after eight years of being run or at least manipulated by the left, mainly for the benefit of left-dominated town hall trade unions. To the government, opposition parties, business leaders and many ordinary people, Mr Harry Rimmer, Labour's leader, is the man who deserves most of the credit. At 64 and plagued by summer asthma, he is an unlikely-looking champion - a former electrical maintenance foreman and deputy leader of the abolished Merseyside county council, who was persuaded back into local politics to help clean up the chaos left by Militant's influence on the Liverpool party. He has several younger supporters now coming through. These, in time, may vie to succeed him, but his has been the will to tackle Liverpool's most pressing political problem: who runs the city? In Labour terms he is a moderate. Moderation was, however, the last thing he could afford. Mr Keva Coombes, his predecessor, had tried to balance left and right in the party after Labour had won 67 of the council's 99 seats in 1988. Mr Rimmer realised early on there were too many left-wing fundamentalists in the group for Mr Coombes's balancing act to succeed. Two years ago, he built a base of support and ousted Mr Coombes. This split the Labour group, and supporters of the left were later expelled by the national executive. That, in turn, laid the ground for Mr Rimmer to tackle the truculent and largely unmanageable town hall trade unions, several leaders of which were known Militants or supporters of other left-wing groups. Battle had to be joined because the district auditor, the government's watchdog on local government spending, had warned the council it was more than 10 per cent overstaffed and in danger of illegal overspending if it did not reduce its payroll. Even Mr Rimmer was unprepared for the bitterness of the battle as the council sought to impose compulsory redundancies. 'I thought I knew how it was, but it was much more sinister,' he says. 'Managers and supervisors were intimidated and terrified of some of the shop stewards and their supporters.' The council fought last year's strikes with government support. Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, said any demonstration by the council of a will to manage was bound to improve business and investor confidence in Liverpool. The City was briefed to ensure money market support if cash was needed. The strikes lasted seven months, but the redundancies eventually went through, in spite of crises and near-chaos caused by more than 12,000 tonnes of rubbish piling up in the streets and the storming and occupation of council buildings by some strikers. 'The strikes were ruthlessly conceived and we never expected them to last so long,' Mr Rimmer says. 'The key for us was ensuring Liverpool met its financial commitments - in spite of a strike in the Treasury - and so retained the confidence of the City.' He believes victory has dispelled doubts about governability, in spite of the fragmented council. When the Labour Party determinedly stands against trade unions - and wins - in a place with Liverpool's tradition of worker solidarity, it signifies a political sea change. Mr Rimmer's personal and political courage is widely admired. 'We had to show that elected councillors were in charge. What we did was right,' he avers. 'It's not just business leaders who tell me this, but ordinary people in the street. 'They stop me, perfect strangers, and shake my hand and wish us well. Sometimes, after a depressing day, I used to go home and wonder how I ever got into this, but now I know we have such widespread support there are very many fewer days like that.' Liverpool's financial stability has now been largely restored after the chaos caused by deliberate overbudgeting in the Militant era. Foreign banks, impressed by both Mr Rimmer and Mr Mike Storey, the Liberal Democrat leader, have even rescheduled some debt to give the city extra breathing space. Underlying problems of urban decline and regeneration are now being tackled with private sector and government support. The fragmented council may even be a blessing. It is forcing political consensus on the centre and marginalising extremists. Almost certainly, the Militant-driven confrontation of the mid-1980s cannot emerge again.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa SPP improves to SKr531m TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurance group, reported an operating profit of SKr531m (Dollars 88m) for 1991, representing a five-fold increase on the previous year when the group suffered heavy losses on share investments. However, the operating profit is still well below the level achieved in 1988 and 1989. Trygg-Hansa SPP said its 1991 figures were seriously hit by losses in Gota, the Swedish commercial banking group which showed heavy credit losses in the real estate and finance company sectors. The insurer, which owns 43.5 per cent of the share capital and 48.3 per cent of the voting rights in Gota, made a SKr1.5bn bid for the outstanding shares in the banking group a week ago in an attempt to quell doubts about Gota's financial stability. The insurance group plans to pay for the Gota shares with a new issue of its own shares and will issue SKr3bn in convertible debentures later this year in order to strengthen its capital structure. Gota's heavy losses led to a SKr850m loss for Trygg-Hansa SPP last year, curbing the recovery in the group's operating profit. However, Trygg-Hansa SPP said the profit from its underlying insurance business - which is predominantly consumer insurance - reached a record level, increasing by 50 per cent to SKr931m, against SKr621m in 1990. Premium income increased by 13 per cent to SKr7.47bn and Trygg-Hansa SPP said its growth in costs slowed to SKr2.008bn, compared with SKr1.789bn in 1990, contributing to the improvement in the insurance results. The board proposed maintaining the dividend at SKr4.</p>

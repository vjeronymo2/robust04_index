			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: Characters' search for the meaning of life THE HEATHER BLAZING by Colm Toibin Picador Pounds 14.99, 245 pages THE END OF THE CENTURY AT THE END OF THE WORLD by C K Stead Harvill Pounds 14.99, 220 pages ENNISCORTHY is a small, unassuming town in south-east Ireland, inland from the relative metropolis of Wexford. In Colm Tobin's fictional universe, however, it sits at the very centre of things. In his first novel, The South, it exerted the main gravitational pull; now it is the hometown and point of moral reference for the main character of The Heather Blazing - Eamon Redmond, respected judge in the Irish High Court, devoted husband and perplexed father. Redmond struggles to disentangle his past from his present. He is a pillar of the legal establishment, buoyed up by his respect for the law and the Irish constitution; every summer he leaves Dublin to return to his roots and increasingly to worry away at the events that have shaped him. These twin narratives unfold in parallel. The death of Redmond's mother when he was a child, the painful final illnesses of his father and uncle, his own climb up the legal ladder, his marriage, are all counterpointed with the realisations and reconciliations forced upon him in old age, as he comes to terms with his daughter when she becomes an unmarried mother and as he faces up to his life after his wife's death. Tobn writes with marvellous, cool precision. The quiet desperation of his characters and the exactness with which he describes their most mundane activities recalls John McGahern's equally laconic prose. Redmond's survey of his life is etched against minute descriptions of place; the sea gnaws constantly at the Wexford coastline, and the houses and farms that framed Redmond's childhood slip remorselessly down the cliffs. The pulling together of the threads, the naturalness with which the judge is finally allowed to make his peace with the world, are achieved with an eloquence that takes one by surprise with its intensity. In its understated way, Tobn's art as a novelist is both supremely confident and hugely accomplished. CK Stead's multi-layered story is a similar interweaving of private and public, but set against the background of New Zealand politics over the last quarter century. Its leading players, former lovers and alternate narrators, are Dan Cooper and Laura Barber, he a former radical and now a Labour minister, she a former tennis champion and now a mature student working on a monograph on the shadowy life of a local novelist. They set out on adulthood at the height of 1960s optimism, and now suffer the disillusions of 1990s middle age, watching marriages founder and friends slip away. Stead's burrowings into the minds of his characters and the neat switches of perspective, from one narrator to another and from one version of past events to its polar opposite, are the book's strengths; its evocations of the 1960s, studiedly ironic, are the weakness. At times it seems to be conceived as an intricate game; distinctions between fact and fantasy, between the novel itself and the novel Laura begins to write, are self-consciously blurred. Somehow, though, an awful lot rings true.</p>

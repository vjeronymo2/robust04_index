			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Ukraine nuclear pact in doubt Ukraine's agreement to rid itself of nuclear weapons remained in doubt yesterday as both government officials and opposition spokesmen in the capital Kiev blew cold on the deal promoted as the centrepiece of the summit between presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow tomorrow and Friday. Mr Yuri Sergeyev, the Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman, said that 'the form (of the agreement) has not yet been fully worked out'. A document other than a formal agreement could be signed at the ceremony planned in Moscow on Friday between the US and Russian leaders and the Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition nationalist Rukh party, told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency that 'president Kravchuk has no authority to sign such an agreement. Nuclear policy is for parliament to work out'. Both parliament and the president are up for election this year - the legislature in March and Mr Kravchuk in June. Fears of Russian expansionism, as well as nationalist demands that Ukraine remain a nuclear power, have invalidated pledges Mr Kravchuk has previously made. Russian officials were also sceptical about the agreement being signed - or, if signed, fulfilled. Mr Vladimir Lukin, the Russian ambassador to Washington, said in Moscow that 'there is an agreement but there are several difficult precedents' of such agreements breaking down. The agreement in principle would see the 1,800 of Ukraine's nuclear warheads returned to Russia over the next three years, in return for a complex and extensive package negotiated by the US and finally agreed in Washington last week by officials from all three countries.</p>

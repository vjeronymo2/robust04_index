			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japan's new government  under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will uphold the trade policy  of his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, a senior trade ministry  official said Monday. The basic framework of the ruling  coalition will be the same under the Hata government, to be  inaugurated later Monday, Hideaki Kumano, vice international  trade and industry minister, told a press conference.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will  focus "in earnest" on implementing macroeconomic steps and  deregulation in line with goals Japan set in the 15.25 trillion  yen stimulus package released in February and in a  market-opening package adopted last month, Kumano said.    MITI will make particular efforts to deregulate  distribution,  information and telecommunications as well as land policy.    On trade issues with the United States, he said Tokyo will  continue to seek an early reopening of the stalled trade  "framework" talks through more dialogue.    Washington has repeatedly said since February's collapse of  the framework talks that "the door is still open," while Japan  has stressed the need for "more efforts at communication,"  Kumano said.    On reported new U.S. framework proposals made at an April 15  meeting between Hata as foreign minister and trade  representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Kumano said  both parties agreed to keep the content of the talks secret.    Kumano denied reports that MITI will send a ranking official  to Washington after the holiday season next week to respond to  the reported U.S. proposals. "Nothing has been decided on the  issue," he said.</p>

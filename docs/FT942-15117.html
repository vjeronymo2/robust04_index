			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Relief on CGT The table below shows how the new Pounds 10,000 transitional CGT indexation relief might apply. (See Serious Money on page II). The concession allows the investor to obtain relief for losses attributed solely to indexation on sales of assets made between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995. Such losses had been disallowed by the November Budget. The concession will benefit only those with enough unrelieved capital gains to need the relief. And they will have a fresh incentive to bed and breakfast suitable shares before April 6 1995.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CGT INDEXATION EXAMPLE       1993/94    1994/95  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Chargeable gains              14,800      9,800 Allowable losses (excluding indexation losses from Nov 1993          -2,000     12,800  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual exemption assume unchanged for 1994/95                   -5,800     -5,800 Taxable gains                  7,000      4,000 before relief                  7,000      4,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Indexation losses (ie losses attributable to indexation) on sales from Nov 30 to April 5:       12,000 Relieved in 1993/94           -7,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Indexation losses on sales 1994/95:              6,000 Add unrelieved 1993/94: 12,000 - 7,000                 5,000                               11,000 Limited to max                10,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance of indexation loss to claim for 1994/95: 10,000 less '93/94 7,000                      -      3,000 Gains on which                    -      1,000 tax is payable                    -      1,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:Touche Ross  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

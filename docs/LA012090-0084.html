			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOX TV PLANS 5 NIGHTS OF PROGRAMMING;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE YOUNG NETWORK WANTS TO EXPAND ITS PRIME-TIME SCHEDULE BY FALL.  </P> <P> The fledgling Fox TV network is planning to expand to five nights a week of  programming by this fall, the company said Friday.  </P> <P> Fox, seen in Los Angeles on KTTV Channel 11, currently is up to three nights of  regular, weekly, prime-time programs -- Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The  so-called "fourth network" debuted in October, 1986, with the late-night,  ill-fated Joan Rivers show.  </P> <P> "Our hope is to be at five nights by fall," Peter Chernin, president of Fox  Entertainment Group, told a gathering of the nation's TV columnists at the  Registry Hotel.  </P> <P> He said that the network, owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, is shooting  for seven nights a week within two years.  </P> <P> "We're a little ahead of schedule," Chernin said.  </P> <P> The first new full-scale night of Fox shows will be Wednesdays, he added.  Chernin said that he expected the previously announced Wednesday lineup -- a  mixture of feature films, TV movies and miniseries -- to go weekly by late  summer or early fall.  </P> <P> "It will probably be 60 to 40% in favor of theatricals at the start, shifting  to 60 to 40, or 70 to 30% in favor of made-for-TV films over a period of time,"  he said.  </P> <P> As for the fifth night, "most of our thinking has been leaning toward Fridays,"  Chernin said, adding that its programming would be regular series.  </P> <P> If Fox's plans come off as scheduled, that would mean the young network would  fail to be represented only on Tuesdays and Thursdays by fall. Tuesday is the  power night of competitor ABC, with its high-rated lineup led by "Roseanne."  Thursdays are dominated by NBC and its smash-hit schedule propelled by "The  Cosby Show."  </P> <P> Chernin also disclosed that three new, weekly Fox series -- including one from  Francis Ford Coppola -- will be launched "in the next two to four months."  </P> <P> Coppola's one-hour series is "The Outsiders," based on the book by S. E.  Hinton, which was turned into a motion picture by the director. It concerns a  group of impoverished youths known as "greasers" who are in conflict with  youngsters from more affluent backgrounds.  </P> <P> Coppola "was very involved in the making of the pilot and the casting," Chernin  said. He said the director is also involved in the show's stories and reads the  scripts.  </P> <P> The two other new series are:  </P> <P>  -- "Molloy," a half-hour sitcom about a bright, 13-year-old girl commited to  social causes who, after her mother's death, moves in with her estranged father  and his chic Beverly Hills family. Playing the girl is Mayim Bialik, who  portrayed Bette Midler's character as a child in the film "Beaches."  </P> <P>  -- "The Kids Are All Right," a one-hour show focusing on four friends, about  19 years old, who must cope with life after graduation from high school.  </P> <P> Chernin said that the three new series will be given specific time slots after  other shows are either canceled or placed on hiatus.  </P> <P> He expressed delight at the ratings and critical reception of Fox's acerbic new  animated series, "The Simpsons." The show's impact "exceeds all of our wildest  expectations," he said.  </P> <P> Fox, whose sharp focus on the 18- to 34-year-old audience has been praised for  its effectiveness by Madison Avenue, already has established such other  well-known series as "Married . . . With Children," "Cops," "America's Most  Wanted," "21 Jump Street" and "The Tracey Ullman Show."  </P> <P> Chernin said he was uncertain about whether "It's Garry Shandling's Show" may  be coming to an end.  </P></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Key China dissident questioned China yesterday announced it was investigating its most prominent dissident for 'new crimes' in a move that risks further inflaming international criticism of its human rights behaviour. In a terse announcement, the Beijing Public Security Bureau said Mr Wei Jingsheng was 'being interrogated' for repeated violations of the law. The statement, carried by the official Xinhua news agency, said Mr Wei was 'suspected of having committed new crimes when he was deprived of his rights and on parole'. These serious allegations could lead to a fresh jail term for the unofficial leader of China's fragmented dissident movement. Mr Wei, 44, was released on six months' parole last September after serving over 14 years of a 15-year sentence for allegedly transmitting military secrets to a foreign reporter and for 'counter-revolutionary activities'. The possible jailing under new charges of Mr Wei, who first came to prominence in the pro-democracy agitation of the late 1970s, is certain to complicate a decision by President Bill Clinton on renewal of China's lower tariff access to the US market. Mr Clinton said last year that a further extension of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status depended on 'overall, significant improvement' in its human rights behaviour. He is obliged to rule by early June on whether to renew MFN.</p>

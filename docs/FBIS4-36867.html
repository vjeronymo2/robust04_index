			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Halah al-'Isawi] </F>   [Text] The Palestinian police have received the most  up-to-date communication equipment used in the world today. Its  range is up to 560 km. This statement was made by Muhammad  Subayh, the permanent Palestinian representative to the Arab  League and secretary of the Palestine National Council [PNC].  Subayh told AL-AKHBAR that the United States supplied the  Palestinian police with this equipment, which is now being used  in the region and the United States. Therefore, the Palestinian  police force has received all kinds of equipment that will help  it perform its duties properly, including revolvers, machine  guns mounted on vehicles, kalashnikovs, and communication  equipment.    He added that the Palestinian police force is still in dire  need of money to develop their capabilities after power is  transferred to the national authority. The latter will be  concerned with performing the civilized role of a police force,  such as combating crime and drugs, instead of the role of the  occupation police, which was to track down the struggling  citizens.    The Palestinian ambassador said he expects some chaos in  transferring funds to the police until after the transition  period is over. This is in view of the absence of police  stations and posts after the occupation forces had occupied  these stations and turned them into prisons and military camps.  They did not develop or maintain them in any way. Even  previously equipped stations were dismantled and removed when  the Israeli occupation forces evacuated the self-rule areas.    Muhammad Subayh affirmed that there is a temporary agreement  on issuing a Palestinian document on which "laissez passer"  would be written. He said that he believes this is a very  advanced step and that this document will be issued as soon as  possible after the National Authority assumes control and a  certain period of time is allowed for administrative stability.  He said that the laissez passer document will be in Hebrew,  Arabic, and English. He affirmed that it will not carry any  Israeli stamps.</p>

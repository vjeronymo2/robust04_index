During  the function, attendees extensively exchanged views, and  conscientiously discussed transformation of enterprise  operational mechanisms, establishment of a modern enterprise  system, and formation of an entrepreneurs' contingent. They  stated: It is necessary to continue to carry forward the spirit  of daring to be the first in the world advocated by 55 factory  directors and managers 10 years ago to explore the way forward,  deepen enterprise reform, and speed up the pace of establishing  a modern enterprise system.    Jia Qinglin, provincial CPC committee secretary and  governor,  attended and addressed the function. He said: March 24 is a  day which deserves commemoration by entrepreneurs. Ten years  ago today, 55 factory directors and managers jointly urged the  higher authorities to delegate power. They played a promoting  role in enterprise reform and evoked greater repercussions in  the society. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, as in various other parts of the country, a  number of enterprises with good management, high efficiency, and  vigorous mechanisms have also appeared in Fujian. In  particular, these enterprises have integrated themselves into  the market economy in accordance with international practice and  accumulated experiences for establishing a modern enterprise  system. This has forcefully promoted sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy.    Jia Qinglin pointed out: To invigorate state-owned  enterprises, medium and large enterprises in particular, the  fundamental solution lies in deepening reform, transforming  operational mechanisms, and establishing a modern enterprise  system. At present, on the one hand, we must grasp well the  implementation of existing measures. On the other hand, we must  continue to explore new ways to further enforce enterprise laws  and regulations, so that enterprises can truly become corporate  bodies which cater to the needs of the market and main market  competitors as well.    In conclusion, Jia Qinglin hoped that the majority of  entrepreneurs will continue to carry forward the spirit of  daring to be the first in the world, and the spirit of  initiative, self- reliance, self-support, and self-renewal, and  rely on and unite with the broad masses of workers and staff  members to explore how to run modern enterprises. CPC  committees and governments at all levels, relevant departments,  and various quarters in the society must show concern for,  support, and cherish entrepreneurs, and create a fine  environment and conditions for carrying out enterprise reform  well.</p>

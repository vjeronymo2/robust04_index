			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Wooing starts in great share sale The task facing Mr Michel Pebereau, recently appointed head of Banque Nationale de Paris, is to make business as usual sound exciting and glamorous, as he sets about persuading investors to buy the shares. Mr Pebereau admitted the bank had a problem with profitability - net profits in the six months to June 30 fell 61 per cent to FFr 522m - but that was because of the economic climate. An improvement was already on the horizon. 'Our small corporate clients are less pessimistic and there has been a slight improvement in the residential property market,' he said yesterday in an interview with the Financial Times. For the bank, this year was proving difficult and 1994 would not be easy; a sustained recovery in profits would probably start in 1995. Such short-term worries aside, the bank merely needed 'classic management strategy', building on its strengths as both a banque de proximite - or neighbourhood bank - and as an international bank for big clients. Mr Pebereau drew a clear distinction between his former role as boss of Credit Commercial de France, which he repositioned as specialist banker to the entrepreneurial classes, and the job he faces at BNP. 'CCF is a medium-sized bank which can move quickly into market niches. BNP is a far larger bank which is preoccupied by market share.' BNP pins a good part of its future on the continued role of the neighbourhood bank in France. The fact that each of its 2,000 branches caters for a wide range of customers - from a company president to the worst-paid of his employees - was a marketing challenge, not a strategic problem, said Mr Pebereau. The branch network could be made more profitable by pushing through more insurance products. Some of these would come from Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurer, itself a candidate for privatisation, which has cross-shareholdings with BNP. But better returns would also come from keeping a close eye on the profitability of individual branches. Though the scale of the network would remain the same, 'we will only develop in places where we are profitable, and will close branches where we are not making money.' Why were French banks on the whole less profitable than those in other European countries? 'We're not over-manned,' said Mr Pebereau. Measurements of individual productivity showed BNP comparing well with its foreign rivals and it was ahead of many of them on information technology. Costs were relatively high in relation to revenues by international standards largely because French banks' prices for their services were low. That might change as the attitude of non-profit-making institutions, such as Credit Agricole and other mutual banks, became more commercial. The needs of local clients were an important factor in BNP's alliance with Germany's Dresdner Bank. The other aim of the relationship with Dresdner was to ensure that the two emerged as members of what Mr Pebereau believes will be a small group of leading international banks, perhaps eight in all. Mr Pebereau reeled off a list of the four types of international clients the two banks would target and the six types of service he hoped to sell them. Just as significant, however, are the things he is not proposing to do on the international scene. His neighbourhood banking ambitions are confined to France, so such interesting oddities as Bank of the West, a retail bank BNP owns in northern California, will remain just that: an interesting oddity, to be developed internally but not expanded even as far as southern California. He has no desire to set up a big trading operation, implying that revenues will continue to be heavily dependent on interest income. And he does not expect to break into the international mergers and acquisitions business, despite handling a large number of small and medium-sized deals in France. French retail investors are being offered a simpler message. Though a price for the offering will not be announced until October, the television commercials are already running using the slogan: 'Let's grow together'. The trick is to keep the togetherness and still achieve the growth.</p>

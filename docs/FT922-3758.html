			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Lower phone bills likely as Oftel tells BT to cut prices LOWER PHONE bills are in prospect after BT, the telecommunications group, was told yesterday to accept a tough new pricing regime or face investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, proposed that BT should be forced to cut the average level of its prices by 7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, compared with 6.25 points at present. Given the current level of inflation at 4.3 per cent, this would mean many customers would receive cuts in their phone bills. In order to help small customers, connection charges would be cut to Pounds 99 from the present Pounds 152.75 and a more generous scheme would be introduced for those who seldom use the phone. Moreover, BT, which wanted to increase line rental charges by 8 points more than inflation annually, would only be allowed to increase them by 2 points. In making its proposals, Oftel wants to ensure that residential customers share the benefits of price cuts. It also wants to help the company's rivals compete against it. The overall package, which is harsher on BT than expected, is the testament of Sir Bryan Carsberg before he leaves his post as Oftel director-general at the end of this week to head the Office of Fair Trading. The proposals have been strongly influenced by widespread criticism that BT's profits - Pounds 3.07bn in the last financial year - are excessive and that domestic customers have received a poor deal since the company was privatised in 1984. Even so, business customers would still be the main beneficiaries of the regime, seeing their bills fall by about 10 percentage points below inflation each year. The average residential customer would receive a 3 per cent cut in real terms. The tougher regime, which would start next year, is expected by Oftel to cut BT's profitability - as measured by return on capital employed - from about 22 per cent in the last financial year to between 16.5 and 18.5 per cent over four years. BT said the proposals were 'harsher than we expected and raise some serious business issues which will take time for us to evaluate'. Privately, executives are accusing Oftel of gross interference in their business. User groups generally welcomed the regime, while arguing that BT should also have been forced to hand back 'excess profits' to customers by making a one-off cut in prices. BT has been given two weeks to respond. If it refuses to accept the regime, it will be referred to the MMC which can impose a solution. Mr Bill Wigglesworth, who is taking over as Oftel director-general in an interim capacity, said there was little room for negotiation with BT. Oftel also told BT that it would have to publish separate accounts for its main businesses from next year. BT's shares fell 8p to 354p.</p>

Commenting on a report in the local press that the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia invited President Li to attend its  party convention, Chien noted that it would be impossible to  make arrangements for Li to visit a foreign nation in just two  weeks.    The UNITED DAILY NEWS quoted the Ostankino National TV of  Russia Tuesday as saying that the leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party, currently the biggest opposition political  party in Russia, invited Li to attend a party convention  scheduled to open April 2.    Meanwhile, Chien, speaking during an interpellation session  at the Legislative Yuan, reiterated the government's policy of  practicing parallel recognition.    Chien noted that Taipei did not ask the 10 foreign  governments which established formal relations with the Republic  of China [ROC] in recent years to sever diplomatic ties with  Beijing in accord with the policy.    As Taiwan and Mainland China are two separate political  entities under different rule, Chien said, Taiwan should also be  allowed parallel recognition alongside Beijing in major  international organizations.    Chien singled out Vanuatu as an example of the policy.    The ROC and Vanuatu signed a communique of mutual  recognition  on Sept. 26, 1991, despite Vanuatu's relations with Mainland  China.    The communique specified that the two countries would not  intervene in the other's foreign relations.    Chien explained that while there is a large gap between  "recognition" and "formal ties," good mutual relations can be  reached between two nations on the basis on mutual or parallel  recognition, even without formal diplomatic ties, he said.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Logic rules, OK The rash of takeover activity that is spreading across the English-speaking economies could hardly be more different from the previous bid flurry in the late 1980s. Today's mergers and acquisitions are not driven purely by financial logic; nor, again, by the machinations of junk bond operators. The conglomerate tendency that marked so many takeovers in the 1960s is largely absent. What we have in both Britain and the United States is a boring, plain-vanilla takeover surge, chiefly characterised by an outbreak of industrial logic. In the US, the rationalisation of the pharmaceutical, rail and defence industries is largely being driven by takeovers. Often bids constitute a response to regulatory change, such as the Clinton healthcare programme, or to perceived opportunities thrown up by new technology, as with the heady battle for Paramount Communications. In Britain, too, regulatory change has spurred rationalisation in the independent television sector, while the deferred Lloyds Bank marriage with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester could be categorised as a late response to the lowering of the statutory ring-fence that surrounds the building society movement. As for the Commercial Union-Victoire deal, it partly reflects the changing structure of the European single market in insurance. In contrast, unadorned commercial logic explains Tesco's offer for the Scottish food retailer William Low, which inhabits a part of the country in which Tesco is under-represented. Can sweet reason continue to prevail against the natural instinct of investment bankers to urge the marriage of the incompatible with the unmanageable? Probably not, given the fat fees involved. In the US the pace is already intense: at the present rate the value of takeovers in 1994 will exceed Dollars 200bn before the year end. Managers who are inadequately accountable to shareholders are always tempted to swallow the investment bankers' bait because size can bring higher pay, pensions and kudos regardless of industrial logic. Commercial banks are also flush with money to finance new bids. Sure enough, the bid premia are already looking skyward. American Home Products' recent Dollars 8.5bn cash bid for American Cyanamid was pitched at close to 50 per cent above the prevailing market value. In outbidding fellow food retailer J. Sainsbury for William Low, Tesco was hardly erring on the side of parsimony. And the battle for Paramount was a classic tale of corporate egos writ large. Tougher acquisition accounting will in due course help curb over-enthusiastic bidders. Still more desirable would be a requirement on directors to submit bids over a certain size to shareholders for approval. American Home Products' offer was even made before sanction from the full board. The links in the chain of accountability from executives to shareholders are urgently in need of repair.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Money Markets: UK data awaited DEALERS IN the sterling futures market yesterday pondered the possibility that the UK might lower base rates again this year, as they awaited the Bank of England's inflation report and a raft of economic indicators due later in the week, writes James Blitz. Both the June and September sterling interest rate contracts were pushed higher, as dealers took the view that the unemployment data, scheduled for release tomorrow, and the inflation data, expected on Friday, would point to another cut in base rates later this year. Weekend newspaper reports said the Bank would take a hard line on inflation in its quarterly report, and this had pushed sterling futures down on Monday. However, dealers yesterday anticipated that the report, which was issued at 5pm last night, would reflect only mild concern about the prospects for inflation. And they were right to do so. In a chart printed at the end of the report, the Bank projected the inflation rate as remaining within the target band of 1 to 4 per cent outlined by the government for the next two years. 'The changes since the last Inflation Report have lowered slightly both the expected inflation rate and the probability of breaching the 4 per cent limit during the course of this year,' the Bank said. The June short sterling contract finished 4 basis points higher at 93.94 and the September contract closed 7 basis points ahead at the same level. The sterling cash market was more or less unmoved yesterday. Three-month money ended unchanged at 6 1/16 per cent. The overnight rate dropped to about 5 per cent but the market had some difficulty removing a tiny daily shortage of Pounds 350m. In Germany, the Bundesbank left its repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent, compared to some expectations of a rise in the rate. Short-dated Euromark contracts reflected this move. The June Euromark contract rose 3 basis points on the day, closing at 92.88. Dealers anticipated a cut of at least 25 basis points in the discount rate at today's Bundesbank council meeting. German call money also eased marginally, to 7.90 per cent, after the Bundesbank added a net DM6.7bn at its weekly repo operation.</p>

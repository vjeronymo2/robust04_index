A senior Malawi Government official told AFP Mozambican  Defence Minister Alberto Chipande will head his country's  eight-man delegation to the talks.    Malawi's Minister of State John Tembo, who with Chipande is  co-chairman of the Joint Defence and Security Commission of  Mozambique and Malawi, will head the Malawi team.    The Pioneers were forced to flee their homes and bases when  Malawi Army soldiers began disarming them, in retaliation  against the shooting dead of two soldiers in northern Malawi  last month by the Pioneers.    The two countries have not established the number of armed  pioneers in Mozambique, although unofficial figures say up to  1,000 of the 1,500 members of the armed wing of the Pioneers  could have fled to Mozambique.    "We are not talking about numbers. We are anxious to resolve  this matter because it is the Mozambicans who raised the  question of armed Pioneers in their country," said the Malawi  Government official.    President Kamuzu Banda, who established the Pioneers as an  armed wing of his ruling Malawi Congress party and his personal  army, announced January 1 that the two neighbouring countries  would meet to discuss the issue.    "We are anxious to have them safely in Malawi," said Banda,  whose constant call for the Pioneers to return and hand over  weapons to the Army or police has been ignored by the Pioneers.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Fashion: Wrap up your shopping list - A chic scarf makes a good gift If you are still wandering around with a distraught air, wondering what to buy for your nearest and dearest this Christmas, the fashion must-haves for women this winter are squashy hats, an important shirt, and scarves, scarves, scarves. If in doubt, head for a chic emporium where the taste is impeccable and all you need do is select the price bracket. Londoners could pick up a crinkly silk scarf (or better still, three or four in assorted colours to be worn together, Pounds 39 a time), an Equipment silk or, more Christmassy, a velvet shirt or a Prada handbag at Joseph. At Harvey Nichols you will find one of the best costume jewellery counters in town. If her tastes are more avant-garde it is not as well known as it should be that Liberty now has one of the best modern designer floors around (Issey Miyake, Koji Tatsuno, Sophie Malig, Vivien Westwood et al). There is hardly a forward-thinking woman who would not give her eye-teeth for one of Issey's crinkly wraps or skirts, one of Koji's cob-webbed vests. If you can't run to those prices then Whistles and, amazingly enough, C &amp; A and Warehouse, do very passable versions of crinkly gear all their own. Less expensive, but just as desirable, are the crochet-edged cardigans (Pounds 37) at Agnes B, at 111 Fulham Road, London SW3. (Mail order tel: 071-225-3477). And, if you are still flummoxed, let me assure you that nobody ever had too many absolutely plain cashmere sweaters. Brora has round-necked, V-necked and polo-necked sweaters and cardigans for men and women for Pounds 99.50 a time in most classic colours. If you order today (tel: 071-731-7672) it will be despatched in time for Christmas if it has the colour in stock.</p>

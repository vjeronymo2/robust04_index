			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Prescribing practices in NHS attacked The National Health Service could save up to Pounds 500m a year on pharmaceuticals if doctors adopted better prescribing practices, the Audit Commission says in a report published today. The savings would be enough to pay for an additional 80,000 hip-replacement operations a year, according to the commission, which audits local authorities and health service bodies. More than Pounds 45m a year is wasted on prescribing medicines of limited clinical value such as appetite suppressants, nasal decongestants and anti-diarrhoeal drugs. Some general practitioners prescribe four times as many of these pharmaceuticals as others, the commission found. The commission says immediate savings of up to Pounds 425m a year would be possible if every general practitioner prescribed to the average standard of 50 good practices selected from around the country for the report. The highest-spending areas of the country spent 50 per cent more than the lowest-spending areas, even after adjusting for the different ages of the populations covered. In the longer term, savings could rise to Pounds 500m a year if doctors followed a 12-point plan set out in the report. The recommendations include greater use of unbranded, 'generic' medicines and regular reviews of repeat prescriptions and practice prescribing policies. Over-prescribing by family health services (the non-hospital part of the NHS) costs the health service Pounds 275m a year, it is estimated. The report also identifies additional spending on drugs that could save money for other parts of the health service budget. An extra Pounds 75m on inhaled steroids, for example, would improve the health of asthmatic patients and reduce hospital admissions. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry welcomed the acknowledgement that prescribed medicines could reduce total healthcare costs. But it said that the commission appeared to have fallen into the trap of looking at the pharmaceuticals bill in isolation from the rest of the health budget. It said: 'The report's 'headline' figures on allegedly potential cutbacks will have a damaging effect on confidence among both British and overseas companies who supply the health service and use the UK as their base.' The Pounds 3.6bn a year spent by GPs on drugs accounts for 10 per cent of the NHS budget. A Prescription for Improvement. HMSO. Pounds 11.</p>

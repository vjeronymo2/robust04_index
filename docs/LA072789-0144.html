			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2ND-QUARTER DEFICIT CAUSES BULK OF AST'S YEARLY LOSS  </P> <P> AST Research Inc. reported a $7.5-million loss for its fiscal year, a figure  softened somewhat by an unexpected $2.5-million fourth-quarter profit.  </P> <P> The annual loss for the fiscal year ended June 30 is a long slide from the  $15.1-million profit that the Irvine-based personal computer manufacturer  earned in fiscal 1988. The fourth-quarter profit, though double what some  industry analysts had expected, still was down 68% from the $7.7 million earned  in last year's final quarter.  </P> <P> "The results for the fourth quarter were above expectations," said Harvey  Allison, an analyst with the New York brokerage of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Wall Street reacted positively as AST's stock closed Wednesday at $8.875 a  share, up 25 cents from Tuesday's close.  </P> <P> AST's revenue for its fiscal year increased 11% to $457 million this year from  $413 million last year. Its fourth-quarter revenue fell 9% to $123.5 million  this year from $136 million in last year's fiscal fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The bulk of the company's yearly loss came from a poor second quarter, ended  Dec. 31, that resulted in an $8.9-million loss and the termination of 70  workers in Orange County.  </P> <P> "Sometime last summer capacity exceeded demand, and suddenly there were more  products than customers," said Harvey Allison, an analyst with Wertheim  Schroder.  </P> <P> AST has since offered a more advanced personal computer that the company hopes  will improve sales and profits.  </P> <P> "This year the difference is we have a much broader product line," said Bruce  Edwards, chief financial officer.  </P> <P> AST RESEARCH QUARTERLY RESULTS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.66IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Net Income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1st Quarter 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $306,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $108.4 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 2nd Quarter 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($8.9 million)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $110.9 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 3rd Quarter 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($1.3 million)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $113.8 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 4th Quarter 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.5 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $123.5 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

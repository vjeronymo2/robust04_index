			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff correspondent Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 10 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- An  analysis by economists here of Guangdong's economic situation  over the past five months identifies the following new  characteristics: A noticeable drop in rate, breakthroughs in  macroeconomic regulation and control in individual sectors, and  the appearance of many serious problems.    Under the economic development target of catching up with  the  "four little dragons of Asia" which was put forward in the wake  of Deng Xiaoping's southern inspection tour, Guangdong -- in  actual operations -- has eased up on the previously planned  economic retrenchment. Guangdong's economy has been developing  at an extremely high rate over the past three years. Its GDP  rose 17.3 percentage points in 1991, 21 in 1992, and 22 last  year. As its economy grew at high rates, its economic power  increased rapidly, and it now plays a notable role in China's  economy.    However, Guangdong's economic growth obviously has slowed  down since early this year. Its first-quarter GDP growth has  been predicted to be 15 percentage points, compared with the 20  percentage points registered in the same period last year -- a  glaring contrast from recent years.    Experts analyzed that the marked economic slowdown was  caused  mainly by the government's strengthening of macroregulatory and  control measures, tightening of credit, and curbing of building  projects; in addition, fluctuations in policy triggered by the  introduction of various reformist measures this year have played  a role. Against last year's 32 percent growth in first-quarter  industrial output value, this year saw only 21 percent growth --  a drop of 11 percentage points.    Falling industrial development rates have had a direct  impact  on the overall economic growth rate, but also have reduced  longstanding "bottleneck" constraints on the province, resulting  in improvement in the overall economic environment. This is one  new salient characteristic of Guangdong's economic development  this year.    On the other hand, Guangdong has achieved some successes in  macroregulation and control this year, with breakthroughs  registered by individual economic indicators. This is the  positive side to Guangdong's economic development this year.    Government-released figures gave a 51 percent fulfillment  rate for this year's first-quarter fixed-asset investment, up 51  percent, which is lower than in the same period last year,  indicating that the abrupt surge in fixed-asset investment  starting the year before is now under control. Falling  fixed-asset investment is helping to reverse the problem of  economic disequilibrium sparked by excessively rapid growth in  investment.    Guangdong's foreign trade and exports in the first quarter  increased 22 percent from the same period last year to $8.2  billion. Trade surplus from the first-quarter imports and  exports topped $100 million. Such a large margin of increase in  foreign trade and exports has been rare in recent years. The  good situation established by foreign trade mitigated the  contradiction of imbalanced growth between imports and exports  seen last year.    In addition, Guangdong's financial revenue in the first  quarter rose 48 percent, and industrial and commercial tax rates  rose significantly. This has been the one among Guangdong's  several economic indicators registering the greatest growth so  far this year.    However, economic activities in the first quarter also  uncovered many problems. Experts here pointed out that there  would be economic, and even social turmoil if these problems  were not handled well. These problems include:    1. It is clear that industrial production is operating far  below capacity. As the pillars for industrial development, in  terms of production, the province's state-owned budgetary  industries this year have performed very badly. Output value  fell 4.2 percentage points from the same period last year;  profits were down 38 percent, with 43 percent of the industries  suffering losses, up 9 percentage points from the same period  last year. Several factors contributed to this situation:  Shortages in funds forced some factories to maintain production  and fund projects with lending; persistently high prices raised  production costs, with the result that some products ceased to  be competitive in price and were forced out of the market; and  the government adopted the policy of scaling down infrastructure  projects, so many projects could not be launched, sapping the  economic development of reserve strength.    Apart from affecting overall economic growth, a sharp  decline  in industrial production also has aggravated unemployment,  making the problem of slumps in the state-owned enterprise  sector more acute.    2. Greater inflationary pressure: Prices in Guangdong have  continued to rise since early this year, on top of last year's  increase of 18.2 percentage points. Prices in January rose 1.9  percentage points from last December, then another 4.2  percentage points in February, and continued rising in March.  Total social retail prices in the first quarter rose 33  percent, up 4 percentage points from the same period last year  -- a rather steep hike. Factors such as greater inflationary  pressure stimulating growth in consumption power played a role  in this.    3. Shortages in funds have worsened the existing debt chains  in the economic sector and have taken away the necessary support  for economic development. High interest rates across the board  have affected financial order.    4. Agriculture is still beset by hidden problems. Despite a  3 percent agricultural growth last year, Guangdong saw drastic  reductions in major agricultural products, such as grains and  sugar cane. Self-sufficiency in grains has remained an acute  problem this year. Although spring farming enjoyed a good  start, there should be no premature optimism concerning the  prospects for agriculture, as factors hampering development in  agricultural production remain.</p>

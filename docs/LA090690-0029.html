			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS 8-MONTH TRIAL WITH PRIVATE AMBULANCES  </P> <P> Seeking to cut costs and improve emergency response time, the Los Angeles City  Council on Wednesday approved a pilot program under which private ambulance  firms would supplement city paramedic services in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> During the eight-month program, about 4,000 patients in the Valley whose lives  are not in danger will be transported to hospitals by private ambulances, city  Fire Department officials said.  </P> <P> Fire Department dispatchers will continue to send a paramedic van, ambulance or  fire truck on all emergency calls.  </P> <P> At the scene, crews will decide whether the patient should be transported to a  hospital by city paramedics or private ambulance, which would be used if the  injury or malady is not considered serious.  </P> <P> For example, people with broken limbs or cuts and bruises would be candidates  for transport by private ambulance, Fire Department officials said.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief Dean Cathey said if the pilot program works in the Valley, the  department will seek council permission to expand it citywide.  </P> <P> Cathey said emergency calls are increasing about 6% a year in Los Angeles,  forcing the department to add about three new paramedic teams each year.  </P> <P> The department is hoping that transferring some of the work to private  ambulance firms will lower costs and simultaneously improve emergency response  time.  </P> <P> Average response time on emergency calls is 4 1/2 minutes citywide and 5  minutes in the Valley, Cathey said, adding that crews have to travel farther in  the Valley.  </P> <P> Private ambulance firms will bill patients directly, using rates approved by  the city that are virtually identical to those charged by the department,  Cathey said.  </P> <P> A typical five-mile trip to a hospital costs about $150, varying slightly  depending upon the time of day and waiting time, according to a city report.  </P> <P> The pilot program met with an enthusiastic response from the council members,  who considered it a cost-cutting measure.  </P> <P> "At one time I was an ardent advocate of having paramedics do everything,"  Councilman Marvin Braude said.  </P> <P> But with the level of service threatened by rising costs, Braude said he  commended the department for the "judicious manner" in which the pilot program  was developed.  </P> <P> The idea arose during a city administrative office audit of the department,  fire officials said. That audit showed that paramedics were busy handling less  urgent calls, which slowed their response to life-threatening calls.  </P> <P> The program will be open to all city-licensed ambulance companies willing to  operate in the Valley.  </P></p>

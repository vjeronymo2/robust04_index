			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / East German jobs warning Between a quarter and a third of east Germany's labour force will be without permanent work by 2010 unless productivity and competitiveness improve sharply. The east German economy will have to become much more export-oriented to create new jobs, concludes a joint study by the Halle Institute for Research and the Hamburg-based Korber Foundation. The study contradicts more optimistic forecasts released last week by the six economic institutes which advise the federal government. These showed that unemployment in east Germany had fallen to about 15 per cent of the 6.6m-strong labour force and should stabilise at that level. However, the Halle-Korber study says this figure could rise if the privatised sector in particular is not supported by more risk capital. The report says productivity is still only 40 per cent of west German levels.</p>

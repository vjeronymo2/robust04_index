Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports that  the prime minister has not yet officially ordered Rothschild to  travel to Washington next week because he does not see a need to  resume the talks on the Palestinian track in Washington while no  progress is being made in Taba.    Rothschild was appointed after the Americans yesterday made  clear to Rabin that they will send invitations to the  Palestinians as well, and suggested that Nabil Sha'th and Amnon  Shahaq also come to Washington. Jerusalem, however, does not  wish to harm the Taba talks, which are not linked with the  Washington talks. Rothschild was appointed acting head because  the decision on who is to head the delegation to Washington has  not been made yet.</p>

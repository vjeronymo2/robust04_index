			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Hain attacks Labour policies MR PETER HAIN, secretary of the Tribune group of Labour MPs, yesterday claimed that some voters no longer knew what the party stood for, as it had got rid of so many policies since the general election. The party's main weakness, he said, was its failure to provide a credible economic alternative to the government's policies. The MP's comments followed a survey by MORI in yesterday's Times newspaper, showing support for Labour at its lowest level since Mr John Smith became party leader. At 42 per cent in the poll, however, Labour is still 14 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.</p>

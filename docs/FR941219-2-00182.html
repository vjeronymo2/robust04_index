The Directorate has reviewed the chapter for consistency with Regional goals and the mission of the Service. The chapter ensures consistency with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), including the Draft ``Refuges 2003'' Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (March 1993_to be completed in 1995), and the Service's Ecosystem Approach to Fish and Wildlife Conservation (March 1994) and associated National Implementation Guidance (June 1994). The major objectives of comprehensive management planning, as outlined in the chapter, are: (1) To ensure that management of NWRS lands reflects policies and goals of the NWRS and the purposes for which each was established; (2) to ensure that all units contribute to the conservation of biological diversity and to the structure and function of the ecosystem in which they are located; (3) to provide a clear statement of the desired future conditions of the planning unit as it should be when system and individual unit purposes are accomplished; (4) to provide a systematic process to aid decision making by identifying opportunities, issues, and concerns; collecting, organizing, and analyzing information; and developing and considering a range of management alternatives; (5) to aid in determining the compatibility of uses on Service units; (6) to ensure that other Service programs, other agencies, and the public have opportunities to participate in management decision making for each Service unit; (7) to provide a uniform basis for budget requests for operational, maintenance, and capital development programs that accomplish unit and NWRS purposes; (8) to provide a basis for monitoring progress and evaluating plan implementation; (9) to identify unit objectives and management strategies leading to their achievement; and (10) to provide long-term continuity in unit management. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> George T.

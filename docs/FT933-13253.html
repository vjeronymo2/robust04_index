			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ahmanson sells Dollars 1.2bn of non-performing loans HF AHMANSON, the US thrift holding company, is selling Dollars 1.2bn of delinquent, non-accruing single-family real estate loans, and will add Dollars 163m to reserves for certain real estate development projects, AP-DJ reports from Irwindale, California. The loans are being sold to a subsidiary of Bear Stearns. Ahmanson said it planned to raise about Dollars 200m of additional capital to position itself for expansion. Mr Richard Deihl, chairman and chief executive, said the company 'expects to see the earnings benefits of these actions in the third quarter'. He added that, by selling the delinquent loans in a bulk sale, the company benefited by reducing future losses and replacing these non-performing assets with earning assets. As a result of the sale and addition to reserves for property development projects, the company expects a loss of about Dollars 290m for the second quarter and a loss for the year. In the second quarter last year, Ahmanson earned Dollars 67.1m, or 54 cents a share. It expects to be profitable in the third and fourth quarters. The sale will reduce the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets to about 2.04 per cent from 5.02 per cent at its peak last year. The ratio of reserves to non-performing loans will rise to about 129.3 per cent from 27.8 per cent at March 31.</p>

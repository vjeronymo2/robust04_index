			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Barns Are Full,  Cashboxes Are Empty," published in the 14 June issue of the  Skopje daily VECER in Macedonian on page 6, J. Pavlovski writes  that the barley harvest has already begun in some regions in The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), where 64,000  hectares have been sown. The Macedonians expect to harvest  50,000 metric tons of brewery-grade barley, and the Macedonian  breweries need 30,000 tons. The expected yields of various field  crops are about 155,054 tons of barley, 15,000 tons of rye,  1,070 tons of oil-bearing pods, and 798 tons of poppies. The  acreage devoted to bread grains has been increased by about  7,000 hectares for a total of 116,550 hectares. Part of the area  sown has been affected by drought, especially in the Stip and  Sveti Nikole districts, but the overall harvest is expected to  be satisfactory. In fact, according to Pavlovski, the wheat  harvest should set a record for Macedonia. Experts estimate that  the average yields of wheat per hectare will be about 3,500 in  the Pelagonija region, 3,200 in the Skopje region, and 4,000 in  Polog.    Pavlovski notes, however, that a bountiful harvest does not  depend only on weather conditions and the mobilization of  workers and machinery, but is also influenced by the purchase  prices for the crops and the amount purchased. According to  Mioljub Panov, chairman of the "Zito Makedonija" milling and  baking industry, because of the high guaranteed price of 10  denars per kilogram, the purchase of bread grains will be  limited. Eftim Ancev, minister of agriculture, forestry, and  water management, says that, to the extent that that price has  not been accepted by purchasers, the government will pay  producers for the wheat.    The milling and baking industry is reluctant to buy bread  grains not only because of the high prices (FYROM wheat costs  $240.00 per ton, compared to $140.00 per ton for U.S. wheat),  but also because of the increased supply of flour and wheat in  stores, silos, and other storage bins, Pavlovski continues.  According to data as of 30 April, there were 110,000 tons in  reserve. According to Sande Djambazovski, deputy minister of  agriculture, forestry, and water management, the Directorate for  Material Reserves will purchase wheat from this year's crop that  is not bought by the mills.    The purchase of bread grains by the milling and baking  industry is also affected by financial considerations, according  to Pavlovski. Because of unpaid loans, the banks are not able to  extend credits to the milling and baking industry. For the  anticipated purchase of 150,000 tons of wheat, about 1.5 billion  denars will be needed. But that is not all: The state must  secure an additional 300,000,000 denars for the producers. Kiro  Dokuzovski, secretary for agriculture, food processing, and  tobacco industry in the Chamber of Commerce, says that the price  is not the focus of the conflict for the producers, nor is the  fact that they will accept whatever quantities of bread grains  that are needed. He believes that the state must issue orders to  control imports because there is no justification for  uncontrolled imports when the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,  and Water Management is attempting to defend the reserves to  ensure supplies for the market. The producers, however, do not  want to repeat the old practice of not knowing where to get  money at the best rate or, after a long wait, having their  assets devalued.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Chocolate with sex appeal - Chocolate needs an educated palate A love of fine wines is chic. But claim a similar passion for chocolate, and you are likely to be branded a superannuated Ovalteeny. In Britain, the general perception of chocolate - notwithstanding masked intruders abseiling into one's bedroom - is about as sexy as flannel nightwear. Chantal Coady would like to change all that. She is the founder of the Chocolate Society, and proprietor of Rococo, a tiny temple in the King's Road dedicated to chocolate. Coady believes that mass marketing and cheap substitutes for essential ingredients have degraded consumer taste. Chocolate confectionery has been reduced to an amalgam of sugar, fats and chemicals whose association with cocoa is entirely coincidental. The once sensuous, high-tax luxury of aristocratic boudoirs has gone the way of the powdered wig. But, she says, we are now on the brink of a chocolate renaissance. The British, joint third with the Belgians in the league of European chocolate consumers, are waking up to the pleasures of the 'real' thing. Chocolate, like wine, requires an educated palate. It should appeal to the senses even before it reaches the tongue; glossy and fragrant, with a characteristic snap, like tree bark, when broken. It should melt smoothly in the mouth, and have a long 'finish'. Among the painted clouds and plaster putti of Coady's little shop, I was guided through a tasting: from the rich bronze Grand Cru No 1 (Pounds 3.25), with all the 'red notes' of the pure Criollo bean, to the dark blended amer chocolate made with 85 per cent cocoa solids. Coady pointed out the astringent 'green' notes introduced by the Trinitario bean, and woody, citrus or dry flavours inherent in various blends. Next, we sampled chocolate with added flavours. Some combinations were familiar, such as orange or mint; others, like cinnamon, more exotic. But the real liaison dangereuse was the Pink Peppercorn (Pounds 2.50). If one were looking for conclusive proof of chocolate's emancipation from the nursery, this is it: strictly adults only. Rococo's range of chocolate comes in 100gm bars. A selection would make a delicious gift for a 'foodie' friend, and, since Rococo encourages customers to try before they buy, I can also recommend the experience of making the choice. There are, of course, those for whom chocolate has never lost its sex appeal. Charbonnel et Walker, chocolatiers By Appointment, have been in the business of ravishing their clients' taste-buds for over 100 years. Madame Charbonnel was reputed to have been a chocolate lover of no mean status - a royal mistress, no less - and C &amp; W still treats its customers like royalty. Its presentation is as seductive as the chocolate itself. You can fill an exquisite hand-made box covered in moire or Liberty print with a 10 lb assortment (C &amp; W will keep a note of your favourite centres), or house two violet creams in a tiny silk casket. Casanova, who considered chocolate a potent aphrodisiac, would have appreciated the chocolate champagne bottle, nestling in white satin and filled with champagne truffles (Pounds 33). If you want to be more explicit, you can deliver a personal message, in chocolate letters hand wrapped in foil, spelled out among an assortment of filled chocolates in C &amp; W's Boite Blanche (Pounds 33 for 1 1/2 lbs). One customer recently sent a box with the message, 'Ring Me' and a telephone number. C &amp; W is too discreet to reveal the outcome. For Christmas, there are elegant crackers, in seasonal red and gold or the traditional blue and white Charbonnel house style, which slide open sleekly to reveal 4ozs of bittermints (Pounds 11.95 each). And, having cultivated a taste for 'real' chocolate, indulge it further with one of the sublime truffle sauces (original, dark rum, Grand Marnier or Cognac, Pounds 5.75). If you still think chocolate is kids' stuff, you deserve to be confined to the nursery for life.

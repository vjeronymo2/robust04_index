			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Diplomatic sources in Cairo  have stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres agreed in their extensive talks  in Cairo today on the need to overcome the remaining obstacles  preventing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule  agreement.    In remarks to MENA, the sources revealed that only three  points of difference remain to be resolved in the meeting  expected to be held in Cairo between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Tuesday. The three points of  difference relate to the size of Jericho, the Palestinian police  presence on the Allenby Bridge, and the control of the sea area  in Gaza.    The same sources told MENA that the Palestinian and Israeli  sides have agreed on the following:    1. A temporary international presence in Gaza and Jericho by  elements from countries making donations to the self-rule areas,  as agreed upon in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993. These  elements will work as observers and administrative staff to  provide social and other aid, as in the case of Hebron, but the  number of observers is yet to be determined.    2. Regarding the question of Palestinian passports, a travel  document (laissez-passer) will be issued. The word passport  will be written at the top of the document, to be followed by  the words Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority,  abbreviated as PISGA. The document will be valid for three years.    3. It has been agreed that the border point in Rafah is to  remain open 24 hours a day throughout the year to individuals  and goods. The Cairo Agreement will apply at the crossing  points.    4. A safe passage for the Palestinians between Gaza and  Jericho has been agreed upon.    5. Regarding stamps, the sources pointed out that it has  been agreed that stamps bearing the words Palestinian  Self-Government Authority will be issued.    6. Regarding the telephone code, a certain code for the  Palestinian self-rule areas has been designated.    The same sources emphasized that the two sides had agreed on  the air space of the Palestinian Self-Government Authority in  Gaza and Jericho. The sources added that the drafting committee  is holding a meeting that will last until early in the morning  to settle the question of legal jurisdiction.    The sources told MENA that Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres had told 'Arafat that the Israeli troops' withdrawal from  the self-rule areas would start the day after the agreement is  signed in Cairo. Peres believes that there is a possibility of  creating a new Palestinian reality, and this represents a goal  for the State of Israel, the sources added.    The same sources pointed out that at the Egyptian Foreign  Ministry this evening, small teams from the United States,  Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinians are meeting to work out the  arrangements for signing the agreement for implementing  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. Peres has commended the hard  work of Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq, heads  of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations, noting that the two  delegations have made a great accomplishment.    MENA has learned that when 'Arafat enters the self-rule  areas  in Gaza and Jericho, he will hold the title "Chairman of the  Palestinian Authority." Diplomatic sources have told MENA that  during the meetings between 'Arafat and Peres, it was agreed to  discuss the issue of the Israeli army's MIA's and POW's. 'Arafat  promised to exert all efforts in this regard.    MENA has also learned that the committees in charge of the  actual transfer of the self-rule powers will start their work as  of Sunday. The same sources added that Dr. Sha'th and Maj. Gen.  Shahaq will discuss the question of the Palestinian prisoners in  a meeting to be held tonight. They should be able to finalize  this issue by Sunday. The sources pointed out that there is a  general agreement on the number of prisoners and detainees to be  released, adding that the details will be made public on Sunday.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has stressed that the  Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached the end of the road  of negotiations. He added: We thought we could face and combat  terrorism with military measures alone, but now we must create a  new Palestinian reality, and this is the goal of the State of  Israel.</p>

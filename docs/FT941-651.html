			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GKN steps up its pursuit of Westland GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday stepped up its pursuit of Westland after the helicopter manufacturer admitted its operating profits would decline this year. The Yeovil-based company, which is fighting GKN's Pounds 497m bid, said profits from its underlying business would fall from Pounds 35.5m last year to Pounds 35m. Pre-tax profits, however, are expected to increase by 64 per cent to Pounds 50m following a Pounds 15m gain arising out of an initial compensation payment from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation, which is at the centre of a Pounds 385m damages claim filed by Westland. A further Pounds 3.4m profit on a property disposal is expected to be offset by interest payments. Although Westland promised shareholders a 6 per cent dividend increase to 4.75p and a 5p special interim dividend next year to reflect the AOI payment, GKN said the profits forecast was disappointing. Sir David Lees, who has offered Westland shareholders 290p per ordinary share, said: 'I thought there would be something more. Westland has been predicting only good news, but operating profits are forecast to fall.' Nevertheless, shares in the helicopter group, in which GKN already has a 45 per cent stake, rose 7 1/2 p yesterday to close at 325p. Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, said GKN's offer undervalued the company and its prospects for future orders, especially for its flagship EH101 helicopter. He also highlighted potential demand for the Apache helicopter, developed in partnership with McDonnell Douglas, which the group hopes the British Army will order next year. Citing estimates of steadily increasing orders, Mr Jones said: 'An order for Apache would transform these growth prospects, providing the profit potential on an estimated Pounds 2bn of sales.' GKN again accused him of inflating order prospects and pointed out that similar hopes for the Black Hawk helicopter had failed to materialise. Sir David said he would be seeking a meeting with Mr Jones later this week at which he would underline his determination to take control of the group and merge it into GKN's existing defence business. The engineering group has until the end of the week to make a revised offer, but Mr Jones - who predicted Sir David would come up with a 'parsimonious' offer - hinted that some senior Westland managers would step down if GKN won control.

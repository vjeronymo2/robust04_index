In order to arrange such a meeting, call or write to the person identified under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Background and Substance of Petition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Department of the Interior received a letter dated January 31, 1994, from James Kringlen, Attorney at Law, Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, Inc., Charleston, West Virginia, as a petition for rulemaking. The petitioner requested that ``*&blank;*&blank;* a new regulation be issued by the Office of Surface Mining or the Department of the Interior, as appropriate, which would require all permit applications for surface mining include documentation with public records identifying the surface owners of the property they propose to mine as well as the property contiguous to the proposed mining property.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 201(g) of SMCRA, any person may petition the Director of OSM to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any of the regulations implementing SMCRA. Under the applicable regulations for rulemaking petitions, 30 CFR 700.12, this notice seeks public comment on the merits of the petition and on the rule changes requested in the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the close of the comment period, a decision will be made whether to grant or deny the petition. Under 30 CFR 700.12, the Director shall issue a written decision either granting or denying the petition within 90 days of the date of its receipt. Soon thereafter, notice of that decision will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If the petition is granted, rulemaking proceedings will be initiated in which public comment will again be sought before a final rulemaking notice appears. If the petition is denied, no further rulemaking action will occur pursuant to the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Publication of this notice of the receipt of the petition for rulemaking is a preliminary step prior to the initiation of the rulemaking process. If a decision is made to grant the petition, a rulemaking process will be initiated. Thus, no regulatory flexibility analysis is needed at this stage, nor a review under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publication of this notice does not constitute a major Federal action having a significant effect on the human environment for which an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, 44 U.S.C. 4322(a)(c), is needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surface mining, Underground mining. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert J.

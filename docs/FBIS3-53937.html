Dhar] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 10 -- Though the United States and  India both desire that a meeting between President Clinton and  Prime Minister Rao is overdue, the expectation here is that the  initiative for it must come from Washington.    U.S. officials, as well as the Indian Ambassador, Mr. S.S.  Ray, have been talking about a Prime Ministerial visit to  Washington for many months to strengthen bilateral relations,  both in the economic and political spheres. The U.S. has to  suggest the dates for Mr. Rao's visit to enable the officials to  ascertain his convenience and also do the necessary preparatory  work.    The External Affairs Ministry is keen that the visit should  take place so that substantive discussions on matters of mutual  interest can be held at the summit level. But the process can  start only on receipt of a proper invitation setting out the  dates. It feels that the policy pronouncements made by the  State Department's South Asia Bureau need not be taken too  seriously, particularly when their interpretation keeps changing  often.    But the positive aspects of the relations between the  world's  two largest democracies ought to be stressed. The higher-level  discussions on such issues as nonproliferation, Indo-Pak  relations, human rights and South Asian security in general is  overdue.    Even though the Clinton Administration's statements on human  rights in Kashmir have evoked criticism here, the positive  aspects of Indo-U.S. relations are not being overlooked in the  face of Washington's repeated assertions about India's stability  and territorial integrity. It is pointed out that U.S.  investment in India has increased substantially and further  expansion of economic cooperation is in the cards. Though the  embargo on rocket-related technology is still in force, the U.S.  has been unilaterally raising the technology export threshold,  and items which India could not obtain earlier from the U.S. are  now readily available.    The U.S. has also sent many positive signals to reinforce  its  desire to establish an active and wide-ranging relationship with  India. Even with regard to Kashmir, the U.S. no longer talks of  mediation. As the State Department has made it clear, "we do  not set ourselves in a mediator's role."    However, the Indian Government would like the U.S. to take  note of the extreme sensitivity of public opinion here over the  Kashmir issue. Almost the entire opposition in Parliament has  urged the Government to lodge a formal protest over President  Clinton's letter to the head of Pakistan-sponsored Kashmir  American Council, Ghulam Nabi Fai, who supports militancy, and  to underline America's partisan attitude.    Even in the face of highly controversial statements  emanating  from Washington, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has been  playing it cool as he believes that one need not feel either  euphoric or frustrated about the ups and downs in Indo-U.S.  relations. Both sides, he feels, should make a serious  assessment of their interests and the advantages of not only  continuing, but also further strengthening this relationship.    The last Indo-U.S. dialogue took place in September 1993  when  the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, visited Washington. The  subject covered global and regional developments, as well as,  recent initiatives on issues such as a comprehensive test-ban  treaty and cut-off of fissile-material production for weapons  purposes. Other issues of interest also figured and both sides  reiterated a desire to examine initiatives to enhance security  through process of confidence-building.    Since then the only worthwhile interaction took place when  Ambassador Ray met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.  The meeting was largely unproductive and did not help to bridge  the differences between the two countries on various issues.  India's concern over the move to repeal the Pressler Amendment,  which would enable resumption of arms aid to Pakistan has been  duly conveyed to Washington. It has been expressly stated that  feverish arming of Pakistan would disturb the security balance  in the sub-continent and force India to spend more on buying  arms to safeguard its security, at the cost of development.    The assertions that the U.S. is not pursuing an activist  role  with regard to Kashmir is, in India's view, not borne out by the  recent policy pronouncements which tend to suggest that  Indo-U.S. relations may face a prolonged cold spell.    According to official sources, the linkage between terrorism  in Kashmir and Pakistan's clamour over human rights violations,  supported by the U.S., is a dangerous trend. However much the  U.S. may desire peaceful relations being established between  India and Pakistan and resolution of the Kashmir issue, even  tacit support for terrorist activities in the Valley is likely  to come in the way of forging closer relationship between India  and U.S.    On the positive side, it is pointed out that India has  agreed  to negotiate with Pakistan the Kashmir issue, and offered to  host the next foreign secretaries' level meeting in four months  in New Delhi. India is also sending a package of six proposals,  including on the deployment of forces in the Siachen area, about  which the U.S. is keen, and additional confidence-building  measures, to Islamabad in four to six weeks if it is in a mood  to give serious thought to it.    On the non-proliferation issue, the U.S. now understands  India's reluctance to sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty] and has agreed to continue the dialogue. India is  supportive of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and also moves to  prevent export of weapons-grade fissile material. The  differences over GATT negotiations have been fully resolved.    During the current year Indo-U.S. relations will get high  priority in India's foreign policy projections. Minus the  irritants from Washington, New Delhi is keen on strengthening  Indo-U.S. relations within the framework of shared interests on  narrowing differences where they exist, and extending  cooperation in a substantive manner in areas of mutual benefit.</p>

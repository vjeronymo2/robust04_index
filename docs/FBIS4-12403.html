			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general </F> of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, ASBP, at a ceremony marking  the ASBP's 47th anniversary, in Damascus on 7 April--live]    [Excerpts] Comrades, masses of our struggler nation,  struggler Ba'thists everywhere. Just as the Earth celebrates  the blossoms of April, every year our struggler Arab masses  celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of our great  party, the ASBP. [passage omitted]    Comrades, on the 47th anniversary of the establishment of  the  ASBP, I have the honor to convey to you on this great  anniversary, and through you to all the party's strugglers and  to all Arab strugglers, the greetings and congratulations of the  first Ba'thist, the leader of the march of our people and  nation, struggler comrade President Hafiz al-Asad. [applause]  At the same time, it pleases me to convey to you greetings and  congratulations from the party leadership, and its wishes for  further success on the road to the objectives of the party and  the masses: Unity, freedom, and socialism. [passage omitted  reviewing ASBP history, principles, and achievements]    Al-Asad's Syria today, with all worthiness, carries pan-Arab  concerns. It will not allow the loss of Arab rights. It is  capable of raising the cultural pan-Arab banner that is the  honorable image of our nation despite the difficult times  through which this nation is passing. The Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is considered an event  that confirmed that Syria's leader, the great Arab leader Hafiz  al-Asad, [applause] constitutes, before the world, the true  image and the nation's cultural face, committed to rights,  pride, and dignity. Within this framework, Syria is working to  reinforce Arab solidarity based on the ASBP's great pan-Arab  principles, to bolster the Arabs' role, and to coordinate their  efforts to liberate their occupied territories, restore their  usurped rights, and defend themselves in the face of the  challenges that threaten their present and future in a way that  proves that they reject humiliation, submission, and  capitulation to fait accompli. The right to defend oneself,  land, and rights, is a right recognized by all the world's laws  and charters. Struggle for liberation is also a right and a  national duty to every people whose land was occupied and whose  rights were violated. Al-Asad's Syria, just as it was in the  past, will not be prevented from playing its pan-Arab role in  defending Arab rights by any pressure, false accusations, and  unjust lists on which the Zionist lobby insists. For a long  time, this lobby has been used to working in the United States  to drag its administration into creating a rift in Syrian-U.S.  relations, and to try to disrupt Syria's position toward the  peace process, especially since this lobby and its henchmen are  angered by Syria's abidance with Arab rights and constants, and  by the diplomatic successes it has made, which were clearly  displayed by Syria's dealing with the peace process through  adherence to Arab rights, and confrontation of Israel's  intransigence and crude terrorism.    Comrades, brothers: Based on all this, Syria has offered  great pan-Arab sacrifices to support brothers everywhere. By  doing so, it had no motives other than the great pan-Arab  motive, which is entrenched in ASBP ideology and thought which  was expanded and enriched by the thought of the honest leader  Hafiz al-Asad and his limitless sacrifices. [applause] It is  the pan-Arab understanding of the issue of the Arab-Israeli  conflict, which is the pivot of the activities of al-Asad's  Syria and its struggle within the framework of achieving a just  and comprehensive solution to this conflict based on restoring  the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights in  accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the land  for peace principle. Syria joined the peace process in the  region, which is based on the international legitimacy, more  than two years ago in order to be a means to achieving clear  objectives, whose contents were included in UN Security Council  Resolutions No. 242, 338, and 425, and the land for peace  formula. It has exerted continuous efforts to contribute to the  success of this process and to achieve its objectives of  establishing a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace.  However, Israel has not stopped, through its maneuverings and  practices since the outset of the peace process, to obstruct  this process and to divert it from its basic objectives, as part  of its plans to impose capitulation on the Arabs.    Comrades, Syria does not agree that this process should be  derailed from its specified track, and the formula agreed on in  Madrid. Syria has confronted, and is resolutely confronting all  the Israeli maneuvering, intransigence, and attempts to evade  the requirements and prerequisites of peace, foremost of which  are the withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and  the recognition of the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate  rights. [applause] Israel is still resorting to the means that  enable it to divert the peace process from its objective. After  it dealt separately with the Palestinian side through the Oslo  agreement in an attempt to strike at Arab coordination and to  weaken the Arab position, it perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, whose hideousness is beyond any one's  imagination. It was also behind the massacre perpetrated at the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The objective behind all this is to  abort peace efforts and to foil the Arabs' efforts to restore  their rights and territories. The UN Security Council's  denunciation of the abhorrent holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  through its Resolution No. 904, shows that the whole world began  to complain about Israel's terrorist behavior, and began to  expose Israel's intransigence and adherence to fascism and  occupation. This is despite the fact that the resolution itself  is not commensurate with the hideous nature of the crime. Nor  does it constitute sufficient deterrence to the terrorist  behavior of which Israel has been known since the beginning of  its continuous aggression against the Arabs.    Comrades, brothers: The quick pursuit of those who exploded  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Lebanon has exposed those  involved in successive explosions. They are linked with Israel  and work to execute its schemes. This proves the fraternal  people of Lebanon are determined to foil Israeli plots to  reinvolve Lebanon in acts of violence and to disrupt its efforts  to achieve stability and national accord, and to liberate  southern Lebanon. These plots use the most hideous and the  crudest means of terrorism, as we saw at Sayyidat al-Najat  Church and before, and as we see in what is taking place in  occupied southern Lebanon everyday. The measures the Lebanese  Government has taken to confront the conspirators against  Lebanon's security and stability, and to confront all those who  would contribute to returning Lebanon to the whirlpool of  violence and fighting, were received with great satisfaction  inside and outside Lebanon. These measures, which are backed by  Syria, have contributed to exposing tools manipulated from  outside Lebanon in order to implement Israeli schemes. These  measures have exposed Israel's intentions against Lebanon. They  prove the march of security and accord in Lebanon is stronger  than all who want this fraternal country to return to the  climate of war, violence, and destruction. [applause]    Comrades, brothers: The struggle of our zealous kinsfolk in  the Golan and their valiant confrontation of the occupation  troops, the valiant Palestinian intifadah in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip, and the heroic Lebanese resistance in southern  Lebanon, are all important factors that integrate with Syria's  struggle to impose the Arab right on an intransigent Israel that  wants peace with land. As its leader, the great Arab leader  Hafiz al-Asad [applause] said, Syria will not relinquish a  single inch of the Golan and the other occupied Arab  territories. Neither will it give up any Arab rights. Syria is  confronting all the obstacles Israel places on the road to peace  with the objective of arriving at a just and comprehensive peace  in the region that restores full Arab rights and territories to  their people, and opens the doors of free development and  progress to the region's peoples, avoiding aggression, hegemony,  tyranny, and occupation.    Comrades, based on the humanitarian dimension of the  pan-Arab  movement and the Arab nation's civilization and culture, the  ASBP established a network of relations with several parties,  organizations, and liberation movements, to gain the greatest  possible support for our Arab issues, and to confront the  world's misleading Zionist media. These relations are part of  the peoples' common struggle to build a world free of all forms  of aggression, hegemony, tyranny, and the policy of variable  standards--a world based on justice, equality, and respect for  every people's right to opt for their own way of development  with complete freedom.    Developments in the international arena prove the end of  the Cold War has not brought security, stability, and peace, as  indicated by the slogans that accompanied its end. The number  of conflicts, tensions, and civil wars has increased. They have  escalated in several countries, such as Afghanistan, Somalia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Soviet Republics, and in other  countries and continents. These countries feel they are left to  fight, as if they exist outside this world. In fact, the  policies of hegemony and tyranny, and the hostility to Arabs and  Muslims, have increased the pains of peoples and made their  causes a field for external interference and a game for the  balances of power and interests in the world.    Comrades: We stress that world peace, security, and  stability, are an indivisible whole. It is necessary to  consider all peoples' interests and aspirations, aside from all  forms of fascism, Zionism, hegemony, and tyranny, and aside from  the policies of aggression, nuclear arms, and mass destruction  weapons stockpiled by those who took the policy of aggression  and hegemony against peoples as a profession. Taking all  peoples' interests into consideration is an indispensable  condition for building a new world order based on democracy in  international relations, on justice, equality, and mutual  respect, and on eliminating the current discrimination among the  world's poor and rich, north, and south.    Comrades, based on a rich experience gradually built by the  party until it grew and became strong, and proceeding from the  sacrifices and energies of a great leader who is leading the  contemporary pan- Arab struggle, the honest leader Hafiz al-Asad  [applause] -- based on all this, we are optimistic about the  future. On this occasion, the party's 47th anniversary, we  renew the pledge to pursue the march with a greater  determination and stronger enthusiasm behind our honest, symbol  leader Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] A march that is led by Hafiz  al-Asad has no choice but to go ahead toward further victories  and achievements.    Comrades, on this occasion, on behalf of you, all the  party's  strugglers, and all the Arab strugglers, I send heartfelt  greetings and congratulations to the leader of the march of our  people and nation, the secretary general of the party, and the  president of the republic, struggler leader Hafiz al-Asad.  [applause] Greetings to all the Ba'thist strugglers in the  entire greater Arab homeland. Greetings to our struggler Arab  masses, the source of the party's inspiration and the minaret of  its policies and march. Greetings to our steadfast kinsfolk in  the heroic Golan. Greetings to the sons of our people, the  heroes of the heroic Palestinian intifadah, to the valiant  resistance men in southern Lebanon, and to all Arab strugglers.  All greetings to the leader of the march of our people, party,  and nation to victory and liberation, the honest leader,  struggler comrade Hafiz al-Asad. [applause]</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bank's shares in a state of flux  -Another stake in Ambroveneto is up for sale A shake-up at Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector bank, seems certain following this week's confirmation that a second big stake is up for sale. Gemina, the investment and financial services group controlled by Fiat, wants to dispose of a 13.5 per cent holding. Its decision follows the news that a group of four co-operative banks from the Veneto region of northern Italy, which together form one of the five members of the shareholders' pool controlling Ambroveneto, also want to pull out. Other constituents of the pool include Crediop, the big Rome-based bank bought last year by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, and Credit Agricole of France. Each member owns about 13 per cent of Ambroveneto, and has a right of first refusal on any stakes that come on offer. The fact that Gemina wants to sell its shareholding, at the same L6,500 (Dollars 5.51) price per share being sought by the Veneto banks for their 13.6 per cent stake, means that more than a quarter of Ambroveneto's shares are in a state of flux. The price demanded values the two packets of shares at about L415bn - more than twice the current stock market level. The premium reflects the rare opportunity to buy into a bank which has changed unrecognisably since the 1982 collapse of its predecessor and the mysterious death of its chairman, Mr Roberto Calvi. Ambroveneto, which has just announced a 5.6 per cent rise in gross operating profits to L336.6bn in the first half of this year, is one of Italy' most successful and best-run banks. Buoyed by acquisitions and a rapidly growing branch network, deposits rose by 11.6 per cent to L16,923bn, while loans jumped by 16.3 per cent to L16,541bn, excluding Ambroveneto Sud, the Naples-based bank bought from Citibank, and only consolidated from July 1991. Surprisingly, Ambroveneto's share price has been relatively stable, in spite of the growing uncertainty about its future. The explanation lies in the rules of the shareholders' pact and Italy's complex new takeover code. The stock market believes that the shares on offer will probably be redistributed within the pool, rather than offered to a potential raider. If both stakes were to be purchased by an existing member of the pact, the resultant holding of almost 40 per cent would be still insufficient to trigger a compulsory bid under the new takeover rules. Both Crediop and Credit Agricole have said they are interested in increasing their holdings. Crediop's owner, San Paolo, now cash-rich following its L1,525bn flotation earlier this year, may see Crediop as a stalking horse for eventually gaining full control over Ambroveneto. The bank would ideally complement San Paolo's existing branch network, which is heavily weighted towards its native region of Piedmont in north-western Italy, whereas Ambroveneto is strongest in Lombardy and the Veneto. Credit Agricole may also have its eyes on the bank. A number of big French banks have been moving into Italy as a prime target for future growth. Credit Lyonnais controls Credito Bergamasco, a successful north Italian regional bank, while Banque Nationale de Paris has a small share in Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo. However, both potential acquirers could face opposition from the Bank of Italy. The central bank may be reluctant to see control of the country's biggest private sector bank passing to San Paolo, which is still largely in public sector hands. Regulators may also be unwilling to accept a transfer of ownership to a foreign institution at a time when they are still trying to encourage the domestic concentration through mergers between Italian banks. Such considerations have increased the difficulties facing Mr Giovanni Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, who has successfully managed to keep up the shareholders' pact through past upsets. Failing a purchase by either Crediop or Credit Agricole, the two stakes could be offered to outsiders. Mr Bazoli has long been considering a cross-marketing pact with an insurance company, which might be invited into the shareholders' pool to seal the relationship. Alleanza, the life insurance subsidiary of Italy's Generali group, has long been tipped as a possible candidate, partly because Generali, though not a pool member, owns over 5 per cent of Ambroveneto's shares. Alternatively, Mr Bazoli may be looking for a new foreign partner. A number of names have been mentioned. But why any non-Italian bank should want to pay twice the bourse price for a minority stake in a company in which another foreign institution is well entrenched is less clear.</p>

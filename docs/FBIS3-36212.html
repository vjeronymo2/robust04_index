The statement says that the negotiation focused on bilateral  trade and economic relations, with the two sides having reached  an agreement on a number of government initiatives to promote  trade and extend to Ukraine the generalized system of  preferences and on the U.S. support for Ukraine's (?accedence  to) GATT. The statement says that the U.S. side greeted  Ukraine's adherence to and observance of sanctions against  Serbia and Montenegro, and took into account Ukraine's losses  suffered as a result of it.    The United States attaches paramount importance to the  success of democratic and market reforms in Ukraine, the  statement says, and considering Ukraine's key stabilizing role  in the region, regards its national, economic, and political  security as extremely important for United States and European  security. The United States also pledges to increase its  technical and financial aid to Ukraine, particularly to finance  private investments as well as urgent humanitarian aid to  alleviate adverse social effects of the transnational [as heard]  period. The United States also pledges to increase financing of  safe and secure dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear weapons. The  two sides agreed to convene in Kiev in March the first session  of a mixed U.S.-Ukrainian committee for Ukraine's defense  industry conversion.    The Ukrainian delegation also carried out some preparations  for President Kravchuk's visit to the United States, slated for  March 1994, which will allow to consider a bilateral charter of  U.S.- Ukrainian partnership, friendship and cooperation, and  sign a package of bilateral agreements.</p>

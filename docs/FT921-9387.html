			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Safra gives bank jobs to Perez de Cuellar: Former United Nations chief to act as political adviser MR Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary-general, will be named today to the boards of the US and European banks controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, the Swiss-based international banker. The directorships, on the boards of the New York-based Republic National Bank and the Luxembourg-based Safra Republic Holdings, will mark the first new appointments to be taken up by Mr Perez de Cuellar since he left the UN at the end of last year. The former UN official said yesterday that he had been approached by a number of banks and companies with offers of directorships, but had decided to work with Mr Safra because the two have been close friends for the past 10 years. Mr Perez de Cuellar, who does not plan to accept any other directorships, said he expects to play an active role at the Safra banks, acting as a political adviser. Mr Walter Weiner, chairman of Republic New York, said the former secretary-general would help the banks assess international economic and political conditions. Mr Perez de Cuellar said in an interview with the Financial Times that he favoured expanding the five-member UN Security Council to include both Germany and Japan. But, he stressed, other nations such as India, Nigeria and Brazil should also be admitted to the Security Council. He was opposed to any fresh US covert action or military intervention in Iraq that did not have full UN backing. Responding to reports that the Bush administration may be providing clandestine support for an uprising against Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, Mr Perez de Cuellar said he hoped the reports were not correct. 'Juridically, I cannot support any flagrant intervention in the internal affairs of another country. You cannot allow one country to take individual action.'</p>

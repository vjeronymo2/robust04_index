This was stated today by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev on arrival in Kaliningrad. He has begun  a three-day tour of inspection of the country's westernmost  oblast.    According to the minister, the numerical strength of the  group that is being set up "will be determined by the defensive  sufficiency necessary to protect this enclave territory and also  Russia's interests in the Baltic region." "The final decision  on setting up the group and its deployment will be made by a  Defense Ministry collegium," Pavel Grachev stressed.</p>

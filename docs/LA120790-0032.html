			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NELLCOR MOVING PLANT FROM THE BAY AREA TO CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> Nellcor, a manufacturer of hospital patient monitoring equipment, announced it  is moving all its remaining manufacturing operations to Chula Vista from  Hayward, a move that will cause the layoffs of 160 of its San Francisco Bay  Area employees.  </P> <P> The move will complete a shift of manufacturing capacity to the San  Diego-Tijuana area that Nellcor began four years ago.  </P> <P> The company already has a Chula Vista plant as well as a Tijuana maquiladora  employing 450 workers where the disposable parts of its instruments are  assembled.  </P> <P> Nellcor, whose principal product is a pulse oximeter, a device that measures  the oxygen in a patient's blood, will soon move into a 90,000-square-foot plant  in Chula Vista now under construction.  </P> <P> Nellcor is one of many medical instrument and product firms that have moved to  the San Diego-Tijuana area in the last few years to take advantage of low-cost  Mexican labor, said Michael Smith, a real estate broker with John Burnham &amp;  Co. in downtown San Diego who represented Nellcor in its Chula Vista  transaction.  </P> <P> A publicly owned company, Nellcor has increased its sales from $46 million in  1986 to $142 million for the fiscal year ended last June 30. Its blood oximeter  was one of the first devices to measure blood oxygen on a real-time basis,  enabling hospital clinicians to avoid the time-consuming process of sending  blood samples to laboratories for analysis.  </P> <P> Nellcor will keep its administrative headquarters in Hayward, where, after the  layoffs, the company will still retain 320 employees. About 80% of those losing  their jobs are manufacturing workers, and the rest are administrative  employees, said Michael Downey, Nellcor's chief financial officer.  </P></p>

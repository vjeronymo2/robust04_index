			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK joins European airlines to fight aid for Air France The British government and seven European airlines mounted a concerted challenge yesterday to the European Commission's decision to allow the French government to grant FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh subsidies to Air France. In three separate filings at the European Court of Justice, the UK government, British Midland Airways, and another group of six European airlines led by British Airways are seeking to annul EU approval of the latest state aid for the French national carrier. The moves are expected to sharpen the controversy over government support for European state-owned carriers while the EU is trying to encourage greater competition in a liberalised European aviation market. The UK government said the EU's decision to allow the latest subsidies to Air France, one of the three largest airlines in Europe, would 'distort competition' and undermine the benefits of the European single aviation market. Mr Brian Mawhinney, the UK transport secretary, said: 'The Commission decision ignores the need for evenhanded treatment. It removes the incentive for state-owned airlines to become efficient and to adopt a sound commercial approach.' British Midland described the Air France aid as 'grotesque' and 'almost equal to the entire losses made by all the world's airlines in 1993'. BA has been joined in its action by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System, Air UK, Maersk Air of Denmark, and TAT, the French regional carrier which is 49 per cent owned by BA. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said: 'Approving Air France's package of state aid was a deplorable decision which cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.' Sir Colin argued that there was no justification for such a large subsidy for Air France. He said the conditions imposed by the EU for granting the aid were 'wholly inadequate' and it risked serious damage to the development of a free aviation market in Europe. BA and several other European carriers, which have been forced to rely essentially on their own efforts to restructure their activities, now fear that a two-class airline industry is emerging in Europe: the first involving airlines that have had to solve their problems on their own; the second including airlines that continued to rely on their governments for support. Since August 1991, Brussels has approved state aid to airlines totalling Dollars 10.35bn (Pounds 6.6bn), with the Commission approving in July alone aid amounting to Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines: Air France, Olympic Airways of Greece and TAP Air Portugal. The UK government yesterday said the Air France aid, spread over three years, was the largest ever allowed in the European air transport industry. Observer, Page 23</p>

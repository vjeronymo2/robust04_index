			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): A door always open - Management THE HUMAN TOUCH by Bill Arnold and Jeanne Plas John Wiley, Dollars 22.95 272 pages WHEN Bill Arnold became president of Centennial Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee, he turned the corporate pyramid upside down by announcing an 'open door' policy. Everyone thought it was just another management slogan - until he had his door taken off the hinges and hung in the lobby as a monument to an outdated leadership style. He called it 'person-centred leadership' - a simple management philosophy based on listening, helping people to work together, to build self-esteem and mutual respect, and spreading decision making right through the organisation. He proved that allowing people to develop actually led to lower running costs, dramatically higher sales and profits, improved cash flow and a 50 per cent reduction in staff turnover. Centennial is the largest commercial medical centre in the US, the flagship of the giant Hospital Corporation of America. Some 3,000 staff and 900 house physicians run three large hospitals and seven medical office buildings, dealing with around 116,000 'customers' and 360,000 worried/relieved visitors a year. Employees, or 'associates' as they became known, began to enjoy coming to work. When other chief executives argued that running a hospital is rather different from most large scale businesses Bill Arnold pointed out the problems were not so different since they also involved providing services/products and dealing with government regulations, budgeting, management, customer satisfaction, market share and the 'bottom line'. If person-centred management can work in a for-profit medical centre of this size and complexity, he argues, it probably can work anywhere. Arnold's 'hard-nosed, humanistic' principles are concerned with listening to gripes, resolving personal frustrations, promoting honesty, an open-door policy, encouraging new ideas, the use of brief, hand-written memos and creating a shared vision. How these principles were implemented, including the expected initial round of errors, is chronicled by Bill Arnold, the doer, and by his collaborator, Jeanne Plas, a distinguished academic who took a close interest in all stages of the transformation. The reason person-centred leadership took off so dramatically within this complicated corporate environment, she suggests, 'is that it is compatible with basic human needs. Bill insisted that his organisation had to start from scratch. It had to get rid of some outdated dysfunctional ways of operating and ineffective ways of thinking . . . begin with what people need; marry those ideas to the needs of the organisation. Encourage people to care about one another and the enterprise. Have some fun.' It sounds deceptively simple, but The Human Touch is a remarkable account of its effective implementation.</p>

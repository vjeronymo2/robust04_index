			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- According  to the sociological poll conducted by the Statistical Department  of the Chancellory of the Arhangay Aymag which covers some 50  city and rural families totaling 254 people, the monthly income  of a family in the city is 22.9 thousand tugrik while in the  countryside 29.8 thousand tugrik. For the first time the income  of the countryfolk has increased that of the city residents  which is due to the privatization of cattle carried out in the  countryside. The standard level is higher in the countryside  but the structure of the foodstuffs does not meet to  physiological normatives. For example the consumption of meat,  rice, porridges, sweets, vegetables and butter and vegetable oil  per one rural person is lower the required standards by from 30  per cent to 2 fold. But the consumption of flour and bakeries  is higher and as for milk and dairy produce is quite near the  standards.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / British Coal sets up fast loan plan BRITISH Coal Enterprise yesterday announced almost 'instant loans' for small businesses to try to speed up job creation in pit closure areas. Under its new Fast Track Loans scheme, it will lend up to Pounds 15,000 at a fixed interest rate of 9 per cent without security. The wholly owned subsidiary of British Coal will start the scheme immediately in Wales, the west Midlands, and north-west and north-east England. It hopes to extend it to the east Midlands, the Yorkshire region and Scotland before the end of next month. Decisions on loans are promised within 21 days of application in an attempt to counter past criticism of the subsidiary's secured lending programme, in which decisions have taken up to six months. The loans will be open to anyone setting up or operating a business in a coal closure area. The subsidiary says nearly 42,000 jobs have been created by the 3,775 projects it has backed with Pounds 76m since it was founded eight years ago. 'We are prepared to back anything legal, barring gambling and speculative building,' said Mr John Dutton, manager of the enterprise's Warrington-based western region. The enterprise is usually wary of backing retail projects, apart from cases where a former miner wants to buy a shop to provide work for himself. Mr Dutton said the ceiling for fast-track loans would be raised to Pounds 25,000 as soon as the scheme had proved itself. The initial Pounds 15,000 ceiling is based on the enterprise's experience that about 80 per cent of new businesses backed need less than this once they have all relevant grants and as much bank funding as they could afford.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Wolfe in Papp's clothing - The row over the controversial changes at the New York Shakespeare Festival The honeymoon never even started for JoAnne Akalaitis, Joseph Papp's successor as artistic director of the New York Shakespeare Festival. The festival's board of directors brought Akalaitis' rocky 20-month tenure to a sudden end last month when it voted unanimously to remove her from her position and to replace her with George C. Wolfe, who has been a resident director at the festival since 1990. Thirty-eight-year-old Wolfe will take the title of producer and oversee both the theatre's business dealings and its artistic affairs, responsibilities split between Akalaitis and producing director, Jason Steven Cohen, when Papp gave over responsibility of the theatre two months before his death in October, 1991. Actor Kevin Kline, long associated with the festival, has been appointed an artistic associate. Wolfe is one of America's hottest young theatre artists and a widely-popular choice to lead the festival. His writing and directing credits include The Colored Museum, Spunk and Jelly's Last Jam; he is currently directing the Broadway premiere of Tony Kushner's Angels in America. While Wolfe's dynamism and charisma make him a natural leader and will serve him well in the public relations and fund-raising aspects of his new position, his only hands-on producing experience to date is an annual festival of solo performers of colour for the Shakespeare Festival. Larry Condon, the chairman of the festival board's executive committee, said that the changeover was part of 'a long-range effort to reshape the institution for the future . . . we decided that we needed to reach back into the theatre's roots and bring in a single leader who will serve the broad producer functions as well as artistic ones. JoAnne is a wonderful director and cares a lot about the theatre but, having made the decision to re-organise the institution, JoAnne was not the first choice.' Akalaitis' supporters maintain that she should have been allowed at least the duration of her first contract - three years - to put her imprint on the festival and that her termination was handled in a peremptory, disrespectful manner. Akalaitis, a founding member of the avant-garde theatre company, Mabou Mines, has never been involved in running a large institution before she took over the festival. Many, while acknowledging that other factors, including the recession, were also at play, blame her lack of business acumen for the theatre's recent fiscal woes. In the last three years, the festival's annual budget has been cut by more than one-third to under Dollars 10m, the staff cut in half to 60, and the subscription audience has dropped from 3,500 to 2,000. Her programming has also come under fire. While the festival has added several successful new projects, including a puppetry festival, and has given producing space to several small theatre companies under her tenure, many maintain that the company, by relying on co-productions and productions brought from other theatres, is failing in its brief to generate new projects. That a Shakespeare production was not included mainstage this year was a particular sticking-point for Akalaitis critics. While the festival's offerings this year have been never less than interesting, they have all been of a grim sameness. They include Texts for Nothing, Beckett's paeon to existential angst; Akalaitis' icy production of Buchner's Woyzeck; Steve Tesich's partly-pretentious, partly-profound post-apocalyptical drama, On the Open Road; a chamber musical, Wings, about a stroke victim; Marisol, Jose Rivera's darkly-poetic expose of contemporary urban life; and Kushner's brilliant Aids rant, Angels in America, which the festival is co-producing on Broadway. Clearly, Akalaitis walked into a near-impossible position when she took over an institution so closely identified with its idiosyncratic founder. Under Joe Papp's 37-year leadership the Shakespeare Festival produced over 400 plays and musicals and earned 28 Tony Awards, three Pulitzer Prizes, and nearly 100 Obie (off-Broadway) Awards; noteworthy productions under Papp's leadership include A Chorus Line, Four Colored Girls .., The Mystery of Edwin Drood and the annual free summertime productions of Shakespeare in Central Park. Whatever her failings and strengths, Akalaitis became the scapegoat and eventually the victim of the inevitably-difficult post-Papp transition period. It is probably small consolation to her at this point, but by absorbing hostilities, earned and unearned, Akalaitis helped clear the road to the institution's future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mastella Flunks Bossi and Fini"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- Things are stirring also within the  liberal-democratic alignment, which is preparing to "designate"  a prime minister to lead the next government. According to  Clemente Mastella, leader of the Christian Democratic Center  [CCD], among the moderates' leaders only [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi is qualified to aspire to the premiership.    In an interview with the MILANO FINANZA daily, Mastella  stated: "There is no chance of [League Secretary] Bossi becoming  prime minister. He has no national standing, he is too much of  a local leader to become prime minister." Mastella said that,  if conditions were appropriate after the elections, he "would  not be against Berlusconi" becoming prime minister. The CCD  leader did not believe that [Italian Social Movement (MSI)  leader] Gianfranco Fini -- Forza Italia's other ally in the  south -- would make a good prime minister either. The MSI  leader, Mastella said, "must still come to terms with his past.  He may succeed in becoming the government's right wing, but not  the coalition's leader."    Replying to those who criticized the composition of the  CCD's  electoral lists for including member of the old political  establishment, the former DC member said: "There are people  with a long political experience among our allies too. Anyway,  I see no great lists being put forward by Forza Italia or by the  other forces. There are no Napoleons or Leonardos among them."  Mastella criticized the League and athe National Alliance [AN]  for having (rhetorically) invited President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  to resign after the elections. "The fact that there will be a  new parliament does not matter. Otherwise, apart from  Scalfaro," Mastella remarked, "we should also throw away all the  laws passed by this parliament."</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Seeking support from a competitor - A look at the background to Newton Investment's expansion The decision by Newton Investment Management, arguably the most successful independent pension fund manager in the UK, to take over the assets of a much weaker competitor is a sign of the times. The move is surprising, however, because Newton has made much of its desire to slow its expansion, closing its doors to new clients for a two-year period in mid-1992. While fund management companies concentrated furiously on building up their roster of blue-chip pension scheme clients in the 1980s, retail services at most houses faded to the background. But now, with pension fund regulatory reform on the horizon, and a growing recognition of the fickle quality of pension fund business, fund management companies are re-thinking their mix of business. Recently, several leading fund managers, including Mercury Asset Management, the largest in the UK, have decided to concentrate on building up their retail businesses for fear of becoming too vulnerable to a downturn in the pension fund market. 'From Newton's point of view, we have a lot of dependency on one area of the business. We want to diversify,' said Mr Jonathan Powell, marketing director. About four-fifths of Newton's existing Pounds 5bn in assets under management are those of pension schemes, with the balance split between private client funds and retail products such as unit trusts and Personal Equity Plans. 'Private clients will stick with you through thick and thin as long as you make profits for them over time,' Mr Powell said. 'Pension funds are volatile and will sack you immediately.' Newton has calculated that it needs a mix of businesses if it is to be able to count on long-term growth. The movement of pension funds into the hands of fund managers is largely determined by a handful of pension consultants. If Newton should lose favour with these, its future would be in doubt, Mr Powell said. The mix of business at Capital House Investment Management, the subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, with which Newton is merging, is almost a mirror image. Capital House has only one big pension fund client, Royal Bank's own pension scheme with about Pounds 1bn in assets. The remainder of its Pounds 3bn is in retail funds and private client assets. Their performances also contrast greatly. Data from Combined Actuarial Performance Services show that in 1993, Newton's median segregated pension fund returned 37.4 per cent against an industry median of 29.2 per cent. By contrast, the RBS Pension scheme earned returns 5 percentage points below the CAPS median in 1993. However perhaps the most significant reason for Newton was the access the merger would give it to a distribution outlet for its retail funds. 'The big growth in the retail area is through bancassurance,' Mr Powell said. 'We are the only independent fund manager with access to a bancassurance outlet.'</p>

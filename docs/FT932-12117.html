			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (3): Heavyweight feels the pain of recession - The problems of Germany's leading industrial company / The importance of being Daimler-Ben IF the company's own forecasts are realised, Daimler-Benz this year will generate around DM1bn profit - almost exactly the same as it did a decade ago when it was a simple automotive company, with sales of DM44bn. Now it is a 'technology group', turning over almost DM100bn. Since 1984 the pride of Baden-Wurttemberg has ballooned into Germany's biggest industrial company. As well as Mercedes-Benz it has grown to embrace Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the AEG electrical and electronic engineering business and Debis, a software and financial services business. From a peak of DM1.9bn in the boom year of 1991, net earnings fell 25 per cent last year and are sliding towards DM1bn in 1993. The faithful milch cow Mercedes, which usually accounts for two-thirds of group profits, will this year produce around 85 per cent of the total. The failure of Daimler's management to generate consistent and worthwhile profit gains from its expensive and showy expansion programme has brought it under persistent and increasingly critical fire from media and city critics. Chairman Edzard Reuter, who has borne the brunt of most of the criticism, bristles visibly every time the subject comes up. 'We never said the importance of the automotive business would decline in the context of the group before the end of the century,' he says. And he rattles off the special circumstances which have come to haunt Daimler - and much of the rest of German industry - since the easy days of the 1980s. Global recession, monetary upheavals and the economic disorder following the dismantling of the Iron Curtain and the Soviet empire were not allowed for in Daimler's grand strategy. 'I must confess that we did not foresee the collapse of communism,' he says, with more than a tinge of irony. The end of the cold war severely buckled one of Daimler's new legs, the defence business of Deutsche Aerospace. This year alone, German government spending cuts will cost Dasa around DM1bn in lost sales. 'If the defence cuts had not happened Deutsche Aerospace (which lost DM340m on DM17bn sales last year) would be highly profitable by now,' Reuter claims. Even so, he is convinced he has built up a potential-packed aircraft and space technology business. 'Just look back at the state of aerospace in Germany when we started ..it was fragmented, non-existent as a force in world markets. We have reorganised it and it is now respected worldwide,' he says. Dasa includes Dornier, the MTU engines business, Germany's European Airbus stake and now Fokker of the Netherlands. Putting on a brave face, Reuter points out that military work accounts for only around 8 per cent of Daimler's group business. But defence spending cuts have not just affected Dasa's sales and profits, the marked reduction in government and corporate involvement in military research has blunted the leading-edge of the group's technological and materials R&amp;D crucial to civil aerospace activities and important to other group activities in vehicles and engineering. Meanwhile, AEG, which encompasses washing machines, automation technology and railways, continues to stumble. After a DM624m loss in 1991, it squeezed a DM10m profit out of DM11bn sales last year, and is now on the way back into the red, according to chairman Georg Stockl. Edzard Reuter is prepared now to concede that AEG may have waited too long before last year's decision to cast out the prime loss-maker, the historic Olympia office equipment subsidiary which was simply smothered by competition from the far east. Originally a typewriter manufacturer, Olympia is a classic case of a traditional German company which failed to make the grade in high-tech global markets. As such it is seen by Daimler's bitterest critics as a model for the whole group. Daimler based its entire diversification strategy on the need to break out of the relatively narrow and crowded confines of the automotive business. Now it has fallen to the car makers at Mercedes to show the way ahead for the rest of the business and at the same time generate the cash needed to support structural change elsewhere. Driven out of its ivory tower by keen competition, the company has undertaken an extraordinary reversal of its most ingrained traditions. Gone is the notion that Mercedes keeps strictly to the market for sedate, heavyweight executive saloons. Gone too is the idea that the company's cars can only be manufactured in Germany. A family-style van is to be built in Barcelona; a 'fun car' will be made in the US, and a pocket-sized city vehicle will follow, also likely to be built outside Germany. The engineering elite, who once dominated the business, have been integrated as members of countless management, design and manufacturing teams. Price, once discussed as an afterthought after the engineers had dictated the form and content of each model, is now the starting point of all development plans. Product prices are established according to what the market will bear, what the competition is offering in a comparable market sector, and what the company can accept as a reasonable profit. Then project teams are required to deliver components, processes - and finished vehicle - according to fixed targets. This programme has led to the greater use of bought-in parts, while speedier and therefore cheaper production methods have reduced the time taken to build a car from 45 man-hours to 35. So far, the Japanese competition's cost advantages have been cut from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, production executives claim. The first fruits of this revolutionary change of attitude and methods will be yielded this summer when Mercedes launches a replacement for its 10 year-old compact 190 series. To judge by outward appearances the new C-class is a classic, traditional Mercedes car. But the bodywork conceals radical differences. The company claims the new vehicle is packed with 20 per cent more customer value than the old model, while the price will be basically unchanged. At the bottom-line, lean production on this scale means ever-leaner payrolls. Although the effects of recession have blurred the picture, many of the cost-savings made to improve the company's competitiveness have been made at the expense of the workforce. Almost 15,000 of the 18,000 group jobs which went last year were lost at Mercedes. The automotive business will cast off at least another 7,000 this year, while other divisions shed 8,000. Meanwhile, most new jobs, which in the past would have been filled by German workers, are being created overseas. Those involved in the manufacture of Mercedes' planned new models will benefit Spain and the US in the first instance. The company is also discussing assembly in Mexico, South Korea and the Philippines, and is in the early planning stages of a projected car assembly factory in India.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Aiming a laser at the snorers A laser treatment that stops snoring has been launched in the UK after successful application in the US. The 'Swiftlaser' is used to trim the uvula at the back of the throat to stop vibrations that cause snoring. The treatment, carried out under local anaesthetic, would replace scalpel surgery under general anaesthetic. The only side-effect is a mild sore throat, according to the Harley Medical Group, introducing the treatment in the UK. In the US, where 12,000 snorers have been treated, Harley Medical says the success rate is 85 per cent to 90 per cent. Nearly a third of US patients were cured after one visit, while about two-thirds needed further sessions. The treatment may also be appropriate for some sleep apnoea sufferers. The cost is between Pounds 450 and Pounds 950, depending on the number of visits. Harley Medical Group, UK. Tel 071 631 5494, fax 071 631 0199.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR HIS BIG, JUICY PORTERHOUSE  </P> <P> A Texas reader writes: "Several years ago my wife and I were visiting San  Francisco. We had dinner at a restaurant where there was a steak on the menu  with your name on it, the Merle Ellis Porterhouse.  </P> <P> "It was a big steak, over a pound, cooked and served in a cast-iron skillet,  then carved at the table. So I decided to write and ask if you had the recipe  for the Merle Ellis Porterhouse."  </P> <P> The steak in question was on the menu at the Mason Beach Grill at the Sheraton  at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco five or six years ago.  </P> <P> To fix the steak, select as good a porterhouse as you can find, well-marbled,  preferably with a bit of age on it and at least one-inch thick -- an inch and a  half is even better.  </P> <P> Trim it well of all but a thin layer of outside fat. Give each side a few  generous grinds of good coarse black pepper. Pour about one-quarter inch of the  best olive oil you can afford in the bottom of a glass dish large enough to  hold the steak and lay the steak in the oil. Let the steak marinate in the oil  for several hours, turning from time to time.  </P> <P> Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. (I prefer a grill pan with raised  ridges to let the fat drip away.) Remove the steak from the oil and pat off any  excess oil with a paper towel. Sear the steak first on one side and then the  other over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook to the desired  degree of doneness, turning twice more.  </P> <P> Remove the steak to a heated serving platter. Pour off any fat in the grill pan  and return the pan to the stove over low heat. Add two tablespoons of butter  and the juice of half a lemon to the pan and with a basting brush incorporate  any drippings left in the bottom of the pan to make a nice sauce to pour over  the steak. Carve the steak, pour over the sauce and serve immediately. A good  steak doesn't like to be kept waiting.  </P></p>

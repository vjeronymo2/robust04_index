			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Opec agrees to push oil prices up - At a Glance AFTER five days of talks in Geneva, the 12 members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached agreement on an accord which will cut output to raise prices. The plan, covering the six months from October to March, aims to halt the sharp fall in oil prices and bring them closer to the Opec target of Dollars 21 a barrel. The agreement led to an immediate jump in oil prices, but by Friday they were slipping slightly on speculation that the embargo on Iraqi oil exports could be lifted earlier than expected.</p>

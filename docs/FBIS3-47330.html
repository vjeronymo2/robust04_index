			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries [MAFF] has decided to provide rice-exporting  countries, including Thailand and China, with technological  assistance in the fields of rice production and distribution.  This is in response to the government's decision to partially  open the rice market. The action is being taken because, if  Japan fails to procure rice from exporting countries in line  with its plan, it will affect its supply and demand policy. To  promote stable rice shipments, MAFF plans to provide  technological aid to rice exporters in such fields as planting  rice intended for exports, controlling rice fields by the  harvesting season, and storing harvested rice. Moreover, in  line with rice exporters' requests, MAFF plans to instruct them  in the technology for producing rice that will suit the taste of  the Japanese people.    Following the agricultural agreement under GATT's  multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), Japan must  accept rice imports of 4 percent (approximately 380,000 tons) of  annual domestic consumption in fiscal 1995 in return for a  six-year moratorium on rice import tariffication. Moreover, it  must increase the rate of rice imports gradually to procure rice  of 8 percent (approximately 760,000 tons) of domestic  consumption from foreign countries in six years.    MAFF has judged that, to help rice-exporting countries  maintain stable production of rice intended for export to Japan,  it is necessary to instruct them in rice-producing methods such  as cultivation technology for planting rice, using agricultural  chemicals, and rice field controlling technology for securing  the steady growth of rice plants. Moreover, MAFF plans to  support rice exporters with the technology for storage and  transport control to prevent rice from declining in quality  after being harvested so that the rice can pass Japan's strict  quality test.    MAFF's decision is based on its fear that because the amount  of the world's annual rice trade is small, reaching more than 10  million yen, a possible drastic change in exporting countries'  production may hinder Japan's rice procurement. Recently, mold  or alien substances such as pebbles were found in Thai-grown  rice imported by Japan as an emergency measure to counter last  year's poor rice crop. When such cases are taken into  consideration, it is necessary to review the system for  controlling the process of distribution.    China, Thailand, and other countries are expected to be  listed as recipient countries for technological aid. MAFF will  study a possibility of providing technological aid to  rice-producing countries, including the SRV and Burma. It will  decide on recipient countries and work out concrete details of  the plan. MAFF intends to begin providing technological aid  during fiscal 1994.</p>

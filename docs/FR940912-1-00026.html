			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Test methods are provided for use by the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator in determining applicability of the standards to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given wastewater stream. The three variables of concern,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual wastewater quantity, average total volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration, and annual average wastewater flow rate, may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined using a variety of methods. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards include provisions that would allow a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SOCMI process unit owner or operator to use either direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement or knowledge of the wastewater to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration of the wastewater. Direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements would be conducted in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Method 25D in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Knowledge of the wastewater can be demonstrated by material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balances, records of chemical purchases, process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stoichiometry, or previous test results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A determination of the volatile organic concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or average annual flow rate of a wastewater would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the proposed standards only when a wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the standards is placed in a waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit that is not equipped with air emission controls in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the rules. The SOCMI process unit owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator would not be required to determine the volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic concentration or average annual flow rate of wastewater streams that are managed only in units equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standard up to the point of ultimate recycle, disposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Monitoring Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure that emission control equipment is properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated and maintained, the proposed standards would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner or operator to inspect and monitor certain air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control equipment used to comply with the rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced monitoring of control device operation is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proposed standards to demonstrate compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. This involves the use of automated instrumentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to measure critical operating parameters that indicate whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the control device is operating correctly or is malfunctioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to maintain the established values of the monitored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the enhanced monitoring requirements, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial leak detection test using Method 21 under appendix A of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 60 is required for certain cover components to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 21 test would be supplemented by annual visual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections for leaking components as well as periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection and measurement of other monitoring parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special inspection and monitoring provisions are included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed standards for cover fittings that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor. Leak monitoring using Method 21 is not required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the following: (1) Drums that meet applicable DOT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations specified in the rules; (2) trucks, trailers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and rail cars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tight by Method 27 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) closed-vent systems operated under vacuum conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Reporting and Recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards require the owner or operator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record certain information in the on-site facility operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logs or files. The information to be collected and recorded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes: the results of all waste determinations such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration at the point of waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation and organic vapor pressure; design specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for closed-vent systems and control devices and control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment; emission control equipment inspection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring results; Method 21 and Method 27 test results;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device monitoring results; leak repairs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of incinerators, boilers, or industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnaces in which wastewater is treated in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general requirements of the rule; documentation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological wastewater treatment units complying with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule; and identification of equipment designated as unsafe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or difficult to monitor or inspect. This information is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be readily available for review by authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives of the EPA. The EPA seeks comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessibility of the monitoring data and periodic reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be kept in logs on the plant site when it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be reported to the appropriate agency. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data and reports should be accessible to citizen groups that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contemplate citizen suits or other members of the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in the source's compliance status. This access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required by section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amended (CAAA). Means of providing that accessibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: direct inspection of the logs or files on-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with authority to access the data equal to that of the EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA with an affirmative duty on the part of the EPA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the state/local delegated agent to obtain any data from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source that the agency does not have in its files,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of a FOIA-like request to the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner/operator with an obligation on the part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner/operator to provide the requested data, or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to keep electronic files/logs which would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible through EPA electronic bulletin boards. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions for meeting the mandates of section 114 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welcome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

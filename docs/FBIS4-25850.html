			<p>BFN     [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] will grant $55 million  to five developing countries according to a ROC high-ranking  official. Poland will be receiving $20 million; the Philippines,  Paraguay, and Latvia will each receive $10 million in loans; and  Vietnam will receive $5 million in loans. The secretary general  for the Executive Yuan's International Economic Cooperation  Development Fund, (Chou Yan), refused to disclose the interest  for these loans. He only said the loan interest for each country  is different. Chou said this is the first time this year the  ROC has given out loans to other countries but in the past five  years Taiwan had already given out $257 million in loans to more  than a dozen countries. Chou said the purpose for the loans is  to help these nations to develop their small and medium  industries and they can later on develop larger industries. The  ROC's foreign exchange reserves [words indistinct] $86.8  billion, which is higher than most of the countries in the world.</p>

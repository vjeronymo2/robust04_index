			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOWER AUTO SALES DRAG DOWN APRIL RETAIL FIGURES  </P> <P> Dragged down by lower auto sales, total U.S. retail sales fell 0.6% in April  after dropping 0.2% in March, signaling an economic slowdown, the Commerce  Department reported today.  </P> <P> Retail sales fell to $148.6 billion in April from $149.5 billion in March, the  department's Census Bureau said.  </P> <P> The numbers were adjusted for seasonal factors but not for price changes.  </P> <P> Excluding automobiles, U.S. retail sales were unchanged in April after falling  0.2% in March and increasing 1.6% in February and 1.1% in January.  </P> <P> The numbers were worse than markets had anticipated, indicating that consumers  are skittish about spending their money.  </P> <P> Most private economists had predicted flat retail sales in April, with the more  optimistic expecting a 0.5% advance for the month. The numbers, however, have  proved to be both volatile and somewhat unreliable, since the Census Bureau has  frequently revised them later.  </P> <P> According to the Census Bureau, auto sales fell 2.7% in April to $30.5 billion,  after declining 0.2% in March and falling 1.7% in February.  </P> <P> The bureau said that April total retail sales were 3.4% above April, 1989,  which would make them lower after adjusting for inflation. Sales in the  February through April period were 5.2% above the same period a year ago,  virtually flat after adjusting for inflation.  </P> <P> Total U.S. retail sales were unchanged in February and increased 2.8% in  January.  </P> <P> In April, retail sales of durable goods -- big ticket items designed to last  three years or more -- fell 1.6% from March. Non-durable goods sales were  unchanged for the second consecutive month.  </P></p>

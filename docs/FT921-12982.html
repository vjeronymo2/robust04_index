			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Flat quarter for Smith Corona SMITH Corona, the US typewriter manufacturer 48 per cent owned by Hanson group of the UK, yesterday turned in essentially flat second-quarter earnings after a weak first quarter. The Connecticut-based company earned Dollars 7m, or 23 cents a share, in the three months to December 31, compared with Dollars 6.8m, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 111.7m in the 1991 second quarter, up from Dollars 106.7m the previous year. The latest second-quarter results include a pre-tax provision of Dollars 2m to cover the cost of replacing software chips in personal world processors. The company also took a Dollars 5m charge to settle a shareholder class action suit, but this was recorded as paid-in capital and was not charged against the company's earnings. For the first half, Smith Corona's earnings slid to Dollars 11.1m, or 37 cents, from Dollars 13.5m, or 45 cents, a year ago. Revenues fell to Dollars 198.9m in 1991 from Dollars 225.3m. Smith Corona is benefiting from reduced borrowing levels and lower interest rates, which have cut the company's interest expense. Long-term debt at the end of the second quarter was Dollars 27m, compared with Dollars 56m a year earlier. Mr Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved second-quarter performance to better US sales of typewriter and personal word processors that more than compensated for a decline in international markets. In recent years, the group has been hit by eroding demand and strong pricing pressures. 'We are particularly gratified with an improvement in demand in domestic markets in a recessionary environment,' he said.</p>

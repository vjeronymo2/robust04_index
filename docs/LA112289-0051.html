			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> THE EAST;  </P> <P> 7 DIE IN HIGH WINDS; BLIZZARD IS FORECAST  </P> <P> Icy wind blasted down trees and power lines from the Great Lakes to North  Carolina and whipped more than a foot of snow into squalls that stopped drivers  cold in northern New England. Two forest fires sparked by downed power lines  burned out of control in Virginia. The weather was blamed for seven deaths. The  wind and cold were backlashes of an intense storm that crossed New York and New  England on Monday. The National Weather Service posted blizzard warnings for  New Hampshire and most of Maine, where snow accumulations of up to 15 inches  were expected.  </P></p>

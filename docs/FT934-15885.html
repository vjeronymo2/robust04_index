			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Van Miert calls for Gatt rules on business barriers THE international trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be extended to cover restrictive business practices, Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, said yesterday. He said a combination of internationally agreed minimum competition rules and firm enforcement, perhaps through the Gatt dispute procedure, could help end restrictive business practices. As tariff and non-tariff barriers were cleared away these 'private barriers to trade' were increasingly the most important obstacle to corporate expansion, he told the Euro-American Chamber of Commerce in Washington. Mr Van Miert used the example of the Japanese and Korean markets, which he said were closed 'not so much by tariffs but by exclusionary behaviour, biased distribution systems or other private practices'. It is the second time in two years that a senior European commissioner has urged the Gatt to take on a new role in regulating competition. Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner and now responsible for trade, told the 1992 World Economic Forum in Davos that the Gatt should draw up worldwide competition rules covering subsidies, cartels, merger policy and public monopolies. Mr Van Miert and Sir Leon's proposals may find a sympathetic ear in Geneva, where their immediate predecessor as EC competition commissioner, Mr Peter Sutherland, is now Gatt director-general. Mr Van Miert said that in the initial stage of such a plan, the Gatt would not handle individual companies' complaints about anti-competitive practices, but would ensure that countries were enforcing minimum competition rules. However, he acknowledged that 'one should not even dream about a worldwide and independent competition agency at this stage'.</p>

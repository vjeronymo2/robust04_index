			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Spitfires on the runway - Clive Fewins visits a small company that rebuilds old aircraft THE 1944 Spitfire Mk16E stands forlorn, its fuselage on large trestles, wings standing separately beside it in the bright, clean hangar. It is for sale for Pounds 275,000. A further Pounds 425,000 could make it fly. The hangar is the home of Historic Flying. The Spitfire is the last of five that the 11-man company acquired from the RAF in 1988. It was a deal in which no money changed hands. HFL gave a restored Bristol Beaufort and an American P40 WSM ('Kitty Hawk') fighter to the RAF Museum at Hendon and paid for nine glass fibre replica Spitfires and three replica Hurricanes to act as 'gate guardians' at RAF stations. In exchange, it received the Spitfires, which had acted as gate guardians. The five Spitfires will eventually join the 40 or so that are airworthy. In the five years since it was formed, HFL has worked on seven of them. Two owners regularly fly their machines into the company's grass landing strip near Saffron Walden, Essex, for checks. One of the Spitfires is domiciled in the HFL hangar, while in yet another corner of the 10,000 sq ft building are the airframe, wings and several more sections of Spitfire BM597, destined to be the personal aircraft of managing director Tim Routsis. Since he was 18, Routsis, 33, has wanted his own Spitfire. He formed HFL in 1988 with four others with the express aim of eventually rebuilding his own aircraft. Routsis believes it will be at least two years before he achieves his ambition. In the meantime, he and fellow director, Clive Denny, have to content themselves with flying the company's 1952 Chipmunk trainer, and occasionally flying clients' Spitfires to air shows and to Saffron Walden for maintenance checks. 'Flying a Spitfire is every bit as good as it has been made out to be by writers over the years,' says Routsis. 'It is the sound of freedom. Even if, like me, you are far too young for it to bring back memories, it is a sound that cannot fail to grab you.' Routsis and his colleagues discovered they had a mutual love of Spitfires when they met in the mid-1980s through the Cambridge flying club. Denny and his friend Ian Warren (now a director of HFL) were working at nearby Stansted in their own particular fields of aircraft finishing and metal fitting. For the first two years they ran the business from an old milking parlour near Braintree, bringing in aircraft by road and using a private airstrip a mile away. Gradually they recruited airframe, engine and electrical experts, fitters and painting specialists to the team, which tackles almost all kinds of work on aircraft of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Three years ago, after the sale of its first Spitfire, HFL moved to the new site, which it rents, and built the Pounds 300,000 hangar with the proceeds of the sale. Since then the company has been self-financing, with the aid of a small loan. The team usually hears of jobs through the tightly-knit world of historic flying enthusiasts. A typical job was the Pounds 35,000 engine change and inspection of a 1944 US-designed Australian-built Mustang fighter. It came via an intermediary acting for the owner, a wealthy French businessman, whom Routsis and his colleagues never met. Jobs can take years. A second world war Luftwaffe Bucker-Yungman trainer - a small biplane, akin to the British Tiger Moth - is being rebuilt for a private customer who is paying for the work in stages, as he can afford it. Other jobs are more exotic, such as the recent rebuild of a Russian YAK 1 fighter, shot down in 1941. It crash-landed on a frozen lake; when the ice melted it sank. 'It was recovered in 1991, acquired by a private collection, and brought here,' says Denny. 'We managed to find a Russian Klimov engine of the original type, which we fitted, so it was able to fly out in style.' HFL does not rebuild engines. 'Rolls-Royce won't touch Merlin engines, so we have to go to a specialist company in California for them,' says Denny. 'The ironic thing is that we have had two Spitfires back from the US partly restored for us to finish the job here. The reason the owners stopped the American restoration in mid-flight was the problem of access to authentic spares. US rivets, nuts and bolts often lack authenticity. If you are spending Pounds 700,000 on a rebuild you might as well get it absolutely correct.' For the HFL team, work on Spitfires is a high note. They scour the world for spares. In the case of Spitfires it is not always difficult to find spares. 'If you know where to look, it's like the Austin 7 club. You can pick up all sorts of original spares from companies specialising in surplus military equipment,' says Denny. For much of the time the team has to be content with what they call 'bread and butter' work: inspection and maintenance of all manner of small aircraft, often quite modern ones. HFL also has a contract with the RAF to rebuild and supply wings for Chipmunk trainers. Says Denny: 'We are going through a quiet period, so work like this is welcome. In the present climate not many people can find the money to buy a Spitfire, let alone the Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 2,000 an hour needed to run it.' Last year HFL turned over Pounds 750,000. 'It's a roller-coaster business and in a good year business is very good,' says Routsis. 'We are all enthusiasts, and we are managing to keep the team together, which is all we can hope for in the present circumstances.' Historic Flying, Audley End Airfield, Saffron Walden, Essex.

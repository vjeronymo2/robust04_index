			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Motorists 'treated like wallets on wheels'  -Driving costs Motorists were a prime target in the Budget with significant increases in real terms in duty on petrol and diesel and with a further rise in vehicle excise duty for cars. The average price of a gallon of unleaded petrol will rise by about 11p to Pounds 2.45. The Automobile Association condemned the chancellor's decision to add 2.5p to a litre of petrol and 3p to the price of a litre of diesel. Mr Clarke said that he was sticking to the government's commitment of a year ago to increase road fuel duties on average by at least 5 per cent in real terms. The rise, which took effect last night, was 'an important part of the government's strategy to return carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 level in the year 2000', Mr Clarke said. However this was attacked last night by motoring organisations. 'Increasing fuel duty by 5 per cent as an 'environmental incentive' is a sham, while the chancellor continues to increase vehicle excise duty, which is an antiquated tax on ownership that does nothing for the environment,' the AA said. It estimated last night that the average motorist's costs would increase by about Pounds 40 a year with petrol costs jumping by Pounds 35 a year and the cost of the tax disc rising by Pounds 5 a year to Pounds 135. 'Yet again Britain's 20m motorists have been treated like wallets on wheels . . . Drivers deserved a tax holiday after shouldering 1993's swingeing 24 per cent increase in fuel costs and 18 per cent increase in vehicle excise duty, but we have been clobbered again.' The chancellor also closed the differential between the duty on diesel and unleaded petrol, by raising the duty on diesel by about 3p a litre. The vehicle excise duty for trucks is being left unchanged, but the increase in diesel fuel duty will hit the road haulage sector. The Freight Transport Association estimated that this would increase industry's costs by Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m a year. The government is planning to reform the vehicle excise duty system by introducing 'continuous licensing', which will tax possession rather than use of a vehicle. A consultation paper is to be issued. Motorists such as classic car owners, who did not pay vehicle excise duty now because their cars were genuinely off the road, would not be disadvantaged, he said. Mr Clarke said the move was designed to combat evasion and to help fight crime by enabling the police accurately to check the ownership of vehicles. New powers are also to be proposed allowing vehicles parked on public roads without a valid tax disc to be wheel-clamped. Vehicle excise duty is expected to raise Pounds 3.7bn in 1994-95. Separately the system of concessions and exemptions from vehicle excise duty is to be simplified and modernised with the number of different concessionary classes to be reduced from 132 to nine. Around 75 per cent of those vehicles currently receiving special treatment will pay no more duty, and emergency vehicles, disabled drivers and most tractors will be unaffected. Rates on some categories such as recovery, road construction and street cleansing and lighting vehicles could rise steeply by more than Pounds 4,000, but increases in the first year will be limited to no more than Pounds 1,000.</p>

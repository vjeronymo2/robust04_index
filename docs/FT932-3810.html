			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Governor of Bank to leave with a peerage MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, outgoing governor of the Bank of England, is one of four life peers created in today's Queen's Birthday honours list. Another is Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the academic and writer. Mr Samuel Brittan, the Financial Times's principal economic commentator and an assistant editor, receives a knighthood for services to economic journalism. Mr David Buchan, head of the FT's Paris bureau, receives an OBE for services to journalism. Today's list reflects a further stage of Mr John Major's incremental reform of the honours system to give greater recognition to voluntary and community service. It includes honours for those involved in humanitarian relief work in former Yugoslavia. Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart, who commanded British troops in Bosnia, was awarded a Distinguished Service Order. The greater emphasis on a wider contribution to the community was highlighted in some of the awards to those in business and commerce, as well as those for charitable services. Among those receiving knighthoods were Mr Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC, the cable and construction group; Mr Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson International, the textile group and Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive of Halifax Building Society. While this is the first list in which the British Empire Medal - the lowest grade of honour - does not appear, other reforms promised by Mr Major in March will have to await future lists. The New Year's honours list will be the first for which people can write in to the prime minister's office to nominate someone. So far more than 10,000 nomination forms have been sent out and 6,000 have been returned. The proportion of awards to state servants was broadly in line with previous lists, though Downing Street said that now no official was nominated automatically. Political honours, however, were distributed at Westminster rather more sparsely than usual. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, and Sir George Young, housing minister, both become privy counsellors, but only two Conservative backbenchers, Mr Ralph Howell and Mr David Knox, receive knighthoods. Among the customary awards to artists and entertainers are the other two life peers: Sir Richard Attenborough, the actor and film director, and Sir Yehudi Menuhin, the violinist and conductor. Miss Thora Hird, the actress, and Miss Muriel Spark, the author, both become Dames. Mr Nicholas Colchester, deputy editor of the Economist and former foreign editor of the FT, receives an OBE for services to journalism. In what may be a sign of the times, relatively few awards went to footballers and cricketers. Mr Andy Roxburgh, the Scottish football team manager receives the OBE. Mr Ray Wilkins, the former England soccer player, receives the MBE as does Mr Harold Larwood, a fast bowler who last played for England in the controversial 1932-33 'Bodyline' Ashes series against Australia.

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Norske Skog poised to launch convertible bond NORWAY'S Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers, plans to issue a convertible bond in the range of NKr550m to NKr700m, with maturity on December 31, 2000. The proposal will be made at the company's annual general meeting on May 14. The bond will be convertible into B shares. The issue is the last phase of a NKr6bn financing programme which was initiated in 1990 when a NKr500m convertible bond was launched. Norske Skog said that the new issue will be aimed at international capital markets and placed with a selected number of investors. To retain flexibility in fixing the terms, a framework for the new issue has been decided. The final proposal will cover the conversion premium, coupon, subscription period and payment date. The placement is scheduled for the period between May 6 and May 15, if the convertible bond is approved at the annual general meeting. Topdanmark, the Danish banking and insurance group, said its banking unit Aktivbanken will take over Sydfyns Discontobank as part of its strategy of building a nationwide financial services network. Sydfyns' end-1990 balance sheet total was DKr1.1bn.</p>

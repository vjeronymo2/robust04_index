			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dawson Holdings rises to Pounds 3.8m Dawson Holdings, the international journal distributor, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.01m to Pounds 3.83m for the year ended September 30, on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 119.9m. However, the company warned that curtailed price increases and the fact that most efficiency savings had already been made, meant it did not expect to show an improvement in profits next year. Dawson said the worldwide library market suffered intense cost pressures. Despite continued success in integrating units and winning new business in the EU, the US, the Middle East and China, it did not forecast a real increase in profit from its traditional businesses next year. Earnings per share climbed from 55p to 72p and the year's dividend is 26p (24p) with an unchanged 18p final.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 7 January at the office of the  Cambodian People's Party [CPP], a meeting was held to mark the  15th anniversary of the 7 January 1979 victory day.  High-ranking leaders of the CPP attending this meeting were His  Excellency [H.E.] Heng Samrin, the party's honorary chairman;  H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the party Central Committee;  H.E. Hun Sen, vice chairman of the party Central Committee;  members of the standing committee and of the CPP Central  Committee; and thousands of CPP members. Furthermore,  personalities representing a number of political parties taking  part in the May 1993 general elections; representatives of  international organizations; ambassadors of some countries in  Cambodia; and representatives of the clergy, intellectuals,  students, workers, farmers, ethnic groups, and the armed forces  were also invited to attend.    Speaking at this big meeting H.E. Heng Samrin, CPP honorary  chairman, stressed that we always remember the great and  energetic movement of our people throughout the country under  the banner of the front for national salvation of Cambodia and  the leadership of the CPP that helped save the nation and the  motherland and won back the rights, freedom, and hope that were  lost. As a result, conditions were created for the revival of  various achievements that had been brought about after national  independence 40 years ago.    H.E. Heng Samrin affirmed that without the 7 January 1979  victory day, the history of our country and nation -- famous for  building the wonderful Angkor civilization -- would have been  very unjustly concluded. H.E. Heng Samrin said proudly that we  now have a progressive constitution genuinely born of the  people's aspiration. We have rebuilt the Kingdom of Cambodia  under the banner of Nation, Religion, and King, which is the the  symbol of solidarity, peace, and progress. Under the roof of  the constitution, our land and people are united; no person or  force can break up our land and people. Going against this goal  is a crime that can destroy the nation -- one which the  Cambodian people cannot tolerate.    At the end of his speech H.E. Heng Samrin stressed heavily  that:    [Begin Heng Samrin recording] The brilliant results achieved  by our people are certainly most worthy of pride. However, this  is only the preliminary and necessary basis for our motherland's  long process. Although vigorous demands to raise economic and  social living standards are being made, many large obstacles,  and minor ones, confront us. If we are negligent and lack  vigilance or make any mistakes, this can certainly push society  and the nation back to the great disaster of the past.  Therefore, all of us should clearly understand the significance  and the main goals of this historic phase. We should strive to  hold aloft the banner of national independence and the banner of  great national solidarity to unite the nation with the aim of  vigorously rallying all kinds of forces from all circles to  defend the nation; building peace, unity, and stability; and  promoting social rehabilitation and development.    On this solemn occasion, on behalf of the CPP, we would like  to appeal to the clergy, all religious followers, intellectuals,  pupils, students, civil servants and officials, workers,  employees, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, the national police,  artisans, artists, traders of all ethnic groups, and all  citizens in and outside the country to unite around the king;  firmly abide by the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia;  actively take part in successfully implementing the political  program of the Royal Government; and strive to defend the social  and national achievements in order to reinforce the foundation  of happiness and prosperity of our nation. We appeal to various  parties, all social forces, and various political forces to  sincerely cooperate in implementing multiparty liberal democracy  by putting the supreme interests of the nation and people above  everything else.    We appeal to all countries the world over, international  organizations, and various nongovernmental organizations to  continue providing all manner of assistance and support to the  poor Cambodian people to help them restore and rebuild the land.    The 7 January spirit will forever remain in the soul of the  people. It is a voice reminding all Cambodians to strive to  preserve national solidarity in order to defend and build their  history and make it shine. The 7 January spirit has again  linked us to the nation's past glory and has created a new  revival force moving toward a brilliant future. The 7 January  spirit is an excellent example of our nation's genuine  patriotism. Without the 7 January 1979 day, there would be no  life today. [end Heng Samrin recording) [applause]</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Telegraph It is to be hoped that the glitterati who adorn the Hollinger and Telegraph boards can muster sufficient resolve to demand some straight answers from their chairman. Hollinger's sale of 12.5m Telegraph shares in May appears remarkably prescient considering the newspaper's later decision to shred its cover price. That news knocked 35 per cent off the Telegraph's shares yesterday. Those investors who bought the Hollinger shares are apoplectic. The stock exchange is right to investigate the background. Goldman Sachs and Cazenove, which facilitated the share placing, must also be musing whether the fees earned are worth the bad feeling that now surrounds their names. The Telegraph insists the decision to cut the cover price was taken after the share sale. It can also argue that none are as blind as those who do not want to see. The market should have expected some aggression when the Telegraph's circulation dropped below 1m in May. Mr Black made it plain at Hollinger's annual meeting - albeit, after the share sale - that 'remedial action' would be taken if the Telegraph's market supremacy were threatened. Bruised Telegraph shareholders will be little comforted by such arguments. The Times' vicious response to the Telegraph's move suggests that Mr Rupert Murdoch has a higher pain threshold than Mr Black. The newspaper industry will shudder at the thought that wars are much easier to start than they are to end.</p>

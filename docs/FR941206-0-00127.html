The residual associated with the shifted channel shall then be converted from per subscriber to aggregate numbers to ensure aggregate revenues from the channel remain the same when the channel is moved. The aggregate residual associated with the shifted channel may be shifted to the tier to which the channel is being moved. The residual shall then be converted to per subscriber figures on the new tier, plus any subsequent inflation adjustment. The price of the tier to which the channel is shifted may then be increased to reflect this amount. The price of that tier may also be increased to reflect any increase in programming cost. An operator may not shift a channel for which it received a per channel adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section from a CPST to a BST. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Substitution of channels on a BST or CPST. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If an operator substitutes a new channel for an existing channel on a CPST or a BST, no per channel adjustment may be made. Operators substituting channels on a CPST or a BST shall be required to reflect any reduction in programming costs in their rates and may reflect any increase in programming costs pursuant to paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section. If the programming cost for the new channel is greater than the programming cost for the replaced channel, and the operator chooses to pass that increase through to subscribers, the excess shall count against the License Fee Reserve or the Operator Cap when the increased cost is passed through to subscribers. Where an operator substitutes a new channel for a channel on which a 7.5% mark-up on programming costs was taken pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(xi) of this section, the operator may retain the 7.5% mark-up on the license fee of the dropped channel to the extent that it is no greater than 7.5% of programming cost of the new service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Headend upgrades for small systems. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When adding channels to CPSTs, independent small systems, as defined in &sect;76.901(c), and small systems owned by small multiple system operators, as defined in &sect;76.922(b)(5), may choose among the methodologies set forth in this paragraph and in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. Operators choosing the methodology of this paragraph may increase rates to recover the actual cost of the headend equipment required to add up to seven channels to CPSTs, not to exceed $5,000 per additional channel, plus any applicable programming costs. Rate increases pursuant to this paragraph may occur between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, as a result of additional channels offered on those tiers after May 14, 1994. Headend costs shall be depreciated over the useful life of the headend equipment. The rate of return on this investment shall not exceed 11.25 percent. In order to recover costs for headend equipment pursuant to this paragraph, small systems must certify to the Commission their eligibility to use this paragraph, the level of costs they have actually incurred for adding the headend equipment and the depreciation schedule for the equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sunset provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (e) of this section shall cease to be effective on January 1, 1998 unless renewed by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Section 76.964 is amended by revising the section heading to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

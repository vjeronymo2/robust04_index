			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.B.: "FIS Leaders Deny Pledge To End </F> Terrorism"]    [Text] Yesterday Mr. Boukhamkham and Mr. Djeddi, the two  FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders freed on 23 February,  broke the public silence that they have maintained since then  except at certain mosques where, by some accounts, they have  preached virulent sermons critical of the regime.    Their statement, which came as no surprise to political  observers, was clearly triggered by the recent communique from  the Algerian presidency accusing leaders of the dissolved FIS of  failing to honor commitments they had made to President Liamine  Zeroual during a meeting at Blida that was kept secret until  only a few days ago.    The "internal wing of the FIS" felt obliged to react to the  presidential communique, which had put it in an embarrassing  position, undercutting its public posture. The regime seems  unconcerned about reactions from the armed groups or from FIS  spokesmen overseas. What it was watching for was a reaction from  the FIS leaders with whom official contacts had been held; thus  this communique from two FIS leaders who were "graduates" of  Blida was important because it constituted a first response to  the authorities' overtures.    The freed FIS leaders--acting, it must be assumed, at the  behest of their leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj--took  pains in the communique they sent to AFP yesterday to deny the  assertions in the presidency communique. The statement by the  FIS leaders leads one to conclude either that the presidency  omitted significant details from its description of the meeting  between the incarcerated FIS leaders and Mr. Zeroual (who at the  time was defense minister for the HCE [Higher State Council]),  or that Boukhamkham and Djeddi are deliberately lying in a bid  to regain lost ground with the general public, by turning the  authorities' own arguments against them: specifically, by  alleging that it was the presidency that failed to meet its  commitments.    First of all, concerning the supposed promise by the  incarcerated FIS leaders to issue an appeal to end the violence,  as the presidency has asserted: The FIS communique denies making  such an offer and maintains that the detained FIS leaders  "rejected as premature and ineffective the proposal made by the  defense minister, General Liamine Zeroual, for the FIS to urge  the people to remain calm and law abiding."  <H5>  Serious Accusations </H5>   What is important about the statement is not whether the  defense minister or FIS leaders were telling the truth--someday  the history will come out, perhaps sooner than one might think,  since some sources say that recordings were made of the meetings  with the FIS--but rather the fact that the FIS admits it is  behind the terrorist acts. By denying they had pledged to stop  terrorism, the FIS leaders implicitly admitted that they have  the capacity to do so--or at least that they feel they do--and  claimed credit for the acts of violence.    The communique initialed by the two freed FIS leaders says  that the only commitment made by their leaders in detention was  to "seek a solution that is just and in accordance with the  shari'ah, in order to put an end to political and social  injustice and spare future generations from sanguinary  conflict." It is easy to see, if this statement is analyzed  closely, that FIS leaders see a commitment to help restore civil  peace as but the final stage of a process that should begin with  resolution of the political question, among other things by  rehabilitation of the dissolved party and release of all  incarcerated FIS leaders. The explicit reference to the shari'ah  is a way for FIS leaders to reaffirm their commitment to a  vision of society that they have always promoted and that they  are not prepared to negotiate away, even from behind prison bars.    The FIS communique spells out three conditions for "a  political solution to the political crisis and insecurity  racking the country." First, "the unconditional release of FIS  leaders, because imprisonment is a constraint, and when a man is  under constraint he cannot be responsible;" second, "access to  full and complete information on the general situation in the  country in all its political, economic, social, and security  aspects, so it will be possible to design an adequate solution,  in accordance with the shari'ah, that will save the country and  the people;" and finally, "permission to remain in direct  contact and consult widely with the other leaders, since we are  all members of one group and cannot make decisions without  consulting with our brothers." Observers will have noted that  the internal political wing of the FIS has softened its earlier  demands: At one time, it demanded nothing less than to come to  power via a return to the electoral process and the status quo  ante of 26 December 1992. The three conditions posed by the two  FIS leaders, with the concurrence of their incarcerated chiefs,  mark a significant break with both the intransigence of the  armed groups--who respect nothing but brute force--and the  increasingly strident extremism of the party leaders in exile.  Readers are reminded of the six "commandments" of Rabah Kebir,  who demanded not only the release of the FIS leaders and all the  imprisoned party militants, but also trials for the country's  current leaders and the holding of a dialogue in a neutral  country. The question thus arises: Which of the groups has  legitimacy--the armed groups, the FIS's internal political wing,  or the leadership in exile?    The FIS communique also informs us that Mr. Zeroual promised  incarcerated FIS leaders the unconditional release of four of  the seven leaders held at Blida, the transfer to house arrest of  Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, and closing of the "security  centers" in the south before the end of the month of Ramadhan.  Not only were these promises not kept, the communique says,  but--an even more serious accusation--also some detainees freed  from the camps in the south were killed almost as soon as they  returned to their homes.    We must certainly expect that within the next few hours the  presidency will respond to the allegations in the FIS  communique.</p>

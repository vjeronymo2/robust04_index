			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Foreign  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin pointed out this afternoon at the  press conference that China is fully capable of meeting GATT  requirements, and it hopes that with the joint efforts of the  GATT Secretariat and signatories, the negotiations for resuming  China's membership can be speeded up.    He said this in reply to a reporter's question.    Wu Jianmin said: China's reforms in its economic and trade  structure over the last 15 years, particularly its progressive  establishment of a socialist market economic system, have put  its foreign trade system on a market economic footing and have  rendered the system more in line with GATT requirements.  Therefore, most of the GATT signatories agreed that under these  circumstances, an agreement on China's resuming its GATT  membership can be reached. GATT Secretary General Mr. Sutherland  has spoken a great deal on this issue, giving much active  support to China's GATT bid. China appreciates and commends his  efforts.    Wu Jianmin said: China's reforms in its foreign trade system  have greatly increased the transparency of its trade rules and  regulations. In line with its resumption of GATT membership,  China has done much work in ensuring the transparency of foreign  trade policies and rules and regulations, making a good start.  To guarantee the unity and transparency of foreign economic and  trade policies, all rules and regulations concerning foreign  economic activities and trade are promulgated by the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], the National  People's Congress, and the State Council only. MOFTEC has  processed and released a total of 93 internal documents still in  effect and announced the revoking of four batches of documents  totaling 744. China will also shortly be unveiling its Foreign  Trade Law. The above facts show that China is fully capable of  meeting GATT requirements.</p>

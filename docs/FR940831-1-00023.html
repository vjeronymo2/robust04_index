Commodities that have been evaluated for carriage but have not been included in the regulations, and for which the Coast Guard has information indicating that they are no longer viable bulk liquid cargoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Commodities that have been evaluated or proposed for evaluation but which had not been included in the regulations, and for which the Coast Guard has no information as to their viability as bulk liquid cargoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard requests assistance from interested parties who may know of additional obsolete commodities or classifications, or who have information concerning a commodity listed above. In a future rulemaking, the Coast Guard may propose to delete from its regulations those commodities no longer viable as bulk liquid cargoes, and cancel the classification of obsolete commodities. Any viable entry will be retained. Any entry retained will be submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for inclusion in its Chemical Codes if not already listed. Also, for any entry identified as obsolete but listed in the Chemical Codes, the Coast Guard will propose that it be deleted from those Codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard intends to periodically propose deletion of commodities no longer manufactured or moved in bulk by vessel, from the tables and lists in titles 33 and 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Toward that end, the Coast Guard requests the continued assistance of interested parties in identifying obsolete entries and classifications in its regulations. Commodities submitted as obsolete will be published with requests for comments at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph J.

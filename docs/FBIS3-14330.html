			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn returned to the homeland  this afternoon with God's care at the end of visits to the  Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar. During his visits,  his majesty and his brother Sultan Qabus Bin Sa'id, and his  brother his Highness Qatari Amir Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al  Thani, exchanged views on various current Arab and international  issues, in addition to the unqiue relations between Jordan and  each of the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, and the  latest developments in the peace process in the wake of UN  Security Council Resolution No. 904.    His Majesty King Husayn spoke to the press about the visits  following his return to the homeland:    [Begin recording] [Husayn] In the name of God, the merciful,  the compasionate. The visit to the Sultanate of Oman, the  meeting with the brother sultan and the relatives there was  excellent. It is a continuation of the solid relations between  us; relations among brothers. Also, my visit to fraternal Qatar  was a very good visit. It gave us the opportunity to discuss all  matters that interest us in the Arab homeland, and the course of  events, such as the peace process and the situation in the  occupied territories with respect to the past and the present.  Thank God, the solid groundwork on which we established our  relations years ago are still solid.    [Unidentified reporter] Sir, how do you view the scope of  joint Arab action in light of your visit to the fraternal  countries?    [Husayn] We have every hope that God almighty will guide the  Arab leaders so they realize the importance of these  circumstances and the need for work to confront these challenges  in a manner that satisfies all of us. It goes without saying  that these are fateful challenges. As for the brothers I  visited, it seems to me, or I am confident, that we proceed in  the same direction and adopt the same approach toward all that  has taken place.    [Reporter] What about your talks with Sultan Qabus about  Jordanian-Omani joint efforts on Yemeni reconciliation. Is  there anything new in this respect?    [Husayn] The new thing is that, thanks to God, there has  been  an effort that was successful from the beginning. We have been  working for many months. This is our duty in response to a  Yemeni and Arab request, and out of our duty toward our  brothers. Then came the document, and Yemen, with all its  representatives meeting here, ratified the document. We were  then surprised by the painful and disturbing reports. A joint  military delegation left and assumed its role as best it can.  Thanks be to God, they completed their task. With respect to  the future, I am confident that we will always be ready to carry  out any duty. However, the basic job should be done by the  brothers in Yemen toward what they ratified and what reflects,  in my opinion, the aspirations and wishes of all the sons of  Yemen. We ask God for the success of the task we and the  brothers in Oman have carried out.    [Reporter] Your majesty, there are resolutions that preceded  resolution 904 on Jerusalem, saying that it is occupied Arab  land. How do you view Jordan's stand in this direction?    [Husayn] We now seek clarifications on the stand. But, all  the UN Security Council resolutions view Jerusalem as part of  the Arab lands that were occupied in 1967. It seems that a few  years ago, there was a warning from the U.S. side that if the  question of Jerusalem was raised, then the stand would be the  one that has taken place, or they said that their stand would be  firmer with respect to using the veto. Actually, and as I said  a fews days ago, I was taken by surprise by the situation on  Friday. I was in the south, and I immediately returned.  Perhaps, for certain considerations, it was a mistake to raise  the issue of Jerusalem. The world at large knows Jerusalem is  part of the ocupied Arab territories. In any case, we seek to  obtain assurances that the stand on this reality and situation  has not changed. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

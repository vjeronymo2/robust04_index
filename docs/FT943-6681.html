			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: US investment fund may take stake in Vox GS Capital Partners, an investment fund run by the US securities house Goldman Sachs, may take a a 25.2 per cent stake in Vox, the ailing German television station which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation recently bought into. GSCP would not comment on the details of the purchase yesterday, but said negotiations were likely to be completed over the next few weeks. 'We are interested but we have not made any decision yet,' said a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. News Corporation last month acquired a 49 per cent stake for nothing after negotiations with Bertelsmann, the international media group, which started the station at the beginning of 1993 and has been struggling to keep it alive after it went into liquidation in March this year. Bertelsmann holds a 24.9 per cent stake. Any deal with GSCP would need the approval of the authorities for four Lander. GSCP, a Dollars 1bn investment fund set up in 1992, has made a series of US media investments. Together with two US partners the fund recently entered the UK market, paying Dollars 150m for an 80 per cent stake in Nottingham-based Diamond Cable Communications. Vox, which has an audience share of about 2 per cent, may be attractive because it is one of only three channels to have access to the entire German terrestrial and cable television network. However, the channel is estimated to have cost its original six shareholders about DM400 during the 15 months before it went into liquidation. Various international media groups, including CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcaster, were rumoured to be considering a stake in the venture as Bertelsmann searched for partners. The Cologne-based station has limped along over the last five months, operating on a skeleton staff and buying in its news programmes from Spiegel TV, another German operator.</p>

According to a ROK Government source, the ROK has  adopted a principle to use the resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint  exercises as a bargaining chip for future negotiations with the  DPRK (North Korea) over that nation's alleged nuclear weapons  development program. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is  now visiting China, is expected to fly directly to the United  States to finalize the policy with such U.S. leaders as  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary  William Perry.    On 28 March, a ROK Government source told an ASAHI SHIMBUN  reporter the following: "The U.S. Forces Korea have already  determined their deployment of Patriot missiles, and the  decision will not be revised. As for Team Spirit, it may be  resumed in April or May if North Korea decides to completely  withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). At  the present, however, we are undecided whether or not the  exercises should be resumed. It depends on North Korea's future  course of action."    An early resumption of Team Spirit was advocated by the ROK  Defense Ministry when North Korea refused to fully accept  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections, and the  issue was brought to the UN Security Council. The ROK  Presidential Office and Foreign Ministry are taking a positive  stand toward the resumption but say that "the timing will be  decided on in consultations with the United States after  President Kim Yong-sam's trip to Japan and China."    Nevertheless, North Korea reacted strongly to such moves,  stressing: "If Team Spirit is held and the IAEA maintains its  unfair attitudes, we will withdraw completely from the NPT."    Now that the cold war has ended, Team Spirit is the United  States' biggest exercise featuring emergency operations and  field battles. To cope with the exercise, North Korea has  always activated its armed forces and conducted large-scale  exercises as counteractions. Moreover, even the general public  had to put up with evacuation exercises and blackouts. Thus,  Team Spirit has been a great burden for North Korea.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALES FOR A SUMMER DAY  </P> <P> I congratulate Sandra Cisneros for her masterpiece of derogatory terms against  Hispanic immigrants, especially Mexicans, in her "Woman Hollering Creek."  Cisneros must have a superiority complex when she looks at other persons of her  own race.  </P> <P> Her story concentrates on searching out the wrong behavior of new immigrants.  The unnecessary abuse of the Spanish language while she is writing in English  makes her story look even more grotesque and awkward. It seems like Cisneros is  ashamed of her ancestors, their traditions, their "criminal" ignorance and  their mistaken habits.  </P> <P> It is necessary for Chicano authors to remember that they are descendants of  peasants. They should never expect great discourses from their parents or  relatives, who came to this country as manual workers; it's not their fault  that they are not educated in the literary arts. They have contributed to the  magnificence of the country with their hard work -- and by paying taxes to  finance the university educations that people like Cisneros enjoyed. Most  immigrants brought with them their traditions and culture, they taught the  Spanish language to their children hoping to preserve their roots. Now those  children feel dishonor about being Hispanic.  </P> <P> So that, Chicano authors escape from their frustrations by writing the trash  that makes their ancestors look so bad.  </P> <P> MIGUEL SANCHEZ GRACIA  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

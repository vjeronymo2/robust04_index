			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MONTANA;  </P> <P> DECISION ON KILLING BUFFALO IS DELAYED  </P> <P> State wildlife officials in Helena, Mont., put off a decision on a plan for  federal wardens and state rangers to kill bison that wander out of Yellowstone  National Park to ensure that they do not spread disease to cattle.  </P> <P> About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 buffalo in the park are believed to carry  brucellosis, which causes cattle to abort. Animal rights groups contend the  threat of the bisons' passing the disease to domestic cattle is minimal, but  Montana ranchers say the invading bison should not be allowed even the  slightest chance to contaminate rangeland. Montana spent millions of dollars  over a decade to eradicate brucellosis.  </P></p>

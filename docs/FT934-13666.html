			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (19): Unsung hero is unique - Profile: London Clearing House TUCKED away in the back streets of the City of London is the unsung hero of the capital's rapidly-growing derivatives industry, the London Clearing House (LCH). LCH, which was founded in 1888 to clear coffee and sugar trades, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the financial integrity and the efficiency of four of London's exchanges. These are the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), the London Commodity Exchange (LCE), the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and the London Metal Exchange (LME). LCH meets its two main priorities through its primary role as the central counterparty for trades executed on the four exchanges. Its ability to take on counterparty risk provides a solid trading framework for its 171 members because their counterparty risk is considerably reduced and market liquidity is enhanced. In addition, LCH's unique position as the only futures clearing house in the world to clear several markets and different products through a centralised and automated system has allowed members to make considerable savings in their settlement costs. 'Members with positions on all four markets can cover all their liabilities with one single payment,' says Mr David Hardy, LCH's managing director. LCH controls the risk of being exposed to a potential default by a member in two ways, through counterparty assessment and margining. Applicants for LCH membership are vetted thoroughly before they become members and LCH continuously reviews existing members to ensure they satisfy the following criteria: Relevant exchange membership; Relevant authorisation under the Financial Services Act of 1986; Banking arrangements for the immediate transfer of funds to LCH on demand; Adequate resources to comply with day-to-day requirements of LCH membership; Minimum financial resource requirements. LCH monitors each member's risk exposure on all four exchanges and analyses it in relation to their ability to cover their liabilities. If the LCH believes that a member's business is out of line with its resources - for example, it might have an unusually large position or a concentration of its margin in a single contract - it will ask the member to put up additional resources or ask it to restrict its business volume. So far, LCH has managed to assess its counterparties with a high degree of accuracy and in its 105-year history it has only had to expel one member, a subsidiary of BCCI, in 1987. The other way in which LCH dampens down its risk profile is by setting margins which are calculated daily and whichmembers have to cover daily with a deposit of funds or with collateral. Margin, which is a measure of the risk of a member's positions, has two main components: initial margin to provide cover for potential adverse movements and variation margin to cover previous price movements. Mr Hardy says that margins are essential so that markets can be seen to be able to trade in times of extreme price volatility but at the same time provide protection for members by not allowing their liabilities and resources to get out of balance. For example, during the Gulf War, margin rates were increased substantially to reflect the big swings in the price of gas oil futures. LCH asked members to improve their resources by way of bank guarantees. When prices stabilised the bank guarantees were returned to the members. 'Margining can be seen as the barometer of the volatility in the market and it serves to neutralise the risk,' says Mr Hardy. He adds that LCH and its members are given additional protection by the diverse nature of the markets and the products cleared by LCH. 'The risks will be different at any one time,' he says, noting that during the stock market crashes of 1987 and 1989 there was hardy any reaction on the other exchanges. LCH regularly holds more than Pounds 1bn in cash in margin money which it invests in overnight money markets. It pays members interest on their margins - usually the bid rate on the London interbank rate (Libor) minus 1/4 - and very often members leave more money than they have to with LCH because of the favourable interest rate. Surplus interest income on the margins forms part of LCH's income. As well as keeping transaction costs down, the interest income helps LCH achieve its third priority, that is, making a sensible profit for its owners. LCH is owned by six leading UK clearing banks: Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered Bank. These six banks provide the backing for LCH's counterparty risk, which amounts to Pounds 150m. Mr Hardy is confident that LCH's structure will enable it to continue to clear the ever-increasing trading volumes generated by London's growing derivatives industry. By October 7, LCH had cleared 112.5m contracts, exceeding the total number of trades cleared during the whole of last year. Total volume for this year is expected to reach 155m contracts. LCH has also taken steps to ensure that it can continue to provide an uninterrupted clearing service for the exchanges if its systems fail or if its building is out of action. All its computers are now located in south London and there is a back-up system in west London where it also has office space. 'LCH has a triangulated provision of service,' says Mr Hardy.</p>

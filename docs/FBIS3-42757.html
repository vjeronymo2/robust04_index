			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kestutis Jauniskis: "The 4th Sajudis Congress: A </F> Rejection of Politics?"]    [Text] The more than 500 delegates who came to Vilnius for  the fourth Sajudis congress Saturday did not expect significant  disagreement on the future of Sajudis; the previously publicized  reports of the Sajudis city and district conferences that took  place earlier had indicated that most of the participants in  those conferences were in favor of Sajudis remaining a mass  organization. Of 3572 Sajudis members polled, 304 stated that  Sajudis should cease its activities, only 18 of those polled  were prepared to reorganize Sajudis into a political  organization, and 344 expressed the view that Sajudis should  remain a mass political movement.    V. Landsbergis, the honorary chairman of Sajudis, opened the  proceedings by asserting that Sajudis had always been  consistent, that during its five years of activity it had  created and nurtured its party--the National Union [Tevynes  Sajunga]. In V. Landsbergis' opinion, that was the final task of  Sajudis, and it was now necessary to think about new forms of  activity which would help defend against internal and external  threats. The professor mentioned several of these in his  speech--the "Zhirinovskyization" of Russia, as well as her  efforts to acquire the mandate of peacekeeper, to which the  statements of the Russian and British foreign ministers in the  English press testified, the attempts to recreate the Bolshevik  party and soviet rule in Lithuania, as well as the actual  readiness of the LDDP [Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party] to  accept the Russian yoke.    V. Landsbergis cited the rejuvenation of Lithuania as the  primary assignment for the new Sajudis. Sajudis could look after  volunteers, farmers, and the Lithuanian schools. It could rally  the forces of the political right. "Sajudis must be Lithuania's  mainstay," said V. Landsbergis.    In an analysis of the results of the last two years of  Sajudis activity, Chairman A. Katkus of the Sajudis Seimas  Council said that those were years of intense political  struggle, which were overshadowed by the victory of the LDDP.  "The leaders of Sajudis could be blamed, or even condemned, but  the clock cannot be turned back, nor the previous status quo  restored," said A. Katkus. In his opinion, Sajudis had made  mistakes--it had not psychologically prepared the people for  reforms, it had not taken over the means of mass communication,  and it had dissociated itself from Supreme Council deputies that  it had formerly supported. A. Katkus also informed the delegates  to the congress of his resignation from the Sajudis chairmanship.    A wide range of opinions were expressed in the discussions  that took place after lunch. They were greeted by the delegates  either with approving applause, or with a stamping of feet and  retorts indicating dissatisfaction. Much criticism was directed  at S. Valentinavicius and R. Gajauskaite, ex-leaders of the  Vilnius city Sajudis council; according to V. Narbutas, they had  expressed extremist opinions and had wanted to separate Sajudis  from the National Union. V. Nezgada said that no party can claim  the Sajudis name. "We may help the National Union, but we cannot  cater to it exclusively. Conversely, it cannot adopt the  attitude that 'we can do whatever we want with Sajudis.'" In V.  Nezgada's opinion, this congress can make no decisions  concerning the future of Sajudis, for two-thirds of the deputies  belong to the National Union, which is already speaking of  future victories, though there is no way of knowing whether they  will take place or not.    One delegate asked why Sajudis should not remain what it has  always been, a mass political movement, and further, why it was  that people who called themselves democrats could not seem to  tolerate dissenting opinions and began to stamp their feet,  while others said that those Sajudis members who are trying to  seize Sajudis were functionaries who even dealt in threats.    The vote on the future of Sajudis confirmed the results of  the poll of the Sajudis rank and file--468 delegates came out in  favor of making Sajudis a mass organization, 30 wanted Sajudis  to become a mass political organization, and 32 felt that  Sajudis should cease its activities.    After the results of the voting were announced, member of  the  Seimas K. Uoka took the floor and read a statement that  expressed disagreement with any change in the status of Sajudis.  According to the authors of the statement, prior to the congress  in-depth discussions of the future of Sajudis had been avoided,  there had been no assessment of the mistakes made during the  period in power, nor of the reasons for the defeat in the Seimas  elections and of the loss of the press. The statement went on to  say that a new group was being organized, which will be open to  present and future members of Sajudis.    By the way, at the 3rd congress of Sajudis, which took place  on December 14-15 of 1991, K. Uoka said that Sajudis was  torturing Lithuania with scripts and speeches, upbraided the  then-current government of G. Vagnorius, and said that it had to  be kept in line by "strong blows from outside." The speech K.  Uoka gave then was greeted with a thunderous ovation, and soon  signs appeared, reading "K. Uoka for Chairman of Sajudis."    When asked by LIETUVOS RYTAS at the press conference that  took place Saturday evening for his opinion about the decision  of his colleague K. Uoka to create a new Sajudis group, V.  Landsbergis said that it would be a new organization, and would  not be Sajudis. To do this, in the professor's opinion, would be  a political mistake--just like the one K. Ouka made when during  the presidential elections he announced his candidacy and  thereby split the rightist forces. According to V. Landsbergis,  Sajudis should remain a movement uniting those who dread the  word "party," or who are not yet inclined to join any party.    According to A. Katkus, a participant in the press  conference, it is difficult to create a viable organizational  structure within Sajudis because its membership is concerned  solely with Lithuanian independence. In recalling the  suggestions that were made at the 3rd Sajudis congress to recast  Sajudis into a party, V. Landsbergis observed that at that time  Sajudis was affected by destructive forces, and that in the  meantime, the National Union had matured as the Sajudis party.  "That was combined with political blows and losses," emphasized  V. Landsbergis.    The congress confirmed the Sajudis platform and bylaws,  according to which former CPSU-Lithuanian CP secretaries of the  national, district, and city organizations, current members of  the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, and former KGB employees  were barred from participating in Sajudis. R. Batura, the holder  of a doctorate in history, was elected chairman of the Sajudis  council. The Sajudis council also includes Seimas members A.  Racas, I. Uzdavinys, and A. Vaisnoras.    The congress accepted several resolutions, statements, and a  declaration. Among other things, the last states that "the day  of the old forces is drawing to a close. We are convinced that  by peaceful, democratic means, we will soon reach the point at  which the helm of the country will be taken by people who are  genuinely concerned with the welfare and fate of the nation."  The resolution "On Lack of Confidence in Lithuanian Democratic  Labor Party's Economic Policy," like a resolution of the  National Union conference, came out in favor of holding Seimas  and municipal elections concurrently.</p>

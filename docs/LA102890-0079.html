			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL RESEARCH  </P> <P> The Times' editorial ("Animal Research," Oct. 20), urging a Yes vote on  Proposition C -- the relinquishing of lost animals in pounds or shelters to  UCSD for research -- is a masterpiece of intellectual dishonesty.  </P> <P> The pivotal issue is not whether medical research performed on animals "could  lead to progress in fighting diseases afflicting both humans and animals."  </P> <P> It is about the legitimacy of taking lost or abandoned animals for research  from a place of refuge.  </P> <P> Why all the fancy rhetoric about medical research on animals? Proposition C has  nothing to do with that -- as The Times well knows. It is about the corruption  of a place of refuge for lost or abandoned animals, never intended to be a  warehouse facility for scientists at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  </P> <P> Most disturbing is that the origin of dogs and cats in pounds is clear -- most  are former pets. Pound seizure is a companion animal issue which corrupts the  entire purpose of animal shelters: A safe place, offering protection from  injury, abuse and exploitation and, should the necessity arise, the painless  ending of their lives.  </P> <P> WALDRON SCOTT, Escondido  </P></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / The Property Market: Winners in the leasing game - Commercial tenancy agreements differ widely between countries within Europe Are certain clauses in the English commercial occupational lease 'iniquitous', as Samuel Brittan described them (Economic Viewpoint, July 30)? In the Single European Market which comes into effect at the end of 1992, there will be many anomalies between European countries, especially as far as commercial office leases are concerned. For both occupiers and investors, these anomalies need to be understood. But of greater significance is the question of who benefits from these differences: the tenant or the owner? Lease terms vary across Europe enormously. The standard lease in Belgium, for instance, is a nine-year lease with both the tenant and the building owner having the option to terminate the lease every three years. In each year the lease rent can be increased by a factor linked to the consumer price index. This means that an increase can happen at a time when open market rents for new lettings are actually falling. In France a similar arrangement exists, although the rent is indexed upwards according to the cost of construction index rather than the consumer price index. Germany and the Netherlands have a similar arrangement except that the leases are normally for five or 10 years; once again there is the provision for indexation. In Italy a standard lease is for six years, also with indexation, but to only 75 per cent of a government inflation index. In Spain leases are for three or five years, also with indexation. The UK has the most unusual lease structure in Europe. The 25-year lease is not only the longest lease term commonly granted, but there are normally no indexation provisions. Instead, every five years, the lease is revalued upwards to the current 'open market value' of the building concerned. The advantage for the occupier is that rent is only reviewed upwards, if the market value increases. However the tenant may have the benefit of an unrealistically low rent if, during the five-year period, the rental value increases. The measurement of office floor space as 'occupied' by tenant varies enormously across Europe, depending on whether it includes the lift area, toilets, stairway and other elements of the building which cannot be strictly occupied by the tenant. It is this measurement of floor space which is normally used to calculate a quoted rent per square metre or per square foot. Therefore, a simple comparison of quoted office rents across Europe can be very misleading. To obtain a true international rental comparison, it is necessary to make an adjustment to quoted rental figures. For instance, the implication is that an annual rental level in Belgium quoted as BFr8,000 to BFr9,000 a square metre (about Dollars 25 a square foot) should in effect be BFr13,000 a square metre per year (Dollars 40 a square foot), using the method of calculation in the UK. A further issue which complicates the picture relates to sharing the risk between the occupier and owner for the management and maintenance of the building. The UK is again in an unusual position in that the occupying lessee is normally responsible not only for paying rent for a 'net area', but also for all the cost of management and maintenance of the building, plus insurance. This covers both the inside and outside of the buildings, including structural items. In many other parts of Europe, the tenant is not responsible for the cost of repairs to the external walls and maintenance or the structure of the building. Other costs, including agents' fees, service charges, taxes and legal costs also vary substantially. From the occupational point of view, the quoted rent, therefore, is a first guide only to the likely cost of occupation. It is far more important for the lessee to take into consideration the total costs and legal obligations, perhaps over the first three or five years of the lease. With all these various lease terms quoted across Europe, it is important to ask who benefits from which system. The system of occupational leasehold tenure used in the UK of a 25-year lease was created by the institutional dominance of the property market. As the pension funds and life insurance companies became more involved in the market, particularly during the 1970s, they were able increasingly to dictate the terms for an 'institutional lease'. The irony is that, in the last 20 years, the property market in the UK has been more volatile than that in other parts of Europe, such as France and Germany. The institution-dominated market has encouraged a greater level of short-term bank lending, based on the premise that the developer would be able to sell his development on to an institutional investor on the completion of the development. The availability of short-term debt finance has exacerbated the overdevelopment of office buildings at periods of property boom. The higher levels of inflation in the UK have also encouraged this type of loan, with asset values often rising ahead of building costs, reducing the real cost of the loan or mortgage finance over time. It could also be argued that this has encouraged poor quality office buildings, where the specification has been dictated by developers with short-term interests and by institutions not fully conversant with the needs of occupiers. At times of property slump, tenants have been in a powerful position to influence events. But such timing has often coincided with a period in the market when very little investment in the office stock is taking place. Hence, tenants have had to make do with poorly specified buildings, although they have been able to negotiate very favourable levels of rent in some cases. In other parts of Europe, especially France and Germany, the extremes of boom and slump noticed in the UK have not taken place. Banks have been reluctant to forward funds for office development unless all or part of a building development has been pre-let or the covenant of the company raising the debt is very substantial. In general, the occupational leasehold tenure system in different countries simply shifts the investment risk of providing office buildings, particularly in the short to medium term, in favour of the tenant or the investor. The system in the UK appears to put a large element of risk on the tenant, yet the systems in Belgium and France appear to put more risk on the building owner, sometimes inhibiting large-scale development. But - at a time when several British developers are in financial trouble - it is perhaps questionable whether the tenant does take on an unfair burden of risk.

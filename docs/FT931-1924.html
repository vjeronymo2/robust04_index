			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Observer: In the long run As if tying up a Pounds 1bn takeover wasn't enough of a sweat, Kingfisher's Nigel Whittaker and Tim Clement-Jones are training for the London marathon. They've been spotted running round Paris and Brussels, as well as London, while engaged on the Darty deal. Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, has never run a marathon before, but has been building up his reserves with daily runs from Marylebone Road to Tower Bridge and back. Should he and group legal eagle Clement-Jones make it round the marathon course, they hope to raise Pounds 10,000 for charity. Surely he can't be the only director of a FT-SE 100 company planning to compete in next month's big event?</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (18): Age-old problems remain - Julian Ozanne examines the progress of the agricultural sector / A look at the food industry, cocoa plantations, the palm oil industry and the timber industry AGRICULTURE is the barometer of the depth and successes of the past six years of structural adjustment, more than any other sector of the economy. As the government repeatedly says, growth in food production and stimulation of agricultural exports are critical to efforts to raise the low standards of living of Nigeria's expanding population. Agriculture's central economic importance cannot be overstated. It continues to provide jobs and livelihoods for at least 70 per cent of the estimated population of 110m. However, in spite of some impressive initial gains in macro-economic adjustment, most notably in food crop production and cocoa exports, many of the underlying structural weaknesses in the sector have not been addressed by the government. Partly, this can be explained by poor policy analysis and implementation. Yet it is the continuing powerful and negative influence of vested interests with political muscle that obstructs more concentrated reform. Eight years ago, before the introduction of the reform programme, the Financial Times survey of 1984 set out the devastating agricultural legacy of the oil boom years and the challenges facing the sector. Agriculture, it said, was suffering from stagnating food production, declining exports, a low level of investment and inadequate rural infrastructure and extension services to farmers. In 1984, the crippling cost of food imports was Dollars 2bn and traditional exports of rubber, cocoa, ground nuts and palm oil had slumped to pathetic levels. The sector was inefficient and heavily subsidised. It had been hit by an overvalued exchange rate which gave poor price incentives to farmers and meant costs of production were 50 per cent higher than those of other international producers. 'Regular and adequate inputs of fertiliser are probably the single most important factor in Nigeria's attempt to boost agricultural production,' the FT said. These concerns were at the heart of government thinking when President Ibrahim Babangida launched the structural adjustment programme in August 1986 and, since then, agriculture has been at the heart of the government stated policy rethink. Some of the problems identified in 1984 have been addressed. Devaluation, the abolition of state-run marketing boards, the introduction of import bans on grains, rice, meat and poultry, export prohibitions on food staples and price liberalisation have created impressive early gains. The World Bank-funded Agricultural Development Programmes (ADP), now set up in every state, have made some significant, if uneven, progress in extension services and developing research linkages to the farmers. A steady growth rate of 2.5-3.5 per cent a year over the last five years has reversed the sector's previous decline. According to President Babangida, agriculture grew 4.35 per cent in 1990 and 5 per cent in 1991 as a result of improved domestic terms of trade, government funding of extension and rural infrastructure and easy access by farmers to rural credit. Good rainfall throughout the past 12 months considerably improved production of food crops, especially cassava and maize. However, many of the age-old problems remain as strong today as they were eight years ago. The large gaps between the official and parallel rates of exchange before the floating of the naira, restricted investment in productive activity and has been a serious constraint to growth. Inefficient and costly subsidies on fertiliser (which consumes most of the federal agriculture budget), poor research and extension services, inadequate access to credit and the lack of a consistent policy environment for investment in commercial farming all combine to curb production. New investment in agricultural processing industries over the past five years has been minimal with a handful of new projects in soy milk, baby food, cotton, palm oil and vegetable processing. In the longer term, the government must develop urgently a coherent and comprehensive policy to stem severe environmental degradation which, according to a recent report by the World Bank, is costing the country Dollars 5bn a year. Soil erosion, water contamination, deforestation, desertification, flooding, gully and coastal erosion, inefficient urban sewerage systems, water hyacinth and fishery and wildlife destruction are only some of the factors held to blame. Food self-sufficiency will also depend on how effectively the government harnesses its considerable water resources, particularly in the arid and semi-arid northern and middle belt states. Three policy issues stand out: Fertiliser policy. Last year Nigerian farmers applied about 800,000 tonnes of fertiliser - an average of 9kg a hectare. This rate of application is 10 per cent of what farmers in the US use and only 5 per cent of what is applied in Europe. Agricultural experts say the government's continuing refusal to solve the fertiliser problem severely holds potential growth in the sector from higher yields, particularly in maize, rice and vegetable production. The price of fertiliser was increased last year from N20 to N40 a bag as part of the government's long-stated goal of phasing out subsidies and attempting to streamline fertiliser distribution through state governments. However, in practice about half of the fertiliser falls into the hands of middlemen and traders who smuggle it to neighbouring countries or stockpile it and sell it on the domestic black market at prices between N80 and N100. This leads to shortages and most farmers, particularly smallholders, end up short of sufficient fertiliser at critical times. Economists argue that since farmers are prepared, within existing producer price incentives, to pay between N80 and N100 a bag, that shows the ability of the market to respond to privatisation of the procurement and distribution of fertiliser and a reduction in the N1.5-N2bn a year federal and state government subsidy. Opposition to this policy from powerful politically connected northern businessmen is the greatest obstacle to reform. The Exchange Rate. No sector will be more grateful to government than agriculture for this month's floating of the naira. Previously, any investment in agriculture and particularly agro-industry was unattractive. The foreign exchange risks for machinery and spare parts imported from abroad, high local interest rates and the long-term nature of agricultural projects far outweighed the 15-20 per cent returns on capital possible in the sector. Failure to devalue adequately also encouraged trading rather than production, considerable naira speculation and capital flight via commodity exports. If the Naira now floats freely and remains stable, productive investments in agriculture will once again become serious options. Water resources. Agriculture in the northern and middle belt states will continue to remain vulnerable to rainfall. Nigeria has an estimated 2m hectares of irrigable land but so far experiments in irrigation have failed to take off. The World Bank is planning a Dollars 68m loan to promote the use of 40,000 small-scale irrigation pumps in the northern valley bottom (fadama) areas. However, donors and farmers are waiting for the government to develop a master plan to harness the country's water resources and promote low cost, small scale, private irrigation. It will be more difficult to develop extension services, appropriate research and technology transfer and combat environmental degradation although new policy directives on these issues will be critical to more rapid growth. The past six years of structural adjustment have demonstrated that Nigeria's small-scale farmers are dynamic and responsive to market-oriented reforms and price signals. But if Nigeria is going to meet the agricultural challenge presented by its expanding population, the policy programme has to be deepened and some politically difficult choices must be faced.</p>

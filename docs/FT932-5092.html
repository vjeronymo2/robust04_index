			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone pauses A week of exceptionally heavy turnover and strong gains in Vodafone shares culminated in the stock price easing back despite news that US investors have been increasing their holdings in the shares during recent weeks. Vodafone shares, the FT-SE 100's best performer last month with a 17.3 per cent rise, reached a year's high in mid-week, but dipped 1 1/2 to 454 1/2 p yesterday. The company, which announced highly encouraging new subscriber numbers for its cellular telephone businesses this week, is scheduled to report preliminary results next Tuesday, with top analysts forecasting pre-tax profits of as much as Pounds 325m, compared with last year's Pounds 271.8m. And dealers are looking for a near 20 per cent increase in the dividend total to around 7p. The main source of the heavy buying interest of recent weeks became evident yesterday when it was announced that US investors now speak for over 18.5 per cent of Vodafone stock, equal to 186.5m shares, up some 2 per cent on the last declared US holding. The 24-hour strike at British Airways (BA) by cabin crew and ground staff and a new threat of a pilots' strike weakened sentiment in the UK flag carrier. The shares shed 1 1/2 to 296p, in light trading of 2m shares. One analyst warned: 'Industrial action or the threat of it will make premium passengers think again about travelling on BA, which will affect the yield.' However most of the day's activity in the stock was in the nil-paid shares in which Charterhouse Tilney, the stock broker, crossed a block of 8.5m at 45p. This raised the day's total volume in the nil-paid to 19m, ahead of next Friday's renunciation date for the Pounds 441m rights issue. Takeover speculation in Evered Bardon built up strongly as the session wore on with turnover expanding rapidly to reach 7.8m, with several blocks of around 1m shares traded around the 57p-58p mark. Dealers said there was no evidence that the day's biggest trades represented corporate stake-building, but one said: 'It now seems obvious that the company is up for sale.' The shares closed 3 higher at 58p, equalling the year's high-point and valuing the group at just short of Pounds 200m. Among property stocks, British Land ended an active week by continuing to be in demand. The shares added 6 to 324p. The same sentiment boosted Conrad Ritblat which firmed 4 to 46p. The rights issue from Burford was well received by the market and the shares firmed 1 1/2 to 75 1/2 p. Talk of a bid by Airtours for Hogg Robinson continued to circulate though analysts dismissed suggestions that Airtours would bid for the whole group. They instead suggested Airtours might go for Hogg Robinson's chain of more than 200 travel agencies and - following its failure to win the battle for Owners Abroad earlier this year - such a move was likely to be agreed. Hogg Robinson put on 14 to 204p, while Airtours firmed 5 to 306p. Owners Abroad eased 2 to 94p. The recent strength in the property sector helped leisure and property group Ladbroke firm 3 to 186p in trade of 4.7m. Strong two-way business in Guinness led to above-average volume of 4.7m. The shares eased a penny to 468p. Shares in Dunhill Holdings, the luxury goods company, dived 44 to 335p, after it issued a profits warning. The company, which revealed a decline in profits for the year to March 1993 to Pounds 70.7 (Pounds 76m), said it would be unable to sustain the current level of profits unless there were a big improvement in its major markets. Rothmans, which owns a 57 per cent stake in Dunhill, gave up 9 to 610p. Hopes of an improved offer for Securiguard from its predator Rentokil continued to boost the former and it added 4 to 302p, while the latter followed the market lower to end 8 lighter at 181p. Solid investment demand for FR Group sent the shares ahead 9 to 270p in trade of 3.4m. A clutch of profit downgrading from several brokers weakened Glynwed International and the shares lost 5 to 294p. Favourable results earlier in the week continued to power VSEL Consortium and the shares gained another 8 to 803p. An uninspiring presentation in the city earlier this week continued to dog TI Group and the shares fell 6 to 325p. NatWest Securities was said to have been negative on GKN where the shares lost 6 to 468p. In foods, Northern Foods continued in the doldrums following a negative note from NatWest Markets earlier in the week and the shares lost another 7 to 245p.</p>

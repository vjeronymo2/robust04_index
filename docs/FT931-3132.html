			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Taxing times for Puerto Rico economy: Clinton may soon end company tax incentives PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's proposal to eliminate a vital package of tax incentives for US companies investing in Puerto Rico as part of efforts to cut the US federal deficit has led to deep concern on the island and prompted renewed soul-searching over its political future. Mr Clinton has proposed the elimination of Section 936 of the federal internal revenue code which allows US companies with manufacturing subsidiaries in the US Caribbean possession to return their profits tax-free to the mainland or to deposit profits in local banks without paying any federal taxes on the earnings. These deposits of about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10.5bn) have become a pillar of the island's financial stability and the tax incentives have been seen by many as the main fuel for the rapid expansion of Puerto Rico's economy. The island's rapid industrialisation over the past four decades has clearly been helped by the incentives which, with lower wages, have encouraged dozens of mainland companies to switch production to the island. Section 936 has been frequently attacked in Washington and it is not surprising that it has become a target in the deficit-cutting exercise. US Treasury officials have repeatedly claimed that the tax breaks cost the federal budget between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn a year. The president is suggesting that over a five-year period Section 936 be replaced by a 65 per cent tax credit on wages to companies which operate subsidiaries in Puerto Rico. The proposal for ending the incentives follows recent charges by legislators in Washington that pharmaceutical companies have been using the tax breaks to make excessive profits through overcharging for their products. Puerto Rico has become one of the world's leading producers of pharmaceuticals, accounting for about half the US market. The island's pharmaceutical sector has not been helped by the debate in the US over the high cost of healthcare. Mr Clinton's proposals have fuelled party political debate in Puerto Rico over the island's future. The 3.5m people of the island are US citizens, but cannot vote for a president. The island's representation in Washington is limited to a commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation. Puerto Ricans are to vote later this year to determine whether the island will retain its current freely-associated 'commonwealth' status or become a state of the union. As a fully fledged American state Puerto Rico would no longer be able to benefit from Section 936 and Mr Clinton's proposals may strengthen the arguments of those who support a change to full statehood, led by the incumbent New Progressive party of Governor Pedro Rossello. Mr Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, also says he favours the phase-out of the special incentives and their replacement with wage credits. The opposition Popular Democratic party however favours a continuation of the political status quo and Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza, the party's leader, argues that elimination of Section 936 would lead to widespread unemployment on the island. While they await the introduction of Mr Clinton's proposals Puerto Ricans are looking to Caribbean neighbours for help. Previous administrations on the island have committed up to Dollars 100m a year of Section 936 deposits in the form of low-interest loans to business projects in other Caribbean countries. Since 1985 Puerto Rico's neighbours have received a total of Dollars 650m of such loans. Mr Baltasar Corrada del Rio, Puerto Rico' secretary of state, said he expected strong Caribbean support for the defence of the programme which he said had helped to provide 30,000 jobs in Caribbean countries.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Finnish trading regime wins praise from Gatt FINLAND runs a generally liberal trading regime, but its heavy reliance on preferential trading arrangements and high protection for domestic agriculture come in for criticism in a report from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Members of Gatt's governing council discussed the report yesterday. They praised Finland for avoiding trade-curbing measures to cope with economic difficulties resulting from world recession and collapse of the former Soviet Union, until recently Finland's biggest export market. The report says over 60 per cent of Finland's trade is now with EC countries and the European Free Trade Association (Efta). While 90 per cent of imports enter duty free, only 30 per cent come in duty free on a 'most favoured nation' (MFN) basis under Gatt's non-discrimination principle. Developing countries said yesterday this hampered their exports to Finland because they face high tariffs on products such as food, textiles and footwear while Finland's (mostly European) preferential trading partners do not. Concern was expressed that the share of preferential trade will increase, with Finland's planned membership of the EC and the European Economic Area. Trade arrangements have been set up with the Russian Federation and the Baltic states. The council stressed the need for these moves to help develop the multilateral trading system; it saw benefits for Finland's economy in closer European integration.</p>

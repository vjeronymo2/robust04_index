			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Grouped art sale forces buyer to double price A MYSTERY purchaser had to pay Pounds 1.5m for a group of seven 17th-century Italian canvases at Sotheby's yesterday - after first bidding a total of Pounds 690,000 for the individual lots. It is not unusual for an important group to be offered in separate lots and then to be offered as a single lot. But it is unheard of for that lot to make more than double the cumulative price of the individual lots. The grandiose canvases illustrating events of Medici history were commissioned by the French queen Marie de' Medici to decorate the Luxembourg Palace. The paintings were executed by different artists in Florence in 1623-27. Bidding began slowly in the initial sale. Then the more decorative Medici marriage portraits confounded expectations by raising bids of Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 140,000 respectively. All seven pictures were knocked down to the same bidder for a total of Pounds 690,000. Bidding for the whole group started at Pounds 690,000. Two new bidders intervened and the original mystery purchaser was this time obliged to pay Pounds 1.5m, or Pounds 1,651,500 with premium, for his pictures. The morning sale totalled Pounds 3,555,387 with 16 per cent bought in.</p>

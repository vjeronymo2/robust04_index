			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Money Markets: London rates ease INTEREST RATES declined on the London money market and prices of short sterling futures rose on Liffe after the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate by  1/2 point to 5 1/2 per cent. The mood was already optimistic about a cut in UK bank base rates and the Fed's move encouraged a further easing of wholesale rates. Three-month sterling interbank fell to 11 3/4 -11 5/8 from 11 13/16 -11 per cent, while 12-month money declined to 11 5/16 -11 1/4 from 11 11/32 -11 5/16 per cent. On Liffe short sterling for June delivery opened little changed at 88.76 and touched a peak of 88.84 before closing at 88.83 compared with 88.75 previously. Last night's settlement price discounts a three-month offered rate of about 11 3/16 at delivery compared with the present cash rate of 11 3/4 per cent. The Bank of England supplied more than enough help to take out the full underlying credit shortage on the money market, but kept the short end tight by leaving most of the assistance until the end of the day. A day-to-day shortage of Pounds 750m was initially forecast, but this was revised to Pounds 700m at noon and back to Pounds 750m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 797m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 45m bills outright, by way of Pounds 2m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 43m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 642m bills were purchased, via Pounds 151m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 491m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 110m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,276m. This outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 445m to liquidity, a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 50m and bank balances above target of Pounds 30m. In Frankfurt call money remained around 8.95 per cent as banks scrambled for funds to increase their reserve holdings on the last day of the month. This followed the Bundesbank's move to drain a net DM4.9bn at this week's securities repurchase agreement tender. The central bank accepted bids totalling DM40.4bn at a two-tranche tender, against expiring pacts of DM45.3bn. It provided DM29.5bn of 34-day funds at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent and DM10.9bn of 62-day money at variable rates, mostly around 8.90 per cent.</p>

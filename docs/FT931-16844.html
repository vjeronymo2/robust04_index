			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: From barricades to new frontiers as Shell ponders the extremes - Predicting the future / Jim Gordon explains the purpose of the oil group's long-term planning methods to Tony Jackson WHEN it comes to long-range thinking on big issues such as the future of Europe, you can be sure of Shell. Like other big oil companies, Shell plans its investments on a massive scale stretching over the next 10 or 15 years. But for the real long term, it relies on its own system of hypothetical world models, or scenarios. These are in no sense predictions, says Mr Jim Gordon, Shell's European co-ordinator. They are simply possible worlds, against which the company's investment plans can be tested. It is currently working on two of these world models. At one extreme is the scenario it calls 'barricades'. The other is 'new frontiers'. Barricades envisages a world dominated by competing trade blocs, one of them presumably being Fortress Europe. There is free trade within the blocs, protectionism between them. New frontiers is an opposite world of trade without barriers, dominated by the Gatt philosophy. Growth is faster, competition is keener and developing countries grow more quickly than developed ones. Either scenario, Mr Gordon says, would fundamentally affect the competitive situation in Europe. Neither offers a particularly comfortable environment for business to work in. 'Under the barricades scenario, one would assume that the prospect for significant growth in the world economy is less. The trading blocs are still large, and within that there will be quite fierce competition: you'll still be fighting for your own home patch. 'In the case of new frontiers, there is growth, and through growth there is investment opportunity, which helps you to survive. But the breakdown of trade barriers gives rise to very real competitive forces on existing players.' The main thing to grasp about these scenarios, Mr Gordon says, is that neither will actually happen. 'The big seduction of scenarios is that you use them to predict things with. But they're not prediction models.' So what are they for? 'To open up the mind of managers, such as myself, to the possibility of real and significant change from the situation you're in at the moment. 'When you're looking at your major strategic decisions, whether on projects or the development of your people, they require long lead times. You test the robustness of your basic assumptions against those rather different conditions. So you avoid nice, linear extrapolations from the status quo.' Let us take an example. At one extreme, the EC market might eventually end up as unified as the US. At the other, it could look more like the Balkans. What does the model say? 'You can describe it as looking like either. The thing about a scenario is that it's supposed to be internally consistent. You're trying to describe plausible worlds which could exist. Is there a fundamental incompatibility between the general environment of the scenario and that assumption about the political structure?' Plainly, Mr Gordon has no intention of giving away what Shell really thinks. There is a sound business reason for this. The Shell method, the company believes, gives it a commercial edge. If it published its expectations and everyone else followed suit, the exercise would be self-defeating. But he is prepared to offer a few thoughts on how Europe might develop in the nearer term. 'It's your customer that determines the competitive climate more than anything else. The single market brings with it a considerable enhancement of consumer choice. It also increases the efficiency of the industrial and economic process within Europe, which again is of direct benefit to the customer. 'The single market means less bureaucracy, but very few of us in industry would see that being of direct benefit to ourselves. In the main, the cost savings will be passed on to the customer and add to the efficiency of the economic process, which I think is a good thing. 'It also enhances the competitive climate in which European industries will have to operate. National barriers will break down, both formally and informally, in the sense that consumers become much more receptive to brands and influences outside their traditional boundaries. So competition will increase, which will make life tougher for European industry. That's not necessarily a bad thing either.' Part of the competition, of course, consists of uneconomic capacity from eastern Europe. How long will this remain a problem? 'That varies a lot from industry to industry, but it'll probably take longer rather than shorter. As we've seen from the rationalisation of some industries in western Europe, it takes a long, long time for the cash cow represented by these plants to dry up. And these east European industries do two things besides: they provide employment, which governments are quite correctly anxious to protect, and they are a source of foreign exchange.' There are two other worries. First, how fast the single market will settle down in reality. 'In legal formality, it's in place now. But the processes and checks to ensure compliance with the legislation have still got to be tested.' There is also a large question in Mr Gordon's mind about the kind of profit margins available in the newly competitive single market, and whether companies - Shell, British Steel or BASF, for instance - have low enough overheads to make those margins possible in any case. But these are mere short-term matters. As to the long term, he says, one must consider the Arab proverb often quoted by one of Shell's chief planners in the 1970s: he who foretells the future lies, even when he is correct.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ze'ev Schiff] </F>   [Text] Three Americans, including Admiral William Crowe, a  former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who now serves as  unofficial adviser to President Clinton, and McGeorge Bundy,  former national security adviser to two presidents, are calling  for recognition of Israel, India, and Pakistan as nuclear states  if they agree to announce that they possess nuclear weapons.  According to the proposal's proponents, such an announcement  would enable the three states to be more moderate, less  threatening and more careful in the future.    This proposal appears in a book published by the Foreign  Relations Council and authored by Admiral Crowe, Bundy, and a  physicist, Cindy Drill. The book, which deals with lowering  nuclear threats, contains a chapter on Israel, India, and  Pakistan. This is the first time that such a proposal has been  made in print by people with their background in security.  Although they do not hold official position in the Clinton  Administration, the three, and especially Crowe, are close to  the government's highest levels.    The authors state that such recognition would require  amendment of the international agreement on nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons so the three states can become parties to it.  Israel, Pakistan, and India are not signatories to the  nonproliferation treaty, which identifies as nuclear states only  those countries that conducted atomic testing before 1967. The  treaty is scheduled to be updated, apparently by amendment, in  1995.    In addressing this issue, the authors state that Israel,  India, and Pakistan are, in effect, "undeclared nuclear states,"  and contend that Israel definitely possesses sizable holdings of  nuclear warheads. By their estimate, India possesses the  know-how and materials required for rapid production of nuclear  warheads whenever it wants. Pakistan's situation resembles  India's, although at a lower level. The authors believe that  when neighboring states contend that these three are nuclear  nations, the charge is true.    Israel is said to engage in a deceptive and hypocritical  nuclear policy. According to the authors, Israel argues that  secrecy causes its neighbors less worry, but it also does not  want to worry its friends, particularly the United States, by  stating that it has nuclear weapons. This position has  increasingly led to difficulties, so that many reject it as  absurd and even aggressive.    The authors believe that the three nations are hurt  politically by their claim that they do not possess nuclear  weapons and that each of them is paying a heavy political price  for it. Israel, as a result, finds it difficult to explain that  its neighbors have nothing to fear from its nuclear weapons  unless they seek to destroy her. The authors state that in the  current situation, in which people shut their eyes to Israel's  nuclear arsenal, talks on limiting nuclear weapons in the Middle  East are meaningless.    In the authors' view, Israel, India, and Pakistan desired  nuclear weapons for compelling defensive reasons, whether to  deter enemies or to repel major invasions of their lands. One  can debate the gravity of this threat, but their neighbors must  consider that each of the three, and each one on the way, sees  nuclear arms as defensive weapons. The fact that the three  nations guard their nuclear weapons in secrecy indicates a  degree of moderation. It is certainly true that the nuclear arms  in their possession do not represent a threat of aggression. If  they now reveal openness, it will be possible to deal with them  in a realistic way rather than as though they do not exist. Like  the five big nuclear states, India, Israel and Pakistan will be  able to display a large measure of moderation.    As for Israel, the authors say that if the United States  were  to announce that it regards Israel as nuclear state, that would  place the situation in a realistic light and undoubtedly make it  easier for Israel to tell the truth. The problem is that  governments do not like it when other nations give away their  secrets, and certainly not nuclear ones. Thus, the best way out  of the thicket, in their opinion, would be an independent  Israeli decision to declare that it has nuclear weapons.    Official Israeli sources queried about the proposal said  that  although it has some interesting and positive features, it  clearly is also fraught with possibilities for enormous  political complications.</p>

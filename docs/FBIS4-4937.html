			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cabinet yesterday approved the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs' proposal to open a Thai consulate in Auckland,  which is the largest city and a major gateway of New Zealand.  New Zealand has a policy called Asia 2000 to expand its  relationship with Asian countries. Thailand thus deems it  appropriate to open an honorary consulate to deal with the  increased trade and tourism. The Cabinet also approved the  appointment of Sir Michael Wales as the honorary consul for  Thailand in Auckland.    Meanwhile, the Cabinet approved the opening of the honorary  consulate in the Republic of Latvia and the appointment of Mr.  Prasong Chongrattanakun the honorary consul of the Republic of  Latvia to Thailand.</p>

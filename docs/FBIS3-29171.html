			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Machinery orders placed by  the Japanese private sector rose 5.3 percent in December from  the previous month, showing signs of bottoming out, the Economic  Planning Agency said Tuesday [15 February].    The figure, excluding volatile orders for ships and from  electric power firms, amounted to 895.9 billion yen, down 6.3  percent from a year earlier.    Private sector machinery orders for the October-December  period amounted to 2,438.5 billion yen, down 10.3 percent from  the preceding three-month period and also down 8.7 percent from  the same period of the previous year.    An agency official said the October-December performance was  almost in line with a projection by the agency of a fall of 10.5  percent from the previous quarter.    Orders for the period were the same as those for the  April-June period and the scale of the fall was much smaller  than in the past, the official said.    "We can regard it as an indication the downtrend in private  machinery orders is coming to an end," he added.    The figure is a leading indicator for corporate investment  in  facility and equipment in near future, which has been depressed  amid the prolonged recession.    The agency predicted that the figure for the January-March  period will show a rise of 8.1 percent from the preceding  three-month period to 2,636.3 billion yen.    The official said the 8.1 percent rise predicted for the  first quarter of 1994 is not really a strong recovery as the  value of orders is at about the same level as the last quarter  of 1992.    In December, private sector machinery orders, including  those  for ships and from electric power firms, came to 1,154.4 billion  yen, up 9.6 percent from November and up 7.5 percent from a year  earlier.    Of those, orders from manufacturers amounted to 375.5  billion  yen, up 4.1 percent from the previous month but down 10.6  percent from a year earlier.    Orders from nonmanufacturers totaled 476.2 billion yen, down  3.8 percent on the previous month and down 1.5 percent from a  year before.    On the other hand, public sector orders came to 312.7  billion  yen, up 14.5 percent from November and also up 20.0 percent from  the previous year.    Overseas orders amounted to 412.1 billion yen, up 0.4  percent  from the previous month and down 9.2 percent from a year earlier.    Overall orders in December thus totaled 2,067.2 billion yen,  up 11.2 percent from November and up 4.3 percent from a year  earlier.</p>

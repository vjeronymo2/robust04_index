			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A $16-million defamation suit filed against commentator-humorist Andy Rooney by  a company that didn't like his consumer report on its product has been thrown  out by a judge in Phoenix. Unelko Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., the maker of  Rain-X, a liquid that is supposed to make rain and snow roll off windshields,  had sued Rooney over remarks he made about the product during a 1988 "60  Minutes" broadcast. U.S. District Judge Robert C. Broomfield ruled that  Rooney's comments about Rain-X were the commentator's opinion and thus legally  protected. The judge agreed with a statement Rooney made on television after  the suit was filed. "This fellow sent me his product to evaluate, and I did,"  Rooney said. "Was I only expected to comment on it if I loved it?"ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

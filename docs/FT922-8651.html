			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Unions urge OECD to act on unemployed TRADE UNIONS in the world's leading industrialised countries have called on governments to implement 'active structural policies' with a strong focus on infrastructure investment to combat a sharp rise in unemployment. Responding to a 5m increase in the jobless in the industrialised world over the past two years, the trade union advisory committee of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said governments should agree a range of policies to reduce unemployment at the next week's OECD ministerial meeting in Paris and July's Group of Seven summit in Munich. It said the OECD should specify a programme of 'vigorous government action' to deal with the problem. This should include more investment in infrastructure, investment,assistance for local and regional development spending, and policies to raise the purchasing power of the poor. In recent years, the OECD ministerial meeting has tended to listen to and then ignore the committee's views. Ministers are unlikely to accept the need for more state spending to combat joblessness. Instead, they are expected to promote 'active' labour market policies that shift the emphasis to incentives for the unemployed to seek jobs.</p>

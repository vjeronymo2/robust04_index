			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Further lead case on swaps is settled ANOTHER lead case in the long-running litigation over interest-rate swap agreements has been settled out of court, Raymond Hughes writes. Samuel Montagu, the investment arm of Midland Bank, yesterday settled with Welwyn Hatfield District Council in Hertfordshire, from which it was claiming Pounds 1.26m under two swap deals. Welwyn has also settled its third-party claims for Pounds 181,538 and Pounds 1.06m from the London boroughs of Hackney and Islington respectively. The terms were not disclosed. It is the third of the six lead cases to be resolved without a trial. Last month Samuel Montagu settled with Birmingham City Council, while Barclays Bank and its investment banking subsidiary Barclays de Zoete Wedd reached agreement with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham - both on undisclosed terms. A lead action in which Citicorp Investment Bank is claiming Pounds 521,323 from Sandwell Borough Council, West Midlands, is due for trial on Monday. In third-party proceedings Sandwell is claiming Pounds 269,246 from the London Borough of Hackney, while Hackney has a claim for interest against the London Borough of Brent. The remaining lead cases of Chemical Bank and National Bank of North Carolina v Hammersmith and Fulham are scheduled for after Easter. The lead cases were selected because they covered the majority of legal points that arose after the Lords' ruling last year that interest-rate swap agreements between banks and local authorities were invalid.</p>

Meetings supporting the New Year address took place in  Moscow, Russia, and Peru and Denmark.    Yuri Vashin, a section chief of the Institute of Oriental  Studies of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, in his speech at a  meeting of representatives of Russian public circles said the  New Year address of respected Comrade Kim Il-song, president of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gives scientific and  philosophical conclusions to all questions and clarifies the  principled stand of Korea.    Noting that the "10-point programme of the great unity of  the  whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward  by respected Comrade Kim Il-song clarifies the idea of achieving  Korea's reunification, the greatest national desire of the  Korean people, in a peaceful way on the basis of the confederacy  formula, he said there is no other alternative but this.    Vasim Rozanov, chief secretary of the Graduates Federation  of  Moscow State University of International Affairs said he fully  supports the policy of peaceful reunification of the country and  all principles of external policy set forth by Comrade Kim  Il-song in his New Year address.    Victor Platov, vice-chairman of the Central Council of the  Russian Association of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation with  the DPRK, charged that the United States has not yet withdrawn  its nuclear weapons from South Korea. The association will  thoroughly expose the aggressive design of the United States and  fully support the socialist construction line of the Korean  Government, he said.    Jorge Raso Arrasco, chairman of the Peruvian National  Association for the Study of the Chuche Idea, speaking at a  meeting held in Peru, held that the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks on the  principle of impartiality.    Anders Kristensen, chairman of the Denmark-DPRK Friendship  Association, in his speech at a joint meeting held in Denmark,  stressed the need to more actively conduct movements for  solidarity with the Korean people.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: Open season on closing the expectations gap - New studies which call for a radical shake-up within the auditing profession IT MAY not look very threatening from the outside, with its plain cover and its bland binding, but the latest work published by the research board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales this week should be handled with care. Hidden inside the plain red cover, the text of 'The audit expectations gap in the UK'* by three academics is a ticking timebomb of revolutionary reform for the audit profession. An independent regulatory body should oversee the appointment, fee levels and practices of auditors of large companies, the authors say. Auditors' responsibilities should be expanded beyond existing shareholders. And, in case that is not enough, their role should be expanded to include the detection of material fraud. Such conclusions might have barely have generated a dismissive wave from the more cynical members of the profession if they had been new outpourings from the troublesome trio of 'radical accountants', Messers Prem Sikka, Tony Puxty and Hugh Willmott. But the latest salvo comes instead from three other dons, adding new weight to calls for fundamental change, and funded by the institute's own auditing research foundation. They are Stuart Turley and Christopher Humphrey of the University of Manchester, and Peter Moizer from the University of Leeds. It is to the credit of the institute that it was willing to fund and publish a report which can hardly be said to echo its own views. But the findings are hardly going down well for many in Moorgate Place, its London headquarters. That is clear enough even from the press release which accompanies the book. Mr Henry Gold, technical director of the institute, is quoted as saying that the case for an independent regulator is not developed sufficiently in the report to be analysed. He also doubts whether the responsibility for detecting fraud could be effective. The three authors begin by defining the so-called 'expectations gap' - a phrase first used by the Cohen Commission in the US in 1974 - in a careful, neutral way: the gap between the service expected by non-auditors and that provided by auditors. Soon, they are citing an all-too-familiar complaint from one firm. 'We have been allowed to audit not from month to month but only once a year; having had too little time to make an exhaustive report; knowing that shareholders are generally impatient to get through the business; being paid a fee out of all proportion to the work done; and being aware that the voting power is in the absolute control of the board . . . (shareholders imagine) that auditors' certificates are proofs of all excellences and complete solvency and security.' That might well relate to any of the litany of corporate collapses of the last decade. In fact it was taken from an article written in 1883, referring to the financial scandal surrounding the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878. The authors' point is that the idea of a perception gap - or many different gaps - between auditors and others has both a long history and parallels in many parts of the world. Yet the auditors' response over this time has been both highly defensive and relatively static, the authors argue. Some firms have offered additional services such as specific fraud audits in compensation. But these have generally been services for management rather than for users of financial statements, and have served chiefly to deflect attention away from the potentially limited nature of current audit practice. However, the most typical response has been to blame the ignorance of the public, and to try to educate them in the 'true' purpose of the audit. A recent example is the Auditing Practices Board's proposals for an expanded audit statement - echoed in the Cadbury report - which clarifies the existing legal responsibilities of directors and auditors. Meanwhile, shareholder involvement in running companies has continued to decline over time, leaving directors with the effective power to hire and fire the auditors, raising considerable questions over auditors' independence. At the same time, the concentration of the audit market into the hands of a small number of firms has intensified, and the firms themselves are being transformed from professional partnerships into fiercely-competitive, high turnover businesses. Neither periodically rotating audit firms nor 'quaranteening' audit from other services offered to the same client would free them from 'the arbitrary patronage of company management', the authors say. Recent changes to regulation have only dealt indirectly with the relationship between auditors and directors, while the process of auditing remains largely hidden from the vast majority of those who rely on the work of the firms. They argue for an office for auditing to oversee appointments and fees for large companies with a clear public investigatory mandate. They say that auditors' duty of care should be extended to cover both existing and potential shareholders and creditors, rather than simply existing shareholders, as the Caparo judgment in the House of Lords ruled. Finally, the authors say that the real issue in the expectations gap is that the public expects auditors to detect all serious fraud. That same expectation has been as recurrent over the years as auditors' attempts to downplay it. It is welcome to see an academic paper drawing frequently on popular articles - including those in the Financial Times and Accountancy Age - alongside more dusty journals and books as part of its thesis. One sad omission is of any critique or even reference to the work of their rival radicals, led by Prem Sikka of the former East London Polytechnic. The latest of their many works on the expectations gap was published by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants this June**. Wrapped in rather more sociological jargon, these authors make many similar points, and argue that the expectation that auditors should detect material fraud has been recognised and debated quite publicly many times in the past and rejected. They suggest that auditors should actively attempt to detect fraud, and that their responsibilities should be explicitly laid down in law. There is also a more fundamental problem in the report by Humphrey, Moizer and Turley, however. There is a strong leap of logic from the empirical analysis of perceptions of the role of auditors - which represents the bulk of their first-hand research - to the recommendations with which they conclude. The fact that groups of individuals - including financial journalists and bankers - perceive that auditors are not doing enough and that their role should change, does not necessarily justify such changes. Neither of these groups pays for the work of auditors. If such a change is going to take place, the authors - or indeed the accounting profession - need to take far more seriously the question of both how much it will cost and who will foot the bill. *The audit expectations gap.

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Search for bilateral deals in Nafta talks TRADE ministers from the US, Canada and Mexico are seeking a series of bilateral deals on the most sensitive regional trade issues in an attempt to prevent a breakdown in the talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. The bilateral talks will include farm trade and textiles and may be extended to the motor trade. A Canadian official indicated yesterday that, while progress had been made on some fronts in recent weeks, several key issues were likely to be resolved only through bilateral agreements among the three countries, or by one participant exempting itself from sections of the trilateral pact. Negotiators are drawing up three separate agreements on agriculture. In addition, Canada is resisting pressure from the US and Mexico for tighter rules of origin on clothing and textile imports, and may end up sticking with the rules in the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA). The three countries' chief negotiators meet in Washington next week to identify the issues which require political decisions. The forthcoming ministerial meeting is expected to take place in Mexico. Sensitive issues which remain unresolved include rules of origin for computers and the threshold for duty-free status for automotive imports, currently at 50 per cent between the US and Canada. US and Canadian concerns about curbs on foreign investment in Mexico's energy industry are being at least partly addressed by Mexican moves to narrow the definition of petrochemical sectors covered by the prohibition on investment. The Nafta pact is expected to break new ground in the area of competition policy. Although it will not contain any rules, the agreement will commit participants to some form of co-operation in promoting competitive markets.</p>

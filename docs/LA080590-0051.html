			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BLACK DRAGON' -- SECRETIVE ASIAN GANG TRACES TO ALIENATED VIET REFUGEES OF  '70S;  </P> <P> CRIME: SOME WERE PUNKS. SOME WERE TORN BETWEEN CULTURES. POLICE SAY THEIR  ACTIVITIES HAVE MOVED BEYOND PETTY THEFT TO EXTORTION, BURGLARIES AND  ROBBERIES.  </P> <P> Back in the early 1980s, when Southeast Asian gangs were still in their  infancy, Los Angeles Police Department Detective William Park remembers  street-wise Vietnamese boys taunting, "New Wave never ends."  </P> <P> It was partly a reference to their rebellious look: long spiked hair, baggy  black pants and white shirts buttoned to the collar.  </P> <P> But it was also a macho slogan, Park believed, meant to say that the tough  refugee youths and their secretive, loosely knit alliances would not be easily  quashed.  </P> <P> "It was like they were saying . . . you couldn't take them down," recalled  Park, an investigator in the Police Department's Asian Crimes Section. "You put  them away, but there's always going to be younger blood taking their place. It  never ends."  </P> <P> Nearly a decade later, it hasn't. Police say those same teen-agers grew up to  be the core of a gang known today as "Black Dragon," a group of mostly ethnic  Chinese refugees from Vietnam who are thought to be responsible for dozens of  armed robberies in Asian communities throughout the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> On July 24, after months of surveillance, police arrested 18 suspected members  of the gang, whose total membership may range from 40 to 100, according to  various law enforcement estimates.  </P> <P> Because many of their alleged victims have been reluctant to come forward,  however, 13 of the suspects had to be released for lack of evidence, officers  said. Of the five who remain in custody -- each in lieu of $300,000 bail --  four were charged with robbery and kidnaping in connection with a heist at a  San Gabriel beauty parlor. The fifth was charged in connection with a similar  holdup at a salon near Chinatown.  </P> <P> In a press conference after the arrests, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman  Block asked for the Asian community's help in identifying the suspects and  tying them to more crimes. He said gangs such as Black Dragon prey on  immigrants' fears of retaliation, their unfamiliarity with the U.S. legal  system and a tendency to write off such assaults as merely bad luck.  </P> <P> "The Asian victim is least likely to come forward and report their  victimization," said Block, whose department teamed up with six other police  agencies to make the arrests. "That's the kind of thing we're trying to break  through."  </P> <P> But leaders in the San Gabriel Valley's Asian communities said last week that  cooperation with police will come only after a long educational process,  including frequent patrols, neighborhood meetings and the hiring of more  officers who speak some of their 42 dialects.  </P> <P> "I always encourage people to cooperate with police, but many are afraid of  revenge," said David Ma, who runs an immigration law and consulting firm in  Monterey Park. "They're skeptical that the police can protect them. They think,  if the police can protect them, then why are there so many of these robberies  happening?"  </P> <P> According to police and probation officers, the early members of Black Dragon  came to this country in the late 1970s as junior high school students -- poor  teen-agers who spent their free time stealing car stereos in the neighborhoods  north of Chinatown.  </P> <P> Like other Southeast Asian gangs, their alliances were fluid. Three or four of  them might meet one day at a pool hall or over a hot bowl of the traditional  Vietnamese soup, Pho, and agree to join forces in a burglary or auto theft,  police said.  </P> <P> Some displayed cigarette burns on their wrists -- supposed symbols of their  immunity to pain -- while others wore tattoos bearing the images of tigers,  eagles and dragons. "They were just street-level punks," Park said.  </P> <P> Some of them were also probably lost, confused young men torn between two  cultures, say mental-health experts and school officials who have worked with  Southeast Asian refugees.  </P> <P> Such gang members, they said, arrive here in their early teens, their  educations disrupted, their families fragmented, and their aspirations replaced  by feelings of rootlessness and alienation.  </P> <P> At home, the youths speak Cantonese or Vietnamese with their parents, many of  whom are former farmers or fishermen with often conservative and restrictive  ideas of how their children should behave. Out on the streets, they encounter  an English-speaking world that glorifies power and material wealth.  </P> <P> "They want very much to be like American kids," said May To, program  coordinator at the Asian Youth Center in Monterey Park. "But that usually means  money to go to a dance or out for a drink -- money that their parents don't  have, or if they do, they won't allow them to use in those ways."  </P> <P> Unprepared for those conflicts, some of the most disaffected take their chances  with crime, psychologists and social workers say. As the members of Black  Dragon reached their 20s, however, they gradually developed into what police  now consider one of the largest and most active Asian gangs in the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> Petty theft gave way to extortion, commercial burglary and home-invasion  robberies, officers say. Victims were routinely bound with duct tape,  electrical cords and clothes hangers. The uncooperative were beaten,  pistol-whipped and tortured.  </P> <P> "They became very organized and very dangerous," said Christopher Kuk, a  probation officer in the county's Asian Gang Unit. "If they see you as a threat  to their well-being, they will not hesitate to remove you from the face of this  earth."  </P> <P> Their name is not well-known in the immigrant communities of Alhambra, San  Gabriel or Monterey Park, largely because they operate furtively and do not  promote the indentity of the gang, police say. Often, they will skip town to  commit crimes in other cities with sizable Vietnamese populations, such as  Boston, Houston, San Jose and Seattle.  </P> <P> A couple of years ago, recalled Steve Kornfeld, dean of students at San Gabriel  High School, a young Vietnamese student approached him and pointed to  Kornfeld's aging Seiko wristwatch.  </P> <P> "Your watch is no good," the boy said, flashing a fancy gold timepiece that  Kornfeld figured cost more than $1,500. When Kornfeld asked the youth where he  got his watch, he remembers him saying, "You get on a plane, go away two days  and come back and you have a nice watch. It's easy."  </P> <P> Before the arrests last month, sheriff's deputies, assisted by officers from  Los Angeles, Pasadena, Monterey Park, El Monte, Arcadia and Baldwin Park, had  been staking out the Black Dragon "crash pad" on a dead-end street in Rosemead.  </P> <P> From there, police say they followed Thuan Kso Ngo, 29, Anthony Lenh, 19, Ty  Pham, 22, and Vang Tran, 23, to the Beauty of Paris Salon in San Gabriel. Five  hairstylists were in the shop, along with four customers, when the men  allegedly barged in, two of them waving pistols.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old the owner of the salon remembers being ordered to lie face-down  on the floor, as the men stripped the women of their jewelry and snatched more  than $1,000 from the register.  </P> <P> "We were scared," the owner said. "I kept thinking about God, that God would  help us."  </P> <P> Officers waiting outside arrested the four men as soon as they exited. At the  dumpy, one-story bungalow in Rosemead where police said members of the gang had  been living for the summer, officers arrested 14 others, including Hong Ly, 21,  suspected in the Chinatown robbery.  </P> <P> Of the 13 who were later released, five were women. Four of those arrested were  juveniles. All were photographed and fingerprinted.  </P> <P> A public defender for one of the suspected gang members did not respond to a  request for comment. It could not be determined whether the others had  attorneys.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at the alleged crash pad last week, a middle-aged man cleaned  up a pile of beer cans from the Alanreed Avenue property.  </P> <P> "This was just a place where young people could come hang out," said the man,  who identified himself as the building's owner. "It was all summer-vacation  fun."  </P></p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / More arrests after Mexico assassination The office of Mexico's attorney-general has arrested three more people for alleged involvement in the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). The arrests bring to five the number detained on suspicion of murder or of conspiracy to murder in the Colosio case. The attorney-general's office is also looking for two more people whom it suspects of involvement in the assassination, which took place at a campaign rally in Tijuana last month. The two have yet to be identified. An official in the investigation said the evidence definitely showed a concerted effort to kill Mr Colosio. The government will not comment on conspiracy theories, and no evidence has emerged to link the alleged killers previously arrested to organised groups. However, it has been variously suggested in the Mexican press that drug traffickers, members of the PRI or radical political groups planned the murder. The new suspects are Mr Vicente Mayoral, his son and a former state policeman, Mr Rodolfo Mayoral, and Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a PRI official who helped to organise security for Mr Colosio when the candidate was in Tijuana, and who employed some of the suspects to control crowds. The police had already arrested Mr Mario Aburto, a 23-year-old mechanic, for the murder of Mr Colosio, and Mr Tranquilino Sanchez, for abetting the assassination. Mr Aburto, who has been identified by witnesses as the man who fired the fatal shots, has confessed to the crime. Mr Sanchez, like Mr Vicente Mayoral, had been employed by Mr Rivapalacio to control crowds at the rally in Tijuana. The new arrests are largely based on video and photographic evidence, which appear to show some of the suspects helping the presumed assassin gain access to Mr Colosio, and others blocking the path of the candidate and his bodyguards. The video-tape also shows some of the suspects talking with the alleged assassin before the murder. Mr Jose Cordoba, President Carlos Salinas's powerful chief of staff, became the latest political casualty of the aftermath of the assassination when he was forced to resign last week. Mr Cordoba, seen as an unofficial vice-president of Mexico, has been appointed the country's representative at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. The enormous power exercised by Mr Cordoba, French-born son of Spanish immigrants who became a Mexican a decade ago, was much resented by many government officials and widely attacked by the press. The attacks on him threatened to hurt the campaign and image of his close friend and ally, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's new presidential candidate. Reports suggested that party officials had demanded Mr Cordoba's resignation as the price for supporting Mr Zedillo. His presence is likely to be missed by Mr Salinas for Mr Cordoba has been crucial in formulating economic policy and political strategy over the past six years, and he was a proponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

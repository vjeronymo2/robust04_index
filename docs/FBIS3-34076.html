			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak and the accompanying delegation returned to Cairo from  Ankara last night following talks with his Turkish counterpart  and other officials. [passage omitted]    The Egyptian president's lightning visit to Turkey was his  third since 1985. Yesterday's meeting between Mubarak and his  Turkish counterpart reveals the nature of relations between  Cairo and Ankara. The meeting was aimed at expanding the scope  of political, economic, cultural, and military cooperation  between the two countries. This cooperation is of special  importance in light of the two countries' status in the region  and of their relations with Israel.    The Zionist entity's President Ezer Weizman paid an official  four-day visit to Turkey one week before Mubarak's visit.  Weizman said that the Middle East's future is dependent on  cooperation between Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. A number of  political observers believe that such meetings are a preparatory  step toward concluding a regional alliance that will give the  Egyptian, Israeli, and Turkish Governments the right opportunity  for confronting every possible danger and for implementing their  own policies. The United States is supporting this step to  strengthen the ties of tripartite coordination and cooperation.  The spread of the Islamic trend and the Islamic forces'  activities topped the items discussed by Turkey, Israel, and  Egypt.    On the other hand, it can be said that strengthening Turkish  and Egyptian relations with the Zionist entity prepares the  proper ground for the normalization of relations between the  other Arab countries and the usurper entity. It also prepares  the ground for lifting the Arab economic boycott of this entity.  This is quite evident to anyone who analyzes the political  trend.    The Islamic trend in the region is the primary target of the  policy of developing relations between Egypt, Israel, and  Turkey. This policy aims to tighten the noose around the  countries that exercise independent policies that are not linked  to the imperialist forces.</p>

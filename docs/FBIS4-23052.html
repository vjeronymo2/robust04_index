			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Volokhina, V. I. Ognev, I. K. Pronichkina, </F> T. S. Sokolova, V. A. Kirillov, V. K. Kovalev, V. S. Morev, and  G. V. Poroshin, VNIIPV, Mytishchi, Asbestos Textiles SRI;  UDC[677.494.675:536.495].044.14]    [Abstract] The domestically produced high-strength and heat  resistant fiber having the trade name ``Terlon,'' as well as the  well known Kevlar (USA) and Tvaron (Netherlands), is a  para-aramide fiber. Terlon is as good as the foreign analogs in  physical properties. At the present time Terlon is being  produced on an experimental basis as a high-strength fiber, both  long and short staple. Terlon is said to be superior to the  Kevlar and Tvaron in having a lower (5-10 percent) density,  higher bonding strength to rubber for tire cord, and better  fibrillation for making pulp. According to data from the Gorky  Labor Hygiene and Occupation Disease SRI, Terlon polymer has no  irritating, sensitizing, or fibrogenic action and therefore its  maximum allowable concentration has been set at 10 mg per cubic  meter (equivalent to inert dust). The present work lists the  many places where Terlon fiber may be substituted to provide  environmentally beneficial effects. For example it may be used  in radial tires, as a reinforcement in conveyer belts (in place  of steel), and in the manufacture of heat and fire resistant  special clothing for welders, metallurgists, and firemen. Short  staple fiber and pulp made of Terlon may also be used in place  of asbestos in brake mechanisms, gaskets, and fillers.  References 3 (Russian).</p>

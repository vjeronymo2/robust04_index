			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G. and Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara announced yesterday the  appointment of National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez as new  Supreme Court justice, replacing former Supreme Court President  Carlos Lucas Lopez. Endara made the announcement during an  improvised news conference at his private office at the  Presidency of the Republic.    According to Endara, Fernandez has the requisite experience  to make a positive contribution to the administration of  justice. Fernandez, who is the current National Police director,  replaces Lopez, who resigned due to "strictly personal reasons"  on 3 January. Lopez said at the time he would remain in the  Supreme Court as long as his work as Civil Court magistrate  required it and until his replacement was appointed.    "Fernandez is a great lawyer who has won the Panamanian  people's trust," Endara stated. The president added that he was  confident Fernandez' appointment as Supreme Court justice would  be ratified by the Legislative Assembly in March, given the  official does not belong to any political party. Fernandez is a  lawyer and has already occupied the positions of Superior Court  magistrate in Penonome and as circuit judge.    Regarding Fernandez' replacement as National Police  director,  Endara said he has no person in mind for the position but that  he believed the new police director should be a "civilian." The  president added: "This is a problem I have to resolve as  president. I have to find a person to direct the police, and I  believe the position has to be filled by a civilian. At least  during my government, I want that person to be a civilian who is  apolitical. I have not found the person yet, however." The chief  executive asked the media to propose names for the position of  police director, "because I do not have anyone now."    For his part, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos has said  he agrees with Fernandez' appointment to replace Lopez. Hoyos  added that legal institutions should be headed by people who are  not linked to political organizations. The official made those  statements when he answered reporters' questions on the  situation in several judicial organizations. Although he chose  not to refer directly to the situation at the Attorney General's  Office, Hoyos said: "Precisely, my election to the presidency of  the Supreme Court shows the magistrates desire the Judicial  Branch to be headed by a person who has no ties to any political  party."    "This is our stand on the issue," Hoyos stated when he was  asked about the possibility of finding a solution to the  situation that is negatively affecting the Attorney General's  Office. The Supreme Court president added that, evidently, the  Attorney General's Office and the Judicial Branch have to have  the people's understanding to be able to work expeditiously.    Regarding other topics, President Endara spoke sparingly  when  he commented on the current political situation. He denied,  however, that the 12 January cabinet meeting had been cancelled  due to the electoral negotiations between the Arnulfist Party  and Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement.] Endara  said that the meeting had been canceled because all the issues  in the agenda had been covered, "and as we are all busy, I did  not think it was necessary to call the cabinet to a meeting."</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / EU backs Customs duty-free rule Customs &amp; Excise yesterday received European backing to continue charging travellers value added tax and duty on drink and tobacco brought in from the Continent for other people. Ms Christiane Scrivener, European commissioner for customs and indirect taxation, yesterday scotched suggestions that British consumers might be able to evade excise duties by importing alcohol or tobacco through European mail order or courier companies. Speaking in Brussels, Ms Scrivener said the only case in which it was clear that cross-channel excise duties could be avoided was when travellers bought goods on the Continent in person for their own consumption - in line with the British government's demands. However, she acknowledged that there was still ambiguity in legislation and said the issue was unlikely to be resolved until a test case was brought before the European Court. Ms Scrivener's comments, only days after other commission officials suggested that mail order purchases might provide a legitimate means of evading British excise duties, highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the commission's directive on excise duty, which officially came into force last year. At issue is the definition of 'personal consumption'. EU legislation permits member states to retain their own levels of excise duty, payable at the point of entry, but last year's directive allowed consumers to evade duty on goods purchased in and brought from another country for private consumption. With British excise duties on goods such as wine and spirits significantly higher than continental levels, the British government has insisted that the legislation could apply only to individual travellers. It has set limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco that can be brought into the UK.</p>

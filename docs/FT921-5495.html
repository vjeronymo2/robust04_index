			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Rates swap case goes to Scotland KLEINWORT BENSON LTD v CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL. BARCLAYS BANK PLC v CITY OF GLASGOW DISTRICT COUNCIL Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: February 27 1992 A CLAIM against a person domiciled in Scotland for restitution of monies paid under a contract which is null and void, cannot be heard by English courts in that it is not a 'matter relating to a contract' within the meaning of the 1968 Brussels Convention, and does not come within any of the matters giving rise to a special jurisdiction to hear the case other than in that part of the UK in which the defendant is domiciled. Mr Justice Hirst so held when giving judgment for the defendant, the City of Glasgow District Council, on its applications to dismiss actions brought against it by the plaintiff banks, Kleinwort Benson Limited and Barclays Bank plc, for lack of jurisdiction. HIS LORDSHIP said that Glasgow was sued in two separate actions by Barclays and Kleinwort Benson for Pounds 389,431 and Pounds 807,230 respectively, in relation to sums paid under interest rate swap agreements. Following on the House of Lords decision in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham (1991) 2 WLR 372 that all such transactions were outside the powers of the local authorities and void ab initio (from the beginning), the banks claimed return of the sums on a restitutionary basis. On the present summonses, Glasgow sought declarations that the court had no jurisdiction over it in respect of the claims, and asked that the actions be dismissed. The two actions came within the Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968 (the Brussels Convention), which concerned 'civil and commercial matters'. Article 2 of Schedule 4 to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 provided that persons domiciled in a part of the UK should be sued in the courts of that part. On the face of it, Glasgow must be sued in Scotland. The banks could only sue in England if they could bring themselves within the special jurisdiction laid down in articles 5 and 6 of Schedule 4. Article 5(1) provided that a person domiciled in part of the UK might be sued in another part 'in matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question'. Mr Tecks for Glasgow submitted that as the House of Lords had ruled there was no contract, the restitutionary claims could not be classified as 'matters relating to a contract'. Mr Beazley submitted that the claims did concern matters relating to a contract, since the court was determining the consequences of nullity of the contracts. He relied inter alia on article 10(1) of the 1980 Rome Convention on the Law applicable to Contractual Obligations, which provided that the law applicable to a contract should govern '(e) the consequences of nullity of the contract'. The House of Lords having held that the swap transactions were void ab initio, the suggestion that the restitutionary claims were matters relating to a contract, placed a severe strain on the language of article 5(1). There was nothing in the cases to support such a conclusion (see Peters v ZNAV (1983) ECR 987 and Arcado v Haviland (1988) 3 ECR 1539). They were consistent with a proposition by Mr Tecks for Glasgow that there must be either a contractual relationship giving rise to actual contractual obligations, or a consensual obligation similar to contract giving rise to a comparable obligation, for the case to fall within article 5(1). So far as the Rome Convention was concerned, it was legitimate and appropriate to take its provisions into account in construing article 5(1). However, it could not properly be treated as determinative of the construction of article 5(1). Moreover, the court was entitled in construing Schedule 4, to take into account the fact that the UK had derogated from the Rome Convention by excluding article 10(1)(e) from UK law. The banks failed to bring themselves within article 5(1). Article 5(3) of Schedule 4 provided that a person domiciled in a part of the UK might be sued in another part 'in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred . . .' In Kalfelis v Schroder (1988) ECR 5565, in paragraphs 17 and 18 of its decision, the European Court said that matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict within article 5(3) covered 'all actions which seek to establish the liability of a defendant and which are not related to a contract within the meaning of article 5(1)'. In paragraph 19 it said 'a court which has jurisdiction under article 5(3) over an action based on tort or delict 'does not have jurisdiction over that action in so far as it is not so based'. And in paragraph 20 it said 'a plaintiff is always entitled to bring his action in its entirety before the courts for the domicil of the defendant'. Mr Beazley submitted that paragraphs 17 and 18 were conclusive in his favour. He said article 5(1) and (3) were to be construed as mutually exclusive but as all-embracing so far as actions to establish the defendants' 'liability' were concerned (apart from article 5(1) cases, and provided that the harmful event occurred in the relevant jurisdiction). That interpretation of Kalfelis was not accepted. The judgment must be read as a whole. Paragraphs 19 and 20 were completely inconsistent with Mr Beazley's construction. If he were right article 5(3) would become a 'catch-all' provision and liability not based on tort, delict or quasi-delict would fall within it, notwithstanding the explicit statement to the contrary in paragraph 19. The word 'liability' in paragraphs 17 and 18 must be interpreted as connoting liability within the scope of the article 5(3) categories, that is, in tort, delict or quasi-delict. The banks failed to bring their case within article 5(3). Article 6(1) of Schedule 4 provided that a person domiciled in part of the UK might be sued in another part 'where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled'. In Kalfelis, the European Court said article 6(1) applied where it was 'expedient' to hear the actions together 'to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings'. In the rate swap litigation, there was a very large number of separate actions, in all of which banks were plaintiffs and in nearly all of which English local authorities were defendants. They were not combined in a single trial, but were regulated by court order so that certain cases should be lead actions, and the others stayed. As at present, there would be two separate lead action trials. Selection of the lead cases aimed to ensure that the majority of the points of law in issue in all the cases were authoritatively decided, and it was hoped that clear guidance would be given to the remaining cases, leading to settlements and avoidance of multiplicity of litigation. The lead cases were not strictly test cases. There might well be individual issues arising in some of the other cases that would still need to be litigated. The court was not satisfied that there was a risk of irreconcilable decisions. There was no question of conflicting decisions on the common issues of fact. So far as issues of law were concerned it was almost inevitable that those cases, in view of the very difficult legal problems and the very large sums of money at stake, would proceed in the end to the highest court. Thus, even if there were a prospect of irreconcilable decisions at first instance or on appeal, the House of Lords would be able to give one single decision which would be binding in both England and Scotland, with no possibility of irreconcilability. The banks failed to bring themselves within article 6(1). Article 5(8)(b) of Schedule 4 provided that a person domiciled in part of the UK might be sued in another part, in proceedings to assert rights in moveable property, 'in the courts of the part . . . in which the property is situated'. To come within that paragraph Mr Beazley must have an arguable case that the property the banks sought to trace was situated in England. Glasgow's evidence was that it held its funds with a Scottish bank in Glasgow. The court accepted that evidence. There was no arguable case that the monies sought to be traced were now situated in England. The banks were unable to bring themselves within article 5(8). The banks having failed to bring themselves within any of the special jurisdictions laid down in articles 5 or 6, article 2 prevailed. Glasgow must be sued in its court of domicil, in Scotland. For the banks: Thomas Beazley (Clifford Chance, and Linklaters &amp; Paines). For Glasgow: Jonathan Tecks (William Sturges &amp; Co).</p>

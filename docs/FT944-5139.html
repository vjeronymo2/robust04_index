			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Next rate rise may be closer than expected - London The FT-SE 100 index has now launched no less than 10 successful assaults on the 3,100 mark since falling through that level at the end of March, when the Federal Reserve tightening moves began to bite. On most of these occasions the index looked set to consolidate above 3,100, only to fall back below that level every time. And behind those falls on virtually every occasion was the threat of, or an actual rise in interest rates. After the series of US rate rises, the first UK interest rate increase since the sterling currency crisis in September 1992 was responsible for dumping the FT-SE firmly below 3,100. The market fought back well, penetrating 3,100 in mid-November and cruising to 3,147 the week before the Budget amid a sequence of impressive economic numbers, indicating continued low inflation - the lowest for 27 years - and good growth. Then a blast of Wall Street-inspired weakness knocked the FT-SE back below 3,100. And there were worrying signs last week that there could be more trouble. Wall Street, which has shown it still sets the agenda for stock markets worldwide, is looking decidedly uncomfortable. Almost every US economic indicator pointed to the economy still growing strongly. Third-quarter gross domestic product was revised upwards, the consumer confidence index surged alarmingly and the National Association of Purchasing Management index rose more sharply than expected. Topping this was a non-farm payroll number which easily beat forecasts. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets on December 20 and another rate rise in the US, with all its implications for Wall Street, and therefore UK equities, could be on the cards. Notwithstanding the impact of falling US markets, the UK Budget was followed by a firm performance by sterling and gilts, which in turn triggered a flurry of overseas demand for equities. There was also a growing feeling, however, that the next rise in UK interest rates is closer than previously expected. The chancellor is to meet the governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday and there are worries that a rise could follow their meeting, although many observers see January as the likeliest time to lift rates. Fretting about about such a move will not be good for equities. Dividend news continues to reassure the big income funds. Seeboard's 21 per cent rise sets the scene for what promises to be a bumper interim reporting season for the regional electricity companies. Similar good news is expected from the four 'recs' reporting this week. And watch for double-digit rises from Airtours, Siebe, Compass and Carlton Communications.</p>

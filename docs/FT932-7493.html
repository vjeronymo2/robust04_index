			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Man in the News: Centurion off-guard - Michael Portillo Mr Michael Portillo was ambushed this week. It was an unfamiliar experience for the bright young Centurion of the Tory right. For Mr John Major's government it was a salutary warning of the political ditches that lie ahead as it seeks to restore a semblance of order to public finances. The proximate cause of the discomfort was a leak that the chief secretary's review of public spending had begun to touch the nerves of the welfare state. Free National Health Service prescriptions - available to 80 per cent of the population - were to be restricted to the poor. The NHS might withdraw from dental care. Parents could find themselves paying the tuition fees for their childrens' university education. Never mind that these are only options - nothing has been ruled out but nothing has been decided. Nor that other suggestions - new restrictions on invalidity benefit, cuts in unemployment benefit or 'hotel' charges for hospital stays - are on the list. The Tory party at Westminster, never far these days from the edge of panic, was aghast. Since the enforced tax increases in the March Budget, the government backbenches have been ringing with calls for the Treasury to regain a grip on public spending. But after their trouncing in Newbury and in the council elections, Conservative MPs are in no mood to dish out more unpleasant medicine to the voters. Mr Portillo, among the few in the cabinet whose reputation has been unscathed by recent crises, found himself encircled. Mr Major was furious. This was to have been the week when the prime minister celebrated the end of the year-long Commons battle over the Maastricht treaty. Another fall in the unemployment total and a sharp drop in the inflation rate were to have provided some all-too-rare icing on the cake. Instead, as his chief secretary toured the television studios parrying questions about the future of the welfare state, Mr Major was forced yet again on to the defensive. The winners were the Whitehall spending departments, determined that a return to fiscal virtue should leave their empires untouched. Few doubted that the leak had emanated from Mrs Virginia Bottomley's health department. It was not the way Mr Portillo had planned it. He had been drafting a speech designed to explain to his party, the nation, and, above all, to his cabinet colleagues, the scale of the problems. It was to be a careful step in preparing a receptive climate for tough decisions in the November Budget. The 'scare stories' derailed it. His speech nonetheless was an elegant exposition of the economic and political case for a return to sound finance. Not yet quite 40 - he intends to celebrate that birthday next week in a London nightclub - Mr Portillo has the advantage of believing in the need to curb the role of the state. The cabinet standard bearer of the Thatcherite right, he has long been tipped as the man most likely to restore the ideological purity of the 1980s when the party leadership falls eventually to his generation. But his demand for a re-evaluation of the welfare state - and his challenge to the principle of universal benefits - is grounded in harsh financial realities as well as ideology. The figures speak for themselves. Britain's public borrowing, running at Pounds 1bn a week or 8 per cent of national income, is unsustainable. The cost of servicing the debt will almost double to Pounds 30bn a year by 1997. The core budget deficit - excluding debt interest - is worse than Italy's. Much of it can be blamed on the fall in tax revenues and rise in welfare benefits inevitable in a recession. But in the chief secretary's view, the government - he would never say Mr Major - has got into the habit of throwing money at problems. Mr Portillo has two parallel strategies to restore the position. The first is a new system for the annual spending negotiations. The cabinet has committed itself for the first time to targets for non-cyclical spending (budgets largely unaffected by the ups and downs of the economic cycle) which will mean small cuts in each of the next two years once account has been taken of inflation. The Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.6bn cash ceilings for 1994-95 and 1995-96 have been declared sacrosanct. Alongside the annual negotiations Mr Portillo has instituted his long-term review - focusing initially on the Pounds 80bn social security, the Pounds 34bn health, the Pounds 32bn education and the Pounds 14bn law and order budgets. It is this second strand which is throwing up the radical options. The original idea was that the conclusions of the review would inform decision-making next year and beyond. But, with many of his colleagues already ignoring Treasury strictures against bidding for extra cash, Mr Portillo must realise that if the sums are to add up this summer, the cabinet must take some tough decisions now. The man who as local government minister introduced the poll tax for Mrs Margaret Thatcher and abolished it for Mr John Major has underlined his politically shrewdness in the way he structured the reviews. He has cast himself as the agent in a collective decision-making process. If harsh decisions are taken, the opprobrium will be distributed equitably. He hopes also that this week's scare stories will dull the reaction to the next, inevitable, batch of leaks. But Mr Portillo's problem runs deeper. The government and the Conservative party have been drained of will. The targeting of benefits and the extension of charges in health and education would hit two groups of core supporters: the middle-aged middle classes and the elderly. An issue like prescription charges might cost the government the forthcoming by-election in once-solid Christchurch. The constituency is packed with pensioners. Mr Portillo was characteristically sanguine about the political fall-out. But he must not forget the fate of the last rising star of the Tory right determined to take an axe to the welfare state. Who else remembers Mr John Moore?</p>

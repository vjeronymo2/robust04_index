			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, 27 Feb (PETRA) -- His Majesty King Husayn has  denounced the ugly criminal incident against peaceful citizens  who were holding a mass at Sayyidat al-Najat church in Zuq  Micha'il in Lebanon.    In a cable he sent to His Excellency Lebanese President  Ilyas  al-Hirawi, his majesty said the victims fell in the church as a  result of a plan by a criminal mentality that is no different in  its evil intentions and tendencies than the mentality that  planned the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Following is  the text of the cable:    Your Excellency Brother Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi.    May God's peace and mercy be upon you.    We received with great sadness and deep sorrow the report on  the ugly criminal incident represented by an outrageous attack  on peaceful citizens, who were holding Sunday mass at Sayyidat  al-Najat church in Zuq Micha'il this morning, and the resulting  victims from among the people of sisterly Lebanon. Those  victims fell as a result of a plan by a criminal mentality which  is no different in its evil intentions and tendencies than the  mentality that planned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  Friday morning, the victims of which were citizens piously  performing the dawn prayers to God almighty.    As I express to you my sympathies on behalf of myself and  the  people and Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, I ask  God almighty to grant his mercy to the victims' souls. May God  help you so that you may continue your benevolent march toward  the advancement and progress of your homeland and toward  maintaining its security and the future of its generations. May  God fortify the victims' grieved families with patience.    May God's peace and mercy be upon you.    Your Brother King Husayn</p>

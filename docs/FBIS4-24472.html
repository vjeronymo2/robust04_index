In the 18,000-character-strong "report," Gyaincain Norbu  first recalled the work of the past year. He said: We steadily  developed the rural and pastoral economy, industrial production,  and transport. The construction of energy, transport,  telecommunications, and other infrastructural projects proceeded  smoothly. A good trend of development was maintained in foreign  trade and tourism, and in the work of introducing investments  from abroad and establishing lateral ties at home. New progress  was made in establishing the market system, new achievements  were made in the building of spiritual civilization, and the  people's living standards were further improved.    The "report" expounded in detail the salient features of  1993, including efforts to emancipate the mind, deepen reforms,  improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control,  adhere to the principle of fostering both material progress and  cultural and ideological progress and attaching equal importance  to both, achieve social stability, and wage a thorough  anti-corruption struggle.    Making a comprehensive analysis and summing up achievements,  Gyaincain Norbu pointed out: There are still many shortcomings  in our work, as well as many difficulties and problems ahead.  We must pay great attention to solving them seriously.    On the guiding principle and tasks for this year, Gyaincain  Norbu particularly pointed out: Nineteen-ninety-four is a  crucial year for this region to carry out comprehensive reforms,  promote overall progress, make breakthroughs in selected fields,  and accelerate the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure. For this reason, the guiding principle for  the government work is: to work under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line; implement in an  all-around way the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Fifth Enlarged Plenary  Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee; seize  opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development  and maintain statability; continue to improve macroeconomic  regulation and control, step up infrastructural construction,  vigorously readjust the economic structure, and constantly  enhance economic efficiency; and bring about a sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development. The goal of economic  development is to achieve a gross domestic product of 4.01  billion yuan, an 8 percent increase over 1993.    Gyaincain Norbu emphasized: All our work this year should  be subordinate to and serve the main objective -- reform,  development, and stability -- and reform should be put at the  center of all our undertakings. In economic restructuring, we  should take productive forces as the criterion and seize the  opportunity to promote overall progress and strive to make  breakthroughs in selected fields. Our economic restructuring  should converge with the national framework and structure. In  economic restructuring, we should consider Tibet's reality, take  firm action and prudent steps, and adopt flexible policies.  Gyaincain Norbu called on the governments at various levels to  implement meticulously all promulgated reform measures and do  solid work in all fields.    In order to adhere to the guiding principle and accomplish  all tasks of this region this year, Gyaincain Norbu pointed out:  Efforts should be made to increase the income of peasants and  herdsmen, further deepen reforms in rural and pastoral areas,  increase investment in agriculture and animal husbandry,  readjust structure according to market demand, develop village  and town enterprises and a diversified economy, and accelerate  economic development in rural and pastoral areas. It is  necessary to step up infrastructural construction and enhance  the capacity for future economic growth. It is necessary to  concentrate on improving the economic efficiency of industry and  transport service. A further step should be taken to open up  wider to the outside world and to develop foreign trade and  tourism. We should continue to improve the fiscal, taxation,  and banking work and ensure funds for economic and social  development. We should accelerate the construction of markets  and cultivate a unified, open market system. Great efforts  should be made to develop education, science and technology, and  improve the quality of the work force. It is necessary to  improve the social security system and accelerate the reform of  the urban housing system.    Gyaincain Norbu said: Development is the foundation for  social stability, and reform creates a strong motive force for  development. Only when social stability is maintained can we  smoothly promote reform, opening up, and economic development.  He emphasized: We should correctly handle the relationship  among reform, development, and stability and create favorable  conditions and a good social environment for the deepening of  reforms and for the acceleration of development. Gyaincain  Norbu expounded in detail such questions as how to wage a  thorough anti-splittist struggle, strengthen the political power  at the grass-roots level, do good work concerning nationalities  and religions in the new period, strengthen the legal system,  step up the building of spiritual civilization, and deepen the  anti-corruption struggle.    In conclusion, Gyaincain Norbu called on everyone in Tibet  to  rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin at its core, hold aloft the banner of building a  socialism with Chinese characteristics, unite as one, work hard,  create a new situation of reform, development, and stability in  Tibet, and rapidly bring about new development in all  undertakings in Tibet.    Present at the meeting as non-voting attendees were all the  delegates to the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous  Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference; comrades in charge of various  departments, bureaus, commissions, and offices of the autonomous  region; responsible persons of various Tibet offices in interior  and coastal regions; responsible persons of universities and  colleges; responsible persons of various organs directly under  the central authorities; and responsible persons of various  prefectures (cities) and counties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the  United Nations, which was established to secure lasting peace in  the world, had serious failures in achieving its goal during  this past term.    Cetin was addressing the first meeting of the national  committee set up for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations,  which will be marked next year. He pointed out that the  massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is the result of a lack of  political will on the part of the United Nations. Actually, he  explained, the will of the United Nations is determined by the  decision of a few countries. The decision of the five permanent  members of the UN Security Council becomes the resolution of the  entire United Nations. Naturally, at times, it is the interests  of the permanent members that is reflected in a UN resolution or  in its implementation. Consequently, it would be better to  criticize the UN decisionmaking mechanism rather than the  organization and its aims.    Cetin pointed out that the phrase "We the peoples of the  world" has been accepted as the slogan of the 50th anniversary  celebrations, stressing that this saddles the United Nations  with great responsibilities that must be fulfilled.</p>

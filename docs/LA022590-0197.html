			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY PREDICTS DIFFICULT TALKS ON PHILIPPINE BASES  </P> <P> Negotiations with the Philippines over continued U.S. use of six military bases  there will be "very difficult" because of growing anti-American sentiment,  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted Saturday.  </P> <P> Returning to Washington from a two-week tour of Asian capitals, Cheney said  that officials of the beleaguered government of President Corazon Aquino are  reluctant to express support for the American bases because of the harsh  domestic fallout from such a position.  </P> <P> "I sense that the majority like having the United States in the Philippines,"  he said. "(But) I also sense that the political dynamic and environment are  such that it's difficult to find elected leaders willing to stand up publicly  and embrace continuation of the current arrangement."  </P> <P> The United States provides Manila with about $500 million a year in military  and economic aid in exchange for use of the bases, which are considered crucial  to Washington's military strategy in the Pacific region.  </P> <P> But Congress reduced the aid package by $96 million this year, enraging the  Filipinos, who accused Washington of reneging on an earlier deal.  </P> <P> Aquino snubbed Cheney when he visited Manila last week, saying she had no time  to meet with him. And crowds of protesters burned him in effigy and chanted  anti-American slogans during his meeting with Philippine Defense Minister Fidel  V. Ramos.  </P> <P> Cheney brushed aside Aquino's snub, saying that she remains greatly admired in  the United States for helping lead the Philippines peacefully out of two  decades of dictatorship under Ferdinand E. Marcos.  </P> <P> He said that she privately sent a conciliatory message to him "through a third  party" and that he considered the matter closed.  </P> <P> On the Pacific tour, Cheney also visited South Korea and Japan, where he told  officials that the United States plans to reduce its forces in the region by  10,000 to 13,000 soldiers over the next three years. He asked Seoul and Tokyo  to increase their share of the cost of supporting the remaining U.S. personnel.  </P></p>

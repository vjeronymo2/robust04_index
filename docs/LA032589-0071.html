			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANKLE SPRAIN PUTS ANTHONY IN DOUBT FOR UNLV'S GAME  </P> <P> Greg Anthony, the point guard for Nevada Las Vegas, was termed "very doubtful"  Friday for the Rebels' game against Seton Hall today in the West Regional final  of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament.  </P> <P> Anthony sprained his right ankle and slightly injured his left knee when he  fell after blocking Ken Lofton's breakaway layup attempt in the final two  minutes of the UNLV's victory over top-seeded and No. 1-ranked Arizona  Thursday.  </P> <P> "Our trainer (Jerry Koloskie) said today that Greg is very doubtful and that he  didn't think he would play," Rebel Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "If Greg can't  play, that's a real big loss for us, obviously. He's our best defender on the  ball."  </P> <P> Anthony, who averages 13 points and seven assists a game, had two points and 11  assists against Arizona.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping he can play," Tarkanian said. "I just can't see how, when you get  this far, you cannot play unless it's broken. But if he's limping, we'll take  him out. You can't play our pressure defense and limp."  </P> <P> If Anthony is unable to play or is limited by the injury, Tarkanian said that  Clint Rossum and Stacey Cvijanovich would replace him at the point.

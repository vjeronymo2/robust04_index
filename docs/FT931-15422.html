			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert back in the black FOLLOWING reversion to its core activities, Jacques Vert, the women's fashion wear group, returned to the black and the dividend list in the six months to October 24, though Mr Jack Cynamon and Mr Alan Green, joint chairmen, said that 'a level of concern must be expressed as to prospects in the immediate future'. Mr Malcolm Heald, finance director since April, said the group had had a good August and first half of September, but that there had been 'a 30 per cent dive in sales between Black Wednesday and Christmas'. The first week of the current sale had been good, he said, but the second had fallen off. Pre-tax profits in the half were Pounds 186,000 (losses Pounds 125,000). Turnover slipped by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 19m, though the cost of sales fell more steeply to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 11.9m), giving gross profits up at Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 7.78m). Gearing was cut from 79 to 49.7 per cent through the reduction of stocks and improved debtor collection. Net bank overdrafts at October 25 were down at Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 6.11m on April 25), resulting in interest payable falling to Pounds 304,000 (Pounds 402,000). Below the line a tax credit of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 48,000) eased the board's decision to pay an interim dividend of 1p, according to Mr Heald. Last time the interim was 2p, though the final was passed. Earnings were 4.2p (losses 0.8p) per share. On the retail side - 10 per cent of the group's business - the number of concessions rose from five in July to 25 in October, 32 now and, said Mr Heald, '36 by the end of the week if all goes well'. JV Plus, the line for larger women, continued to expand, the Grace collection was launched, while Alain Cannelle was closed, the 51 per cent stake in L'Anglaise was sold, and Mr Ben de Lisi bought out Vert's share of their joint venture.</p>

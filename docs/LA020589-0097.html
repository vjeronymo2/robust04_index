			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE AND TAXES  </P> <P> Why the modesty in Dick Turpin's column (Jan. 22)? Nearly everyone knows that  the Los Angeles Times is indirectly behind every real estate movement that  takes place in the Southern California area. Mr. Kyser of the Los Angeles  Chamber of Commerce may have put together a list of the pros and cons of the  growing ownership of Los Angeles real estate by foreign nationals and  companies, but his list is superfluous to the beliefs (and holdings) of the Los  Angeles Times.  </P> <P> In any case, I doubt his list mentions one of the largest contributors of all  to the development of the real estate now being sold to foreign interests. I  refer, of course, to U.S. taxpayers. For years, real estate has been subsidized  by extraordinary tax breaks given to developers and their investors. (Remember  the bold giveaways written into President Reagan's 1981 Tax Act?)  </P> <P> I wonder if U.S. Congress members would have been so generous with real estate  if they had realized at the time that the ultimate beneficiaries of their  largess would be foreign nationals -- not U.S. citizens. But then this isn't  the first time that we deficit-burdened taxpayers have been taken for a ride,  is it?  </P> <P> A. DANIEL ELIASON  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P> <P> Letters to "Our Readers Write" must include the writer's name, address and  daytime telephone number and should be sent to the Real Estate Editor, Los  Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053. Letters may be edited  for reasons of space and clarity.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Radioactive Waste Specialist Sub-Committee of  the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan has gathered information  concerning progress of research and development of high level  radioactive waste underground disposal. In order for our country  to get people to understand and go along with further  development of safe nuclear energy, it is highly essential to  obtain the public's trust in advanced technical establishment of  radioactive waste underground disposal treatment. The basic  points to view are: 1) investigation of the geological  surrounding conditions, 2) disposal techniques, and 3)  performance evaluation. A confirmation of the updated results of  these three important research issues and in addition, emphasis  on the necessity of future technical progress is being made. The  general contents of the investigation are being reported in  series.    The goal of our country's underground disposal research and  development has been to concretely demonstrate the possibility  of long term safety of the underground disposal for high level  radioactive waste. At present, no specifications are being made  on the type of rocks or designated areas but a wide range of  geological surrounding conditions have been assumed. The  disposal techniques that will cope with these environments are  being studied and developed together, and generalized analysis  and evaluation on the capability of the treatment system which  has been based on the concept of the multiple barrier system has  been in progress. For this reason, under the ``Important  Subjects and Ways To Proceed,'' the important listings for  research and developments have been decided on the three areas  of: 1) survey study of geological surrounding conditions, 2)  research and development of disposal techniques, and 3) the  study of performance evaluation. The idea has been followed also  in the ``Technical Report'' and the results of each study area  have been organized respectively. The following articles report  on the validity and progress made by the various studies  together with the overall evaluation of its justification.  <H5>  Systematic, Comprehensive, Organized and Useful </H5>   Survey Study of Geological Surrounding Conditions.  In the study of the geological surrounding conditions, the first  objective is to look into what is considered one of the most  important items in relation to the disposal system. That would  mean a survey of a wide range area of our country's surface to  the deep underground and extract its characteristics concerning  the geological environment. The systematization should be  measured and the data should be applied to the study on  performance evaluation. Secondly, in preparing for the future,  when the time comes to evaluate a specific underground site in  detail for its geological environment, it would be necessary to  be ready with the utmost accuracy and reliable data that has  been inspected and accumulated efficiently. In addition, the  goal is to have necessary technical developments available for  analyzing and evaluating the accumulated data so it can be put  into practical use. From the ``Technical Report,'' extraction  was made from the accumulated report and data in the area of  earth science, and reports that would be useful in the future  concerning geological environments viewed from waste disposal  interests were systemized and consolidated. At the same time, a  survey of the development of techniques and tools so that  precise geological environmental data can be collected is being  pursued. Furthermore, on deep geological environmental data, the  necessary reports for performance evaluation is being prepared  but since the actual data is limited to a portion, it has been  learned that collection of more data would be necessary.    At the present, the data concerned with geological  environment of underground waste disposal, as far as collection  is possible has been prepared systematically and comprehensively  for a large area for the first time in our country. The data  will be the basis for showing our country's characteristic  geological surroundings and together it can be evaluated as  useful for extracting subjects for survey studies in the future.  <H5>  Selection of Applicable Material for Artificial Barrier </H5>   Research and Development of Waste Disposal  Techniques. The research and development of waste disposal  techniques have to be a method where long term safety can be  guaranteed. In order to clearly make this concrete, the  essential techniques are dependent on the individual artificial  barriers and based on it, the goal for disposal techniques  related to site design, construction and operation must be of  utmost trustworthy one.    In the ``Technical Report,'' the applicability of different  types of material for structuring the artificial barrier have  been compared and organized, and as a result, selections of  example materials are displayed. Furthermore, a groundwork  investigation of the technical feasibility of the design and  execution of the disposal installation is being made together  with a display of an example of a technically feasible system.  The outlook has been that for the technical aspects necessary in  building the artificial barrier, basically, existing technology  will be applied for the design and the operation of the disposal  installation. In addition, the topics for reliability  improvements on individual essential techniques are shown and  recommendations for future research and development are  suggested.    The above shows clearly the topics necessary for research  and  development. It emphasizes attaining utmost technical  reliability and establishing concrete directions for technical  development in design, construction and execution for artificial  barrier and for the disposal site.  <H5>  Safety Security by Multiple Barrier System </H5>   Performance Evaluation Studies. The study of  performance evaluation first must begin with the possibility of  high level radioactive waste directly affecting humans in the  event of natural phenomena such as earthquakes and from other  human causes and various activities.    Research and survey must be made on the possibility of such  occurrence and the magnitude of its effect. In addition, an  awareness of the notion that deep stratum underground disposal  for high level radioactive waste is the appropriately stable  burying ground needs to be clarified. Secondly, in the event  that radioactive products from high level radioactive wastes  elute into underground water, the possible effects on humans and  the eluted quantity need to be evaluated. The goal is to use the  basis of these results and evaluate a technically feasible  multiple barrier system.    The possibilities of high level radioactive waste affecting  humans directly caused by natural phenomena such as volcanic  activities, upheavals and erosions have shown to be area  dependent. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, concretely  each individual area separately. However, according to the  ``Technical Report,'' our country's geological environment  conditions have been already widely surveyed and studied without  specifying designated areas. It has been shown according to such  summarized investigation that the concept of using deep  underground for waste disposal burial location as being stable  has been valid in our country. At the same time, it has been  pointed out the importance that in the event an area is  designated, there is a need to develop technical skills and  methods to evaluate the phenomena that may be characteristic for  the area.    Next, on the technical feasibility of multiple artificial  barrier systems, in the case of our country, the existence of  the possibility of movement of radioactive products via  underground water is an important consideration. Therefore, from  this point of view, the geological surrounding conditions are  being widely assumed and the underground water quality, its flow  characteristics, the long term health of artificial barriers,  and the control of the shifted radioactive products that have  eluted through the artificial barriers etc. are being  systematically constructed into a basic model so that the total  multiple barrier system can be analyzed. By using this, the  multiple barrier system's performance is being illustrated. As a  result, when artificial barrier and disposal site can be matched  with its geological surrounding conditions and when design and  construction work are followed accordingly it has been shown  that the performance of the multiple barriers can be maintained  for a long term with safety assured. At the same time, in the  event that appropriate design and construction work take place,  the importance of accurate evaluation of the artificial barriers  and its relative neighboring geological surroundings has been  pointed out.    By this means, arguments concerning evaluation methods of  multiple barrier system performances have been made clear and  the basic model necessary for analysis is understood to have  been built. Further, in the future, in order that a reliable  analysis be performed, important influential elements have been  pointed out, and also the direction to be taken for future  performance evaluation study is being made clear. In addition,  important knowledge of concrete techniques for safety security  based on the multiple barrier system concept has been acquired  and it can be assessed that the technical foundation for  planning safety security for underground disposal treatment is  being made very clear.  <H3>  A Clear Statement of Concrete Know-How That is Generally  Reasonable </H3>   Summary of Evaluation. In the future, by  performing further required research development and survey as  needed, the geological environment can be grasped exquisitely  and together, technical improvements and detailed analysis can  be planned and it will be more and more necessary to attain high  grade evaluation with confidence. The ``Technical Report''  states: 1) for the techniques necessary for designing and  performing construction work for the artificial barriers and  waste disposal installations, basically, existing technology can  be applied, 2) concerning the performance of the multiple  barrier systems, a comprehensive analytical method has been  completed that has been centered around the performance  evaluation of the new field (the area including artificial  barrier and its neighboring underground), and 3) by taking into  consideration the width of fluctuation, the results of analysis  made on the assumed geological environmental conditions shown in  examples indicate that if the artificial barrier and waste  disposal installation are matched with the geological  surroundings and the design and construction work is  appropriate, the performance of a multiple barrier system can be  maintained for a long duration. It clearly shows the safe and  secure attainment in planning for an underground disposal  treatment in our country as being technically possible.    Assessing the above, in summary, the underground waste  disposal research and development contained in the ``Technical  Report'' has followed appropriately the article ``Important  Subjects and Ways to Proceed'' and has faithfully proceeded  accordingly. Also, pertaining to the information on safety and  security of underground waste disposal, the knowledge of the  validity of multiple barrier system has been obtained. Together,  when considering that concretely, technical methods are becoming  distinct, and therefore, at the present stage, it can be  concluded that, in general, the entire technology appears  reasonable.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: COMIC BOOK/SCI-FI SALE AIMS AT YOUNG COLLECTORS  </P> <P> If a brand-new Batman T-shirt or Batman bubble gum from 7-Eleven no longer is  enough to satisfy the collectible urge of 10-year-olds, Sunday's show at the  Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention may do the trick.  </P> <P> The dealers' room at the Shrine Hall will be filled with Batman memorabilia  spanning five decades (lunch pails and cards from the 1950s). Jerry Robinson,  one of the artists of the Batman comic books in the 1930s and 1940s, will be on  hand from noon to 1 p.m. to talk about his experiences. At 1:30 p.m., he will  present a slide show on old comic books, then move back to the table for  further discussion in the afternoon.  </P> <P> The day is sort of a Batman-meets-Freddy occasion. Show producer Bruce Schwartz  has planned a slide preview of "A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"  for 2 p.m. Speakers will include Freddy's makeup man, David Miller, and  visual-effects supervisor Alan Munro. There also will be an exhibit of Freddy  props.  </P> <P> Beyond the Batman/Freddy axis will be dozens of dealers with toys (Star Trek,  Roger Rabbit), comics, posters and cards -- some rare and expensive and some  priced just right for a 10-year-old's back pocket (quarter comics).  </P> <P> Show hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $4. The hall is at 700 W. 32nd  St., around the corner from the Shrine Auditorium. Information: (818) 954-8432.  </P></p>

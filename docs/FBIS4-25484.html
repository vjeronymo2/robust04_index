			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 9 (CNS) -- According to the latest  statistics, Shanghai, the biggest industrial city in China, has  to date totally approved 8,551 foreign-funded items with  contracted foreign investment of U.S.$17.55 billion.    Though some foreign businessmen hesitated about their  investment in the city at the beginning of this year, when the  city began to implement its new tax system which, they wondered,  might have an unfavourable influence on their businesses,  statistics show that foreign investment in the city still grew  in a steady way with 1,620 foreign-funded items with contracted  foreign investment of U.S.$3.852 billion were newly approved in  the first five months of this year, respectively increasing by  34 percent and 10 percent over the same period last year.    Foreign investment in the city this year has three  characteristics. First, industrial items were still welcomed by  foreign investors. In May alone, 1,183 foreign-funded  industrial items were approved, accounting for over 70 percent  of the total endorsed.    Second, the city saw more and more multinational companies  investing in this municipality. 41 items invested by 27  companies were approved last month. Up to date, some 136  multinational companies from various foreign countries and  regions have been attracted to invest in this metropolis and  their total investment has been nearly up to U.S.$3 billion [as  received].    Third, investors from Japan and Singapore grew sharply with  191 Japan-funded and 67 Singapore-funded items being approved  between January and May, respective increases of 55 percent and  100 percent in number over the same period last year.</p>

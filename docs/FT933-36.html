			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (10): There's no turning back - The pace and intensity of economic deregulation INDIA, it has sometimes been remarked, has potential: it will always have potential. The programme of deregulation that the present government embarked upon in July 1991 is designed to prove that wry comment wrong. With luck, it should do so. India includes somes 30 per cent of the world's poorest people. It needs to grow far faster if it is to relieve that poverty. Amazingly, as one of India's most distinguished economists, Jagdish N. Bhagwati, points out in his recently published Radhakrishnan Lectures, 'this thoroughly plausible statement can create immense controversy in India'.(1) That deregulation was not embraced more urgently before 1991 reflects partly such ideological attitudes, partly suspicion of foreigners and partly the resistance of powerful interests. Also important has been the ability of the Indian economy to keep chugging along. An economic crisis was needed if serious reform was to start. But only a systemic collapse would produce a total transformation. It was the former, not the latter, that was forthcoming. Under the 'licence raj', businessmen had to ask permission from Delhi over what, where and how to produce. They had to ask permission over what they could import, what technology they could use and with whom they might collaborate. They had to ask permission over where to locate, when they could close and whom they could fire. Foreigners were generally precluded from majority ownership and so-called 'large houses' from expansion. The public sector was strongly promoted, while the Indian economy was detached from the rest of the world. Yet this was a planned economy only in name. It was really just a controlled economy. The man in Delhi was thought to know best. What he did, in fact, know best was how to stop things. In this system corruption was no accident. It was inevitable. The nadir of Indian economic development was reached in the 1970s, also the heyday of the control system. The 1980s saw some liberalisation and, correspondingly, improvement in economic performance. At 5.4 per cent a year, India's average economic growth between 1980 and 1991 put its economy among the ranks of the more successful developing countries, though far behind leading East Asian exemplars (see chart). These differences are significant. Even at the rate of growth of income per head achieved in the 1980s, India's income per head would double only every 22 years. At China's rate, it would double every nine. The failure to achieve fast growth has been mainly caused by the inefficient use of resources. Though far behind levels achieved in leading east Asian countries, India's gross domestic savings rate in 1991, (1) Jagdish N.

But total factor productivity stagnated in the 1960s and 1970s, before growing at the more satisfactory rate of 2.8 per cent a year in the 1980s. More disturbingly, the productivity of India's scarce capital has been falling over the past 30 years.(2) The fundamental objective of deregulation is to secure a much better performance. In industrial policy, many important changes have been already made, including the abolition of industrial licensing for all except a select list of hazardous and environmentally sensitive industries; abolition of the separate permission for expansion hitherto needed by the large companies covered by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP); a reduction in the number of industries restricted to the public sector; and freer access to foreign technology. Similarly radical have been steps to liberalise controls on trade and foreign exchange. Also important, if more cautious, have been changes in the treatment of hitherto suspect foreign investment. As the finance ministry has noted, 'net foreign direct investment into China is estimated at over Dollars 5bn in 1992. By comparison, net foreign investment inflows into India during the late eighties and early 1990s were around Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m a year.'(3) Approval of foreign holdings of up to 51 per cent of equity in a specified list of 34 priority industries has been made automatic, with case-by-case approval beyond that given by the specially constituted Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). Procedures for Indian investment abroad have been streamlined. The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act has been amended to make it easier for companies with foreign equity to operate in India. To take just one example, it is now relatively easy for businessmen to obtain Dollars 5,000 for foreign travel, without a per diem limit. India has also signed the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Tax reform has begun: the marginal rate of income tax has been lowered to 40 per cent, the tax base has been broadened and excise duties have been simplified, while the level of import duties has been lowered and their structure simplified. A start has also been made on reforming the financial sector. Cumulatively, these are big changes. That they are having an impact can be seen by the large increase in the value of foreign collaboration approvals (see chart). The commercial director of Indian Airlines ascribes the decline in his business partly to the reduced need for businessmen to travel to Delhi. Similarly, major business houses have given up suites they long maintained in the best Delhi hotels, while many of those whose job was to help people obtain licences are now out of business. The changes so far are also probably irreversible, except perhaps for the greater tolerance of foreign investment, to which important elements in the BJP object for nationalistic reasons. They should ensure a substantial improvement in economic efficiency and accelerated economic growth, as demand recovers. Nevertheless, these reforms will also create problems, some of which could inhibit further movement in the same direction. One obstacle is the parlous state of parts of the public sector. But there is also a question mark against the future of many large private houses. So far pressure on them has been modest, partly because of the devaluation. But the development of private concerns has been distorted by the control regime: their technology is often outdated, their spending on research and development exiguous, the scale of their plants inadequate and their experience with marketing, rather than distribution, negligible. They are not, says a businessman, 'learning organisation'. Many are also now riven by conflicts within the families that control, rather than own, them. Large houses are just one of the interests likely to resist further reform. Also important is the lower level of the bureaucracy, many politicians and organised labour, whose political importance far exceeds its modest weight in the labour force. The number of registered unemployed alone exceeds the number employed in the organised sector. Nevertheless, removal of restrictions on 'exit' of businesses and laying off of workers remains the hottest of potatoes. Even such obstacles to change are not absolute, as the success of many companies in securing voluntary retirement demonstrates. But they raise the cost of adjustment, increase the difficulty of using resources efficiently and lower incentives for entry. As the ministry of finance remarks, 'in protecting the interests of those who are currently employed, we must not lose sight of the need to create fresh jobs for those newly entering the labour market'. The National Renewal Fund, though helpful, is not large enough to make a decisive difference to the government's ability to push through redeployment of organised labour. The finance ministry has further plans, notably for tax reform, tariff reduction and financial liberalisation. Tax reform, for example, is to include simplification of the complex and distorting structure of excise taxes, abandonment of specific tax rates, more sophisticated tax collection, virtual abolition of exemptions and a progressive move to value added tax. In industrial policy, the main concern is now with the states, whose licences, permits and inspections impose a heavy toll. No less important has been the failure to provide adequate infrastructure, notably in areas of state responsibility, such as electric power distribution. Furthermore, where central government is involved, as in railways or telecommunications, both delays and bureaucratic and political infighting remain serious obstacles. In addition, restrictions on foreign ownership remain too tight, since it is unreasonable to expect foreign companies to risk ceding control over their most advanced technology. Much has been done, but much remains to be done. So how far might reform yet go? The erstwhile commerce minister, Mr P Chidambaram, obliged to resign over the scam, argues there is no strong opposition to reform. The problem is rather that the government consists of 'converts rather than crusaders'. The free market does, it is true, have few strong supporters. But it also has few disinterested opponents. Economic success should do much therefore to shift public opinion. Reformers need a marked improvement in performance as a platform on which to build further reform. Only then might India's politics shift from their current obsession with the redistribution of just about nothing to the more attractive business of offering more to all. (1) Jagdish N.

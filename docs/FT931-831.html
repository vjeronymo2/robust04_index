			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Investors find silver cloud's dark lining - Wall Street LOW INTEREST rates and a recovering economy are what every stock market likes best. Wall Street has both at present, in fairly ample measure. But even the sunniest situation will have its share of shadows, and this week the political upheavals in Russia cast a prolonged cloud across US stock markets. For the first three days of the week, share prices generally moved lower, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall to around the 3,445-mark on Wednesday night. That was some 26 points below the previous Friday's close. There was a certain amount of logic behind the concerns. If President Boris Yeltsin was replaced by hardliners, ran the reasoning, cutbacks in US military expenditure would probably be postponed and the Clinton Administration's economic package would be jeopardy. But the reasoning ran a little thin in places, and the overall impression was of a market reacting more to the threat of uncertainty, than to specific, delineated dangers. It is also worth noting that the market was standing at near-record levels going into the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its all-time closing high on March 10, when it peaked at 3,478.34, and when the week's trading began on Monday morning, it was still standing at 3,471.58. In a market that has enjoyed a good rally, the scope for little nervousness is that much greater. Still, by the end of the week, Boris Yeltsin was still walking his tightrope, and Wall Street responded at first enthusiastically and then with a little more care. As moves to impeach Yeltsin looked increasingly unlikely on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.94 points, recouping much the losses seen earlier in the week, while the more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index showed a 2.82-point advance to 450.88. But at the opening on Friday, the advance was a modest five points and traders were warning that a sagging bond market, fearful that interest rates may edge higher, plus continued volatility in the international arena, could curtail the market's upward momentum. The main corporate story of the week - the move of Louis Gerstner from the chairmanship of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco group, to International Business Machines, the computer behemoth - had muted stock market implications. RJR Nabisco, which is in the throes of a complex 'targeted stock scheme' and a Dollars 1.5bn capital raising exercise, acted quickly to realign its management structure, filling Gerstner's shoes without introducing new blood. Its shares, clouded by all the difficulties currently surrounding tobacco stocks, remained at the Dollars 8 level. IBM shares showed a little more reaction. They fell early in the week, but this was attributed as much to pricing pressures on the group's mainframe business and the spill-over effect from the profits warning by Amdahl, another US computer systems company. On news that the intensely-watch management issue had been finally resolved, IBM shares gained Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 51 5/8. The situation in the pharmaceuticals sector was a lot less happy. Shares of many mainline drug makers - already under pressure for months - tumbled again, when Merck announced its first-ever job reduction programme. Cutbacks in the automotive, defence and aerospace industry have been on a much larger scale than Merck's decision to cut 1,000 jobs. The New Jersey-based drug company blamed the situation on the increasingly competitive environment in the US, and the worldwide effort to contain healthcare costs. It also said that the impact of this deteriorating environment would tell on its first quarter results, and analysts scaled back their expectations. Merck's shares fell sharply, down Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 34 3/4 on Wednesday, but the damage was more widespread than this. Pfizer lost Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 57 5/8, Schering-Plough tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars Dollars 56 1/2, Glaxo slumped Dollars  3/8 to a year-low of Dollars 17 5/8, Bristol-Myers Squibb eased Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 57 7/8, and so on. The drug manufacturers have had more than their fair share of worries but another ailing industry - the US airline sector - saw a rare gleam of light in mid-week. Airline stocks rallied across the board, and helped account for a gain of over 20 points in the Dow Jones transportation average on Tuesday. The reasons were various: the national commission set up to examine the industry's problems was formally approved by the House of Representatives, domestic traffic looks more healthy, and the savage price-wars which devastated the industry's fortunes last year have abated.  ----------------------------- Monday      3463.48 -  8.1 Tuesday     3461.83 -  1.62 Wednesday   3445.38 - 16.48 Thursday    3461.32 + 15.94 Friday      3439.98 - 21.34  -----------------------------</p>

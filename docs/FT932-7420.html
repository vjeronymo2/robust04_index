			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 24m offices for Revenue BOVIS CONSTRUCTION (SCOTLAND) has begun work on a Pounds 24m design manage construct contract to build new premises for the Inland Revenue in Lanarkshire. Schedu1ed for completion at the end of 1994, the new Centre 1 is at Kittoch Glen, a greenfield site at Phillipshill, a mile and a half from East Kilbride town centre. The P&amp;O company is managing the design and construction of the new development, a single building, comprising some 25,000 sq metres, of variable height up to a maximum of 20.5 metres over four storeys. In addition to the provision of office accommodation for around 1,600 staff, the premises will include a restaurant, leisure, social and child care facilities. The linear plan of the building is designed to allow for naturally ventilated office space. Energy conservation through careful temperature control, zoning of heating controls and use of solar gains when available, together with a state of the art lighting system will ensure that greenhouse gas production is minimised. Each wing of the building will be connected to one of three triple height internal atria. These spaces will connect the various departments to each other by accommodating communal lifts, staircases and meeting rooms; they will also act as thermal stacks which considerably increase the efficiency of natural cross-ventilation. The project is on schedule to be completed by Christmas 1994 and staff can expect to relocate to their new premises in January 1995.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Economics: All eyes in UK financial markets fixed on general election outcome FINANCIAL markets in the UK are likely to remain nervous ahead of Thursday's general election, with concern particularly over the possibility of investors shifting large sums out of sterling. There is also data published this week which will provide fresh clues on the extent of the slowdown in Germany and the faltering recovery in the US. In the UK, credit business data due out today will shed light on whether consumers are starting to feel happier about borrowing, a development which economists believe is necessary to kick off recovery from the 18-month recession. The figures are expected, however, to provide little encouragement to those looking for a strong economic revival after the election. The City is expecting the figures to show a net repayment of some Pounds 50m of credit in February, following a run of similarly weak numbers stretching back to the autumn. Among the highlights of the week for statistical buffs are manufacturing output figures for Germany, and the latest details of capital spending in the US. There will be interest, too, on the progress of German wage talks. These could have an impact on German inflation, which in recent months has risen sharply. The following is a list of the main items of data being published during the week, and other notable events. The numbers in brackets are forecasts provided by MMS, the financial information company.

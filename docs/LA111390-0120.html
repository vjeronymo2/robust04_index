			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FPPC CLEARS SHERIFF OF MISSPENDING FUNDS  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission has cleared Orange County Sheriff  Brad Gates of wrongdoing following claims by a local citizen that Gates had  illegally spent thousands of dollars in campaign funds in winning reelection to  a fifth term earlier this year.  </P> <P> Central to the dispute were allegations that Gates had sidestepped state  election law by using more than $1,600 in campaign funds to rent space at a San  Juan Capistrano equestrian center that his wife owns, and using the space as  his reelection headquarters.  </P> <P> State law would have precluded Gates or family members from accepting campaign  funds as rent payments, officials said. But the FPPC found that because the  Ortega Equestrian Center is owned by a separate corporate entity -- not in the  name of Gates or his wife -- the rental was legal.  </P> <P> Gates' wife, Diana, is the sole shareholder of the corporate entity, Otra Inc.  </P> <P> "The lease arrangement does not violate (the Political Reform Act's) personal  use provisions," FPPC Counsel John G. McClean wrote in an Oct. 19 letter to  Shirley L. Grindle of Orange, who has monitored the campaigns of county  officials since 1974 and brought a complaint with the state against the sheriff  in June.  </P> <P> Similarly, the Orange County district attorney's office in May found no  campaign violations in Gates' action after reviewing Grindle's claims.  </P> <P> In addition to the equestrian center issue, Grindle had also taken Gates to  task for accepting $2,000 in campaign contributions from the firm of Valenti  and Coelho Inc. in February, 1989, allegedly in violation of state law that  bans donations in excess of $1,000.  </P> <P> The FPPC said in its Oct. 19 letter: "While this appears to be a violation of  the (Political Reform) Act's contribution limits, we have decided not to take  formal enforcement action. At the time the contributions were accepted, the  contribution limits were new, having become effective on Jan. 1, 1989.  Furthermore, (Gates' reelection committee) returned the excess amount of the  contribution following the filing of this complaint."  </P> <P> The FPPC also noted that the contribution limits were overturned by a federal  court in September, throwing the entire issue into confusion.  </P> <P> Grindle had also attacked Gates for his far-reaching use of campaign funds,  citing such expenses as limousine service to events and $1,565 worth of Los  Angeles Rams football tickets for staff and supporters.  </P> <P> While the FPPC did not address the various expenses individually or respond to  Grindle's request for an audit of Gates, it did say:  </P> <P> "Each of the expenditures complained of is one which could have a relation to a  political, legislative, or government purpose, and there is no evidence to  indicate that such purposes do not exist. Absent such evidence, we have decided  to close this file."  </P> <P> Gates, who was reelected sheriff in June, defeating Fullerton Councilman Don  Bankhead, could not be reached for comment Monday on the ruling, nor could  officials in the FPPC office in Sacramento, which was closed for Veterans Day.  </P> <P> Grindle took some satisfaction in the FPPC's position, noting in particular  that the commission may adopt new regulations that would close off the legal  technicalities that she said allowed Gates to pay rent to his own wife for his  campaign headquarters.  </P> <P> Proposed FPPC regulations could erase the distinction between a corporate  entity and a candidate or his family in the regulation of campaign funds.  </P> <P> Gates' lawyer, Darryl Wold of Costa Mesa, noted that the sheriff probably won't  be able to pay rent to his wife's company in the future for a campaign  headquarters. But because of the overturning of the contribution limits in  Proposition 173, he can instead accept the space as a contribution from the  company -- as he had done before 1989, Wold said.  </P> <P> The end result, Wold said, would be the same: Gates could use the equestrian  center for a campaign headquarters.  </P> <P> "This is space he needs for his records and things, so it's a matter of  convenience," Wold said. "There's nothing wrong with it. (Grindle's)  allegations were motivated by her support for Gates' last opponent, Don  Bankhead, and she just ginned up these charges with no legal basis because she  didn't understand the law."  </P></p>

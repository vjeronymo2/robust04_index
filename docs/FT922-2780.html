			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Labour to press for early reduction in interest rates MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor and clear favourite for the Labour leadership, will today press for a cut in interest rates as anxiety grows in the government over the sluggishness of the long-predicted economic recovery. In an effort to maximise the government's discomfiture, Mr Smith will argue that, with mounting unemployment and business failures, there is 'precious little' evidence of the recovery the Conservatives had promised would follow their April election victory. His speech to the GMB general union in Blackpool criticises the government for taking no action to stimulate production or demand: 'It is time now for a further reduction in interest rates - a reduction which I believe can be sustained within the exchange rate mechanism. 'After all what is the point of being in the wide, 6 per cent band, if the greater latitude it offers is hardly ever used.' Treasury officials believe, however, that the opportunity for the government to stimulate demand by cutting interest rates has receded significantly following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on monetary union. On Friday, sterling stood at DM2.92, three pfennings below its DM2.95 central rate in the ERM, while interest rates at 10 per cent are just a quarter of a percentage point above the German Lombard rate. Most independent economists also seem to concede that there is little margin for flexibility. Private sector economists have revised their expectations for economic growth this year to less than the 1 per cent forecast by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his March Budget. The lacklustre outlook for the economy is provoking disquiet among Conservative MPs, with the Euro-sceptic faction seizing on the Danish referendum result to step up its attacks on the UK's ERM membership as an intolerable constraint. Meanwhile, ministers last week completed their submissions to Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, for spending in the coming fiscal year. In spite of an early round of meetings with Mr Portillo, aimed at ramming home the government's call for austerity, the rise in unemployment levels alone means that at least Pounds 1bn more will be needed to pay benefits.

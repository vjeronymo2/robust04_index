			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHOOSING THE RIGHT SHIP CAN BE KEY TO CRUISING  </P> <P> A colleague mentioned the other day that he and his wife had been thinking  about taking their first cruise. But, he confessed, "We don't know the first  thing about how to choose the right one for us."  </P> <P> It's not surprising the couple is confused. As many as 150 cruise ships sail  the world's seas, and no two are exactly alike. You can pick a compatible ship  and have a great vacation, or sail on a bummer and rue the day you wasted so  much money.  </P> <P> Price, of course, is a major factor, but it should not be the only basis for  reaching a decision. The ship's style, itinerary and size are also important  considerations.  </P> <P> Carnival Cruise Lines calls its growing fleet "the fun ships," and its  brochures depict a youngish, bikini-clad crowd in frenzied activity.  </P> <P> Society Expeditions' clientele appears older; photos in its brochures might  show them with binoculars and boots studying penguins in the Antarctic.  </P> <P> Depending on your personal tastes, you can select from among ships that:  </P> <P>  -- Promise a lively, nonstop party, or fill your evenings with scholarly  lectures. Dock at a new port every day, or rarely go near a port.  </P> <P>  -- Seek out sun-drenched beaches, or explore ancient cities and other  historical sites.  </P> <P>  -- Feature budget-conscious three- and four-day getaways, or cruise leisurely  on itineraries that stretch on for weeks and months.  </P> <P>  -- Cater to families (premier Cruise Lines identifies itself as "the official  cruise line of Walt Disney World") or make themselves available to  special-interest outings such as cruises for singles.  </P> <P> If you prefer intimacy, it can be found on small ships such as those operated  by the American Canadian Caribbean Line, which carry as few as 76 passengers.  But as might be expected, on-board recreational facilities are, by necessity,  very limited.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's new Sovereign of the Seas, the  largest liner afloat, is a full-fledged resort in everything but name --  offering practically everything except 18 holes of golf. It can carry more than  2,200 passengers. When the Sovereign docks at a Caribbean port such as St.  Thomas in the Virgin Islands, passengers spill into the streets like an  invading army.  </P> <P> On my first cruise a few years back, aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's Sunward II,  a magnificent sunset rewarded our last night at sea. The sky was so  spectacular, the captain made an announcement over the public-address system  urging everyone to go on deck and take a look. Hardly anybody showed up,  however, and my wife and I continued to watch in pleasant solitude. Later we  discovered why: Our fellow passengers were engrossed in bingo. If there were  ever a next time, I told myself, I would find a ship catering to folks who  prefer scenery over games.  </P> <P> "There are different breeds of travelers," says Ron Bitting, president of the  National Assn. of Cruise Only Agencies. "You've got the backpackers," by which  he means adventurous travelers, "and you've got the traveler who needs to plan  a year ahead and wants to know what side of the bed the phone is on."  </P> <P> Bitting's organization represents about 800 travel agencies nationwide,  including those that handle nothing but cruise vacations as well as  full-service agencies with separate cruise divisions. The goal of the  specialists is to match passengers with a cruise they will enjoy -- which,  despite the romantic ballyhoo of cruise-line advertising, is no easy matter.  </P> <P> A travel agent himself for almost three decades, Bitting heads Personal Touch  Cruise Consultants of Freeport, N.Y. He has put together a detailed  questionnaire, which his staff uses to determine the interests of his  customers. Among the very specific questions: Do you prefer a new ship sleekly  modern in decor or an older one that reflects an earlier era? If you like an  older ship, he suggests sailing the 30-year-old Rotterdam of Holland America  Line ("It's so beautifully maintained").  </P> <P> One tip to getting a ship you will like, says Bitting, is to find one that  offers activities similar to those you enjoy on land-based vacations. If you  tell Bitting that you want to sample several beaches, he probably will book you  on a ship plying the Caribbean. If gambling, disco dancing and a vibrant night  life are most important to you, he will find you a party ship. In the first  example, itinerary is of primary importance, he notes; to the night owl, the  ship's activities come first, regardless of its destination.  </P> <P> Among the major considerations when choosing a cruise vacation:  </P> <P>  -- Price: "In all instances, price is important," says Bitting. "Everybody is  price-conscious. We have people booking $20,000 cruises, but they want it for  $19,500."  </P> <P> Last-minute bargains often are available because many new ships have been built  recently and the availability of cabins has outstripped demand -- at least  temporarily. But Bitting cautions that the bargains are not for everyone. You  don't, for example, get first choice on cabins, and often have to take the  leftovers.  </P> <P> An easygoing traveler -- the backpacker, says Bitting -- may have no difficulty  adjusting to whatever ship is offering the best price. But those people who  demand certainty "are fooling themselves if they think they can take advantage  of these offers." Their choices are limited, and they will not like it. "It's  an emotional thing."  </P> <P> Generally, the more you pay for a cruise the classier the ship you get. Service  should be more attentive, and your cabin should be larger and better located.  At the top of the scale, you can book a two-room suite with a private veranda  open to the sea. For this, you might pay as much as $2,000 a night for two  people.  </P> <P> The cheapest cabins may have no window or porthole and be located in the ship's  equivalent of the basement. For real savings, four adults can share a bunk-bed  cabin at a rate of perhaps $125 to $150 a day per person. Some travel  counselors suggest these tight, remote quarters shouldn't matter because you  spend very little time in your cabin. If you are claustrophobic, however, you  probably will be happier with an outside cabin, and the closer to open air the  better.  </P> <P> The major cruise lines -- that is, those with fleets of large ships offering a  variety of activities -- can be loosely grouped in price categories. Bitting  lists the following among the lower-priced, mass-market lines: Chandris Fantasy  Cruises, Celebrity Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Lines and  Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. In the mid-price range, he puts Holland America  Line, Princess Cruises and Royal Cruise Line. Upper-scale cruise lines are  Royal Viking Line, Cunard Line and Crystal Cruises.  </P> <P> Among the specialty cruise lines with upscale cabin rates are those that  provide a luxury, yachtlike experience. These include Seabourn Cruise Line;  Renaissance Cruises, which has introduced the all-suite concept to the sea; the  Club Med 1, a five-masted motorized sailing vessel cruising less-visited  islands in the Mediterranean and Caribbean, and Windstar Sail Cruises.  </P> <P> Also upscale but in a category of their own, says Bitting, are the expedition  or adventure cruise lines, whose shipboard and off-ship activities are strongly  educational. These lines include Society Expeditions, Salen Lindblad Cruising  and Special Expeditions.  </P> <P> Obviously, longer cruises are more expensive. But many travelers don't have the  money or the time for lengthy vacations at sea. In line with an industry trend  toward shorter cruises, Society Expeditions next year is introducing its  version of the short cruise: a series of itineraries designed to fit within a  two-week time frame, including travel time. Most of the line's itineraries are  15 to 29 days. The cost of the line's shorter cruises is expected to be less  than $300 a day per person, based on double occupancy.  </P> <P>  -- Destination: Cruise fans will tell you a cruise is the best way to tour  foreign lands, because you always have a comfortable cabin waiting at the end  of the day and you have to unpack only once. This, of course, should be taken  with a grain of salt. A day in port is hardly time enough for anyone to get to  know a city or country. At the very least, a port call is an introduction to a  destination that may lure you back on your own at a later date.  </P> <P> Cruise itineraries tend to fall into three major categories: recreational,  cultural and educational.  </P> <P> The primary recreational destination for Americans is the Caribbean, both for  its sunny beaches and shopping ports such as San Juan and St. Thomas. If your  goal is fun in the sun, opt for a Caribbean cruise. When in port you can, of  course, skip the beaches and the boutiques for a quick personal or escorted  tour of island villages, historical sites and scenic attractions.  </P> <P> For a deeper cultural experience, the most popular itineraries are the ancient  ports of the Mediterranean Sea as well as Scandinavia, the west coast of  Mexico, the islands of Hawaii, the South Pacific and South America. Such  cruises schedule frequent sightseeing excursions, providing you with a glimpse  of local life.  </P> <P> Into the solidly educational category fall cruises that highlight wildlife  viewing or the study of remote and exotic lands. Invariably, one or more guest  lecturers are on board to offer evening briefings -- perhaps the night's  entertainment -- and to accompany off-ship excursions. These destinations  include the Inside Passage to Alaska, which has wildlife, historic and scenic  appeal; the Arctic and Antarctica; the Amazon River, and the islands of  Indonesia and the Indian Ocean.  </P> <P>  -- Style: On my first cruise, the ship's communications system broadcast light  rock music from morning until night. I am not a fan of this kind of music, but  there was almost no escaping it. The sound filtered into our room from the  hallway speakers just outside the door. The experience taught me a lesson. If  you choose to cruise, do so on a vessel that is not going to assault your  sensibilities.  </P> <P> For many travelers, style can be at least as important as price. Style can mean  such simple differences between ships as whether dinner seating is in one or  two shifts.  </P> <P> Typically, seating aboard ships with two shifts is at 6:15 and 8:15 p.m. If you  are dining early, you can expect to be hurried along by a staff that has to  clean up and set the tables again for the late seating. On a single-seating  ship, more time usually is available for a leisurely meal. Royal Viking Line  makes a big point of advertising single seating on its ship, the Royal Viking  Star. Or style can reflect more fundamental differences in a cruise experience.  </P> <P> As Bitting points out, the large, mass-market ships -- such as those in  Carnival's "fun" fleet, which sails year-round on a variety of Caribbean  itineraries -- offer Las Vegas-style shows, discos, boutiques, health spas and  gambling casinos. They appeal to gregarious, often younger travelers on a  limited budget who are looking for a good time. If you favor the bustling  activity of a big resort hotel, you probably will get along fine on a large  cruise ship.  </P> <P> No matter what cruise style you choose, it's important to keep in mind that the  cost of all activities is included in the price you pay. A basic seven-day  Carnival cruise, including air fare, ranges from about $1,000 to $2,100 per  person, depending on cabin choice. And although even this price may seem hefty,  it includes almost everything: food, lodging, recreation, entertainment and, in  many cases, round-trip air fare.  </P> <P> However, if you don't expect to take advantage of the activities -- if, for  example, you have little interest in lavish entertainment or casinos -- you may  want to consider a different style of cruise, perhaps opting for a ship where  your money buys instead a fancier cabin or a longer cruise. On the Sunward II,  I was never able to stay awake for the midnight buffet, nor was I much  interested in the extra calories.  </P> <P> Presumably there is fun to be had on the cruises offered by adventure lines  such as Society Expeditions. But don't expect a lot of revelry. More sedate  enjoyment comes in the form of scholarly pursuits, such as joining in on a  full-day trek in southern Madagascar to view the famous ring-tailed lemurs in  the Berenty Reserve, an option on Society Expeditions' 20-day cruise of the  Indian Ocean, which departs Capetown, South Africa, March 26.  </P> <P> Yet another entirely different style of cruising is available aboard the little  76-passenger Shoreham II, operated by American Canadian Caribbean Line. The  vessel's shallow draft permits it to sail right up to remote beaches where a  ramp in the bow can be lowered to disembark passengers. Passengers can swim and  snorkel without the crowds of a huge ship or a popular resort beach.  </P> <P> In November, the New Shoreham II began cruising the Bahamas and the Caribbean,  retracing the voyages of Christopher Columbus, who touched on some islands that  still remain well off normal cruise paths. The captain, a student of Columbus  lore, will provide a daily commentary. The 12-day voyages, commemorating  Columbus's discovery of the New World five centuries ago, begin at $1,190 per  person; air fare is additional.  </P> <P> If you are considering a cruise for the first time, be aware of what you are  looking for in a cruise experience. Sort out your priorities. Ask friends and  relatives who have sailed for recommendations. Consider checking one of the  standard guides to cruising available in bookstores, such as the "Berlitz  Complete Guide to Cruising" by Douglas Ward ($13.95). The book provides a  numerical evaluation of 125 cruise ships based on such characteristics as  cleanliness, cuisine, passenger space, service, activities, shore excursions  and decor.  </P> <P> Consult a travel agency experienced in cruise vacations. Most cruises are sold  through travel agents. A list of local cruise-only travel agencies can be  obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the National Assn. of  Cruise Only Agencies, P.O. Box 7209, Freeport, N.Y. 11520. Specify no more than  three states. For information: (516) 378-8006.  </P></p>

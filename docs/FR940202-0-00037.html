			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commentator requested that an immediate deduction be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed for a repurchase premium in a debt-for-debt exchange even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the issue price of the debt instrument received in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange is determined under section 1274. The IRS and Treasury,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, believe that taxpayers could inappropriately accelerate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deductions in these situations because of the flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in section 1274 for determining the issue price of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument. Thus, the final regulations retain the rule in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.446&hyph;2&blank;Method of Accounting for Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide a special payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation rule for certain small transactions. Because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule's limited scope and uncertainty regarding its application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the IRS and Treasury believe that the rule should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finalized. However, to allow further comment on the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule, &sect;1.446&hyph;2(e)(3) is reserved in the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and remains in proposed form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.483&hyph;1 Through 1.483&hyph;3&blank;Unstated Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide that stated or unstated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest under a contract subject to section 483 is taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account under a taxpayer's regular method of accounting. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentator suggested that an accrual method taxpayer should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for unstated interest in the year a payment is due, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was the rule in previous final regulations under section 483.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and Treasury, however, believe that it is appropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treat stated and unstated interest consistently. Thus, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations retain the rule in the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1.1001&hyph;1(g) and 1.1012&hyph;1(g)&blank;Amount Realized and Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations provide that the issue price of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument is used to determine the seller's amount realized and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the buyer's basis. The final regulations adopt the rules of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations, but clarify the treatment of a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument with an issue price determined under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1273(b)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1271&hyph;1&blank;Special Rules Applicable to Amounts Received on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Retirement, Sale, or Exchange of Debt Instruments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As requested by a commentator, the final regulations provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the intention to call rules do not apply to debt instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold pursuant to a private placement memorandum that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distributed to more than ten offerees and that is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain sanctions of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exchange Act of 1934.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1272&hyph;1&blank;Current Inclusion of OID in Income <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide that accrual periods may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any length and may vary in length over the term of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument, provided that each accrual period is not longer than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one year and that all payments are made at the end of an accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. In response to one comment, the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that payments also may be made on the first day of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrual period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule permitting accrual periods to vary in length was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in response to commentators who criticized the prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations as too mechanical and inflexible. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators commended the flexibility of the rule, they noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the rule raised several technical issues: (1) the accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods used to determine whether an instrument is an applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high yield debt obligation under section 163(i); (2) the accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods used by a subsequent holder to determine adjusted issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price for purposes of OID accruals, market discount, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition premium; and (3) the accrual periods used for Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1099 reporting. As noted above, &sect;1.163&hyph;7 of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations provides that the issuer's determination of accrual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods controls for purposes of determining whether a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument is an applicable high yield debt obligation. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, &sect;1.1275&hyph;1(b)(2) of the final regulations provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a subsequent holder determines adjusted issue price for purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of OID accruals, market discount, and acquisition premium in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner consistent with these final regulations. Rules on Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1099 reporting will be addressed in a separate project. Until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance regarding Form 1099 reporting is issued, however, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuer should use the same accrual periods for Form 1099 purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as it uses for computing OID deductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide rules to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield and maturity of a debt instrument with a stated contingency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could result in the acceleration or deferral of payments if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the timing and amounts payable upon occurrence of the contingency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are fixed. The contingency is ignored unless, based on all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts and circumstances, the contingency is more likely than not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to occur. The final regulations clarify that this rule applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the contingency, if triggered, would result in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative payment schedule as long as the timing and amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the payments comprising the alternative payment schedule are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known as of the issue date. The final regulations also clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these rules apply if the debt instrument is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple contingencies that result in alternative payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules. The final regulations retain the rule in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for determining the yield and the maturity of a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument in the case of a put or call option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury consolidates Shaftesbury, the property group, consolidated its return to profit in the 12 months to September 30 with Pounds 1.01m before tax, against a restated loss of Pounds 5.29m. The latest result followed a Pounds 344,000 pre-tax profit in the first half, against a Pounds 1.27m loss. The year saw completion of the disposal of the development portfolio and the conclusion of trading activities of associated companies. The pre-tax loss for the year to end-September 1992 was restated to reflect a Pounds 616,000 increase in provisions related to associated undertakings. Mr Peter Levy, chairman, said he believed the company had embarked on 'a period of growth.' The Pounds 20.8m raised in August via a placing had enabled Shaftesbury to exploit investment opportunities.</p>

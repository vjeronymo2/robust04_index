			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (13): Waiting for the clincher - Multimedia The 'killer application' that will turn multimedia from a gimmick into a business necessity hasn't happened yet, writes Claire Gooding. It was Visicalc spreadsheet software that turned microcomputers into business machines, and its successor Lotus 1-2-3 that sold 80 per cent of IBM PCs. But the average PC buyer, both commercial and home consumer, is still waiting for the irresistible multimedia application: the clincher that convinces them to spend the extra on CD-ROM drive and supporting technology. Some point to long-distance videoconferencing  - and the price of air tickets  - as the incentive, others to the games and home market for selective film viewing known as video-on-demand. As for applications, there are an increasing number of samples outside the traditional areas of training and education. These are being promoted as 'real live commercial applications' for multimedia, but they are still pioneers. In fact, the market can not take off before three factors are settled: reliability, ease of use, and the 'critical mass' factor. Previous waves of technology have proved this pattern in everything from cars to cameras, faxes and video tape recorders. There's not much point being the first user of the telephone or fax if your peer group isn't similarly equipped. In the US, says multimedia consultant Jeffrey Goldberg of Dataquest, things are more advanced. 'For the average US home buyer, buying patterns prove that the CD-ROM is more important than having the fastest possible speed of processor' he says. 'Even though the software itself is still in short supply, they want the capability there.' He notes that in the IT industry, software suppliers are seizing on the technology as an alternative to using unwieldy bundles of discs for the distribution of products and upgrades. 'There has to be a return on investment and a commercial incentive, because the technology isn't cheap'. Reliability is another delimiter, according to Anne Perlman, vice-president of the multimedia division of Tandem Computers of Cupertino, which specialises in 'non-stop' fail-safe computers. 'The focus has to be on business applications for multimedia, because it will be three to five years before networks are sufficiently upgraded to serve home consumers,' she says. 'Reliability is critical if a business is on line 24 hours a day across different time zones: users have to be able to take it for granted that the service will be working when they need it, much as we do for TV or electricity supply.' Multimedia is simply a consolidation of many technologies we have come to take for granted, including computing, telecommunications, computer graphics and text, fax, video and photography. The so-called 'information superhighway' allows the computer user to tap into online databases and other remote sources. This is already possible with current electronic mail and messaging systems, but much enhanced by the used of graphics and live pictures as used in videoconferencing. This accessibility still depends on a chain of skills and commodities, and the development of multimedia is characterised by partnerships and consortia. Large suppliers such as Sony are already providing the hardware, but smaller suppliers provide for specialist areas: Micropolis' new video-on-demand server, for example, or VideoLogic's Vesa Media Channel for PC/video integration.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 19 May "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- "Prime Minister Stuns  Parliament" (the trade union daily TRUD), "Prime Minister Gets  Mixed Up Kicking His Own Chair" (ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of  the Bulgarian Agrarian Party), "MP's to Boycott Berov's Cabinet  Overhaul" (the private daily STANDART NEWS), "Berov May Fall  Today" (the private daily 24 CHASA) -- this is a sample of  newspapers front-page headlines on Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's  proposals for structural and personnel changes to the cabinet  which he unveiled in parliament yesterday. Prof. Berov read his  proposals at the beginning of debates on the sixth vote of no  confidence in his cabinet the parliamentary Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS) moved for last week. The no confidence motion is  to be put to the vote after 18:00 hrs today.    The private daily OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK stresses that "the New  Union for Democracy (NSD, set up by breakaways and expelees from  the parliamentary SDS), and the ethnic Turks' Movement for  Rights and Freedoms (DPS, on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet  was formed at the end of 1992), have withdrawn their political  and parliamentary support for Prime Minister Berov." "The  problem is whether the NSD and DPS joint declaration is mere  words or actual intention," a signed commentary in the same  daily says.    Citing Socialists, the SDS daily DEMOKRATSIYA writes that  the  Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is expected to adopt a decision  on toppling Prof. Berov and his cabinet at a plenum today.    "It is worth talking about a new cabinet if some six million  Bulgarians have their say on it first", the socialist daily DUMA  writes referring to a statement by BSP leader Zhan Videnov.  Commenting on the NSD-DPS joint declaration, Mr. Videnov said  that "the two parliamentary groups refuse to give credit to  Lyuben Berov after he fulfilled all their wishes".    TRUD predicts that Prof. Berov's Cabinet will be succeeded  by  a government formed by centrist forces -- the DPS, the NSD, the  independent MP's and the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR,  part of whose members broke away from the BSP). Prof. Todor  Vulchev, governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, is expected to  head the new cabinet, the paper writes. The MP's' unwillingness  to dissolve themselves before the expiry of their term is a  guarantee for the appointment of a new cabinet, the paper says  adding that the centrists and the moderate in the SDS and the  BSP are expected to conclude an agreement.    "The SDS and the BSP would better admit that the bogging  down  of reform and the disintegration of the state is their fault,  and not the fault of that cabinet of figure-heads," a signed  commentary in 24 CHASA says. According to the publication,  "more than four years have passed but the SDS, the BSP and the  president still do not dare publicly name the price of the  transition to a market economy which Bulgarians have been paying  through the constant drop in their incomes, living standards and  social status". "They say nothing about the price because they  do not dare take the responsibility and govern the country in an  open and honest way," the author points out.    "75 percent of Bulgarians disapprove of Parliament, 65  percent are against Berov", 24 CHASA reports publishing the  results of a representative opinion poll conducted by the BBSS  Gallup International in May.

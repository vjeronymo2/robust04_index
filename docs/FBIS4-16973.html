			<p>BFN     [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 21 April ITAR-TASS -- Chinese  Premier Li Peng today continues his official visit to  Turkmenistan.    On the eve of his arrival, the local press published a  series  of statements on relations between Turkmenistan and China by  President Saparmurad Niyazov. Niyazov described these relations  as having great perspectives.    "China is a great country, and its role in the Asian-Pacific  region and the entire world is considerable," Turkmenistan's  president said.    "We have no intention of copying somebody's model  uncritically," Turkmenistan's leader said. "Along with this we  are studying carefully and interestedly China's economic reform  experience."    The head of the Chinese Government is on a 12-day tour of  the  Central Asian countries, including Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan,  Kazakhstan and Mongolia. These visits were planned in spring of  last year but had to be postponed because of the premier's  unexpected illness.</p>

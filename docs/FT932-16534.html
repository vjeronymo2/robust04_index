			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Kohl urges more aid for Russia: G7 finance ministers meet next week to discuss support package GERMANY will today call on its industrialised partners to underpin Russia's reforms with more debt rescheduling and a co-ordinated aid package. The call follows the weekend's decision by US President Bill Clinton to provide Moscow with Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) in aid and a new warning by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that, without help, Russia's reform programme would fail. Today's meeting of special advisers to the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington is expected to finalise a package of financial and economic assistance to Russia. This will be presented to a G7 meeting of finance and foreign ministers in Tokyo next week. Mr Kohl warned yesterday that if western governments did not co-ordinate a programme - assisted by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community  -Russian reforms would fail. 'Support for the reforms is an investment in a peaceful future. A slide back into confrontation would put burdens on all of us which would be far greater than the aid that is now necessary,' Mr Kohl said in a four-page statement. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said he welcomed 'the American president's determination to support as a partner the politicians who want to press ahead with reform in the Russian federation'. But Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, said President Clinton's pledge of Dollars 1.6bn of credit and aid facilities to Russian President Boris Yeltsin following last weekend's summit meeting was 'a good start, but far from adequate'. 'Compared with what we Germans are giving and will still have to give Russia, it is a relatively small amount. But I am pleased that the Americans have jumped the hurdle and made a start,' he said in a radio interview. The west sees its aid as crucial in shoring up support for Mr Yeltsin within Russia, where economic adjustments following the collapse of communism have severely eroded living standards. Mr Yeltsin faces a key test in an April 25 referendum, on his presidency and the policies of his government, which is being conducted by the conservative-dominated Russian parliament. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, cautioned yesterday that Western countries should make aid to Russia conditional on its control of money supply and inflation, 'policies which do not exist at the moment'. Mr Hurd, speaking on a visit to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, said he supported the US government's announcement at the weekend US-Russia summit between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin of Dollars 1.6bn package of aid with its emphasis on the micro-economic measures. Macro-economic assistance channeled directly through the Russian government, should be conditional on the implementation of new economic policies, said Mr Hurd. He said reformers within Mr Yeltsin's administration wished western aid 'to be conditioned, because only if it is conditional is there an increasing incentive, support, for reform in Russia'. The coming weeks would see a dialogue among G-7 industrialised nations, and in the EC, as to levels and conditions of further help to Moscow, Mr Hurd said. In Tokyo, Mr Yohei Kono, chief spokesman for the Japanese government, said Japan was preparing further aid measures of its own, which it intended to have ready for the G7 Tokyo meeting. A Japanese foreign ministry official told AP-Dow Jones that the size of the package would be comparable to that of the US. For his part, Mr Kohl said 'anchoring democracy, the rule of law and the market economy in Russia, and the other reform states, is a unique chance and challenge which demands the full commitment of the entire West'. He said that Germany, which would not be providing fresh money, had already 'provided more than half of western aid'. Foreign ministry officials in Bonn are increasingly confident the Clinton administration is more committed to supporting Russia's reforms than the Bush administration.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Marriott files bond plan details MARRIOTT Corporation, the large lodging and food services group, yesterday filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission details of its plan to exchange existing bonds for new high-yielding debt securities, common stock and cash. If all bondholders participate fully in the exchange offer, Dollars 1.525bn of existing bonds would be retired. The offer was agreed in principle with some of the group's bondholders in March. Bondholders were upset by Marriott's plans to demerge its main operating interests - the lodging business and food services operations - which would leave behind Marriott's property assets and the bulk of the group's Dollars 3bn of debt. Negotiations between Marriott and some of the larger US institutional bondholders resulted in the exchange offer plan. However, a second group of unhappy bondholders - led by the UK's Prudential insurance group - continued to oppose the demerger plan, and so far has not agreed to the settlement offer. Marriott, which intends to put the demerger plan to shareholders at the June 22 annual meeting, said the exchange offer required holders of 85 per cent of all relevant series of bonds and 51 per cent of each individual series to agree. In the SEC filing, it said the new bonds would have interest rates 100 basis points higher and maturities extending about four years later than the present Marriott bonds. Up to Dollars 70m of Marriott common stock and up to Dollars 104m of cash would be offered in the exchange.</p>

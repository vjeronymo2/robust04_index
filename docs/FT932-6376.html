			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Asprey expands further with Pounds 11m Swiss deal ASPREY, the USM-quoted jewellery group, yesterday announced that it would continue its recent expansion with the acquisition of Les Ambassadeurs, a specialist retailer of high quality watches and jewellery in Switzerland. The consideration of SFr24.3m (Pounds 10.8m) will be funded by a seven-year Swiss franc term loan fully underwritten by Lloyds Bank. Les Ambassadeurs, an affiliate of Siber Hegner Holding, is among the most upmarket watch and jewellery chains in Switzerland. In 1992 it made profits before interest and tax of SFr1m on sales of SFr31.1m. Mr Naim Attallah, Asprey chief executive, said Credit Suisse had suggested the acquisition, knowing that Asprey was keen to broaden its customer base and expand in Europe. The group has traded in Geneva for 20 years (under the Asprey name). It also owns Garrard, Mappin &amp; Webb - which is soon to open a branch in Prague - Hamilton &amp; Inches, and Rene Boivin. Last June it paid Pounds 23.2m for Watches of Switzerland. Siber Hegner, which managed Les Ambassadeurs as a stand-alone business, is a private, family-owned company that has specialised in trading a wide range of Swiss precision machinery and prestige consumer products in the Far East. About 40 per cent of its SFr1.45bn sales in 1991 came from Japan. The acquisition is conditional upon the Swiss authorities approving the transfer of leases over certain lengths.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Deputy Irene Pivetti by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Irene  Defends Herself: Me, Anti-Semite? Nonsense, I Am Only a Little  Khomeyni-ist" -- first two paragraphs are IL MESSAGGERO  introduction]    [Text] "I am very outspoken," Irene Pivetti said in April  1992, a few days after landing in parliament thanks to 3,272  votes. She has confirmed this in every way. As a strong  Catholic, previously a member of FUCI [Italian Catholic  University Federation] and ACLI [Christian Association of  Italian Workers] in Milan, director of the monthly IDENTITA, and  the president of the Northern League's Catholic Advisory Council  [Consulta], Irene Pivetti has never been soft with anybody. She  has attacked the Pope: "He must not meddle in politics." She  has fired broadsides against Cardinal Martini of Milan: "He  interferes unduly." Once she even yelled at the great head of  the Northern League Bossi: "He is too much of a planner."  Today, she is one step away from the speakership of  Montecitorio [lower house]. And if she succeeds, at age 31 she  will be the youngest speaker in the history of the republic or  nonrepublic.    Pivetti speaks four languages including Russian, has been  married for six years, and admits that "a hard boiled egg is the  only thing she knows how to cook": She does not want to be  defined as being the Northern League Joan of Arc ("she is a  saint, I am not") or a pasionaria ("I am not"), but a  Khomeyini-ist, yes: "At times, in fact, I am a little rigid."  And it is precisly this intolerance that the Radicals and  Progressives are now denouncing.    [Correspondent] Deputy Pivetti, you have been accused of  anti-Semitism.    [Pivetti] This is nonsense. I cannot be accused of  anti-Semitism, I have the utmost respect for diversity.  However, I have never made any secret of the fact that I am a  Catholic. Rather, my religion permeates my personality, but I  can assure that this will in no way interfere with the role of  guarantor that I will have to fulfill if elected. I think that  these insinuations are mere expedients and also irresponsible at  such a critical moment.    [Correspondent] In the past you have talked of "Jewish  Masonry." Is this not so?    [Pivetti] I may have spoken out about the Masonry and also  about some Jewish lodges. But I do not think there is anything  wrong in that.    [Correspondent] But you also expressed a negative opinion  concerning the regulations on skin-heads.    [Pivetti] That is not so. It was back in November 1992 when  the kickback scandal inquiry was in its decisive stages. What I  said was that the campaign against racial intolerance was a  means of drawing the attention of the Italians away from more  serious problems.    [Correspondent] What about your antiabortion stance that is  causing the Radicals to put their foot down.    [Pivetti] There is a law in Italy, Law 194. Now is the time  to start implementing it. Including the section that provides  for preventing abortion.    [Correspondent] [National Alliance Coordinator] Fini has  said  that: "Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century."  What do you think?    [Pivetti] We must acknowledge the fact that he built a part  of Italy's history. Both good and bad.    [Correspondent] What will your 25 April [Liberation Day] be  like?    [Pivetti] I hope it will be a celebration of reconciliation.  The rights and wrongs of both sides must be acknowledged.    [Correspondent] During the last legislative term one of your  colleagues shook a noose in the air. What will happen when you  are speaker?    [Pivetti] There will be no nooses with me.    [Correspondent] Once you suggested abolishing the title  "honorable." Will you do this again?    [Pivetti] Certainly. Instead of "honorable fellow  representatives" it will be sufficient to say: "Fellow  representatives." Period.    [Correspondent] With you as speaker will the League's  machismo come to an end?    [Pivetti] Well, perhaps the time has come to do away with  this myth.</p>

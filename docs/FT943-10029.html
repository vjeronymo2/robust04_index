			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / High achievers who 'fear only the creator': Those drawn to a controversial Islamic group 'We embrace Islam intellectually and we carry it politically. We are looking for change,' says Abdul, a 25-year-old investment analyst with a City merchant bank. By day Abdul (not his real name) handles a multi-million pound portfolio for private and institutional investors. By night he helps run Hizb-ut-Tahrir (Liberation party), an Islamic revivalist group which advocates the restoration of the Khilafah, a single borderless Moslem entity with one leader, abolished by the father of modern Turkey, Kemal Attuturk, in 1924. In the UK, Hizb-ut-Tahrir counts among its members British-born doctors, gilts traders, computer analysts, university lecturers, accountants and physicists. They are high achievers, outspoken and 'fear only the creator', according to party spokesman Farrid Qassim, a former town planner now fully absorbed with running the party. Abdul, a physics graduate who recently completed his doctorate at London University, is typical of the highly educated British-born Moslems whose uncompromising articulation of their faith has set them apart from fellow Mohammedans. Yesterday thousands of Moslems like Abdul descended on Wembley Arena in north London to hear speakers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, Pakistan and the US at the International Moslem Khilafah Conference. Hizb-ut-Tahrir was one of the organisers. Brent council, the local authority, and the Union of Jewish Students, had urged the government to ban the meeting. They cited Hizb-ut-Tahrir's anti-semitism as likely to inflame tensions in a multi-racial area already on edge after last month's two bomb attacks on Jewish targets in London. The Board of Jewish deputies expressed its concern to the government but stopped short of calling for a ban. Brent Islamic Forum, an umbrella group, and leading Moslem scholars opposed moves to ban the conference, saying it would simply make Moslems more suspicious of government motives towards the Moslem community. Any ban, they added, would backfire in Hizb-ut-Tahrir's favour. But Islamic scholars have nevertheless denounced Hizb-ut-Tahrir's anti-semitic comments, carried in leaflets distributed at universities. The party's statements about 'killing Jews' were 'wrong in theology, wrong in ethics, and wrong in British law', said Dr Zaki Badawi, principal of the Moslem College in London. Hizb-ut-Tahrir insists its published comments have 'been taken out of context', and that it is the target of an orchestrated campaign. All this attention has raised the profile of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which was founded in 1953 in the West Bank town of Hebron to revive the Khilafah, an aim which led to its banning in many Middle East states. Yet its agenda - dismissed privately by Moslem scholars as 'silly and Utopian'  - has attracted many young Moslems in Britain. Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, says: 'We provide intellectual leadership. This forces us to argue our case and we are equipped to do this. This will create public awareness (for the Khilafah), then create a public force and then public demands.' Omar Bakri was expelled from Saudi Arabia 10 years ago and today runs an Islamic school in Tottenham, north London. Much of the reason for the interest created by Hizb-ut-Tahrir is attributed to disenchantment with the internal leadership of the ummah, the Moslem community. It is denounced for failing to address contemporary issues that concern young Moslems. Sohail Nakhooda, a director of Islamica, a religious journal, says that these issues include racism, employment and drugs in the UK. Overseas issues include the plight of Moslems in Bosnia, the occupied territories and Algeria, and injustices in, for example, western-supported Gulf states. This discontent has, for five years, been tapped by Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Universities and colleges have proved the most fertile areas for recruitment. The Union of Jewish Students says complaints from its members about Hizb-ut-Tahrir activities have risen sharply in the past eight months. The party's members probably number no more than 2,000. Typical is Zulfikar, a former futures and gilts trader with Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch, who quit the City and, after starting a physics degree at London University, joined Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Today, London-born Zulfikar is studying Islamic jurisprudence at Omar Bakri's Islamic school. 'What motivates me? The intellectual pull and the desire for a Khilafah,' he says.</p>

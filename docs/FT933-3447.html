			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: The right rules supreme - America's highest court was dominated by conservatives in the '92-93 term A review of the voting patterns of the US Supreme Court over the 1992-93 legal term shows America's highest court still dominated by the conservatives. According to the National Law Journal, a US legal magazine, at the opening of the 1992-93 term in October last year the main question was whether three centrist justices, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice David Souter, would continue to act as a moderating influence on the court's more extreme left and right-wing elements, as they had done in the previous term. By the end of the term in July it was clear that they had not. Looking at the court's decisions during the term, on civil rights, church-state separation and voting rights, it was apparent that Justices O'Connor and Kennedy at least had returned to the conservative fold, the magazine says. Evidence of the renewed domination of the right was most apparent in the 20 decisions in which the court was split five-four. Most often in the majority in those cases was the staunch conservative, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, followed by Justices Antonin Scalia, Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Least often in the majority in five-four splits was Justice Souter. This pattern was a reversal of the 1991-92 term. Justice Thomas followed the approach he took in his first year on the Supreme Court bench, agreeing most often with Justice Scalia - in 91 per cent of all cases. Overall, the National Law Journal says, the last term's 118 decisions demonstrated that the court's seven conservative members often had competing visions of conservatism. Nevertheless, there was a high degree of unanimity. The justices were unanimous in 43 per cent of cases, continuing an upward trend in unanimous decisions which began in 1989-90. In the commercial sphere, for the second year running business won important victories in the high court, enjoying success in anti-trust, employment discrimination and federal taxation cases. But in two of the term's most significant decisions, business suffered big defeats. In TXO Production Corp v Alliance Resources Corp and Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc, the court respectively rejected attempts to curb juries' awards of large punitive damages, and gave federal judges broader discretion to admit novel scientific theories that may not be generally accepted. The TXO decision was a big blow for industry, which for years has been fighting punitive damages awards many times the size of compensatory damages. The National Law Journal predicts that the court's decision in TXO will increase pressure from business for legislative caps on punitive awards. Upholding a punitive damages award 526 times the size of the compensatory award not only handed the reformers a piece of propaganda, the magazine says, it also allowed the press to hold up the decision as 'an example of a judiciary that has lost its collective mind'. In the anti-trust field, the most important decision came in Hartford Fire Insurance v California and Merrett Underwriting Agency v California. The court, in two five-four opinions, allowed an anti-trust suit brought by 19 US states against four insurance companies and their UK reinsurers at Lloyd's to go to trial in the federal court, and held that insurers did not lose their anti-trust immunity by collaborating with foreign insurers. The big issue for the next term, beginning next month, will be where the court's newest member, Justice Ruth Ginsburg, fits into the picture. The first Democratic appointment to the Supreme Court for 26 years, she was billed by the Clinton administration as a moderate centrist. But Justice Ginsburg has an activist record and many legal observers feel she is not naturally aligned with the moderate conservatives of the court and is likely to be more left of centre. Some predict that a quartet may emerge in the centre ground - Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter and Ginsburg - but only on occasions. The National Law Journal predicts the most visible result of the replacement of the centre/right Justice Byron White, retiring after 31 years, with the centre/left Justice Ginsburg is likely to come on abortion rights. Justice White was consistently against the court's 1973 landmark abortion rights ruling, Roe v Wade. The court has accepted a number of cases for next term that should soon reflect the influence Justice Ginsburg will have. They include cases on voting rights, the retroactive impact of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, sex discrimination in jury selection, federal anti-racketeering laws, abortion clinic blockades, child pornography and sexual harassment.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             US SUPREME COURT VOTING ALIGNMENTS 1992-93 TERM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Justice                                                       All Cases  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rehnquist               Agreed most often with              Kennedy 90%                            least often with                 Stevens 62%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- White                   Agreed most often with            Rehnquist 87%                            least often with                 Stevens 68%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Blackmun                Agreed most often with              Stevens 84%                            least often with                  Scalia 63%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Stevens                 Agreed most often with             Blackmun 84%                            least often with                  Thomas 61%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- O'Connor                Agreed most often with               Thomas 85%                            least often with                 Stevens 65%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Scalia                  Agreed most often with               Thomas 91%                            least often with        Blackmun/Stevens 63%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kennedy                 Agreed most often with            Rehnquist 90%                            least often with                 Stevens 66%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Souter                  Agreed most often with         White/Scalia 81%                            least often with                 Stevens 71%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thomas                  Agreed most often with               Scalia 91%                            least often with                 Stevens 61%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most agreement: Scalia/Thomas 91%.

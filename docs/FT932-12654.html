			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand underpins more French franc issues THE Eurobond market continues to see a steady stream of French franc issues as borrowers try to take advantage of lower interest rates and strong investor demand. Yesterday, the European Coal and Steel Community launched a FFr1.5bn 10-year Eurobond and Deutsche Bank Finance launched a FFr2bn bond with a three-year maturity. The deals follow closely on the Kingdom of Norway's FFr3bn five-year bond issue launched last Friday. Dealers pointed out that demand for French franc-denominated paper is still strong as investors expect the currency to remain firm while French interest rates are likely to be cut further. The Bank of France has already cut interest rates since the centre-right election victory, with the latest fall announced on Friday. The European Coal and Steel Community is not a frequent borrower in the French franc sector of the Eurobond market, and BNP, the lead manager and book-runner, claimed this 'rarity' factor enabled the deal to be aggressively priced at a spread of 15 basis points over the mid-price of the 10-year OAT. BNP reported good demand for the triple-A rated paper from Europe and eastern Asia. The bonds rose from the fixed price re-offer of 97.785 to 97.82 by mid-afternoon. The funds are being passed on directly to a client and will be kept in French francs. Deutsche Bank Finance, which also tapped the French franc sector, said it would be swapping the proceeds of its FFr2bn issue into floating-rate funds. Some of the recent French franc bonds have been swapped into floating rate francs or into dollars, as swap opportunities have improved. The other main feature of the Eurobond market yesterday was the launch of two 'collared' floating-rate note issues - from ING Bank and Merrill Lynch. Morgan Stanley, lead manager for ING's Dollars 100m 10-year deal, said demand for these instruments remains strong. The deal has a minimum coupon of 5.1875 per cent and a maximum of 8.125 per cent. 'The floor is well above short-term interest rates, so people are willing to cap their upside in return for a high floor,' the lead manager said. The recent flood of Latin American deals continued yesterday, with a 2 1/2  year Dollars 50m bond from Banco Bradesco, the largest private bank in Brazil. Lead manager Deutsche Bank said the bonds were mainly bought by specialist Latin American funds and Swiss banks.</p>

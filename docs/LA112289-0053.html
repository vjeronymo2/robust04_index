			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE OFFICERS UNIT BACKS S.F. DIST. ATTY. FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL  </P> <P> The 34,000-member Peace Officers Research Assn. of California Tuesday endorsed  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith for attorney general.  </P> <P> The organization, the state's main union of police officers, said Smith has the  record on fighting crime and other issues important to its membership,  including support of the death penalty.  </P> <P> "From the street officers' perspective, Arlo Smith, we feel, is the best  candidate for attorney general," said association President Larry Malmberg.  </P> <P> Smith is battling Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner for the Democratic  nomination for the state post. Sacramento lawyer Dan Lungren is so far  unopposed as the Republican candidate.  </P> <P> One association member, who asked not to be identified, was critical of Reiner,  charging that he "plea bargains away all our hard work" once cases go to court.  </P> <P> A recent California Poll showed that Smith -- who also has been endorsed by the  National Organization for Women -- gained 10 points between July and October,  with the number of Democrats preferring Smith jumping from 13% to 23%. In the  same survey, Reiner's support by Democrats jumped from 33% in July to 36% in  October.  </P></p>

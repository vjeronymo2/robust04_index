			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PAIR HAS THE COMPETITION COVERED  </P> <P> For Kathy Olsen and Suzette Wehunt, the most difficult part of becoming  entrepreneurs was cutting the umbilical cord to their former employers, leaving  behind a dependable, weekly paycheck to go into business for themselves.  </P> <P> Nearly three years after stepping out into the great unknown of  self-employment, the twosome seems to have made the right move. The  four-employee company, Computer Covers Unlimited, a manufacturer of dust covers  and other accessories for personal computers, has grown rapidly to a sales  level of $400,000 for 1990, up from $26,000 when the pair took over.  </P> <P> Despite formidable competition, the company has carved a niche by paying close  attention to product quality and individualized service. Clients include a high  number of school districts and government entities, in addition to computer  retail stores.  </P> <P> All of the company's computer covers, trademarked Nycov, are cut from raw nylon  at its Clairemont Mesa plant and sewn by independent contractor seamstresses in  San Diego.  </P> <P> Recently, Olsen and Wehunt earned the distinction of becoming the first  beneficiaries of a $25,000 annual San Diego Women Business Owners Grant, given  by sponsoring organizations that include Women's Enterprises, the U.S. Small  Business Administration and Southern California Women for Business Ownership.  </P> <P> They beat out 100 entrants to win the award, gaining the favor of a panel of  judges that included local businesswomen Jenny Craig, Gail Stoorza-Gill, Joyce  Bonneau, Ingrid Croce and Judi Sheppard Missett, among others.  </P> <P> The grant money came from dozens of donors, including Jenny Craig  International, General Dynamics, Wells Fargo Bank, Union Bank, Avon Products  and First California Bank.  </P> <P> The award is meant to highlight the success of women-owned businesses and  provide them with capital to develop specific business plans and products, said  Women's Enterprises President Joann Mockbee.  </P> <P> Olsen, 40, and Wehunt, 39, acknowledged that their decision to buy Computer  Covers Unlimited in early 1988 from its previous owner was a risky venture.  Both left jobs with salaries of more than $40,000 of year.  </P> <P> But both were debt-free, single -- -- Olsen at the time was a divorced mother  of a teen-age son -- -- and looking to make career changes. Of comfort was the  fact that the company they were buying had a product already on the market,  although sales were at exceedingly low levels.  </P> <P> Olsen left a job she had held for six years in the finance department of IVAC  Corp. of San Diego, where she had specialized in computerizing office  functions. Wehunt had spent eight years in a marketing position with Clark  Security Products, a San Diego-based wholesale distributor of locksmith  supplies.  </P> <P> The two met as members of an investment club and joined forces as consultants  in their off hours. The previous owner of Computer Covers Unlimited hired them  as consultants, and a year later offered to sell them his company.  </P> <P> "We had fallen in love with the product line and with its purpose, which is to  protect the investment in a computer and the people who use them," Wehunt said.  The market looked as though it could be fertile if they could accentuate  individual attention to clients.  </P> <P> The company's covers were made of lightweight nylon that allowed personal  computers to "breathe" after being turned off. Other plastic coverings trapped  heat inside, shortening the life of the machines, Wehunt said. The company says  that only three of the 40,000 or so covers it has sold in the past three years  have been returned for faulty manufacturing.  </P> <P> The company's product line has been expanded to include keyboard protectors and  radiation screens for terminals, but both of those items are manufactured by  outside companies.  </P> <P> The women put up no capital -- they had none -- but agreed to pay the seller of  the company a royalty on future sales. The company they acquired had $15,000 in  inventory -- about half of it obsolete -- plus 1,000 yards of material and  $2,000 in receivables.  </P> <P> The company grew mainly through an aggressive direct sales approach to high  volume buyers, including school districts and government agencies.  </P> <P> "The difference I have seen in their covers is they are made of nylon as  opposed to clear plastic covers, which get hot from the machines and crack,"  said Kim Glemser, a buyer for the San Diego Unified School District in charge  of computers, software and accessories for the district's 165 schools.  </P> <P> "They do have lots of competition. Just about everyone offers computer covers,"  Glemser said. "But their stuff is better quality and they are local. In case  there is a problem, they can come and service the account more easily."  </P> <P> Manjula Jain, vice president of purchasing at Byte &amp; Floppy Computers  retail store in Kearny Mesa, said her store carries Computer Covers Unlimited  products because of their high quality.  </P> <P> "We have been carrying them for five years. They are custom-made and the  quality is good. They are not unique -- there are several people who make the  covers, but (Computer Covers Unlimited's) quality has been good. The service is  very good. We don't have to do any returns."  </P> <P> The company plans to use the $25,000 grant to help expand its market from  mainly San Diego County to other cities on the West Coast, Wehunt said.  </P></p>

Qiao said he was satisfied with the results of his visit to  Austria in a message sent to Heinz Fischer, president of the  National Assembly of Austria, after his departure from Vienna.    During the visit, he said he had exchanged in depth views  with Fischer and other Austrian leaders on bilateral relations  and international issues and found much in common, which would  promote mutual understanding, cooperation and friendship.    "I am sure that with concerted efforts the Sino-Austrian  relationship will be further developed," he said.    Fischer said goodbye to Qiao at Austria's official  guesthouse  and then saw the party off at the airport.    Also seeing them off at the airport was China's Ambassador  to  Austria Hu Benyao, the Chinese representative to the United  Nations and other international organizations in Vienna Chen  Shiqiu, and the Austrian Ambassador to China Dietrich Bukowski.    Before he arrived here on January 26, Qiao had visited  Germany and Switzerland.</p>

The safety limit is being changed to reflect the actual analytical safety limit calculated by General Electric.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change in the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level setpoint is supported by a Unit 3 specific setpoint calculation that has been performed in accordance with the methodology endorsed by Regulatory Guide 1.105, Instrument Setpoints for Safety Related Systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part C:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The addition or correction of Unit 2 instrument identifiers is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part D:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The change in Unit 2 reactor high water level and RCIC instrumentation functional test descriptions reflects the equipment currently installed and the functional tests currently being performed. The changes in calibration frequencies are being made to reflect Unit 2 specific setpoint calculations. These calculations have been performed in accordance with the methodology endorsed by Regulatory Guide 1.105. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part E:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The changes in Units 1, 2, and 3 calibration frequency for the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, is being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. The specified minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required, remarks, functional test, and instrument check reflect current operational requirements. The setpoint calculations have been performed in accordance with the methodology endorsed by Regulatory Guide 1.105. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part F:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed correction of the capitalization of terms in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling and capitalization of other words on the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pages is also administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama 35611.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 400 West Summit Hill Drive, ET 11H, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Frederick J.

These five parts are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. For the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3, improve operating flexibility by expanding the allowable operating domain. This expansion is accomplished by revising the equations for the flow-biased Average Power Range Monitor (APRM) flux scram trip setting and the APRM rod block trip setting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Revises the Rod Block Monitor (RBM) limiting conditions for operation (LCOs) to require two RBM channels to be operable if the plant is operating with low thermal margins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Miscellaneous editorial changes to the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 technical specifications (TS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Revises the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 TS to delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Revises the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 TS to relocate the specific equations for the APRM rod block and RBM upscale setpoint equations from the TS to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

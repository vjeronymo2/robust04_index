			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (4): Shift away from US continues - The future of futures trading Ten years ago, when 95 per cent of the world's futures trading occurred in the US and London's Liffe was considered an 'emerging market', Chicago's futures visionaries believed the route to global expansion was through electronic connections. Their vision of a single global after-hours trading system anchored and governed in Chicago, uniting a confederation of trading countries across time zones, has not materialised. Instead, a host of competing futures exchanges have blossomed across Europe and Asia, and continue to emerge in economies as diverse as China, South Africa and Peru. Last year, for the first time, more futures contracts traded abroad than in the US. This year, as the world's top 10 ten futures exchanges again topple volume records, the geographic shift in market share away from the US continues. Futures Industry Association data show that for the first nine months of this year, US futures and options exchanges had a cumulative volume of 498.2m contracts, while the rest of the world combined had traded 594.8m during the same period. Listed derivatives trading outside the US is growing at a rate of 54.8 per cent this year, compared to the US growth rate of 28 per cent. On a percentage basis, the biggest gainers in are exchanges that have been in existence for fewer than five years. Surprisingly, despite the proliferation, relatively few alliances have been forged between futures exchanges. The robust growth in derivatives trading has allowed each exchange to develop independently, while demand for futures products outside domestic time zones has proved lighter than imagined. Reuters' costly experiment with a global electronic trading network, Globex, has demonstrated that day-to-day demand for after-hours access to financial futures contracts is meagre. However, such systems are still invaluable because they provide escape routes during times of crisis. Futures' industry experts say that just knowing contracts can be exited after regular business hours gives traders a kind of insurance policy that significantly reduces market, credit, and political risk. Grand visions for Globex have fizzled out, with only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and France's Matif still contributing to the system. However, other sorts of bilateral co-operations are being developed, and during the next decade may evolve into powerful trading blocs. The future of futures trading, it appears, may follow the example of the CME's 10-year-old mutual offset agreement with Singapore, rather than the Globex model. The CME/Simex arrangement allows financial contracts, such as the CME's Eurodollar futures and options, to trade interchangeably in Chicago and Singapore. The newest cross-exchange futures co-operation is Matif's link with Germany's DTB. Matif's liquid contracts and DTB's excellent technology have the potential, over time, to create a formidable alliance, and give Matif an after-hours alternative to Globex, should Reuters discontinue that project. Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif's chairman, has said he will also consider joint ventures with Europe's smaller, fast-growing exchanges in Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. However, building such links is a treacherous business, since they require co-operating exchanges to put aside competitive differences and harmonise rules that can differ dramatically from country to country. Loose electronic links that allow exchanges to market into different time zones are forming for two specific products: government bond futures and energy derivatives. The Chicago Board of Trade, London's Liffe, and the Sydney Futures Exchange are examining the technological feasibility of linking their existing after-hours computers so their respective government securities products could be available electronically to traders at the partner exchanges. Along a similar vein, the Sydney Futures Exchange recently agreed to list its energy products on Access, the after-hours computer trading system operated by the New York Mercantile Exchange. Unlike Matif, Liffe sees its expansion opportunities outside Europe. It is in talks with Simex to distribute its eurodeutschemark futures contract, is exploring co-operative arrangements with Tokyo's Tiffe for a euroyen product, and has an agreement with the Tokyo Stock Exchange where Tokyo's opening price is used to settle Liffe's Japanese Government Bond contract. These talks, and those Liffe is conducting with the CBOT, are in such preliminary stages, however, that results are difficult to predict. A secondary force, the trend toward international harmonisation of regulations governing futures trading and co-operation between regulatory agencies worldwide, is smoothing the way for these sorts of links This trend was set in motion during the early days of Globex development, and continues as world futures trading expands. While potential links between various futures exchanges are interesting for competitive reasons, they are merely a sideshow to the main event. Most of the world's futures are traded in open outcry during regular business hours. The world's four largest futures exchanges - the CBOT, the CME, Liffe, and Matif - are all riding the crest of an interest rate derivatives boom that has brought unprecedented growth to their trading floors. It now appears that boom is levelling out, with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association reporting a slowdown in the past 12 months, particularly in US dollar-denominated transactions. Although some exchanges still grumble that the over-the-counter markets are stealing business, most now recognise that the bank markets are their best customers. The CME, a prime example, has seen volume double in the past five years, and seat values rise to near Dollars 1m, primarily because its eurodollar pits provide a hedging haven for off-exchange interest rate derivatives transactions. Growth in the contract ramped higher this year on volatility generated by Federal Reserve credit tightening. Eurodollar futures and options during the first nine months of this year comprised 64.7 per cent of the CME's total volume, compared with 45 per cent in 1989. While the CME's business shows no signs of slackening, its future is unusually vulnerable to a slump in the bank swaps market. CME competitors such as Liffe have more diversified product portfolios which make them less dependent on the long-term fortunes of a single product. However, even those exchanges will have to cope with a rapid maturation of the markets that underpin their products and a consequent flattening in their growth curves. The only futures exchanges that have not shared equally in the swirling success of derivatives this year are those devoted primarily to physical commodities. Although money managers have rediscovered commodities as an asset class, their effect on exchange volume has been spotty - New York orange juice and coffee futures, for example, have thrived as a result of Wall Street's recent attention, while some other commodities have escaped notice. To strengthen their positions, a number of commodity exchanges have quietly consolidated. The largest of these consolidations was in New York, where the Comex merged with the Nymex to create the biggest commodity exchange in the world. Equally significant has been the gradual combination of Japan's broadly-fragmented physical exchange markets. In Europe, China, and Russia, new exchanges are developing to help manage risk in agricultural commodities that have recently been released from centrally-planned pricing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       TOP 10 DERIVATIVES EXCHAGES             (ranked by futures and options contract volume)*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank   Exchange               Jan-Sept 1994   Jan-Sept 1993   % change  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1      CBOT (Chicago)            171.1m          131.2m          30 2      CME (Chicago)             153.0m          110.3m          38 3      Liffe (London)            118.3m           68.8m          72 4      CBOE (Chicago)             82.6m           61.7m          34 5      Matif (Paris)              76.3m           53.6m          42 6      BM&amp;F (Brazil)              70.6m           39.1m          80 7      Nymex (New York)**         60.2m           54.8m          10 8      DTB (German)               39.3m           22.6m          74 9      LME (London)               34.2m           25.3m          35 10     Tiffe (Tokyo)              29.6m           16.7m          77  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Volume of options traded on individual securities is not included. **Nymex volumes are Nymex and Comex combined, for both years  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Futures Industry Association, Washington  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

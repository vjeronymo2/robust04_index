			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Rate plea as 120 Jaguar jobs go A FURTHER 120 jobs are to be cut by Jaguar, Ford's luxury car division, on top of 700 announced last month. The intended cuts were disclosed yesterday by Mr Nick Scheele, Jaguar's chairman and chief executive, who also called for further interest rate reductions to stimulate the UK economy. Mr Scheele said:'The current rate is still too high.' He forecast that Jaguar's total sales this year would be unchanged at about 25,000 units. Sales in the first half of this year declined further from year-ago levels, to 11,900 from 12,900, but Mr Scheele said he expected a minor strengthening, partly due to sterling's effective devaluation. Only Jaguar's salaried staff will be affected by the latest cuts. They will bring Jaguar's total employment down to just over 7,100, compared with 12,100 in 1990 and slightly more than 8,000 at the end of last year. Last month's reductions mainly affected production workers, as Jaguar trimmed output plans to make only 23,000 cars this year, compared with an earlier forecast for the year of 27,000. The new figure is less than half the output level of the late 1980s. Renault Truck Industries, the French vehicle group's loss-making UK commercial vehicles subsidiary, announced that it was cutting 35 of the remaining 517 jobs at its manufacturing plant in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. The company blamed the severely depressed state of the UK truck market for the job losses, most of which are expected to be compulsory.</p>

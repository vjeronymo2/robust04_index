			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] urged North Korea to begin implementing its  recent agreement to permit IAEA inspection of seven declared  nuclear sites at the close of a board of governors' meeting here  on Wednesday.    The UN nuclear watchdog warned that if Pyongyang fails to  issue entry visas to IAEA inspectors by month's end, the  director-general will call a special board meeting to discuss  the issue.    North Korean Counselor Yun Ho-chin said his government had  offered March 1 as the date for IAEA inspectors to arrive in  Pyongyang at a working-level meeting with the United States in  New York on Tuesday.    The IAEA's 35-member board of governors ended its first  regular meeting of 1994 here amid concerns about North Korea's  delay in issuing visas for IAEA inspectors, releasing a  statement calling on Pyongyang to follow up on its decision to  allow IAEA inspections, including issuing the visas.    Board Chairman Ronald Walker said it had asked  Director-General Hans Blix to immediately convene an  extraordinary board meeting "in the absence of satisfactory  developments in connection with the inspection, notably if a  firm, early date for the start of the inspection had not been  settled by the end of this month."    A U.S. delegate said that in order for the third round of  high-level U.S.-North Korea talks to take place, Pyongyang must  meet all IAEA inspection requirements, adding that an  extraordinary board meeting would likely resolve to turn over  the issue to the UN Security Council.    Over 40 national delegates spoke during the two-day meeting,  many of them criticizing North Korea for failing to issue visas  to IAEA inspectors by the final day. The IAEA moved the North  Korean issue from the first-day agenda to the second day, hoping  that Pyongyang would issue the visas by then.    Not only the West but also pro-North Korea nations, such as  Cuba and Syria, have charged Pyongyang with trying to resolve  the nuclear issue outside the IAEA, linking the matter to  improving relations with the United States, IAEA sources said.    Speaking at the meeting, North Korean delegate Yun warned  that if the IAEA continued to apply "unreasonable pressure" on  North Korea, it would invite "grave results, including  cancellation of the decision to suspend withdrawal from the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." But Yun, disclosing his  government had offered March 1 as the date for IAEA inspectors  to arrive in Pyongyang at the meeting with the U.S. Government  in New York on Tuesday, said visas would be issued on Thursday  at the earliest, depending on the results of another North  Korea-U.S. contact in New York on Wednesday.    Noting that Pyongyang must still negotiate the U.S. demand  for an exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea  as a condition for further high-level North Korea-U.S. talks,  the North Korean delegate warned his government would reconsider  its decision to accept IAEA inspections if a special IAEA board  of governors meeting was held.    The meeting adopted a resolution urging North Korea to  implement its Feb. 15 agreement to allow IAEA inspections of its  declared nuclear facilities and meet all obligations of the  nuclear safeguards pact, including permission to inspect  undeclared nuclear sites.</p>

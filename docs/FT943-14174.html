			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thai group seeks 7-11 franchise for China Charoen Pokphand (CP), the Thai multinational that is one of the largest foreign investors in China, said yesterday it was bidding for the right to establish a network of Seven-Eleven convenience stores in China. CP group has run the Seven-Eleven franchise in Thailand since 1989, and now controls a network of 320 stores. The Seven-Eleven name belongs to Southland of the US, which is in turn owned by Japan's Ito-Yokado. CP said it was submitting a bid to Southland for the franchises in various zones of China. Bids must be in by the end of September. CP's likely rivals in the bidding include the Seven-Eleven franchise-holders for Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively Dairy Farm and the President group. Dairy Farm, the food retailing side of Jardine Matheson, already has a franchise for Guangdong province in southern China, and has set up several Seven-Eleven shops in Shenzen. Of the new China zones on offer, Shanghai is regarded by retailers as one of the most promising. Southland is also considering introducing the Seven-Eleven name in Indonesia, CP executives say. Asians are increasingly using modern retail chain stores instead of markets or individual shops. In Thailand alone, CP expects the number of Seven-Eleven outlets to rise from 320 to 400 by the end of this year, to 500 next year, and to 1,000 by 1997. CP also runs Makro cash-and-carry superstores in Thailand in a joint venture with SHV of the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Dunkin' Donuts (Thailand) said it planned to invest Dollars 3m in Vietnam over the next two years. It has just been appointed priority franchisee for the country by Dunkin' Donuts of the US. Siam Commercial Bank says it has received approval from the Thai central bank to link up with the CP group to open a joint-venture bank in Hanoi, Vietnam, AP-DJ reports from Bangkok.</p>

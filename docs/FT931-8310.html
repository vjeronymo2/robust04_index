			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guttman declines to step down as Nymex head MR Z Lou Guttman, who on Wednesday afternoon received notice from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that he was subject to serious trade violation charges, became further embattled on Thursday when the leadership of the New York Mercantile Exchange asked him to step down as chairman. Mr Guttman, who has maintained his innocence in the trading case, refused to relinquish the chair. 'Mr Guttman respectfully declined to resign, stating that this issue should be decided by the membership, rather than the board,' said a statement issued by the exchange on Thursday morning. Directors of the Nymex, the world's largest energy market, will meet again to consider if they should suspend Mr Guttman under an obscure clause in the rulebook. A board vote to suspend would have to be ratified by a vote of the entire membership. With many members sympathetic to Mr Guttman's plight, the board could face a membership defeat if it pushed the issue, one exchange official noted. Mr Guttman was charged with pre-arranged trading and other market violations in connection with trades in options on sugar futures during 1989. The CFTC civil complaint, which does not entail charges of fraud, says that Mr Harold Magid, Mr Guttman's former partner, executed the allegedly questionable trades for their joint account, but that Mr Guttman still maintained responsibility for the transactions.</p>

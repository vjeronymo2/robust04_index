The Seoul High Public Prosecutor's Office  sentenced former Navy Chief of the General Staff Kim Chol-u to  three years' imprisonment, four years' stay of execution and a  300-million won fine.    Kim was sentenced to six years in prison at the first trial.  He was charged with receiving money from an arms dealer in  connection with the Navy's destroyer purchase project.    The former commander of the Marine Corps, Cho Ki-yop, was  sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment, three  years' stay of execution and a 60-million won fine. He was  sentenced to three years in jail at the first trial.    Another former Navy Chief of the General Staff, Kim  Chong-ho,  was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a 373-million won  fine. He received a six-year prison term at the first trial.    The judges said, "the defendants admit they received money,  though denying the money had some connection with the promotion  of military officers. But we feel the money has some connection  with the promotions. We are reducing their terms of  imprisonment because they appeared before the prosecution  voluntarily before the prosecutor's summons."    Meanwhile, the head of Haksan Co., Chong Ui-sung, who was  charged with giving bribes to Kim Chol-u, was sentenced to one  year and six months' imprisonment and three years' stay of  execution.</p>

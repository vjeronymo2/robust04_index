			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle The market has never been sure how to value Tate &amp; Lyle. A string of canny deals and a spell of rigorous management in the 1980s almost convinced it that Tate's commodity sweetener businesses deserved a premium rating. But Tate's misfortunes in the US last year dispelled that delusion. The shares have bounced since but now seem merely to be tracking the dull food sector. Tate's 20 per cent interim profits increase hints that a reassessment of its rating may be due. But once currency translation gains and the benefits of the green pound's devaluation are stripped out, the underlying earnings progress is lacklustre. The trouble is that it may not get much easier from here. Despite steadily improving cash flow, gearing will still be about 80 per cent at the year end, inhibiting debt-funded expansion. Paper may be issued. But since food assets in developed countries generally command higher multiples than Tate, that would threaten earnings dilution. Tate may therefore focus on developing countries, where assets are cheaper. That, however, will only raise questions about the quality of earnings, further impeding a rerating. Tate is not alone among UK food manufacturers in confronting this growth conundrum; it is, though, experiencing the pressure more acutely than most.</p>

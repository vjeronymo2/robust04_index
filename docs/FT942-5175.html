			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Seeking funds to open window of opportunity  -Alan Cane considers the flotation of VideoLogic The demerger and flotation of VideoLogic, the electronics company developing some key components of the coming multimedia revolution, is expected to be announced this week. Analysts believe the company could be capitalised at up to Pounds 70m. The company is a subsidiary of Avesco, a broadcast equipment and services group whose trading performance has been adversely affected by VideoLogic's voracious appetite for research and development funds. It bought the company in 1989 for about Pounds 10m on the rationale that the companies' activities were complementary. For the six months to September 30 Avesco incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.32m and at the time of reporting the figures announced a placement to raise about Pounds 5m, chiefly to fund VideoLogic's multimedia research. VideoLogic incurred a loss of Pounds 2.34m on sales of Pounds 4.56m in the same period. This week's flotation, analysts estimate, should raise up to Pounds 25m of new money, much of which will go to repay debt to Avesco. Up to Pounds 15m, however, should be available as much needed working capital. The flotation, likely to take the form of a preference application to existing shareholders coupled with an open offer, is eagerly awaited both by Avesco shareholders and VideoLogic's senior management. Mr Derek Maclaren, VideoLogic's chairman, said: 'We have been investing heavily for the past two years to exploit a window of opportunity in multimedia which is just beginning to open. 'Now we need public money to take advantage of the opportunity. Avesco cannot afford it. It bought a Formula One stable: very racy and very expensive.' Industry analysts believe a properly funded VideoLogic would be in pole position to make an impact in multimedia, the delivery of media services of all kinds through a single interactive channel to home or office. Other forces in the industry agree. VideoLogic has either joint ventures or alliances with International Business Machines, British Telecommunications, Motorola and Matrox. The company's strategy is based on the proposition that the receiver for multimedia services, essentially the screen on which information will be displayed, will be the personal computer rather than the television. An essential part of multi-media, however, is the ability to handle full motion video and here personal computers are deficient. Video clips in a typical multimedia programme play in a window the size of a postage stamp. VideoLogic's microchips and printed circuit boards can give the computer the ability to display full screen, full motion video. The potential market is very large. Dataquest, the US market consultancy, estimates the global installed base of multimedia personal computers will grow from 7m last year to 19m in 1995. Suggestions that the company has at least a six month lead over its competitors are given credibility by the fact that the company's earlier video product, the DVA400, led the world in combining flexibility with low cost. VideoLogic's products are sold to other manufacturers to build into their systems, to corporate customers and, through retailers, to the public. Warburgs, VideoLogic's adviser, is predicting operating profits of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 50m to Pounds 90m in 1995-96.</p>

Independence of South Korea and the independent  reunification  of the country, this is the way for the complete realization of  national independence in our country.    The destiny of our nation is closely linked with national  reunification.    The reunification of our country is not a matter of ideology  and system but a matter of national character as the matter of  putting an end to the domination and interference of outside  forces, completely realizing the sovereignty of the Korean  nation and achieving national unity.    The entire compatriots at home and abroad should unite with  one will to defend the independence of the country and the  nation with their lives, linking their destiny with the destiny  of the motherland and the nation.    Our fellow countrymen, who have lived for over 5,000 years  as  a homogeneous nation with tan gun as its father, are able to  build a united state of the whole nation by means of  confederation that can promote coexistence and co-prosperity,  leaving the present two systems and two governments in the North  and the South intact if they pool their wisdom and strength,  giving precedence to national ideal.    The entire compatriots in the North and the South and abroad  should unite as one, transcending the differences of idea and  ideal, political views and religious belief under the banner of  the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation  and vigorously struggle to found a united state of the whole  nation by means of confederation.</p>

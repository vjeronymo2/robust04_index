			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Appleyard tumbles to Pounds 1.81m APPLEYARD GROUP, the motor distributor, dipped into reserves to pay a maintained and uncovered dividend despite a 70 per cent tumble to Pounds 1.81m in pre-tax profits for 1991. Mr Paul Chambers, finance director, said the group had held the 5.2p final - which maintains the total at 7.8p - in light of the 'medium term prospects for the industry and the company . . . Everything is in good shape, the only thing we are lacking is volume.' However, trading continued to be difficult with any benefits from changes in car tax still some way off. 'People are waiting until the election is out of the way,' he said. The group suffered an unusually severe second half, recording profits of just Pounds 294,000 in the second six months. Ian Skelly, the Audi/VW dealer purchased in 1989, had suffered supply problems, and sharply lower sales. Skelly broke even in the year, said Mr Chambers. Group turnover fell 18 per cent to Pounds 390m. A net exceptional gain of Pounds 1.1m eased the decline in operating profits which fell from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 5.8m. Mr Chambers said the group had taken action to cut costs and had managed to maintain car margins. Sales of new cars had fallen by about 21 per cent and of used cars by 12 per cent. Commercial vehicle sales declined by 30 per cent. Appleyard sold its remaining two Ford franchises for Pounds 2m, a book loss of Pounds 300,000. The remaining 41 dealerships were all in good shape, he said. The group had also taken its first steps towards multi-franchising by moving one of its new Nissan dealerships to a Skelly site. This would help to recover some of the fixed costs of the large site, despite the downturn in sales. Net debt was reduced from Pounds 16m to Pounds 14m, although gearing remained unchanged at 46 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 8.7p to 2.5p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yuelong (3769 1471 7893)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- Since its inception a  year ago, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association, the  country's first local copyright protection organization, has  achieved tremendous success in actively protecting the  legitimate rights and interests of copyright holders, in  extensively publicizing and popularizing the Copyright Law, and  in encouraging people in all sectors of society to participate  in copyright management and protection.    Since its founding, the Beijing Copyright Protection  Association has focused on publicizing and popularizing the  Copyright Law. In March 1993, the association organized  training on the "Universal Copyright Convention and copyright  management" for people in charge of copyright-related work from  more than 60 publishing houses and press offices in Beijing,  thus enabling them to gain a preliminary knowledge and  understanding of the Universal Copyright Convention, and thus  laying a fairly sound foundation for copyright management organs  to exercise their duties in accordance with the law. The  Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has organized many  forums regarding the Copyright Law for artists and renowned  writers in Beijing, and it has launched publicity and  consultation services regarding the Copyright Law in Beijing's  main streets and public places. This has facilitated Beijing's  enforcement of the Copyright Law.    The Beijing Copyright Protection Association has provided  services for copyright protection and has carried out  explorations and experiments in copyright agency services. Last  September, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association and the  Beijing Copyright Bureau held the first trade fair on book  manuscripts, thus serving as a bridge between writers and  publishers. Nine publishing agreements and 30 letters of intent  on publishing were concluded, and approximately 300,000 yuan  worth of business was conducted. The fair won universal acclaim  from writers and publishers. The Beijing Copyright Protection  Association also has actively investigated piracy and other  infringements on behalf of copyright holders. In 1993, the  association sent its members to Heilongjiang Province, Hebei  Province, Tianjin municipality, and Shanxi Province to  investigate the piracy of "The Gourd Brothers," a book published  by the China Film Press. It helped the publishers recoup part  of their economic losses.    The Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has made  active efforts to mediate copyright disputes. A publishing  house in Beijing had a dispute with the heir of an author, and  the dispute remained unresolved for several years. Last year,  the Beijing Copyright Protection Association mediated the  dispute at the request of both parties and quickly solved it.  According to the feedback of many publishers and writers in  Beijing municipality, the civilian mediation process employed by  the Beijing Copyright Protection Association regarding copyright  disputes is simple, is unlikely to provoke hard feelings, and is  economically acceptable.    After more than a year of exploration and practice, the  Beijing Copyright Protection Association has inducted most of  the publishers and a number of writers in the Beijing area,  thereby initially installing a collective management mechanism  for copyright management in the Beijing area.</p>

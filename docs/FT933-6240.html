			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: There is life after Bull's Blood - Jancis Robinson considers the politics of Hungarian viticulture IN EVERY large tasting of a supermarket or off-licence's wine range this year, I have been surprised by the value offered by Hungarian wines in the heavily populated Pounds 2.50 to Pounds 3.50 per bottle bracket. And, once the country's privatisation ferment has settled, we should see an even more interesting range of fiery whites and clean, fruity reds. The pioneer, as usual, was Bordeaux-based, Australian-trained Hugh Ryman, whose response to the frost damage to France's 1991 crop was to install himself in a well-equipped but under-utilised winery in Gyongyos, east of Budapest, and vinify lorryloads of bargain Sauvignon and Chardonnay grapes. Gyongyos Estate wines, Pounds 3.35 from Sainsbury's and Pounds 3.39 from Thresher, are still at the cutting edge of Hungary's white wine output - although its 1992 Semillon has been commercially hampered by the fact that the Hungarians forgot to register Semillon as an approved Hungarian variety in Brussels. Two colourful rival importers are at the heart of extracting wines to suit British palates from Hungary's excitingly varied but under-achieving vineyards. Both of them laugh much more than seems appropriate in view of the confused state of Hungarian wine production, which has suffered from a lack of motivation and is now suffering from the disappearance of its old Comecon markets. About half of all Hungarian wine exports to Britain are imported by Eva Keresztury and her associates, who include Ryman. 'I'm a strange creature,' admits this jolly Hungarian. 'I came to England as decoration when my husband came to work in the City for one of those strange foreign trading organisations.' Drawn in to the Hungarian wine business by the need for translators, she now runs Interconsult, a strange foreign trading organisation of her own, from her dining room in Barnes, south west London, and shepherds inceasing numbers of professional wine buyers around wineries and vineyards in the throes of privatisation. 'One of the most pleasurable trips of my life was soon after I started in 1991 when I took the two Safeway buyers around the wineries. What a revelation] The winemakers blushed and had tears in their eyes when they made blends that pleased them. We worked 18 hours a day and never seemed to sleep.' Her determination to sort the wheat from the chaff, and make the most of some very exciting fruit, which can yield 'brilliant' wine only if handled properly, has led her on one occasion to buy and install her own bottling line. She is now directing a team of antipodean and local winemakers in various temporary locations. It all sounds suitably Romany. Hemant Kotecha, of Manchester, is her main competitor in exposing the best of Hungary to western palates. A Ugandan Asian, he took a master's degree in crop control at Reading before immersing himself in business. He went to Hungary in 1989 looking for general commercial opportunities, and wine was one of the commodities offered. He too started up his company, Myliko, in 1991 and applied antipodean technology to a well-equipped Balaton winery, in this case to produce the Chapel Hill range of white international varietals at Pounds 2.99. The Chardonnay, at Sainsbury's, is a snip; the Rhine Riesling, at Victoria Wine, is racily fruity (although not dry); only the overripe Sauvignon disappoints. Safeway, particularly open to suggestion from the east, has the most genuinely interesting selection of Hungarian wines, which reflects its genuine interest in what distinguishes the country and its very different wine regions. Oddbins has the fine Volcanic Hills range. Its moody label was designed for Eva's company by a 19-year-old who has never left Hungary. The eerily Alsace-like Pinot Gris 1992 at Pounds 3.49 is my favourite, and I can reluctantly understand why they did not use the grape's Hungarian name, Szurkebarat. Some of the crispest, liveliest red wines selling anywhere at Pounds 2.99 are Eva's Villanyi Hills Cabernet Sauvignon and, even fruitier, Merlot, stocked by Thresher, Bottoms Up and Wine Rack - and miles better than these shops' Hungarian whites at the same price. The Tuscan firm, Antinori, has invested in the Bataapati estate in the country's south west and the lively red Kekfrankos and spicy white Zoldveltelini are available at about Pounds 4.50 from Great Northern Wines of Leeds. Other more expensive wines are, inevitably, in the trans-Danubian pipeline, although I have yet to be thrilled by them. It is heartening to note, however, that both major importers are planning to introduce some of Hungary's rich gene bank of indigenous vine varieties. Look out for 1993 Harslevelu. And what of Hungary's most famous wine, the legendary rich, deliberately sherrified golden Tokay? Do not ask. A bevy of international wine companies is trying to establish a firm foothold in this historic region, but they are being comprehensively hamstrung by local landowners and state officials.</p>

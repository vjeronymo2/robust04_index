			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: General Accident No bad news is suddenly good news for investors in UK composite insurance companies. That at any rate seems to be the shallow thinking behind yesterday's 4 per cent jump in the General Accident share price after the company announced pre-tax losses, a final dividend and shareholders' funds bang in line with expectations. Relief after Royal is understandable, and income funds are no doubt grateful for a yield more than 50 per cent higher than the market average. But with the shares still trading at a hefty premium to estimated net assets it is hard to summon up much enthusiasm on a long term view. Take last year's dreadful UK underwriting results, for instance. There may be some evidence of an improvement in the last quarter, and just a hint of highly prudent reserving, but the overall 50 per cent deterioration is pretty bleak given GA's relatively small mortgage guarantee exposure and the comparison with a storm-tossed 1990. Rate increases will help repair some of the damage to the motor account - but a 34 per cent fall in fourth quarter premiums for this type of business highlights the strategic dilemma of taking the pricing solution too far. As with most of its competitors, the over-riding question about GA is whether it can sustain its dividend payout. Royal has already shown what can happen when a company runs out of balance sheet fat. While GA is not in the danger zone yet, it does not take much imagination - another Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m of losses this year and a reversal in the US dollar exchange rate or the UK stock market - to see the solvency margin down in the low 30s. GA, rightly or wrongly, will do its damnedest to pay, but there are too many unknowns to be comfortable at this stage.</p>

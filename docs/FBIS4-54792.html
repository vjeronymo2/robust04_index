			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 4 (CTK) -- Slovakia's ex-Premier  Vladimir Meciar said today that "parliament was in the state of  profound moral and political crisis and it will not probably  last until the September elections." Addressing some three  thousands of the supporters of his Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS), Meciar criticised the parliament, the  government of his successor Jozef Moravcik (Democratic Union of  Slovakia, DEUS), President Michal Kovac as well as journalists,  particularly for their allegation that he was expecting a baby  with the former director of his secretariat, Anna Nagyova.    Meciar said he was going to deal with existing problems  "even  in the street" because the media were not giving enough space to  the present opposition.    He accused his former party fellow, now Deputy Premier Roman  Kovac, of embezzling five million dollars, but did not  elaborate. The affair allegedly marked the beginning of their  conflicts which resulted in Kovac's departure from the HZDS at  the beginning of the year. This fact motivated the motion of  no-confidence in Kovac proposed by the present opposition in  parliament last week. The motion is to deal with it in the near  future, but no exact date has been announced yet.    Meciar also accused Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the  coalition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), of informing  President Bill Clinton in February 1993 of his intention to  revive Czechoslovakia.    Meciar said this step should be preceded by a merger between  the KDH and Democratic Left Party (SDL, former communists) and  the disintegration of the HZDS. The next HZDS meeting is  planned on June 1. Meciar's supporters want to fill the  8,000-seat Winter Stadium.</p>

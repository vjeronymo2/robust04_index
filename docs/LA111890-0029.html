			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURN IN, TUNE ON, SPEAK OUT;  </P> <P> HERE ARE RESPONSES TO THE OCT. 28 QUESTION: WHAT OLD SHOWS SHOULD BE REMADE?  </P> <P> The show I would most like to see remade is "Hawaii Five-0." It was a  high-quality police drama that didn't rely on car chases and half-dressed women  instead of a solid plot. The writing was of consistently high quality and the  actors fit their parts well, particularly Jack Lord as supercop Steve  McGarrett.  </P> <P> In fact, it could be remade with Lord continuing to play McGarrett as the  governor of Hawaii.  </P> <P> Kathy Harter, North Hollywood  </P> <P> In answer to your question about what old shows should be remade, I think one  should be "Lost In Space" and another should be "The Fugitive."  </P> <P> Crystal Moore, Thousand Oaks  </P> <P> I'd love to see someone remake "The Fugitive." There was something about the  story that kept myself, and I'll bet a lot of other people, interested in  following the adventures of Dr. Richard Kimble played by the late David  Janssen.  </P> <P> J.D. Jones, Simi Valley  </P> <P> As a fan of the series "Route 66S and George Maharis, I would like to see that  show remade with Maharis and Martin Milner. It was outstanding in 1960 and  would be as well in 1990.  </P> <P> Laurie Koff, Encino  </P> <P> With interest in extraterrestrials and UFOs soaring, it is time to bring back  "The Invaders," the well-executed series from 1967 that focused on a young  architect's quest to thwart an alien takeover of the world. Roy Thinnes, the  star of that series, could take up where he left off, combatting the invasion.  </P> <P> Dr. Franklin R. Ruehl, Glendale  </P> <P> I feel that shows like "Gilligan's Island," "I Dream of Jeannie," "Bewitched"  and "Magnum, P.I." should be remade because of their style, actors and  originality.  </P> <P> Sally Martindale, Newport Beach  </P> <P> I would like to see a "Playhouse 90S series-and I don't mean Pee Wee's,  although my kids love that- where television plays could be presented, each of  them complete and individual, an hour long, like the early days of television.  </P> <P> Also, it would be refreshing to have a good variety show on once a week on a  network where children's choruses, magicians, singers and other seldom-seen  entertainers could perform.  </P> <P> Kitty Wills, Van Nuys  </P> <P> My answer to the show that should be remade is "Palmerstown, U.S.A." If remade,  all of the original cast should be hired, if possible. The story and series is  set in Palmerstown, Tenn., in 1935 and presents a view of life in a small town  where whites and blacks co-exist for economic survival.  </P> <P> W.A. Scott, La Canada  </P> <P> I would like to see a classy remake of "Bewitched," along the same lines as  "Star Trek: The Next Generation." What's happened through the years to the  Stevens family? I'd love to see Whoopie Goldberg make a guest appearance as a  nymph. Or Shirley MacLaine as a wacky aunt. How about Jack Nicholson as a  replacement for Uncle Arthur? No one could replace Agnes Moorehead as the  prank-playing mother (Endora). But someone along those lines could bring some  new blood to the show.  </P> <P> Mac McCoy, Pasadena  </P></p>

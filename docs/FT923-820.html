			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: The music of innocence violated - Max Loppert admires this thought-provoking biography of Benjamin Britten BENJAMIN BRITTEN: A BIOGRAPHY by Humphrey Carpenter Faber Pounds 20, 680 pages NOT MANY composer biographies generate the amount of advance publicity already notched up by this one. Humphrey Carpenter's Benjamin Britten shows every likelihood of becoming that exceeding rarity, the bestseller from the world of 'serious' music. The obvious reason, crudely put, is that it is a beans-spiller and its chosen subject is full of beans. This is the first full-scale Britten biography. More to the point, it is the first to explore realms previously familiar only to various coteries and interest-groups in the music world (and then mainly in the form of rumour and gossip). What Carpenter has done is to probe, with a well-trained biographer's microscope, into areas previously largely unexamined: the full picture of childhood and youth (always publicly depicted by Britten as idyllically happy); the affairs; the many examples of cruelty to friends and colleagues (often prompted by Peter Pears, lifelong muse and partner, who emerges as a distinctly equivocal figure); the anxieties and morbid sensitivities; the possible biographical parallels for and sources of the artistic obsessions. If that were all he had done, though, his book would rate no higher than, say, Joan Peyser's portraits of Boulez and Bernstein - assiduous in muckraking concerns, of very limited insight into the man-as-great-artist, and therefore unputdownable and distasteful in equal measure. It is by no means all Carpenter has done; and his Britten rates infinitely higher. Indeed, it must be judged one of the year's, if not the decade's, most completely engrossing and thought-provoking biographies of any stamp. As readers of his Auden will expect, it is laid out with unfailing lucidity and sense of direction. There is a purpose behind the accumulation of every detail; the author does not indulge in tittle-tattle in the act of asking his thorny questions (many of them, he is at pains to admit, capable of no more than a cautiously hedged answer). Above all, he never forgets that it is because Britten is one of the geniuses of music - and one who developed and triumphed in an often philistine, hostile environment - that the questions arise in the first place. The difficult, irresolvable and yet crucially illuminating links between the life and the art of such a genius make up the central issue at stake in this biography; and Carpenter confronts it with an impressive combination of frankness, determination and taste. The thorniest question is the one that has already gained the book most publicity: was Britten raped by a master at school? And, if so, might this 'provide explanations for the recurrence in his operas of the subject of innocence violated'? It is raised via Eric Crozier, librettist of Herring and Billy Budd, who claims that Britten told him as much; and it is supported by the testimony of Beata Sauerlander, member of the family with whom Britten and Pears resided during much of their wartime American sojourn. Others respond to the matter with extreme scepticism; but the theme it engenders surfaces most fascinatingly in Carpenter's discussions of Budd and Turn of the Screw, in a way that suggests he himself attaches some credence thereto. Like much else that is essentially speculative in the analysis of Britten's psychological makeup, it is at the very least plausibly argued. So are the dominance, at once encouraging and suffocating, of Britten mere (whose alto singing voice one friend from childhood reckons to have been 'fantastically similar' to Pears's tenor) and the shadowy role of Britten pere (who may have been a homosexual and who 'used to send (the young Ben) out to find boys' - this is another piece of fascinating hearsay, offered via Myfanwy Piper, a later Britten librettist). The early chapters are particularly gripping for the glances they afford behind the facade of Lowestoft bourgeois respectability. In its cosiness but also in its tensions and pretensions the Britten household as portrayed here could have been invented by Betjeman, Rattigan and Orton in collaboration. Carpenter is also notably vivid on the years of burgeoning creativity, the lessons with Bridge and Ireland, the like-minded young artists among whom Britten began to spread his wings. He keeps in clear focus the tendencies to form amities amoureuses with boys (early demonstrated, and inevitably dissipated when the boys in question became mature teenagers) and to regress in life - though not in art - to an insulated world of games, nursery food and unruffled domesticity. In this latter respect, the personalities of Auden and Tippett provide gusts of fresh air each time they enter the picture. Auden counts as the earliest of what came to be known, in Aldeburgh parlance, as Britten's 'corpses' - those close associates later cast by him into outer darkness for having committed some offence, frequently slight, for having performed below standard, or simply for having outlived their usefulness. The numbers of these grew in proportion to the success of the Aldeburgh Festival: the already-mentioned Crozier, Lord Harewood, the conductors Mackerras and Del Mar, the singers Jennifer Vyvyan (an especially grisly case) and Robert Tear, and many others. At a certain point I began to regret a degree of over-documentation: too many corpses' tales, perhaps even too many episodes of young boys fondly fancied, pad out the book's later stages. And while I also appreciated the discussion of each of the major works at the psychologically relevant juncture in the narrative, I came to feel that the method of treatment does not always shed light on the purely instrumental works. In the end, a still larger doubt about the book needs to be tackled head-on: the danger it raises (in the words of Donald Mitchell, Britten scholar and executor) of fostering an 'enormous superstructure of speculation' on the basis of juicy but unprovable biographical assertion, and of promoting the belief that such assertion 'provides us with a key to, a readymade (sic) 'explanation' of, the music. It doesn't'. For myself, I think that in Britten's case it is a danger worth risking - partly because in his own lifetime his public image was too hagiographically presented, more because the music is surely strong enough to permit such an angle of scrutiny, but most of all because Carpenter's justness of viewpoint provides its own system of checks and balances.</p>

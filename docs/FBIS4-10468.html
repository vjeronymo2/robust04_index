			<p>BFN     [Text] Chetumal, Mexico, 11 Apr (AFP) -- The spokesman for  Quintana Roo State told AFP on Monday a boat adrift with 83  Cubans on board, which had attempted to arrive in Miami  (Florida), was rescued in Mexican waters and taken to Islas  Mujeres.    The Cubans, 53 men, including three doctors, 16 children,  and  14 women, had sailed from Cuba on 6 April and stopped at (?Grand  Cays) Island for food and fuel.    Nevertheless, once they sailed from the island, the boat (54  meters long) developed a mechanical failure and went adrift  until dawn Sunday when it entered Mexican waters.    On Monday the boat was towed to Islas Mujeres. The 83 Cubans  will remain on board until immigration authorities decide what  to do.    It is estimated this will take three days. During this time  the Cubans will be held on board under detention and will not be  allowed to go ashore.</p>

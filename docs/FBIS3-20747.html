			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josef Stetka: "The Transformation of the Czech </F> Republic Army"]    [Text] At his first meeting with rehabilitated soldiers,  Defense Minister Baudys expressed his regret that the Army does  not have enough money to retain the younger command personnel. I  contradicted the minister and said that there is enough money,  but that it is not being utilized purposefully. I was not alone  in making this argument, so the minister was given a few  specific examples, not only from the Defense Ministry, but also  from the General Staff and the former Western Military Circuit  [ZVO]. It is to his credit that he stopped squandering more pay  on a gentleman (or rather, comrade) who was discharged from the  Army despite stiff resistance from Mr. Pezl [former chief of the  General Staff], resistance motivated by the fact that he was an  "irreplaceable expert" (it could not be otherwise; after all, he  was one of the main organizers of the Zasah and Vlna  operations). Mr. Pezl expressed his opinion of this "expert" in  an interview with editor Grunthalova in TELEGRAF. This comrade  had duties pertaining to a senior officer, duties that in the  Army correspond to the rank of captain, but he received the same  pay as a deputy chief of the General Staff. It is not difficult  to work out who was responsible for this.  <H5>  A Mere 240 Million Korunas </H5>   The minister's response to other disclosures, however, was  not so unequivocal. The objection that new defense systems  compatible with those of NATO are not being purchased for the  Army, but personal Mercedes Benz cars are, was resolved by the  cars being put in the garage for three months. However, they  are now once more cruising along our highways. The minister  also did not respond to the revelation that the former commander  of Armaments and Technical Procurement should have been  responsible for drawing on the authorized budgeted resources for  the ZVO ("Our proposals were not taken into consideration in the  1992 exercise year and, consequently, we consider an evaluation  to be unnecessary bureaucracy"). The issue here involved a  "mere" 240 million korunas and, so that the red tape did not  grip too tight, all the documents were shredded before 9  February 1993. This may be why this enemy of bureaucracy was  appointed ZVO commander.  <H5>  Distinguishable Oil? </H5>   The retirement of various generals and administration  commanders is another example of "purposefully" expended funds.  I will cite one case for all of them. When General Barak  retired, he kept for three whole months--when General Barta was  already in office as his successor--his staff car and a  secretary and used all the means of communication in the  administration. That was mainly so he could increase his  business activity and so that Tesla Pardubice would not cost him  so much. You would think that someone would go back and review  his business trips and find out who had authorized them? Why  should we bother about such petty details since, after all, the  Army does not care about them.    I would also like to mention that the retiring communist  generals purchased from the defunct Warsaw Pact all the supplies  of fuels, aircraft fuel, and lubricants stockpiled in our  military stores--for peanuts. Did Czechoslovakia, as one of the  members of this disintegrating organization, receive an  appropriate amount for these bargain-basement fuels? However,  since none of our government protagonists--including the prime  minister--is familiar with dirty money, it is impossible to  ascertain for what purpose these supplies were purchased. It is  possible to ascertain, however, that they were sold not only to  civilian enterprises, but also back to our Army. It should be  easy to distinguish the 100,000 hectoliters of Warsaw Pact  aircraft petroleum from the 100,000 hectoliters of CSFR Army  aircraft fuel stored in the same tanks--or am I mistaken?  <H5>  What Was Left by the Soviet Army </H5>   It is unnecessary to say too much about the selling of  military exercise areas [VVP] for ludicrous sums or even just  for write-offs. However, at least something will act as an  illustration: The deputy commander of the Military Housing  Administration has carried out such economic regroupments that  even U.S. managers may envy him. Did the commander of the  administration or the chief of the General Staff know about  this? Buildings vacated by the former Soviet Army in VVP  Milovice were sold to Colonel Zbytek (by the way, he is the one  who became famous at the United Agricultural Cooperative  Congress in December 1989 for his demand to use force against  those subverting socialism in the CSSR) for more than 140  million korunas, although it says unequivocally in the  agreements on the withdrawal of Soviet troops that all the real  estate must be offered first to the Czechoslovak state. It is  no longer necessary to mention his cooperation with former  Defense Minister Vacek in the Ralsko Free Trade Zone. He was  promoted to the rank of general for his "services" to the state  and, when he retired, he was given a better appraisal by the  supreme commander than any of those who fought in foreign armies  in World War II. Or, the sale of the exercise ground in Karlovy  Vary, where Colonel Salek--otherwise commander of the Regional  Military Administration in Karlovy Vary--and his son  distinguished themselves by managing to appreciate the value of  one square meter by around 500 percent the next day. How much  did they make, given that it was 100 hectares (of course, it was  not to the Army's benefit)? Who gave them the go-ahead for  this? The ministry's inspection team, led by Colonel Silhan,  did not find anything suspicious about this deal. I do not know  of any case that would have been submitted to the Prosecutor's  Office for investigation--or, God forbid, for  prosecution--during the time that this commander and Minister  Dobrovsky were in office. Why be petty, the new budget will  take care of it.  <H5>  Incompatible Computers </H5>   There are about 1,000 senior officers and civilian personnel  in the General Staff, but there are also more than 1,000  personal and other computers there that were purchased in an  uncoordinated manner (let us exclude the intention) by various  administrations, commanders, and so on. Of course, no one is  capable of putting together a network from these  computers--which, with a few exceptions, are incompatible--to  handle not only command, but also communications logistics for  the General Staff. Thus, the computers have been downgraded to  luxury typewriters worth a cool 50,000 to 100,000 korunas each.  I pointed this out to Mr. Pezl at the meeting with  rehabilitated officers. But to no avail. In fact, the upshot  is that last year--that is, 1993--incompatible computers were  again purchased in an uncoordinated manner for millions of  korunas. I will not publish the exact sum so that I am not  suspected of revealing a military secret, if such economic  management is a military secret. A novice economist may perhaps  be able to work it out.    Apart from this computer shambles, there are X number of  modems (the commander of the Communications Administration can  supply the precise number) in the General Staff, which enable  their addressees to have fax links from their workplaces in the  General Staff to their apartments, businesses, and--of  course--anywhere else. Why observe military secrecy when a  classified or even a strictly classified document can be sent  anywhere by modem, even to the KGB, for instance. However, I  breathed a sigh of relief. I found out that the KGB has been  abolished.  <H5>  Illogical Logistics </H5>   Support units were turned into "logistics" in the name of  transformation, although no one there behaves logically.  Instead of reducing the number of colonels and  lieutenant-colonels and increasing that of the non-commissioned  officer and warrant officer, they have begun to equip the  offices with new furniture and carpets, including these  computers. Illogically, not one new defense system has been  purchased and technical equipment for the Military Police has  been shelved so that it cannot point out this illogicality--or  anything else. The gentlemen at the Defense Ministry and the  General Staff are acting like Marshall Russworth in the  Emperor's Baker--they are buying trinkets and  feathers for their overgrown administrations and departments.  If they think this is the correct way to transform the Army,  they are certainly quite mistaken. We can imagine how they  contribute to the Army's credit in the eyes of the taxpayers.  Probably they do not; otherwise they would not run things like  this.  <H5>  Impatient NATO </H5>   I am aware of how NATO is burning with impatience to take us  into its bosom. An Army that does not know that, if it retains  an intolerable number of senior officers and does not transfer  funds to the lower command levels, it cannot undergo any  transformation, an Army without compatible defense systems, an  Army that cannot stick to its annual budget and must survive to  the detriment of the following year? An Army in which to this  day there are more than 2,000 former political staff, more than  half of whom work in the units and offices dealing with the  training of young people? An Army in which a "university"  education obtained at the Vokovice Sorbonne or at another  Marxist-Leninist-type political college of a similar level is  enough for the rank of colonel? An Army in which not one KGB  agent has been uncovered and that applied to communist generals  to draw up its transformation plan? This transformation plan is  a mockery of a defense doctrine, including the one whose author  is, allegedly, a former chief of the General Staff. An Army  whose senior command is--according to a recent statement by the  defense minister--made up of traitors, because anyone who after  1968 agreed with the Soviet aggression is a traitor. Mr.  Minister, these are not my words, they are your evaluation! You  should draw conclusions from your own statements!  <H5>  The West and Russia </H5>   In 1938 we had one of the better equipped and trained armies  in Europe, an army that could have been one of the decisive  factors in the clash with the "brown plague." Despite this, our  allies did not include us in the anti-Hitler coalition and  peddled us in return for a dubious attempt at preserving the  peace for their own countries. To think that we would be more  attractive for them today is an unforgivable error. Everyone  knows how the elections in Russia have turned out, and I do not  just mean Zhirinovskiy. The "democrats" Yeltsin and Kozyrev  speak just as unequivocally. If the West again needs to make a  concession to preserve the peace for its countries, a new Yalta  will be formulated and we will be surrendered to another  plague--a red one. We recently learned that we should not  submit our request for admission into NATO in Brussels, but in  Moscow. Obviously, will be able to tell the next day whether  Partnership for Peace prevents it.  <H5>  The Tradition of the Minister's Advisers </H5>   It has become one of the traditions of our "post-revolution"  Army that a retiring senior Army functionary acts as an adviser  to the new defense minister. Obviously, he is supposed to  advise him in such a way that it can be passed on that it was  not like this under us. Mr. Vacek was an adviser to Mr.  Dobrovsky and, during this period, he got better at tennis and  swimming and even managed to write his first socialist literary  work--Why I Should Keep Silent. Why would he prefer not to keep  silent? He could still be giving advice today. The minister's  current adviser is Mr. Pezl. What is he advising him? How, at  a time of dire peace, to acquire four general's stars in just  under three years? On the basis of a query made in the Military  Historical Institute, this is a completely unknown phenomenon in  the history of the modern military. Perhaps it was necessary to  increase the Army's prestige in the eyes of the civilian  population. Or, how to maintain the highest possible number of  protagonists of the former regime in senior posts, including  those who took part in the Zasah and Vlna operations? I would  add the Order of Victorious February to his last general's star  for saving those who shared the same ideals as him. Mr. Pezl  often blamed shortcomings on the communists' 40-year reign. Has  he forgotten that he himself played no small role in this  government--before 1968 and again after 1989? It is not,  General Pezl, just the 40 years of communist government; you  have to add to this the three years when you were chief of the  General Staff. You did not resign from the party of the  Bolsheviks, you had to be expelled from it; otherwise you would  probably still be there today. Or, perhaps you are advising the  minister how to discharge the senior officers faced with  screenings and to give them 3,800 korunas per month until they  reach retirement age--and then hire them again at the Defense  Ministry or the General Staff and place them on the 11th pay  scale as civilian employees, who are not subject to screening?  <H5>  How To Make Money Privately on the Ministry's Budget </H5>   In every normally managed entity, an order is placed with an  enterprise that is able to do the requested work or to fill the  order. The work is invoiced after it is completed or partly  completed. Invoicing before completion is only done in  exceptional cases, for example, in filling foreign orders and so  on. Why are things different at the Defense Ministry and the  General Staff? I can cite the specific example of how a former  senior officer gets together with four other people, amasses  100,000 korunas, and registers a shareholding company--the  officer places an order with it for the Army worth 1 million  korunas for delivery and assembly. The newly established  shareholding company buys materials from this million korunas  and invoices them with the work for the Army. A profit is  guaranteed and is divided. How? In a legal procedure, the  shareholding company would have to borrow money, for example,  from a bank and pay the interest out of its profits. I do not  believe that it would be too difficult to find out in how many  cases business was conducted this way in the Army.  <H5>  One Should Respond to the Criticism, Not to the Critic </H5>   This does not make pleasant reading, and I will certainly be  attacked for criticizing too harshly. Unfortunately, this is  far from everything, it is merely the acclaimed tip of the  iceberg. First of all, it should be ascertained whether it is  really the truth, and only then should action be taken. I am  not writing this to discredit the Army, but as proof of why I  have no faith in how the Soviet-type army is being transformed  into an army that could be admitted into NATO.    When Mr. Baudys came into the Army, he issued such  statements  that I came to believe in him. But when the year was over and  reality did not match up to his statements, I began to have my  doubts. I now know that I am unable to change or correct  anything myself, but I cannot let it pass without comment. I  have never been in favor of across-the-board solutions, but I am  also not in favor of a thick line under the past. After all,  there is a considerable difference between an employee in the  political apparatus who distributed newspapers and the behavior  of a hardened ideologue paid not for his military knowledge, but  for his party work in the irreconcilable class struggle. I  think, Mr. Minister, that you have squandered the opportunity to  set down this difference in the recent assessments of the corps  of commanders. Just as you squandered the approval of the law  on the illegality of the communist regime.  <H5>  And What Does the Parliament Have To Say? </H5>   I would like to address my final appeal to another  institution, which in fact is most responsible for the twists  and turns of this whole transformation process, even though it  does not want or know how to acknowledge this. I cannot  understand, given the number of critical articles concerning the  Army lobby, why our parliament's Defense and Security Committee  has still not dealt with these issues. It is impossible to  leave the Army--one of society's power-wielding elements--to  self-control and self-regulation. Why in other armies do the  inspector generals enjoy the support and even respect of  parliament, the government, and the supreme commanders, while in  our country--where the Army is tossed about by its ideological  heritage and by corruption of unknown proportions--the attitude  of a "dead beetle" is adopted?  When I said in OBRANA LIDU in 1991 that the post of inspector  general is essential for the Army, I was considered to be a  simple idealist: Come on, man, the Army will be democratized,  why the supervision? The facts show that this issue has been  severely underestimated and if it is again left to the  discretion of Army officials, in the next two or three years we  will have to scrape together several more tens of billions of  korunas to put right what we neglected now. With all due  respect for the high IQ of the possible candidate from the  Christian Democratic Party, Vaclav Benda, I think that the  bargaining among the parties for a functionary for this post has  to proceed from more than party criteria.  <H5>  We Need an Army Inspector General </H5>   I do not know if Mr. Tigrid's appointment as a minister was  merely a campaign move by the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party or indeed a glimmer of better  times, but I pray that he was not the exception that confirms  the rule. He has assumed a great deal of responsibility, and I  hope that he proves that we do not just have "personalities" in  the political parties.    Esteemed deputies, I am turning to you, to the  representatives of those who want to again believe that the army  is protecting them and that their money will not be frittered  away, but really used for what it was intended. Do you think  that when you leave the Army to self-maintenance and  self-regulation you are doing your voters a service? Certainly  not. I am asking you to draft a law on an inspector general,  without unnecessary procrastination.    We all know that now, after the offer of Partnership for  Peace from the West, the Defense Ministry along with the Foreign  Ministry has to submit to our future alliance partners our  concept for this partnership. Do you think that generals reared  by the Warsaw Pact's military doctrine have the best concept for  this partnership? Minister Zieleniec gave the best answer to  this question in Sunday's Arena program when he said that there  has to be civilian supervision of the Army. Under the current  legal arrangement, I cannot imagine anything other than  parliamentary supervision.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During his telephone conversation with Latvia  President Guntis Ulmanis Thursday, Russian President Boris  Yeltsin confirmed that Moscow still insisted on signing the  entire package of agreements on Russian troop withdrawal from  Latvia.    The head of the Russian delegation to the talks with Latvia,  Ambassador Sergey Zotov, told Interfax that the main  Russian-Latvian treaty providing for the withdrawal date might  be signed only if all the other three agreements, in the first  place that on social guarantees for Russian military pensioners  and their families residing in Latvia, were signed at the same  time.    The Russian diplomat said that the summit could be held in  the near future, as soon as Latvia was ready to sign all the  four agreements at the same time.    The package includes the main treaty setting the withdrawal  date as August 31, an agreement on the functioning of a radar  station in Skrunda for another five and a half years, another  one on social guarantees for Russian servicemen for the  withdrawal period and the other one on social guarantees for  Russian military pensioners.    The Latvian leadership declared its readiness to sign the  first three documents, though it has been opposing the signing  of the agreement on military pensioners.</p>

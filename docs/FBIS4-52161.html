			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New Justice Minister Hiroshi  Nakai expressed remorse Monday [9 May] over Japan's aggression  and colonial rule in the first half of the century. But he  refrained from criticizing his predecessor Shigeto Nagano, who  quit over his controversial remarks about the war. "As one of  the Japanese I must have a feeling of deep remorse and apology  for the numerous acts of aggression, including colonization,"  Nakai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE at his office  at the Justice Ministry.    Nakai replaced Nagano, who resigned as justice minister  Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks, which were  published in a newspaper last Wednesday. He said the 1937  Nanjing massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with  China and other countries was not aimed at aggression.    "It's correct that the Imperial Japanese Army after invading  Nanjing at the time massacred ordinary Chinese people," Nakai  said.    Unlike Nagano, who participated in the war with China as an  army officer, Nakai, born in 1942 in China's Changchun, which  then belonged to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, was  still a child at the time the war ended. But as his family was  repatriated in September 1946, Nakai said he is well aware of  "the various implications Japan's utter defeat had."    Nakai, who was in the middle of a meeting with his election  committee in Nabari, Mie Prefecture, when Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata called Saturday night to offer him the cabinet post, said  he accepted out of understanding for "Hata's feelings in this  very difficult situation."    Asked whether he plans to make use of his directional  authority that allows the justice minister to intervene with the  prosecution, Nakai said he "does not intend to take action to  intervene in individual problems."    He declined to comment on the ongoing debate about whether  the United Nations should impose sanctions on North Korea to  enforce its request for full inspections of the country's  nuclear facilities, saying he first wants to study relevant  reports currently being prepared by various government  institutions.    Stressing that the justice minister's duty is to maintain  law  and order, Nakai said he does not want to become involved in the  discussion about the enactment of legislation covering  emergencies and whether Japan should claim the right to  collective defense.    "It's quite right that everybody voices different views and  standpoints, and that the Diet and political parties deliberate  (this problem)...However, I don't want to anticipate this  discussion," Nakai said.</p>

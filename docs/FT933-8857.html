			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Growth in earnings declines to 3.5% AVERAGE EARNINGS growth slowed to an underlying 3.5 per cent in the year to June, pushed down by low publicsector pay settlements. The June increase was  1/4 of a percentage point lower than in May and the smallest for 25 years. The latest slowdown was concentrated in services where the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling has brought settlements down sharply. In the year to June average earnings in the services sector rose an underlying 2 3/4 per cent compared with 3 per cent in the year to May. Service-sector earnings growth has dropped from 4.3 per cent at the start of the year. In manufacturing, where economic recovery is raising overtime payments, earnings rose an underlying 5 per cent in June compared with a year ago. It has been at this level since February. Average earnings have dropped virtually every month since the start of last year. Throughout most of the recession they were static at about 7 per cent, before starting to fall a year ago.</p>

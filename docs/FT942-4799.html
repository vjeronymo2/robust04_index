			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / People: Oftel The appointment of Ann Taylor to head the competition division at Oftel, the telecoms regulator, is the latest in a series of senior female appointments to the body charged with overseeing the industry. Taylor succeeds Anna Walker, who was last month appointed to succeed Bill Wigglesworth as deputy to Don Cruickshank, the director-general. Her appointment gives women a 5-4 majority on Oftel's senior management team, with one post vacant. Taylor moves on secondment from the DTI, where she is a grade 5 responsible for regional policy. The competition brief is one of the toughest at Oftel, with 40 new entrants to the UK's liberalised telecoms industry calling loudly for better terms for connection to BT's network. Mercury, BT's main competitor, is currently in the courts claiming that Oftel has failed to give it a fair deal.</p>

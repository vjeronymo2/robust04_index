			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Riga, 12 May (LETA) -- "It was the first  official visit of a representative from independent Latvia both  to South Africa and the African continent," said the Saeima's  [parliament] chairman, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, on his arrival in  Riga from South Africa on Wednesday [11 May]. He participated  in the inauguration ceremony of the first black president,  Nelson Mandela. [passage omitted]    Speaking of his meeting with the South Africa's new  president, Nelson Mandela, the Latvian speaker stressed that Mr.  Mandela is energetic and has a great deal of ideas. However,  Mr. Gorbunovs, declined to speculate on the development of the  events in this African country, because relations between the  black and white remain tense there. Mr. Gorbunovs drew a  parallel between Mr. Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev, who led  Russia to democracy and was deprived of his post of the  president because of the political struggle in the USSR.</p>

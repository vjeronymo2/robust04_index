During his visit [to Jordan] where he met with the prime  minister, Nayif Hawatimah expressed displeasure with the  meticulous search of his car.    Prime Minister al-Majali explained to Nayif Hawatimah that  he  was not personally targeted by this search but that the  Jordanian security authorities at the border posts have started  to carefully search all incoming vehicles to Jordan, whether  private or official.    Al-Majali explained to Hawatimah that Jordan was forced to  do  this out of its fear that these vehicles might be used to  transport weapons into Jordan as had taken place with the car of  George Habash [the secretary general of the Popular Front the  Liberation of Palestine, PFLP].    The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent visit  to Jordan, his car was searched and various types of weapons and  silencers were found in it.    On the other hand, the security forces have stepped up their  surveillance of all the Jordanian border posts to foil any arms  smuggling operation, particularly after the two cinema  explosions.</p>

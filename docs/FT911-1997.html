			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Venezuela proposes third bank sell-off THE Venezuelan government has issued a public call to parties interested in bidding on the privatisation of a state-controlled commercial bank called Banco Republica, writes Joe Mann in Caracas. Tenders will be sought later this year from groups the government classifies as qualified bidders. Banco Republica is the third commercial bank the Venezuelan government has put on the block over the past year. The state holds just over 90 per cent of the bank's stock. According to Venezuelan banking law, foreigners can hold no more than 20 per cent of shares in a banking entity, but this restriction is likely to be eased. The administration has expressed interest in opening up Venezuela's financial system to international banks. In other privatisations, including airlines and telecommunications, it is seeking majority foreign participation.</p>

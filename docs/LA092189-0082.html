			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLOOD OF STUDENTS BRINGS RETURN OF BUSING AT SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> WITH ENROLLMENT NEARING RECORD, YEAR-ROUND SESSIONS ARE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> Enrollment in the Glendale Unified School District has boomed beyond  projections again this year, forcing the district to initiate busing at two  schools -- the first such move in more than two decades, officials said.  </P> <P> In an effort to deal with the problem, the Board of Education on Tuesday  appointed a 25-member task force to consider, among other things, the  possibility of initiating voluntary year-round schools in the crowded district.  The committee will hold its initial meeting Monday and plans to complete its  study by February.  </P> <P> Enrollment had climbed to 24,170 by Monday, about 670 more students than the  district had expected. The figure is a 6.5% increase over the number of  students -- 22,703 -- enrolled at this time last year.  </P> <P> Officials said new students normally continue to enroll for about the first six  weeks of school, which could bring the district near the record enrollment of  almost 25,000 reached in the late 1960s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Schools  </P> <P> Compounding matters, the district has five fewer campuses because of schools  closed from 1979 to 1983 during a steady decline in enrollment.  </P> <P> Today's burgeoning population may force significant changes in policies and  school boundaries in the district, officials said.  </P> <P> "We have always believed very strongly in the neighborhood school concept,"  said Donald W. Empey, deputy superintendent of instruction. "But we can no  longer deal with the growing enrollment on individual school campuses."  </P> <P> In the past, the district has added portable classrooms at campuses to  accommodate students -- about 65 portables are in use -- but new state laws  that take effect in January will restrict the use of portables, said David M.  Kanthak, assistant superintendent of business services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Campuses  </P> <P> In addition, most of the school sites in the district are relatively small and  portable buildings encroach on playgrounds and parking areas.  </P> <P> The district is adding 92 permanent classrooms at five schools in the downtown  area -- Horace Mann, John Marshall, John Muir and Thomas Jefferson  elementaries, and Hoover High. But even that will not be enough to provide  classrooms for a student population that has grown from 19,800 to more than  24,000 in just the last five years, officials said.  </P> <P> Busing became necessary for the first time this year after it was eliminated  almost 20 years ago.  </P> <P> All new enrollment has been halted at two elementary schools in southeast  Glendale -- Marshall and Mann -- where capacity was reached less than two weeks  after school began Sept. 7.  </P> <P> Only 18 students living within the boundaries of Marshall and Mann are riding  vans to nearby Glenoaks and Cerritos elementary schools, Empey said, but the  number of students bused is expected to continue to swell during the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> Enrollment also neared capacity at Eleanor J. Toll Junior High School on the  midwest side of town, but officials said that as of Tuesday, busing did not  appear necessary there. The most logical alternative site for Toll had appeared  to be Rosemont Junior High in La Crescenta, a move that would have forced  students to travel a considerable distance from their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Officials attributed the larger-than-projected enrollment to changing  demographics, mostly in the mid-city and southeast Glendale areas, where new  immigrant families appear to be living two and three to a household. The  district plans to conduct a survey to determine how extensive the trend is  toward multifamily households.  </P></p>

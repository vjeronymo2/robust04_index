			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Man in the News: For a policy with whiskers - Rudolf Scharping Ten days ago Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), dragged himself from his sick-bed to return, still visibly shivering and pale, to the hustings. It was the last week of electioneering for a new state parliament in Lower Saxony, the first poll of no fewer than 19 in Germany this year, and he was clearly not going to miss it for a bad dose of gastric flu. This dogged determination provided a graphic illustration of the way this serious, rather didactic career politician is tackling the election marathon ahead. He looked dreadful, but his audiences were delighted that he was there at all, and he managed to tell a few jokes. His reward was a good victory for the SPD, which gained an absolute majority in the state - if only by one seat - and saw the rival Christian Democratic Union of Chancellor Helmut Kohl slump to its worst result since 1959. It was not really a victory for Rudolf Scharping. The success was due more to the wily campaigning of Mr Gerhard Schroder, his arch-rival within the SPD, the state premier in Lower Saxony, and the man he defeated for the party leadership last year. But by turning out to give him support, Mr Scharping made sure that some of the glory rubbed off on himself. More importantly, perhaps, he managed to underline his success in forging a common front in the SPD, whose internal divisions and open arguments have undermined each previous attempt to recapture power in Bonn. As far as public opinion is concerned, the election result was an essential first step for the SPD on the long march towards its ultimate ambition: victory for Scharping against Kohl in the general election on October 16, and a return to power for the party after 12 years in the wilderness. For the first time, the polls are suggesting that a clear majority - more than 70 per cent - expects a change in power. Yesterday, Mr Scharping took a second big step towards that goal, with the publication of the party's draft government programme. The document represents a clear victory for his middle-of-the-road agenda: it is deliberately cautious, low-key and unrevolutionary, a studied attempt to reconcile the party's traditional commitment to social justice, full employment and strict environmental standards, with a balanced budget and strict fiscal responsibility. It is above all an attempt to prove that the party is 'fit for government'. 'It is not a list of pious wishes, but a practical government programme,' said Mr Gunter Verheugen, Mr Scharping's right-hand man as party secretary-general. When Mr Scharping, then simply the state premier in the Rhineland-Palatinate, was elected party leader, one senior SPD official was asked why he was chosen. 'Because we Germans like someone who is worthy and safe,' he replied. 'He looks just like a typical scout master: trustworthy and sympathetic,' according to one business observer. 'The question now is: do we think a good scout master would make a good chancellor?' He is not the sort of person who sets his audiences alight, or has them rolling in the aisles. But he has abandoned written texts for his speeches, and makes them from a handful of notes. He has a remarkable memory, according to close advisers, and can keep a whole mass of figures in his head. That may be part of his problem, for he still tends to blind his audiences with science. But he is also starting to enjoy his role of the modern, youthful challenger - he is 46 - taunting the old warhorse, 63-year-old Mr Kohl. His favourite story of the moment tells of a broadcast he had time to watch two weeks ago, lying on his sick-bed, when the chancellor was answering callers' questions. 'This man rang in to ask him what he was doing to promote investment in the new multi-media super-highways, the leading edge of new technology. But the chancellor thought he was talking about the autobahn system, and started banging on about traffic jams and investment in the roads,' Mr Scharping told a delighted audience in Lower Saxony. 'How on earth can you trust a man who doesn't know the difference?' The SPD leader's greatest success so far has been in stopping the squabbling inside his own party. 'For the first time in 12 years, the SPD has got a proper party leader,' according to one rival CDU official. From the moment he was formally elected last June, after a grass-roots ballot of the party membership, he moved swiftly and methodically to spike potentially divisive issues. He rapidly co-opted his other potential rival, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, by giving him responsibility for the whole field of economic and financial policy. Between the two of them, they have forged a policy which combines tax reform, to shift the burden from the lower-paid to the higher income groups, with strict fiscal discipline. Mr Lafontaine has been forced to postpone his plans for a headline-catching environmental tax reform, to concentrate instead on the absolute priority of job creation. Mr Scharping does not want to scare off the business lobby. By shifting the party to the right, he has set his face against a possible coalition with the Green party after the October election - although the latest opinion polls suggest they could have a clear majority between them. 'The SPD will not be a partner in a policy which suggests petrol prices should be raised to DM5 (a fourfold increase), or the Bundeswehr should be pulled out of Nato,' he said yesterday, in a firm rejection of Green party policies. The challenge he now faces is keeping his party in line, with Mr Kohl ready to exploit the slightest sign of dissent. The CDU last month launched a big poster campaign, featuring a huge grainy close-up of the chancellor's grinning, clean-shaven face, and the slogan: 'For a policy without whiskers.' It was intended to show that the neatly bearded Scharping is merely peddling the same old policies of a tired opposition. It could yet backfire. It certainly shows that the chancellor's advisers are taking their challenger seriously.</p>

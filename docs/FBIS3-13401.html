The procession was led by a number of general secretaries of  the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, led by Ahmad Jibril,  secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]; Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa  Muraghah], Central Committee secretary of the Palestine National  Liberation Movement [PNLM]-Fatah; Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary  general of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; Talal Naji,  assistant secretary general of the PFLP-GC; Abu-Khalid  al-'Amlah, assistant secretary of PNLM- Fatah; Muhammad  Abu-Musa, command member of the Islamic Resistance Movement  Hamas; and Abu-Istayf [not further identified], Central  Committee member of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front; and  other alliance leaders.    Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus and an Iranian delegation  were also in the forefront of the procession.    Our correspondent in Damascus said that since the early  morning hours, the masses of our people gathered in the streets  of al-Sayyidah Zaynab camp, then headed for al-Sayyidah Zaynab  tomb where Ahmad Jibril delivered a speech. He said: Today we  stand here on the occasion of world Jerusalem day--this day  which Imam Khomeyni, may God have mercy on him, made an  international day. This was decided immediately after the  victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. Imam Khomeyni said  Israel is a cancerous growth that should be removed, and  Jerusalem should have an international day. With this, Imam  Khomeyni drew a link between Jerusalem day and the blessed month  of Ramadan, and the last Friday of that month in particular.  The Islamic conquests and the Muslims' battles against heretics  were carried out in this blessed month.    Ahmad Jibril recalled what Imam Khomeyni said--that Islam  without Palestine and without Jerusalem is an incomplete Islam,  and Muslims throughout the world should work for the restoration  of Jerusalem and Palestine.    Jibril added: We meet today on world Jerusalem day at a time  when the whole of Palestine suffers from massacres and  repression of children, woman, and the elderly. These Jews, who  killed prophets and messengers, have never hesitated to commit  more massacres. You recall, o brothers, the massacre at the  holy al-Aqsa Mosque and how they kill the worshipers who were  prostrate before Almighty God. This took place on Friday. Two  week ago, you heard how the Jews killed or injured hundreds of  worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. This also took place on  Friday.    The history of our people in Palestine is full of massacres,  from Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, Sabra and Shatila, and  'Uyun Qarah, until the latest massacre. The Zionist leaders  arrogantly denounced the massacre of al-Ibrahimi Mosque, saying  that its perpetrator was mad and deranged. We ask terrorist  Rabin: Who committed the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dayr Yasin  massacres? Was it not the Zionist army?    Jibril went on to say: These lies and tricks do not deceive  anyone. Today, the capitulationist leadership, which signed an  agreement with the Zionists and relinquished everything, agreed  to sell the homeland and the blood of martyrs to the enemies of  God and humanity.    We say to all these defeatists that the Palestinian  people--their women, youths, and elderly--have not calmed down  and have not become tired. Haven't they seen the children  chasing the Zionist soldiers and throwing stones at them?  Haven't they seen the women taking kitchen knives and stabbing  the enemy's soldiers before being martyred? Haven't they seen  how the mujahidin in Palestine fight the enemies of God? We say  to these people: Do whatever you want, but God's will shall  prevail.    Jibril concluded his speech by addressing Muslims all over  the world and said: Do not despair of Gods' mercy because God  told the faithful that they will attain victory. If you aid  (the cause of) God, He will aid you. [Koranic verse]    Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus, read a statement in which  he condemned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron,  and all the massacres the enemy has committed in Palestine and  the occupied Arab territories.    He hailed the Palestinian people and urged Muslims to  support  the Muslims in Palestine and to carry out jihad for the  restoration of Jerusalem and Palestine.</p>

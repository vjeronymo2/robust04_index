			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: MMT moves 14% ahead to Pounds 712,000 Mr Mike Tilbrook, chairman of MMT Computing, said he was pleased that the USM-quoted computer systems consultancy had achieved a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 626,000 to Pounds 712,000, in the six months to February 29. He added that the mainstream of the company run from London had performed 'most creditably', and he singled out the south-east branch as especially praiseworthy. Turnover slipped to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 3.1m), but earnings rose to 3.9p (3.4p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.1p (1p). Axime, the French company with which it had been linked and which owned a 20 per cent stake, was no longer a shareholder.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Dec (NA) -- Government House has  announced that President Carlos Menem this evening promulgated  the law declaring the need to reform the Constitution. The bill  was approved by the Senate early this morning.    The promulgation of this law, the senators' claim to have  been the chamber that submitted the law, and their decision to  modify the duration of the senators' terms today elicited  various reactions from the leaders of the Justicialist Party  [PJ], the UCR [Radical Civic Union], and other political sectors.    National UCR Deputy Leopoldo Moreau criticized the  "shortsightedness" of his fellow party members who opposed the  constitutional reform, adding that Fernando de la Rua "has not  understood the change that this reform will imply for the  consolidation of democracy."    In a conversation with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, Moreau  reiterated  that "(the reform project) originated in the Chamber of  Deputies," but said that this matter is not "essential" enough  to cause a constitutional conflict.    For his part, Senator De la Rua criticized the contents of  the law, because "far from reducing presidential powers, it  increases them," noting that Buenos Aires UCR Constituent  Assembly delegates "will adopt their own position" in spite of  any decision by the party.    De la Rua, who also talked with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, said  that the minister of coordination, which is created by the  reform, "is an entelechy," reiterating that the possibility of  reelection of the current president "violates ethical rules."    He added that "the bill did not follow the usual steps,"  noting that "it should have returned to the Chamber of Deputies"  after the Senate eliminated the paragraph reducing the senators'  terms.    PJ Senator Antonio Cafiero said there is "firm discipline"  in  the PJ bloc in the Senate, remarking that "only one paragraph"  of the law establishing the need to reform the Constitution had  been modified.    Cafiero explained that the Senate "failed to endorse only  one  paragraph of the law" because it is an exception, adding that  the decision to reject the reduction of senators' terms to four  years "was unanimous."    "As we are considering a law that should be approved by a  two-thirds majority in each chamber, the five steps provided for  for common bills do not apply," Cafiero said.    For his part, Progressive Democracy Deputy Alberto Natale  said that the Senate decision to modify the decision by the  Chamber of Deputies "makes it mandatory that the bill be  returned to the Chamber of Deputies."    According to Natale, "congressional proceedings which are  ruled by the Constitution include the list of steps to be taken  for a bill to be approved by Congress."    Natale added that "the bill should return to the Chamber of  Deputies, because otherwise the constitutional reform will not  have a healthy birth."    Socialist Unity Deputy Hector Polino also said that the law  on the need to reform the Constitution "does not meet the  requirements for submission to the executive branch," adding  that the Senate approval was "unconstitutional."    Polino explained that "there are two different bills, each  of  which were approved by just one chamber of Congress," noting  that "congressional proceedings have not been completed for  either one."    "The entire reform process has been embarrassing, and the  conclusion they are trying reach in Congress implies the death  of the country's entire constitutional doctrine."    National Senator Jose Antonio Romero Feris justified his  vote  against the reform on the grounds that "before thinking of  modifying the Constitution it is necessary to comply with it."    Romero Feris added that the introduction of runoff elections  and the post of minister of coordination "do not entail any kind  of restrictions on the powers of the president."    He said that "the pact was reached behind closed doors, and  was approved -- reluctantly but with Prussian discipline -- by  the lawmakers of the majority parties."    National PJ Senator Oraldo Britos said the bill originated  with the Senate, and that "some articles were eliminated because  the Chamber of Deputies did not take into account the bill that  was submitted by the Senate."    Britos added that the duration of senatorial terms "will be  decided by the Constituent Assembly, because the Senate has  proposed six years."    Finally, Raul Alfonsin's spokesman Simon Lazara said that  the  Senate rejection of the four-year term proposed for national  senators was "lamentable," although he explained that this  decision "does not affect the group of basic agreements" reached  by the PJ and the UCR.    "It is obviously the defense of sectorial interests, an  attitude that impairs the image of the Senate and that does not  match the spirit of the reform agreement," Lazara told NOTICIAS  ARGENTINAS.    Mendoza leader Raul Baglini (until a few days ago the leader  of the bloc of national UCR deputies), said that "now that the  constitutional reform law has been approved the UCR should  overcome its internal disagreements -- which have been broadly  disseminated because of the importance of the subject -- and  should prepare for the election of Constituent Assembly members,  thus guaranteeing a modern reform with equilibrium between the  branches of government."</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Save us all from the credentialist fad If there is one unquestioned business belief of our time it is the need for more vocational training in the UK. This has replaced socialism as the theme song of John Smith's Labour party. As shadow chancellor, his answer to every problem was to call for more training - or sometimes more 'training and investment'. He was, of course, knocking against an open door. One of the few academic books defending the Thatcher decade, by Geoffrey Maynard*, made an exception of inadequate training effort. Nor was the Conservative government behindhand in following its critics. Despite very recent fluctuations, central government spending on training trebled between 1978 and 1990. Total training expenditure, including individual loss of earnings to learn on the job, and expenditure by business, amounted in 1986-87 - the last year for which such a comprehensive estimate is available - to Pounds 33bn, or some 10 per cent of GDP. This was over and above education as such. A small dent in the contemporary orthodoxy is made in a new study by J R Shackleton for the Institute of Economic Affairs.** It is not quite the neat surgical demolition for which I had hoped. But it does cast some very necessary doubts on the whole fad. The idea that training is the main factor behind differences in national economic performance goes back to some pioneering studies made by an American economist, Edward Denison, in the 1960s. Denison tried to identify the contributions to growth from factors such as the expansion of the labour force and capital stock. His characteristic finding was that such statistical explanations left an unexplained residual, usually accounting for about half the growth rate in the better performing economies. Differences in training are simply one guess out of many attempts to explain the growth residual. But it is more difficult to establish a direct connection. The former Central Policy Review Staff - or cabinet think-tank - which was hardly a force against high-minded centralist thinking, failed to do so in a report over a decade ago. Training can be divided into transferable skills useful in a wide variety of workplaces, and specific training of little use outside the company providing it. Most kinds of training have an element of both, but the distinction is clear. There is a theoretical danger of inadequate training in transferable skills. This is because employers will lose the value of the training they have provided to those who walk across the road to rival companies. In that case the benefits to the economy are 'external' to the company itself: hence the jargon word 'externality'. But this theoretical deficiency does not mean that the more the government spends on training, the better. Shackleton, unable to find any rate of return estimates for vocational training, cites a Department of Education paper for university degrees. This shows personal returns to the graduate from higher education more than three times as high as the social return. Both rates of return are based on differences between graduate and non-graduate earnings. But the private costs exclude government grants and contributions to fees and other university expenditure. Hence the much higher return. (The almost unbelievably high return to social science studies may be due to the inclusion of subjects such as law and business studies.) Estimates of both rates of return may, however, be swollen to the extent that qualifications are used by employers as a filter to sort candidates. As Shackleton says: 'Jobs which you could have obtained 20 years ago with O-levels now require A-levels or even degrees if you are to have a chance of getting them - even though the skills required have actually changed very little. This is what American educationalists call credentialism.' The UK has a similar proportion of the workforce with degrees and higher educational qualifications - about 17 per cent - as its main European competitors. Where it lags is in intermediate vocational qualifications. But training on the job is not always worse than paper qualifications, many of which have a remote connection with performance. The IEA study has a useful warning about the much-praised German system based on formal apprenticeship and compulsory instruction in vocational schools. It is a highly corporatist system. Chambers of commerce, Land governments and unions together lay down tight specifications for about 400 recognised occupations. The laws prevent people setting up handicraft workshops and other enterprises without having a meister qualification: a system gently mocked by Richard Wagner in his opera more than a hundred years ago. German apprenticeships last three or more years - often much too long in modern conditions. A tell-tale sign of the real purpose of the system - to prevent low wage competition - is that unions are pressing for yet longer apprenticeships. Many skilled workers do not in practice use the skills for which they are trained and subsequently work in a different occupation. One study by an Anglo-German foundation found that samples of British young people were more enterprising in learning new skills and in reported experience of information technology. In Britain, most of the government's training effort is being transferred to the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which are largely under the control of employers. But is it really such a good idea to place such responsibilities on part-time top executives? And is not the Conservative government's emphasis on businessmen doing its work for it indicative of a profound confusion about how an open market economy is supposed to work? In practice, chief executives drawn from the government Training Agency will be in control. Another not-so-innocent body on the horizon is the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. By the end of 1992 it is hoped that 80 per cent of the workforce will be subject to NVQ, which has its own ambitions. All other certifying bodies must accept the NVQ philosophy. For government training funds are tied to NVQ recognition. In Shackleton's words: 'Economists would not, as a general rule, accept that monopoly status of this sort is likely to encourage independent innovation and experimentation.' Indeed, one of the new system's severest critics has been Sigmund Prais, who was a pioneer of the movement to improve training and education, but now observes: 'Too much emphasis has perhaps been placed on employers' needs for personnel capable of doing their immediate jobs, and too little on the longer-term needs of the economy and of individuals.' There are some better ideas, such as the government's Training Credit, which young people can use to select their own courses from approved lists. So far, the take-up has been limited, where it has been tried. One problem is that it is aimed at 16 and 17-year-olds, many more of whom are staying on at school. An extension to 18-plus might help. Meanwhile, a tell-tale symptom is the high ratio of people talking about training, administering it or generally pushing it around, compared with the numbers actually helping young people to learn. The training industry is becoming a vast vested interest, dependent on government patronage, no worse but no better than other such interest groups. *The Economy Under Mrs Thatcher, Blackwell, 1988. **Training Too Much?, Institute of Economic Affairs, Pounds 6.95.  --------------------------------------------------------------------        RATES OF RETURN TO A FIRST DEGREE, UK 1981-85  --------------------------------------------------------------------                   Personal rates (%)   Social rates (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Social sciences          32.5               12.0 Engineering              34.0                7.5 Sciences                 23.5                6.0 Arts                     10.0                0.5 All subjects             27.5                8.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dept of Education and Science, Top-up Loans for Students  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

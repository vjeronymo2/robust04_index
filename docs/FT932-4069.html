			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Serbian companies count cost of sanctions: Kerin Hope talks to some of the financial victims of the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia THIRTEEN months ago, Simpo, the biggest furniture manufacturer in the former Yugoslavia, was about to sign a contract with an Italian design group. The Belgrade-based company could barely keep pace with local demand for its latest line in rattan armchairs. With production for the first half of 1992 set to rise by 63 per cent, record exports were projected. Now, Simpo's 5,000-strong workforce is on short hours and company executives must pay for their coffee. UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, imposed in June 1992 and tightened two months ago, have forced radical changes on a company that used to sell 70 per cent of its output abroad. In 1990, the year before Yugoslavia started to break apart, Simpo's foreign sales totalled Dollars 120m. Unable to export because of the embargo, Simpo took drastic cost-cutting measures. It started local production of imported items, such as heavy-duty staples formerly sent from Germany. Faced now with the prospect of being excluded indefinitely from markets abroad, the company's survival plan involves a comprehensive restructuring. 'We built a reputation for flexible management over the past 20 years. It is now being challenged to the limit,' says Mr Slobodan Stojanovic, international sales director. Simpo is sharply scaling down its operations, offering to lease tools and machinery to its workforce, based around 40 plants in Serbia. It is also prepared to offer equity stakes of up to 51 per cent in more than 30 subsidiaries, from upholstery-makers to equipment repair and maintenance companies. 'We may end up with a kind of cottage industry, with workers producing from their homes,' Mr Stojanovic says. 'But we'll also still have a workforce, when sanctions are lifted.' Although relatively few Serbian companies have developed a strategy for surviving the embargo, many former exporters make an effort to stay in touch with former clients and their markets, attending conferences and trade fairs around Europe. The sanctions have hit hard. Serbia's share of total Yugoslav exports amounted to about Dollars 4.7bn in 1990, according to the trade ministry. Last year, exports were less than Dollars 1.5bn. Imports of medical supplies are exempt from the embargo but that has not halted the decline of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. Overall production plunged by 70 per cent in the past year, according to the pharmaceutical manufacturers' association. The government's foreign exchange reserves are too depleted to cover more than basic drug imports for public health requirements. Pharmaceutical companies complain of long delays in payment for supplying the state health service. Their biggest problem, however, is the reluctance of drug producers abroad to supply raw materials to Serbia. 'It's the really big producers in Europe and the US that have dropped us since sanctions started. Trading companies were more willing to continue,' says Mr Radomir Stojicevic, president of ICN Galenika, Serbia's largest pharmaceuticals producer. ICN Galenika, which has a 50 per cent share of the Serbian pharmaceuticals market, can now import only about one-third of its raw material requirements, he says. Lay-offs have not yet started, but workers at several plants have already been sent on on summer leave. Controlled by Mr Milan Panic, the California-based millionaire who served briefly as Yugoslavia's prime minister, the company is better placed than its rivals to lobby for what Mr Stojicevic calls 'fair treatment under difficult conditions'. With reserves of Dollars 50m deposited in a Swiss bank, intended to fund its investment programme, ICN Galenika argues that it has no problems in providing guarantees to suppliers abroad. Mr Stojicevic claims that ICN Galenika should not be penalised, because it has complied with sanctions. 'Our exports used to be worth Dollars 70m yearly. We've stopped exporting completely. When some of our products were spotted recently in Slovenia, we sent documentary evidence to the UN sanctions committee that they were smuggled,' he says. For Credibel Bank, a private bank with 12 per cent of its equity base provided by a group of Canadian investors, the problem was one of timing. The bank, set up to promote private investment, received its operating licence just before sanctions were imposed. When they were tightened in late April, the foreign shareholders' Dollars 10m equity contribution was frozen. As a result, Credibel confines its lending to short-term loans for small and medium-sized private businesses in basic sectors such as food processing. 'Sanctions have had a catastrophic effect. We planned to do a lot of trade financing, we'd developed contacts with banks in the European Community, and we wanted to back some innovative projects. Now we can't plan, we just have to wait,' says Mr Vladan Muzdalo, executive director.</p>

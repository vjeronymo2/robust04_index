			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): British Rail faces increased threat of industrial action THE likelihood of industrial action ballots among 95,000 British Rail workers grew last night after BR said it had made a final 7 per cent pay offer. After meeting to consider the BR offer last night, union leaders said they would not recommend the executives of their unions to accept it, but would consider later this week what action to take. The move came as separate talks to avert threats of industrial action by 76,000 workers in the electricity supply industry were continuing. Late last night the employers raised their pay offer by 0.5 percentage point to 8.5 per cent, which the unions are understood to have rejected. Electricity unions had threatened an overtime ban from midnight tonight unless the offer was increased substantially. Action by either the rail or power unions could cause considerable disruption. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the BR offer 'seems unacceptable'. Leaders of the RMT transport union are believed to be more likely to call an industrial action ballot. Leaders of the Aslef drivers' union may take the issue to the Railway Staffs National Tribunal for arbitration instead. BR made only a small improvement to an earlier 6.5 per cent pay offer, in spite of warnings by union leaders that a vote on industrial action was likely unless they were offered a rise above the rate of inflation. Unions were meeting last night to consider a formal response. The offer would cover 95,000 employees, represented by the RMT, TSSA and Aslef transport unions, and would add Pounds 106m to BR's wages bill. It would probably be extended to cover another 20,000 employees not directly represented at yesterday's talks. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, said he believed 7 per cent was a good offer because it would be above the rate of inflation for the year it covered. He said that to have offered more would have been irresponsible. Mr Watkinson said the deterioration in BR's finances this year, because of the recession, meant a higher offer would lead to cuts in services or jobs. Unions were told during the talks in London that BR faced the most severe financial difficulties for a generation. Revenue for 1991 was running 9 per cent below the expected level and profits from property sales had fallen sharply.</p>

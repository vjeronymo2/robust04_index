			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRINCESS ANNE IS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION;  </P> <P> BUT ANITA DEFRANTZ HAS IOC TALKING ABOUT PROPOSED STEROIDS BAN  </P> <P> There are only six women among the 93 members of the International Olympic  Committee, but two of them were at the center of attention on the final day  Friday of the IOC's annual session.  </P> <P> Every move made by Great Britain's Princess Anne, the president of the  International Equestrian Federation who became an IOC member last year, was  duly noted by 80 members of the British press, who descended upon Puerto Rico  after word surfaced this week of her separation from husband Mark Phillips.  </P> <P> Security prevented reporters and photographers from following her onto an  elevator. But when the elevator door did not close, they shouted questions and  snapped pictures from afar.  </P> <P> While the princess waited patiently, a hotel engineer was unsuccessful in  getting the elevator doors to close. But when the princess stepped forward to  leave the elevator, the door suddenly closed in her face.  </P> <P> The busiest person at the IOC's headquarters hotel Friday was the travel agent,  who was trying to arrange trips for the reporters to Belize, where the princess  will go this weekend on behalf of her Save the Children Fund.  </P> <P> Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles caused a stir that was more closely related to  IOC business with her proposal to ban athletes who test positive for anabolic  steroids at the Olympics from competing in future Games.  </P> <P> The proposal also called for strict sanctions against administrators, coaches,  doctors and trainers who assist athletes in using drugs.  </P> <P> The IOC referred the proposal to its medical commission for further study but  not until 23 members had addressed the subject during Friday's session.  </P> <P> "It was a very good discussion," DeFrantz said. "I hope some real solid  proposals come from it. At least, people are talking about it."  </P> <P> IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch echoed the statement earlier in the week  by the medical commission chairman, Prince Alexander de Merode of Belgium, that  athletes should not be suspended for life for a first offense.  </P> <P> "We agree in principle with the proposal by Ms. DeFrantz," Samaranch said.  "After a very long debate, we decided that we will try to increase the  sanctions regarding doping. But they will be mainly against the people  surrounding the athletes."  </P> <P> The IOC now allows the governing bodies for the sports in the Games to  establish their own eligibility rules. Most federations suspend athletes for  two years for initial drug offenses but have vague rules regarding  collaborators.  </P> <P> Two new members elected Friday to the IOC were Walther Troeger of West Germany  and Fernando Ferreira Lima Bello of Portugal.  </P></p>

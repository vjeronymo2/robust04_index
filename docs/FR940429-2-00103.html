This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict non-compatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations. and the way in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies and persons using the airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of FAR part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing non-compatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional con-compatible uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The City of Manassas submitted to the FAA on February 24, 1992, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during an airport noise compatibility planning study. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the City of Manassas. The specific maps under consideration are the noise exposure maps: Figure X&hyph;1 Existing (1992) Noise Exposure Map (page 56) and Figure X&hyph;2 Future (1997) Noise Exposure Map (page 57) of the February 1992 submission as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that these maps for Manassas Regional Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on March 21, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

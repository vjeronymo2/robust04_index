			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast; accompanying video carries </F> VoyenTV attribution]    [Text] [Correspondent A. Bondarenko, identified by caption]  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Boris Gromov had  a meeting today with representatives of the sub-committee for  disarmament and arms control of the FRG Bundestag. Questions of  arms reduction -- primarily nuclear and chemical -- in Europe  were discussed. This process is important and essential but  every one of us is worried lest it become a one-way street.  Might it not end up with us, alone, destroying our arsenal,  while the West actively assists us, leaving its own untouched?    [Begin Gromov recording] Parity in disarmament is maintained  in line with signed agreements and treaties. We, naturally,  could not have a situation where we would sign a treaty  concerning, for example, the elimination of chemical weapons,  that was detrimental to us and our defense capability.

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (1): The need to tighten belts - Chancellor Kohl has told Germans to tighten their belts and stop acting as if Germany were 'a leisure park'. His warning reflects a mood of national introspection as reunited Germany reviews its place in an increasingly uncertain world THE slogan of the hour is Standort Deutschland. It does not translate easily. Literally, it means Germany as an investment location. But it also begs questions about Germany's international competitiveness and its social make-up - education, culture, social welfare, and population trends. All these are under the microscope in the great debate on Standort Deutschland launched by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, with their report on 'safeguarding Germany's future as an industrial location'. It is a rumbling debate which has been worrying German political and economic analysts, and the business community, for 10 years or more. It has suddenly hit the headlines with the simultaneous advent of German unification, the European single market, upheaval and instability in eastern Europe, and the sharp increase in industrial competition from the Far East. The question is whether the doubts about German competitiveness represent another bout of typical German soul-searching, inspired by a sharp but temporary downturn in the economy, or whether they are a recognition of more profound problems. 'Almost all our present problems are structural problems of the old federal republic,' Mr Kohl said in Berlin last month. 'We would have to solve them even if German unification had not happened. 'We are not in a traditional recession. But tough times can make new thinking easier. German unity is in that sense a great opportunity for new thinking.' There are gloom-laden headlines in the media. Der Spiegel magazine proclaims Germany's imminent relegation to the second division of manufacturing nations and its population sinking under the burden of an inexorably expanding social state. There are few if any visible signs of such doom. In spite of the huge costs of unification, and the sharpest recession since the war, Germany is overwhelmingly prosperous. The problem for Germany is in steering a sensible middle course between incorrigible self-satisfaction and profound self-doubt. 'The sensible question about Germany's attractiveness as a business location is not why Germany has fallen behind ..but whether changes are appearing that could relegate it from its high-level position and cause a lasting deterioration in productivity and growth trends,' says Mr Michael Heise, secretary general of the government's council of economic experts - the so-called five wise men. In spite of the fact that the debate has been launched by the government and the business community, there is wide acceptance on the other side of the house - in the trade union movement and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) - that it is a debate which is needed. They only disagree on the analysis. The government's view, in the Rexrodt report, is fuelled primarily by a liberal, employers'-eye concern at high costs and the inflexibility of labour, compounded by worries over the soaring costs of the social state. The trade unions, and a growing number of independent analysts, stress instead their concern over the slow pace of innovation, lack of investment in high technology, and the inflexibility of management thinking. 'The structural problems lie deeper than high costs,' says Mr Walter Riester, newly-elected deputy leader of IG Metall, the giant engineering workers' union. 'We have the wrong products.' Mr Kohl himself is calling for all the sectors in the German economy to tighten their belts, from central government, through the federal states and local councils to the private sector. He also wants something called 'umdenken' - new thinking. 'Just a few kilometres east of Berlin and Munich, serious new competitors are growing up, with great cost advantages and increasingly impressive products,' he says. 'Yet we allow ourselves the luxury of being a country with ever younger pensioners (average retirement age 59) and ever older students (average matriculation age 30) ..With ever shorter working hours, rising wage costs, and ever longer holidays, our competitiveness is in danger. 'The simple fact is that a successful industrial nation cannot allow itself to be organised like a collective leisure park.' The questions he is raising do not simply concern the quality and duration of education, the need to cap social spending with an ageing population in which one in three people will be over 60 by the year 2030, and the need for more flexible working hours and labour mobility. German unification has to be made to work rapidly if the annual drain of at least DM150bn in resources from west to east is to cease putting an intolerable strain on the exchequer. The proportion of taxation and social insurance contributions in the national income is expected to reach 52 per cent this year. 'It was always obvious that unification would lead to an extraordinary demand for taxation and social contributions,' says Mr Gert Haller, the new state secretary in the Finance Ministry. 'As soon as possible, we must offer the prospect of this tax burden coming down.' How long it will take for east Germany to achieve self-sustaining growth is the great unknown factor. In the meantime, there can be no let-up in the belt-tightening in the west. Tackling the inflexibilities - whether in working hours or energy supply - requires political decision-making, which is one commodity in desperately short supply. Political debate in Germany is eternal, as the parties, the federal government and the 16 states, negotiate interminably to reach a consensus. The lack of decisions is a certain factor behind a growing political disaffection in the population at large, demonstrated by rising support for protest parties in the polls. And next year, Germany faces no fewer than 19 separate elections. The great concern is that the dissatisfaction with the entire political establishment will see a rise of the far-right wing parties, such as the Republicans. So far it has been expressed more in non-voting, in support for protest parties of the left, such as the Greens, or in votes for local interest groups. The most dangerous moment for Mr Kohl is in next year's European elections in June, when voters feel least constrained by traditional loyalties. When it comes to the national poll in October, the chancellor is adamant that the Republicans will fail to get the five per cent they need for seats in the Bundestag. Domestic issues seem certain to dominate and decide those polls: jobs, law and order, housing and immigration are all key concerns. Mr Kohl remains totally committed to the process of European integration, but he wins little applause on the issue, even from his party faithful. The worry that the mighty D-Mark may be replaced by a less stable European currency in 1999 is certainly no vote-winner, and the far right parties are exploiting that concern for all they are worth. And yet for all the doubts and fears, the fundamental nature of the current debate is seen by most as positive. 'I think it will work out as an advantage that we are publicly debating our shortcomings,' says Mr Horst Kohler, chief executive of the German savings banks' association, and Mr Haller's predecessor as financial state secretary. 'I think we will be able to make some corrections. We have not yet gone far enough. A lot of things need to be corrected in the direction of more flexibility. I am convinced we have a problem with German self-confidence. It is not very strong. In Standort Deutschland, we list all our short-comings, and then people think: 'poor Germany'. 'But the basic structure of our economy is better placed than many, especially with the high proportion of small businesses. The financial sector is a major source of strength. It is decentralised, stable and sound. It is not in our interest to be at the leading edge of financial innovation. 'We should encourage more transparency, and we need more competition. We are too inflexible with regard to hierarchies. We need to organise society so that everybody has the feeling of participation, of injecting ideas and creativeness into concrete projects. That is the challenge, not simply cutting costs.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lyudmila Beldyugina, Stavropol: "Elections in </F> the Regions: A Little More, and They Will Get Into a  Hand-to-Hand Fight...."]    [Text] Once again, the Inner Council of people's deputies  unanimously (with one abstention) affirmed its former decision  regarding the numerical size of the State Duma of Stavropol  Kray, whose elections are scheduled for 27 March.    What is more, the deputies decided to turn to the judicial  organs, including the appeals and supervisory courts with  complaint statements about declaring invalid the decree of the  electoral commission of the kray on the elections to local  organs of authority "Concerning the Organization of 25 Electoral  Districts" and its other decrees that were adopted in defiance  of the kray council.    The Inner Council also sent documents to the Supreme Soviet  of the Russian Federation, appealing against a decision of the  kray people's court, which refused to examine its complaint to  the kray electoral commission. Thus, the dispute between the  representative and executive branches of authority in the kray  has entered a more acute phase.    The gist of the delayed and by no means concluded dispute is  the following. In January of this year, already not for the  first time, the Inner Council once again ratified the decision:  Forty-two deputies will work on a permanent basis in the State  Duma of Stavropol Kray. But the administration of the kray is  insisting on 25, of which, in its opinion, only 10 deputies  should work on a permanent basis, and it is also insisting on  increasing the percentage of signatures of voters for the  nomination of candidates for deputy from 3 to 5 percent.    These proposals were interpreted by members of the Inner  Council as a frank desire of the current administration to form  an obedient representative authority that it had in its pocket.  After all, the more signatures that future candidates will have  to collect, the easier it will be for the executive authority,  which has a powerful apparatus, to push its own people into key  posts, mainly heads of local administrations, believes Yevgeniy  Borodin, a member of the kray council and an activist of the  Democratic Russia movement. Many kray, oblast, and city dumas  are being formed today according to this principle. He reported  that after a meeting of the Inner Council, which affirmed its  previous decisions, the deputies learned about the decree of the  head of kray administration, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, in which the  numerical size of the future duma of 25 deputies apparently is  legalized. The kray electoral commission is also adopting a  similar decree to please the governor.    Briefly, the elections are just around the corner, but the  dispute is heating up in earnest. The people's deputies believe  that the 25 districts--according to the number of candidates for  deputy--that were organized by the kray commission are illegal  and that the competence of the deputies in them can be disputed,  which creates a basis for the instability of future authorities  and the sociopolitical situation in the kray.    "Supporting our assumptions that the kray administration  will  create an obedient authority is the fact that the first  registered candidates for deputy of the kray duma are entirely  representatives of executive authority," asserts Ye. Borodin.</p>

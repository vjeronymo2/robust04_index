			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE WORDS HISPANIC AND LATINO  </P> <P> Calendar's recent articles on La Raza prompt me to try to clarify why the  distinction between the word Hispanic and the word Latino is important.  </P> <P> The people who are currently in power in this country are mostly of  northwestern European ancestry. After the Renaissance, the English were locked  in a struggle with Spain and Portugal over the dominion of the Western  Hemisphere.  </P> <P> Spaniards were the frame of reference for the English who came to the New  World, and, deluded by the language there, Anglos called the natives Hispanics,  even if they were Spanish-speaking Indians, with whom the criollos intermarried  soon enough.  </P> <P> This had the convenient effect of negating the existence of the indigenous  people, who numbered and continued to number in the millions (there are today 1  million Nahuatl speakers in Mexico alone, according to Encyclopaedia  Britannica).  </P> <P> This ties in neatly with the (false) rationale that there were almost no  Indians in the New World, that the land was empty and for the taking. It  ignores the obvious achievements of the Indians, making them invisible --  unpersons.  </P> <P> Yet the fact remains that the genetic pool of the non-Anglos on the North  American continent is overwhelmingly Indian. The famous dark skin, which Anglos  are almost at pains to point out, did not come from the Moor.  </P> <P> Spaniards were feared and hated by native peoples, and revolutions were fought  to throw off the yoke of exploitation over most of the continent. To call  someone (who is not a Spaniard) Hispanic is simply an insult.  </P> <P> Why is Latino correct? First of all, because that is what we call ourselves. It  is not a word given to us by people who are historically hostile to us.  </P> <P> It acknowledges the use of French, Portuguese and Spanish, all widely spoken in  the hemisphere, and it affirms our American-ness -- that is, our Indian-ness.  </P> <P>  Latinoamericano is a word to be used with pride. Latinos have fought  injustice, repelled foreign invasions, and have, for the most part, replaced  feudalism with liberal republics. We have won Nobel prizes and made outstanding  contributions in art, science and medicine, as well as contributed to the  wealth of the world with our labors.  </P> <P> If we are called Hispanics, however, all this is negated. We are no more  Spaniards than Bush is British.  </P> <P> How would U.S. Americans feel if all their achievements were considered to be  European, and not native?  </P> <P> I salute The Times for using the word Latino.  </P> <P> ANTONIO BERNAL  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

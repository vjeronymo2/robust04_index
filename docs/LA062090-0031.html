			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS TO NARROW LIST OF CAMPUS SITES  </P> <P> Officials of California State University said Tuesday that they hope to choose  three or four possible sites for a campus in Ventura County by Oct. 1.  </P> <P> A Sacramento consulting firm, EIP Associates, will study each site's effect on  pollution, traffic, water use and other services.  </P> <P> The firm should recommend a site to the Cal State trustees by July 1, 1991,  said David E. Leveille, the university director of institutional relations.  </P> <P>  "We have our list of 31 sites still on the table, and if there are additional  sites offered, they would be part of the review process as well," Leveille  said.  </P> <P> Trustees decided in Long Beach on Monday that the Taylor Ranch, formerly the  preferred site for the campus, will now be one of the final three or four.  </P> <P> Trustees withdrew their support for the 465-acre ranch property west of the  city of Ventura after uncooperative owners threatened a lengthy court battle  over the property. The trustees said they were also influenced by community  opposition to the site and division on the Ventura City Council.  </P> <P> The university has formed a committee of Ventura County people that includes  mayors and city government staff members as well as opponents and supporters of  the Taylor Ranch site.

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has urged UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to issue a new report to reflect  realistically the Turkish Cypriot side's approach on the package  of confidence-building measures. Describing the resolution to  be adopted by the UN Security Council as important, Denktas said  that the future of the talks will depend on it.    President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's deputy special representative, this afternoon.  Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur,  Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit, Under  Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozer Koray, Presidential  Advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun, and Adviser on  Special Political Affairs [title as heard] John Paul Cavanaugh  attended the meeting.    In a statement after the meeting, which lasted nearly an  hour, President Denktas said the Turkish Cypriot side wants the  UN secretary general to change the untrue and unjust views he  has included in his report against the Turkish Cypriot side.    [Begin Denktas recording] We worked with Gustave Feissel on  31 May. We gave him a memorandum that removed all the problems.  However, the UN secretary general's report is dated 30 May. It  does not refer to the work carried out on 31 May. It blamed and  even insulted the Turkish Cypriot side. Naturally, that state  of affairs has drawn our attention. We have invited Gustave  Feissel here to ask him that a new report be drawn up to inform  the UN Security Council that the Turkish Cypriot side is  prepared to agree to the map [on Varosha] and the views on the  access road to that area on the condition that the agreement  that was reached in the Vienna talks is included in the main  document. We hope that this is done. [end recording]    A correspondent asked Denktas whether the UN Security  Council  will adopt a resolution. He replied:    [Begin Denktas recording] A resolution may or may not be  adopted. If a resolution is to be adopted, then we want it to  be done realistically. The new resolution should not be slanted  toward the view expressed in the first report that the Turkish  Cypriot side lacks the will to reach reconciliation and  establish peace. It must be based on the view that the Turkish  Cypriot side has used its will in a constructive way until the  last moment and has submitted constructive proposals that have  safeguarded the Turkish Cypriot people's rights. That must be  realized. We want a new resolution to be adopted reflecting  this. The resolution to be adopted can either kill or  facilitate the negotiating process. [end recording]    On his part, Gustave Feissel said after the meeting that he  will convey President Denktas' message to the UN secretary  general. Feissel declined to respond to a question on whether a  supplementary report can be drawn up. Meanwhile, Turkish  Cypriot journalists protested that Feissel either declined to  reply to their questions or gave evasive answers. They recalled  that, although he declined to reply to their questions on the  talks, he made disclosures to the Greek Cypriot journalists as  soon as he crossed into the Greek Cypriot side. Feissel claimed  that this was not true.</p>

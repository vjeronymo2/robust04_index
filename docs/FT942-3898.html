			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Dirty laundry - Reading Matter Sticking a real US dollar bill on the front cover of a book is almost guaranteed to get an author noticed; unfortunately it is equally likely to mean the book itself is so bad it needs that kind of hype to get anyone interested. The Laundrymen purports to tell the inside story of 'the world's third largest business'; hyping bad books certainly looks like becoming the world's second largest business. It does nothing of the sort. The Dollars 1 on the front cover is said to have a high statistical chance of containing traces of cocaine; on that basis you would need about 500 copies of this book to be able to conclude 'gee, that was a wow of a read'. Sure, laundering money is a hugely-troubling phenomenon, destructive of lives, economies, nations. And an authoritative book on the subject would be a major event. So what is the problem with this one? Leaving aside some of the more egregious factual errors - I would relish the chance of flying in a 'Leerjet' (page 61), for example - its central flaw is, ironically, in keeping with the subject matter. For Jeffrey Robinson - or his publisher - encourages readers to think they are getting something new, insightful and challenging. Whereas what is actually on offer is a rather shoddily-written cuttings' job. Robinson knows his way round the world's databases; he has sifted them all, it feels, in the effort to track down established, already written-up, cases of clearly proved money-laundering. For anyone interested in the subject, there is nothing here which has not already been thoroughly cooked up elsewhere. Robinson holds up for display - not contempt, exactly - a global rogue's gallery of convicted criminals. But throughout I found myself asking: where are the footnotes? That is not pedantry; in a book of this sort, we need to be convinced that all the stuff which does not come from cuttings is credible. Of course, Robinson can - and does - fall back on the defence of confidentiality, though I did not have confidence in his deserving my trust. One example from many possibilities, Robinson writes that 'apparently he's (Fidel Castro) also approached the Chinese and the North Koreans, proposing to help them develop their nuclear capacity in exchange for oil.' That apparently speaks worrying volumes. Most peculiarly of all, Robinson's style and tone clearly indicates that he is half in love with the fast car, rich lifestyle, globe-trotting image of the unsavoury characters he writes about. Imagine Hello magazine doing a photo-spread on a Colombian drug baron; if that's your idea of a good read, buy this book instantly. The Laundrymen. By Jeffrey Robinson. Published by Simon &amp; Schuster. 340pp, price Pounds 17.99</p>

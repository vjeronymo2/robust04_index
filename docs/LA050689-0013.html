			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECOVERED OR RECOVERING: THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> Well, it has happened again. There was another story of how an athlete has  overcome his drug and alcohol addiction to once again perform up to his  "potential."  </P> <P> It wasn't too long ago that The Times featured Houston McTear and how well he  was doing. But when he was arrested and charged with drug possession, there  were only a couple of lines.  </P> <P> Now there is this story about Orlando Woolridge.  </P> <P> I hope that all of these people really do make it on their roads to recovery,  but doesn't the newspaper do them a big disservice and put pressure on them by  saying that they have recovered?  </P> <P> The truth is that they are only recovering.  </P> <P> HARVEY J. GLASS  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P> <P>  Editor's note: In neither the McTear story nor the Woolridge story did The  Times say, or even suggest, that either athlete was recovered from his drug  problem, only that each was trying to deal with it. The Times, too, hopes that  those with drug problems really do make it on their roads to recovery but is  not so naive as to believe that they are anything more than recovering.  </P> <P> </P></p>

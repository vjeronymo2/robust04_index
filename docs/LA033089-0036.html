			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Beckman Laser Institute, a private medical research organization closely  affiliated with UC Irvine, has entered into partnership with USC to compete for  a $15-million federal grant to develop a new laser technology. USC officials  confirmed that there have been discussions about relocating the Beckman  Institute, which now leases property on the UCI campus, to Los Angeles, but  said work could continue at both sites if USC beats six other universities  seeking the Department of Defense grant. The Institute's participation "helps  tremendously" USC's chances of winning the grant, according to Pablo Valencia,  a USC biomedical engineer and coordinator of the project.  </P></p>

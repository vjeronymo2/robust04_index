			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (10): Place to be pampered - The Plaza Athenee, classically 'haute Parisiene' and probably the prettiest of the city's luxury hotels THE Plaza Athenee is a seductive blend of the old and the new, with early 19th century directories decking the corridors and cascades of fresh flowers. The Plaza is also far smaller than most of the other grand Paris hotels - with just 220 rooms and an army of 400 staff - so the atmosphere is more intimate and you feel pleasantly pampered throughout your stay. The aesthetics are classically haute parisienne - with stucco flurries on the ceilings and marble fireplaces in the rooms - but never too formal and never, ever kitsch. The Plaza is also adept at tiny finishing touches. The monthly bills for its flowers are said to be higher than those for electricity. The rooms themselves are amply proportioned, at least by Parisian standards. The bathrooms are bliss - meticulously renovated 1930s marble with big baths, steamy showers, heaps of thick, white towels and lovely old-fashion toiletries blended specially for the hotel. All the rooms are sound-proofed, so you can sleep in peace even in those overlooking the busy Avenue Montaigne. The most expensive rooms are those on the Avenue, where the upper floors have stunning views over the rooftops to the river islands and the Left Bank. But the garden rooms are lovely looking out over the pretty frieze of ampelopsis and rosy red geraniums in the courtyard which looks as though it could be anywhere other than a city centre. In the summer you can dine al fresco in the courtyard to the strains of a string quartet. A harpist plays each day at tea-time in the 1930s ocean liner-like Relais-Plaza restaurant. The food at the Relais-Plaza, or its counterpart, the Regence-Plaza, is not sensational. But both restaurants score highly on ambience, the Relais-Plaza for its Art Deco decor and the Regence-Plaza, for grandeur. They also rate well on snob appeal as favourite haunts of the fashion designers along Avenue Montaigne. Meanwhile the Bar Anglais, where Marlene Dietrich liked to take cocktails and the scene of Mata Hari's arrest, is now a discreet retreat in carefully polished leather and wood. The bustle of the Champs-Elysees is only a stone's throw away and the designer shops of Avenue Montaigne are on the doorstep, so women guests can pop out to treat themselves at Chanel, Christian Dior or Christian Lacroix after a busy working day. Plaza Athenee, 25 avenue Montaigne, 75008. Tel: 4723 7833. Rooms: FFr 2,530 to FFr3,170. Suites: FFr5,800 to FFr8,770.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleh Hrusdzilovich on a news conference by </F> Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb; place and  date not given: "The CIS Has Prospects. Stanislaw Bahdankevich  Does Not Violate Laws"]    [Text] CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya and  Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb, who returned  from St. Petersburg, where they participated in the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, organized a news conference for  journalists.    Myacheslaw Hryb opened the press conference with a joke  saying that the journalists were so occupied with the  presidential race that they almost forgot about the Supreme  Soviet chairman. Myacheslaw Hryb assessed the agreements signed  in St. Petersburg and answered a range of questions. The  Supreme Soviet chairman was convinced that interest in him and  his personal opinions on some pressing issues of our life did  not decrease. We paid attention to five key questions which  Myacheslaw Hryb had to answer: on CIS prospects, on the  initiative -- regarding the creation of the Eurasian union -- of  the Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, on unexpected  changes in prices for bread, and on National Bank Chairman  Stanislaw Bahdankevich's recent moves.    "Our St. Petersburg meeting was very fruitful. In my  opinion, work aimed at strengthening the CIS has sense, and the  CIS has prospects," is how Supreme Soviet chairman answered the  first question. Following are his words regarding Nazarbayev's  initiative: "The president of Kazakhstan proposes two versions  of the so-called Eurasian union -- mild and tough -- with which  we should acquaint our society. What I like in this proposal is  that it plans to set a union of states with equal rights.  Under these conditions, the obligations of the allies would be  more specified because the union does not foresee associate  membership. In my opinion, this proposal does not run counter  to the CIS. However, I would like to emphasize that the  attitude of the CIS leaders toward this initiative is different.    "I think that we should not change the text of the  Constitution," stated Myacheslaw Hryb regarding the monetary  merger. He confirmed his earlier position which is that the  state requires a tough Constitution because only such a  constitution can be respected. Myacheslaw Hryb said that when he  spoke earlier with president Yeltsin, they agreed that the  fifth, and, probably, the eighth clauses of the agreement could  be redrafted. However, the text of the agreement was submitted  to Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin and work halted for a while.    As for the unexpected changes in prices for bread and some  other foodstuffs, Myacheslaw Hryb said: "The government adopted  this decision when I was in St. Petersburg. My personal opinion  is that currently we cannot do without state management of the  economy. The majority of enterprises are state-owned but the  state cannot even affect the prices for products of these  enterprises."    "We exercised juridical expertise regarding recent decisions  adopted by the National Bank. It confirmed that everything was  done within the limits of competence," said the Supreme Soviet  chairman in reply to the last question. "As for Stanislaw  Bahdankevich who adopted presidential candidate Stanislaw  Shushkevich's proposal to head his `shadow' cabinet, this is his  personal affair. By the way, former Interior Minister Yladzimir  Yahoraw also joined the Shushkevich team and became his campaign  manager. Well, this is their personal position."</p>

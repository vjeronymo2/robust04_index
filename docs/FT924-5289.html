			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Positive reasons for financial intervention Sir, The FT of November 25 was an object lesson in the power and application of market-distorting financial intervention, the positive reasons for it and the continued lack of government commitment to its necessary application to the UK's manufacturing industry. Your leader concerning the European steel industry quite rightly says that subsidised inefficient capacity could destroy lower subsidised efficient capacity. I agree. But this is exactly what has been allowed to happen at large to the UK's manufacturing industry over the past 13 years as other competing countries have supported theirs. On the other hand, immediately adjacent to your leader is an article in which the government is shown perfectly happy to distort the market for television programmes by allowing the flat-rate TV licence to continue to support programmes which the market would not sustain. It is admitting that a free market would destroy 'good' television. I agree such distortion is necessary, but why only for the BBC? Finally, on page 10 you report the Department of Trade and Industry's 'exports strategy'. It is naive to believe that this Pounds 10bn increase will not itself cause a substantial increase in imports which form a large part of our exports. As the DTI never tires of telling, the UK already exports 80 per cent more per head of population than Japan. Quite clearly it imports a great deal more, too. The real problem is one of import substitution. There are too few medium-sized manufacturing companies, the back-bone of manufacturing industry in Germany, Japan and Italy, and, therefore, too few British designed and manufactured products. Will the government be able to spot these links, I wonder? Andrew Allcock, 10 Friars Close, Tankerton, Whitstable, Kent CT5 1NU</p>

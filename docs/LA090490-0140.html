			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JAPAN ENDS BAN ON CARL LEWIS  </P> <P> Carl Lewis is no longer banned from competing in Japanese track meets, sponsors  for an upcoming meet said today.  </P> <P> Lewis, the world record holder in the 100-meter dash who won four gold medals  in the 1984 Olympics and two golds in the 1988 games, will race in the Toto  Super 90 track meet Sept. 15, the meet's organizing committee announced.  </P> <P> It will be Lewis' first race in Japan since May 14, 1989, when the Japan  Amateur Athletic Federation accused him of covering up a sponsor's name on the  number card on the back of his jersey.  </P> <P> After the meet, the federation lodged a "strong complaint" with its American  counterpart and informed Lewis that he would not be invited back except as part  of a U.S. international team.  </P> <P> "Mr. Lewis and the federation seem to have worked all that out," said an  organizing committee member who requested anonymity. "With the world  championships to be held in Tokyo (next year), I think they decided they had no  choice."  </P></p>

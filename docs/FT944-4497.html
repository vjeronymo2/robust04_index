			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / BSkyB to offer Disney Channel The Walt Disney Company said yesterday it had agreed with BSkyB to launch The Disney Channel as a subscription service next autumn. The animation and family-based entertainment channel will be available free to BSkyB subscribers who already take both premium film channels. The deal came the day before prices are set and shares allocated in the flotation of BSkyB, a venture in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, holds a 17.5 per cent stake. The offer is believed to have been five times oversubscribed. The launch of the channel in the UK will be the first in Europe under the Disney name. In January Walt Disney and CLT Multi Media, the Luxembourg-based international broadcasting company, will launch Super RTL, a German satellite channel specialising in family entertainment. Plans for Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television included the Disney channel and at one stage Mr Murdoch launched a Dollars 1.5bn lawsuit against Disney. Yesterday Mr Etienne de Villiers, president of Walt Disney Television International, said Sky represented 'a very viable distribution outlet'. The channel will be available to more than 2.5m homes by cable and satellite. In the US the Disney Channel is available to 8m homes.</p>

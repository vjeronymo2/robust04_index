			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, </F> Operation Turquoise commander, by Benoit Duquesne in Goma, Zaire  -- live]    [Text] [Duquesne] General Germanos said yesterday that the  situation was delicate because of tension at the roadblocks. Do  you agree with this description?    [Lafourcade] Obviously, Gen. Germanos is speaking of our  current deployment. It is always a difficult period because we  are setting up a large force 8,000 km away from France, and you  must understand that there are grounds for concern in an  operation of this nature. That being said, let me tell you that  everything is going well -- you can see this for yourself. The  UN resolution was adopted last Wednesday [22 June], I believe.  It is now Sunday, and more than 1,000 soldiers and 120 vehicles  have arrived here.    [Duquesne] Does this mean that this is only the start of the  operation, that you are carrying out reconnaissance missions in  Rwandan territory, and that you feel that the situation might  prove delicate for yourself and for your soldiers?    [Lafourcade] We immediately got in touch with the population  in a difficult situation in Rwanda, with refugee camps, although  our deployment is not even fully achieved. I believe that this  decision was the right one, since we have already been able to  reassure many refugees in a number of camps without going too  far into the north or the south of Rwanda.    [Duquesne] A last question. You are arriving in a region  controlled by government forces, where there are many Hutus. It  is known that many Tutsis or moderate Hutus have been murdered.  Don't you feel that you are coming a little late?    [Lafourcade] I will answer you like a soldier: A decision  was  made on Wednesday evening and there are already 1,000 soldiers  four days later; I believe I am not too late.    [Duquesne] You were quick, but politically, wasn't it too  late?    [Lafourcade] I should tell you that this is not my problem.  I believe that our political negotiators who were behind this  resolution wanted to ensure that the killings would be ended  before the arrival of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda]  II.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE AND SOUND NO MORE  </P> <P> It is difficult to describe the intense emotions I felt when I read John  Doyle's "Safe and Sound No More." It was the first time that someone has dared  to adequately describe the same painful feelings and emotions that I have  experienced. Doyle's story is so similar to mine that I could have written it.  I applaud his courage for sharing this important topic.  </P> <P> NAME WITHHELD  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary intends to continue the current policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the inclusion of books, supplies, and other equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation consistent with guidance given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to institutions that were required to use a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy because the institution had a default rate that exceeds 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent and was required to calculate a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student who received a loan under the FFEL programs. As is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently the case, an institution is required to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full amount of charges for equipment in the calculation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund if a separate charge exists for the equipment by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or if the institution requires the student to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase the equipment from a certain vendor. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that by charging students a separate equipment charge or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by requiring students to purchase the equipment from a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vendor (for example, a school book store) the equipment charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are being mandated by the institution and should be treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional costs. In effect, the institution is the sole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of the equipment. If an institution does not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate charge for equipment and the student has the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing the equipment from more than one source, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would not have to include the equipment charge in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation. An institution would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to demonstrate that its students have the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing the equipment from other sources that are easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible to the student and that the students are advised that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an option is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to allow an institution to subtract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the refund to a student any charges for equipment (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> books and supplies) that a student could have returned for credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but did not do so. Under this provision, there would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate charge for the equipment, and the student must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually have obtained the equipment but failed to return the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment within 20 days after his or her withdrawal. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was suggested by one of the negotiators and is based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon California law. By consensus of the negotiators, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would be extended to situations where the equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies are sold by an affiliate or related entity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. If the student does not return the equipment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution could subtract from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund owed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student the documented cost to the institution of equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued to the student. The student would be liable for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the amount of the student's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, if some or all of the equipment is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually received by the student, the institution would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation 100 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount paid for that portion of the equipment. Further, if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution gives a student the option to return the equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution would not be permitted to subtract the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equipment from the refund to the student if the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses to return the equipment and does so within 20 days of his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or her withdrawal. The Secretary believes that 20 days provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student with a sufficient period of time to return equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without delaying the refund to the student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that any equipment returned by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student must be in good condition allowing for reasonable wear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tear. The Secretary notes that there may be restrictions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under State laws that prevent an institution from accepting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned equipment due to health and sanitary reasons. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions might also limit the return of equipment. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, a workbook that has been written in or a damaged text  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> book might not be reusable. The Secretary solicits comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether this provision should be expanded to identify other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that could affect the institution's ability to reissue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that, because an institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the charges listed above in the calculation of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund and is then permitted to subtract the charges or a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the charges from this refund, in many cases it appears that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution could retain more than the actual charge to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student. For example, if an institution that charges a $100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative fee calculates a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund to a student, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the $100 charge would be refunded to the student in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund formula, and a portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charge would be retained by the institution. Yet, in addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution could then be permitted to subtract the full $100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the refund to the student. The Secretary requests comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on whether it may be more appropriate to require institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude these charges from the refund calculation entirely rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than subtracting the charge after performing the calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also requests comment on whether some other means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be adopted to eliminate this potential ``double counting''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of determining a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to exclude from the ``room charges'' that are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the refund calculation, any room charges for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-campus housing that are passed through the institution in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their entirety to an entity that is not under the control of,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to, or affiliated with the institution. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that an institution may enter into an agreement with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an outside agency to provide lodging for students. Under such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement, the institution is merely a conduit that passes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room charges along to the other entity, yet those charges appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as institutional charges on student accounts. In these cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the independence of the entities and the students' continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to occupy the housing after the students withdraw warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exclusion of the room charges from the refund calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to exclude from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation charges for group health insurance that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory for all students in the calculation of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund so long as the coverage remains in effect for the students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the period for which the student was charged. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary notes that the inclusion of these group health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance charges in the refund calculation could cancel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance coverage that might otherwise be extended to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student beyond the student's withdrawal date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt  complained of "fossilized welfare state structures" today. He  said before the German World Economic Association today in  Berlin that the "ossification of institutions and behavior  patterns in our society" were delaying the necessary structural  adjustments and jeopardizing the competitiveness of German  industry.    The far-reaching changes in the global economy were a  challenge to the Western world. The technological advantage of  the old industrial countries was shrinking. The European and  German superiority in the quality of work could no longer be  taken for granted.    In Germany, said Rexrodt, the economy in the new eastern  states was noticeably catching up with that in the West,  "despite all prophecies of doom". It was particularly  gratifying to note that the processing industry, which had so  far "lagged behind", was now catching up. This could be seen  from the increase in incoming contracts and strong production  growth of just under eight percent in 1993.</p>

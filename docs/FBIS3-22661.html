Jean Francois Girard, director general of health in the  French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and City, told a news  conference that the one-day summit will bring together heads of  at least 17 nations to consider ways to fight the AIDS epidemic  on a global level.    "Till now, health problems have been treated by doctors, but  AIDS is too serious to be treated only by doctors," Girard said.    "For the first time in the history of the world, heads of  government will be considering a health problem. It will be a  historic turning point."    Girard visited the Health and Welfare Ministry on Monday and  the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday to explain the goals and solicit  participation.    He said the 17 countries to be invited include those whose  contribution to the international fight against AIDS is the  greatest. Among them are Australia, Canada, France, Japan,  Russia, the Scandinavian countries and the United States.    He said United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  has indicated he would like to attend.    Girard said several international organizations, including  the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Education,  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the U.N.  Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Fund for Population  Activities (UNFPA) and the World Bank will have input into  planning the summit agenda.    He said experts in many other AIDS-affected countries who  are  not invited will be consulted at the preparatory stage.    French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will chair the  summit,  for which no final date has been set.    The gathering was originally scheduled for June, but Girard  said it was postponed because many heads of state could not come  in June and because Japan will host an international meeting of  AIDS experts, including doctors, researchers, and AIDS  sufferers, in Yokohama in August.    About 10,000 people from more than 140 countries, including  some 1,000 AIDS patients and carriers of the AIDS-causing human  immunodeficiency virus, are expected to attend the Yokohama  meeting.    Girard said the Paris AIDS summit will be able to capitalize  on decisions made at the Yokohama conference.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Domestic oil price to double as production slide continues THE RUSSIAN government will next week more than double the controlled domestic price for oil to boost support for the ailing oil production sector, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy, announced yesterday. He also forecast that oil production would total 395m to 397m tonnes this year, down from 460m the previous year. Exports would reach 57m-58m tonnes, half of which would be delivered to hard currency-paying countries beyond the former Soviet Union. He gave no comparative figure for the previous year, when the Soviet Union was still one country and exported 53.9m tonnes. He dismissed reports that Russia had suspended deliveries of oil products to Japan and western Europe. But he confirmed that the government planned to centralise exports next year to meet its international obligations better. Mr Chernomyrdin said the new domestic price would be about Rbs4,000-5,000 a tonne, up from the current range of Rbs1,800-2,200. 'If we continue with present prices, the industry will be indebted to the tune of Rbs170bn by the end of the year,' he said. The government was still working out a mechanism for how the new pricing system would work, he said. Despite the liberalisation of most other prices since January, energy and fuel prices have remained regulated in order to protect industry from an oil price shock. While the industry's costs have gone up its revenues have remained fixed. An additional problem is that even at the present prices, enterprises and refineries within Russia and other former Soviet republics have found it difficult to pay for oil deliveries and have continued to receive supplies none the less. At his first major news conference since his appointment in June, Mr Chernomyrdin said his strategy for overhauling the energy sector had been approved at a government session yesterday. Although he did not go into details, nothing of what he said suggested a major departure from the policies of his young predecessor, Mr Vladimir Lopukhin. And while he regretted the freezing of the funds of oil and other types of joint ventures in Vneshekonombank, the state-owned bank that once had a monopoly of foreign currency operations, he held out little comfort to the victims, saying his priority was to make sure this never happened again. Mr Chernomyrdin added that despite President Boris Yeltsin's last minute decision to call off what was supposed to be a ground-breaking trip to Japan, Moscow still expected to receive about Dollars 1.4bn in new Japanese financing to overhaul its gas industry and purchase drilling equipment. But he also suggested to an incredulous audience that delays in drawing up new agreements for Japanese companies to take part in additional oil and gas tenders off Sakhalin island had been one of the reasons for the postponement of the presidential trip.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Former Tory flagship fires warning shot The defeat of the Conservative candidates in the last two parliamentary by-elections at Newbury and Christchurch was enough for Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, to reach for the champagne, irrespective of her party's poor third place. If the pattern is repeated in Eastleigh, there will be no such celebration for Labour. For once, the interest in the Hampshire by-election is as much about who comes second as who wins. The by-election, expected on June 9, was called after the death in February of the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan. Reading their election literature, Eastleigh's constituents could be forgiven for forgetting that the Conservatives are defending what was once regarded as a safe seat. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are running their campaigns on the assumption that the Conservative vote has already collapsed. For a constituency which had a 17,702 Tory majority at the last general election, that appears to be a big assumption. But there is ample evidence to suggest that the two main opposition parties are not indulging in wishful thinking. From the plush northern suburbs around Chandler's Ford, known locally as 'gin and Jaguar' territory, to the southern opulence of the marina in Hamble-le-Rice, it is surprisingly difficult to find anyone who admits to be planning to vote Conservative. Mr John Major may shrug off a defeat in Eastleigh as a typical bout of mid-term blues  - the familiar story of the loss of a safe seat in a by-election which returns to the Tory fold at the next general election. But if the Conservative candidate, Mr Stephen Reid, can no longer rely on the goodwill, let alone the loyalty, of the regulars in Hamble's pubs and clubs, then the prime minister should know that something is seriously wrong. The mere mention of 'the C word' at Hamble's King and Queen public house, which subscribes to Yachting Monthly, is enough to ignite a storm of protest. Lifelong Tories fume about the government's 'treachery over taxation', complain that there are few signs of recovery, express anger at the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and laugh in dismay at the recent row over qualified majority voting in Europe. Almost all defecting Tories say they will vote Liberal Democrat, though with little enthusiasm for, or understanding of what the party stands for. The Liberal Democrats came second in the last three general elections in Eastleigh and out-polled Labour in the recent county and borough elections, but the Labour candidate, Mrs Marilyn Birks, is fighting for every vote. Even the Liberal Democrats would not deny that there is a core Labour vote in parts of the constituency. It is mostly concentrated in the Woolston ward, which is in Southampton. But the northern part of the constituency tells a different story. Many workers from the British Rail maintenance works  - which gave Eastleigh its reputation as a railway town  - are more determined to give the government 'a bloody nose' than to vote positively for one of the opposition parties. In the Comrades and Unity working men's clubs there is talk of voting for the Liberal Democrats as the best-placed party to take the seat. In spite of the recent visit of members of the shadow cabinet to the Unity Club, Mr Ray Chapman, a 21-year-old mechanical worker, strikes a chord with many of his friends when he says he will vote Liberal Democrat 'because they are the best lot to get the Tories out'. Try as Labour does to focus the campaign on the Liberal Democrat's record on the county council  - alleging incompetence and waste and criticising them for environmental problems surrounding the airport  - there is no evidence that people are more interested in local issues. The by-election is seen as a referendum on Mr Major's government. Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, stands to be the main beneficiary of such a contest. He accuses Mrs Beckett of keeping the 'vintage champagne' on ice in case the Tories make a late recovery. Notwithstanding the campaigning talents of Mrs Birks, Labour is unlikely to have much to celebrate from the Eastleigh result.</p>

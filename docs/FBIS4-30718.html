			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report, on the evening of 27 June  600 Red Wa soldiers, armed by a Burmese Government force in  Tachilek, attacked the (Pakae) camp which is located on (Pakae)  hill about two km from (Huanam Mae Kham) village in Burma and  about three km from Ban Thoetthai, Tambon Thoetthai, Mae Fa  Luang Subdistrict, Thailand's Chiang Rai Province. The attack  resulted in 20 Red Wa soldiers being killed and 32 wounded,  while the Khun Sa force suffered 20 killed and seven wounded.  The Khun Sa force, however, successfully defended its base  after thirty minutes of fighting and seized several weapons from  the attackers.    The clash was the first such incident after the signing of  the peace accord in May by independent ethnic minority forces  which oppose the Burmese Government. The Khun Sa force,  however, does not have such an accord with the Burmese  Government. The other ethnic minority groups hope that the Red  Wa will keep its pledge to them.    On the same evening, a ceremony was held in Tachilek to  welcome new recruits who will join seven battalions of the 55th  Division under Major General Swu Tun, commander of the Eastern  Military Command, which came from Rangoon and Toungoo. The new  augmented force is likely to participate in renewed fighting in  the area.</p>

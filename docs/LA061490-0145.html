			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE PARK: VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK 13000 SAYRE ST., SYLMAR  </P> <P> Size: 96 acres  </P> <P> Facilities: Art gallery, picnic and group camping areas, Frisbee golf, disabled  adults center  </P> <P> Hours: 8 a.m.-sunset  </P> <P> Information: (818) 367-1957  </P> <P> Mary Dahlsten remembers the peaceful setting of the San Fernando Veterans  Hospital.  </P> <P> "They used to call it the 'country club of veterans hospitals,' " said  Dahlsten, 73, who has lived half a mile from the 96-acre site of the hospital  complex in Sylmar since 1948.  </P> <P> "I remember the patients would sit out on the lawn during the day and feed the  squirrels."  </P> <P> The peaceful setting was suddenly shattered on Feb. 9, 1971, at 6:01 a.m., when  a 6.6 earthquake destroyed almost all of the buildings in the complex.  Forty-nine patients, nurses and other hospital workers were killed.  </P> <P> Today, except for a memorial plaque embedded in a rock, there is no indication  that this was once the site of a tragedy. The ruins of the hospital were long  ago hauled away and much of the land re-landscaped and turned into Veterans  Memorial Park.  </P> <P> The park's most notable man-made feature is Century Gallery, a small art space  in one of only two structures on the site to survive the earthquake. Hours of  operation for the gallery, which features work by local artists, are severely  restricted because of funding limitations.  </P> <P> "We used to have a lot of programs but it's mostly just a park now," gallery  curator Priscilla Nielsen said as she gazed out the window of her office. "I  look at the trees and hills and grass and try to imagine what it was like when  the hospital was here." DAVID COLKER  </P></p>

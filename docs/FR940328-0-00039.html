			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Predation of Hawaii's native vegetation by goats and the extensive damage caused by them have been well documented (Tomich 1986, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Although browsing by goats is not confirmed for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperomannia arborescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  population on Molokai, such activity probably occurs, owing to the large number of goats in the vicinity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two rat taxa,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rattus rattus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (black rat) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> R. exulans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Polynesian rat), and to a lesser extent other introduced rodents, eat large, fleshy fruits and strip the bark of some native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Tomich 1986, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1985). Predation of plants in the bellflower and African violet families that have fleshy stems and fruits has been reported (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Rats probably eat the fruits of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea truncata, Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha, Lobelia oahuensis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rollandia crispa, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  all of which produce fleshy fruits and stems and grow in areas where rats occur (J. Lau and J. Obata, pers. comms., 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Little is known about the predation of certain rare Hawaiian plants by slugs, particularly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Milax gagantes, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is found in wet montane habitats (Howarth 1985). Indiscriminate predation by slugs on plant parts of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lobelia oahuensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and particularly the fruits of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rollandia crispa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has been observed; field botanists believe that the effect of slugs on the decline of these and related taxa may be significant (S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). Slugs pose a serious threat to these two species because they chew through the stems and eat the fruit, reducing the vigor of the plant and limiting the number of seeds for germination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of the 11 plant taxa in this final rule, a total of 8 have populations located on privately owned land, 10 on State land, and 4 on Federal land. One taxon is located exclusively on private land and one is found only on State land. No State laws or existing regulatory mechanisms at the present time effectively protect or prevent further decline of these plant taxa on private land. However, Hawaii State laws relating to the conservation of biological resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sec. 195D&hyph;5(a)). State regulations prohibit the removal, destruction, or damage of plants found on State lands. Despite the existence of State laws and regulations which give protection to Hawaii's native plants, their enforcement is difficult due to limited funding and personnel. Federal listing automatically invokes listing under Hawaii State law, which prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies (HRS, sec. 195D&hyph;4). Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the (Federal) Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter *&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS, sec. 195D&hyph;4(a)). Further, the State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sec. 195D&hyph;5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Endangered Species Act (State Cooperative Agreements). Listing of these 11 plant taxa reinforces and supplements the protection available under the State Endangered Species Act and other laws. The Federal Endangered Species Act also offers additional protection to these 11 plant taxa because it is a violation to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The small number of populations and individuals of most of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. Three of the plant taxa in this final rule,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chamaesyce deppeana, Cyanea truncata, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra crenata, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are known from a single population. Five other taxa are known from only two to five populations (See Table 1). Ten of the 11 plant taxa are estimated to number no more than 100 known individuals. Four of those taxa,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyanea truncata, Cyrtandra crenata, Cyrtandra polyantha, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Melicope lydgatei, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are estimated to number no more than 10 individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

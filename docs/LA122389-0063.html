			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT HAS LONG BEEN MERE FACADE FOR RULE BY THE MILITARY  </P> <P> Ever since the late Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Panama's last honestly elected  president, was deposed by the old National Guard in October, 1968, civilian  government in that country has functioned as a facade for military rule.  </P> <P> A so-called National Assembly of Representatives, a body of 510 elected  community delegates, drafted a new constitution in 1972 and named a civilian to  be president. But it gave dictatorial powers to Gen. Omar Torrijos, the  National Guard officer who had emerged as the nation's ruler after the 1968  coup. Torrijos was killed in an aviation accident in 1981.  </P> <P> Two years later, Torrijos' chief of intelligence, Manuel A. Noriega, became  commander of the National Guard -- by then renamed the Panama Defense Forces --  and effective ruler of Panama.  </P> <P> So-called democracy under the 1972 constitution was restored in 1984 with the  election of a civilian president and a 67-member unicameral Legislative  Assembly in tainted balloting. But Noriega remained the boss, ousting every  civilian president who crossed him and reducing the Legislative Assembly to a  rubber-stamp function.  </P> <P> When last May's elections appeared likely to give Noriega's foes the presidency  and significant influence in the Legislative Assembly, the dictator annulled  the elections.  </P> <P> Last month, Noriega sought to give his rule constitutional legitimacy by  reviving the old National Assembly of Representatives (sometimes called the  People's Assembly in Panama).  </P> <P> That body made Noriega its president Nov. 22, and on Dec. 15, it proclaimed him  "head of government" of Panama and declared Panama to be "in a state of war"  with the United States.  </P></p>

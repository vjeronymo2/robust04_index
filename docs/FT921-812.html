			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: United Newspapers Thanks partly to higher circulation at the Sunday Express, United Newspapers looks well placed for economic recovery. Pre-tax profit of Pounds 85m was at the top end of expectations. The dividend is well covered. Interest cover is over three times, including payments on the preference shares. Capital spending will rise by Pounds 19m this year, but there would still be scope to maintain the dividend without higher borrowing. Recovery should boost advertising, though it might be 1993 before this feeds through to the lucrative classified sector. Were this the whole story, a yield of 7.5 per cent would leave the shares attractive even after yesterday's rise of nearly 4 per cent. The trouble is that prospects would look different if recovery were thwarted by higher interest rates after the election. No surprise, then, that the Daily Express is working so hard for the Tories.</p>

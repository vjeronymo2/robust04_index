			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Immigrants cast their spell over Israeli election: Jewish immigrants from Russia could tip the balance in favour of Labour FOR 30 months, Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union have seeped into every corner of Israeli life: in the supermarkets, in the schools, in the workplace, even busking on street corners, they are everywhere in evidence. Russian is the most widely heard language after Hebrew and Arabic. There are daily broadcasts in Russian, and cyrillic subtitles are common on television. Yet the political voice of the olim (literally, ascendants) has been muted. That may be about to change. In the general election on June 23, the way the immigrants vote could have a dramatic impact on the outcome of the poll. Such are their numbers in a small electorate, that if they tend heavily to favour one party over another, they could decide whether the Likud party of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the incumbent prime minister, or the opposition Labour party leads the next government. A survey published this week suggested such a trend was developing for Labour. The latest in a series carried out by Jerusalem's Tazpit Research Institute showed support among Russian immigrants for Labour and its potential coalition allies rising to 43 per cent, compared with 27 per cent for the Likud and its right-wing allies. The result was a remarkable turnround from the position in April 1991, when the right scored 46 per cent and the left 21 per cent. With 2 1/2 months still to go until polling day - and 29 per cent of the olim remaining undecided, according to the poll - it is important not read too much into the Tazpit findings. But it has underlined the importance of the immigrant vote to Labour's bid, under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, its new leader, to replace Mr Shamir's hardline government with an administration committed to territorial compromise in the current Middle East peace negotiations. Since September 1989, some 360,000 immigrants have arrived from territories now in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Some 240,000 of them will be eligible to vote, out of a total electorate of something over 3m. Mr Aharon Fein, director of Tazpit, reckons about 180,000 of the eligible newcomers will actually vote. Under Israel's system of proportional representation, that number would account for about eight seats in the 120-seat Knesset in which Labour trailed Likud in the 1988 election by just one seat. What is striking about the apparent swing to Labour is that it confounds the past tendency of Soviet immigrants to spurn the party because of its socialist background and favour the tough stance of the Likud in refusing to make territorial compromises with the Palestinians. The chief reason for the switch is a profound dissatisfaction with the economic record of Mr Shamir's government. Almost one in every two immigrants of working age is without a job. There is great resentment against the high price of housing, and the government's insistence on building a large proportion of new housing in peripheral areas where jobs are scarcest and few olim want to settle. 'The majority have a tendency towards the right. But because the government has done such a poor job on absorption many are now inclined against the Likud,' says Mr Ephraim Meidan, a Soviet immigrant in the 1970s who now lectures to olim on Israeli politics. 'A vote against the government will be a protest against Likud, not a positive vote for Labour.' But Mr Fein thinks there are other factors at work. He says many Russian olim feel a greater ethnic empathy with Labour, the traditional party of Russian and east European 'Ashkenazi' Zionists, than with the Likud which has big support among the 'Sephardi' communities originally mainly from North Africa and Middle eastern countries. He also says the largely non-religious Russians perceive the Likud to be more influenced by religious parties, whose heavy involvement in the bureaucratic absorption process has upset many of them. On top of these issues, says Mr Fein, the immigrants have learned that Labour's socialism is a good deal less rigid than in the past. The main ideological divide between Labour and Likud, over what to do about the occupied territories, appears not to be the decisive factor in how the immigrants will vote. Instead, many olim accuse both Labour and Likud of paying only lip service to absorption. As a result, a number of exclusive olim parties have emerged, notably a group called Da, which wants to force the main parties to adopt its prescriptions for employment and housing. 'It's not that we are uninterested in the issue of territory,' says Mrs Faina Selmitska, a Da activist in Jerusalem. 'But immigrants think that the traditional parties are uninterested in their concerns. Of course peace is important. But it won't be coming soon, so for us the big issues are economic.' Da leaders think the party could win up to three Knesset seats. Ms Ida Nudel, a former Prisoner of Zion detained by the Soviet regime, says until now Russian olim were nervous of expressing political views. 'But we are learning a lot and we discover that Israeli society is like any society and has a lot of problems. And because we are a big entity in that society we should fight for our place without self-restraint.'</p>

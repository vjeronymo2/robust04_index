			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> POLITICS ARE CHANGING FOR ASIAN-AMERICANS;  </P> <P> DEMOGRAPHICS: WHILE THEY ARE VASTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN ELECTIVE OFFICE, A NEW  GENERATION OF ACTIVISTS ARE LANDING JOBS WITH LEGISLATORS. AND THEY ARE HAVING  AN EFFECT ON PUBLIC POLICY IN CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> Not a single Asian-American holds a seat in the California Legislature and none  held a seat last year when a bill was introduced making it a crime to eat dog.  </P> <P> No one rose from the floor to explain that while dog meat is a delicacy in some  Asian regions, the mere thought makes most Asian-Americans shudder. And no one  warned that some would surely view the bill as an ethnic slur.  </P> <P> But behind the scenes, a cadre of influential Asian-Americans went into action.  These were not elected officials, but well-placed aides to powerful  politicians. Armed with political savvy, legislative know-how and the ear of  their bosses, some of them set to work to take the bite out of the "dog bill."  </P> <P> The legislation that Gov. George Deukmejian ultimately signed made it a crime  to kill and eat domestic pets -- language that did not implicate any ethnic  group. In an unusual message, the governor also called for a follow-up bill to  make sure no pet-eater goes to jail.  </P> <P> One of every 10 Californians now is of Asian heritage, and the fraction is  growing fast. However, Asian-Americans are vastly underrepresented in elected  posts -- a legacy of both discrimination and a traditional distrust of  politics. Asian-Americans hold only 2% of the state's top 300 elected offices  and only 1% of city council and school board seats. In Washington, only two of  California's 47-member congressional delegation are of Asian descent.  </P> <P> The 1990 elections offer little hope for improvement. As in previous years, few  Asians are candidates, and those who are running generally face tough  campaigns.  </P> <P> But into this political vacuum has stepped a new generation of Asian-Americans  who have landed jobs as legislative aides and analysts, consultants,  researchers, press secretaries, campaign managers, attorneys and advisers.  </P> <P> They are the first to say they are no substitute for elected representatives.  But as they begin to climb the political ladder, they are having a subtle but  substantive effect on public policy in California.  </P> <P> "What you're seeing now is that Asians are not only donating money, but asking  to be partners in the process," said James Lee, 26, state press secretary for  U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. "More Asians my age are coming to work in campaigns and  doing pretty well. . . . They are really going into positions where they are  having a major impact."  </P> <P> Like their black and Latino counterparts, Asian staffers were once hired  primarily to help lawmakers cover their flanks in heavily minority districts.  Nowadays, those aides are increasingly likely to be public policy professionals  juggling issues that affect all citizens, from health to transportation to  insurance.  </P> <P> "We are not just 'the Asian staff person' where we handle Asian complaints or  bills which have the title 'Asian' in the bill," said Dale Shimasaki, 36, a  special assistant who handles education issues for Assembly Speaker Willie  Brown (D-San Francisco). "We're trying to diversify ourselves in public policy  areas."  </P> <P> These staffers are rarely quoted -- except when touting their bosses'  accomplishments. But they have put their stamp on such issues as discrimination  in Asian admissions to the University of California, divestment from South  Africa, redress for Japanese-Americans interned during World War II and the  portrayal of that incident in state publications and textbooks, bilingual  education, school funding, hate crimes and redistricting.  </P> <P> When Congress approved reparations to Japanese-American internees, for example,  the payments were exempted from federal taxes. Priscilla Ouchida, an aide to  Assemblyman Pat Johnston (D-Stockton), realized that state taxes would still  apply and wrote a bill to also exempt the reparations from California taxes.  Johnston introduced the bill in the Assembly, and Ouchida enlisted  Asian-American staffers on the Senate side to smooth its voyage through the  Legislature.  </P> <P> Asian staffers also played a role in bringing the question of discrimination in  UC Berkeley admissions to a head by taking the issue directly to Brown and  Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, aides, politicians  and community leaders said.  </P> <P> After aides arranged for the leaders to meet with the Asian American Task Force  on UC Admissions, Brown in March, 1987, backed a resolution calling on UC  Berkeley to disclose its admissions policies. And Roberti asked the state  auditor general to investigate.  </P> <P> The resolution passed both houses unanimously in September of that year. Three  months later, then-UC Berkeley Chancellor Michael Heyman apologized for the way  the university had handled the issue.  </P> <P> "Had the (Asian) community gone to a member that didn't have an Asian-American  staff member, it probably would have happened, but it might have taken a year  more," said Shimasaki, a Berkeley alumnus who drafted the resolution for Brown.  </P> <P> Today, 64 Asian- or Pacific-Americans hold professional jobs as aides to state  senators or representatives, according to Maeley Tom, special assistant in  Roberti's Office of Asian and Pacific Affairs.  </P> <P> "When I first started here 17 years ago, we were able to count them on one  hand," Tom said.  </P> <P> The Sacramento staffers are a tight-knit bunch who keep in touch through their  own group, the Asian Legislative Staff Caucus. A similar group, the Southern  California Asian/Pacific Legislative Staff Caucus, includes at least 29 other  aides to legislators, mayors, city council members, supervisors and  congressmen.  </P> <P> The Asian community is pushing for more.  </P> <P> "When anyone calls, the first thing I ask is, 'What have you done for the Asian  community?' " Maria Hsia, a fund-raiser and political activist, said of  politicians asking for help. "If they are not even going to hire Asian staff, I  don't see that they're very sincere about trying to understand Asians."  </P> <P> There are some Asian-American political veterans such as Jadine Neilson, who  started as a receptionist in U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston's San Francisco office 18  years ago. Now she directs his California staff of 20 and, significantly, his  schedule. Sacramento has a veteran Chinese-American power couple, legislative  aide Tom and her husband, Ronald L. Tom, a lobbyist who was once a pharmacist.  </P> <P> But most staffers are in their 20s and 30s. Democrats far outnumber  Republicans. Many work in nearly all-white districts. Most -- like Audrey Noda,  an aide to Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) -- set their sights on politics  early.  </P> <P> As a fledgling legislative aide in 1982, Noda was assigned to draft what became  known as the "Peking duck bill" on behalf of Chinese restaurant owners, whose  ancient method of hanging the ducks at room temperature was under assault by  Los Angeles health inspectors. Torres, whose district includes parts of  Chinatown, Koreatown and Little Tokyo, successfully sponsored a bill to permit  the traditional method of preparing Peking duck. At 32, Noda is now Torres'  chief of staff.  </P> <P> Like Noda, most aides are second-, third- or even fourth-generation Americans.  Some of their parents and grandparents fled corrupt or brutal governments and  saw politics as a dangerous, disreputable, or -- at best -- an unseemly  pursuit. But the children thrill to the rough-and-tumble of American politics.  </P> <P> "In Asia, your father wants you to be a doctor," said Hung Trung Le, 35, once a  medical student in Vietnam and now an aide to Assemblyman Phil Isenberg,  (D-Sacramento). "But this is a free country. I want to do what I want to do. .  . . Even now, my father thinks I'm crazy. He wants me to get a stable job."  </P> <P> Staffers like Le, who is so blunt that his friends call him "Uzi mouth," smash  any lingering stereotypes of Asians as quiet, studious, technical whizzes who  don't make waves.  </P> <P> "All of us are going to explode that myth quickly if it hasn't been exploded  already," said Kam Kuwata, a 36-year-old Venice-based political consultant who  is slated to manage Cranston's reelection campaign in 1992. "It doesn't mean  we're going to be bomb-throwers. It means the stereotype isn't accurate --  wasn't then, isn't now."  </P> <P> A few of today's staffers say they want to become tomorrow's candidates. They  are well-positioned to do so, according to scholar Fernando Guerra, head of the  Chicano studies department at Loyola Marymount University.  </P> <P> Guerra said that more than one-third of all black, Latino and Asian  officeholders in California did stints as political aides -- including all six  minority members of the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> "It's the best base for an ethnic to run," Guerra said. Staffers know the  district and the donors, how to organize a campaign and whom to hire, he said.  "They take on all of the advantages that the incumbent has, except one, and  that is name identification. But that can be made up with enough financial  backing."  </P> <P> In fact, the two top Asian-American challengers on the ballot this fall trained  in behind-the-scenes political jobs.  </P> <P> Butte County Democrat Lon Hatamiya, who once worked for Torres, would become  the first Asian-American in the Legislature in more than a decade if he  succeeds in unseating Republican Chris Chandler in the Yuba City-based 3rd  Assembly District.  </P> <P> And the Republican candidate for state controller, Matthew (Kip) Fong, cut his  political teeth working for his mother, Secretary of State March Fong Eu, the  first and only Asian-American to hold a statewide constitutional office.  </P> <P> But other staffers say they prefer to wield power behind the throne.  </P> <P> "I like my personal life private," said Esther Kim, 23, an aide to Assemblyman  Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> The Sacramento staffers count 20 to 30 lawmakers who are dependably sympathetic  to Asian-American interests -- which often coincide with Latino concerns. The  aides call such members surrogates. Nevertheless, Ouchida and others say they  are wary of overstepping their bounds by pushing what might be seen as  special-interest legislation too often.  </P> <P> "I time my bills five years apart," Ouchida said. "I figure you can only go to  the well every once in a while."  </P> <P> "We don't have . . . a vote on the floor so, by default, staff become the  members for the Asian community," said Shimizu. "That isn't right."  </P> <P> Staffers point to the dog bill, saying it would have been killed if one of  their own had held a seat in the Legislature.  </P> <P> During the debate, the Cambodian Assn. of America backed the ban on dog-eating.  They argued that it would lessen anti-Asian discrimination, which they said had  been inflamed by the arrest of two Cambodian immigrants in Long Beach for  killing a puppy. And several lawmakers ordinarily sympathetic to Asians sided  with animal rights activists instead.  </P> <P> A number of the Asian staffers are still smarting over that loss.  </P> <P> "It's a testament to the insensitivity of the governor and the Legislature on  Asian issues," fumed Nguyen T. Nguyen, a Vietnamese-born consultant to the  Legislature's Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement, who argues that the law  is vague and bound to be applied in a discriminatory fashion against new Asian  immigrants.  </P> <P> "I want to be the first person arrested for eating my goldfish," he added.  </P> <P> Then there was a 1989 Assembly debate on how textbooks should describe the  Japanese-American internment. During the debate, Rep. Gil Ferguson (R-Newport  Beach) incensed Asian-Americans by referring to the internees as "American  Japs."  </P> <P> Several of Ferguson's colleagues stood up and blasted him from the floor.  Still, said Maeley Tom, "Our feeling is that if we had Asian-Pacific members on  the floor, I don't think any member would have the courage to look a fellow  member in the eye and say, 'You Jap.' It just shows what lack of representation  means."  </P></p>

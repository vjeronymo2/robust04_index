			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Kuvaldin, general director of the </F> joint-stock company "Reklama-Holding" ["Advertisement-Holding"],  conducted by Anna Kachkayeva: "`Ostankino' Enters the Era of a  New Advertising Policy"]    [Text] Henceforth, the right to place advertisements  on channel one air time is being handed over to the closed type  joint-stock company "Reklama-Holding"  ["Advertisement-Holding"].    Its founders are comprised of large advertising agencies,  with the controlling packet of stock (30 percent) belonging to  the "Ostankino" television company. The rest of the stock is  distributed between the founders as follows: The agency "Premier  SV," "Inter ViD," "Video International"--15 percent each;  "Maxima"--12 percent; "LogoVaz press" and "Oster"--6.5 percent  each. Professionals in the advertising business worked on  developing the model for the holding company. Foreign experience  was also taken into consideration, and specifically the practice  of creating television advertising agencies on the state  channels of Germany and France. Aleksandr Dmitriyev has been  appointed president of the a/o [joint-stock company]  "Reklama-Holding," and Sergey Kuvaldin--its general director.    Our correspondent spoke with the latter, and asked him to  explain in greater detail about the new commercial structure.    [Correspondent] Will there be a principle change in the life  of the first state channel with the creation of the holding  company, and what will the viewer get as a result of its  activity?    [Kuvaldin] The creation of the holding company is the first  important element in the new economic mechanism which is  gradually being developed at "Ostankino." Its main goal is the  centralization of advertising. What is the advantage? A singular  program and price policy is established, dumping (pricing below  production cost) is not permitted, and the uncontrolled  placement of advertisements on the basis of barter is  discontinued. The quality of the advertising product is  improved. Moreover, "Ostankino" will not only get a percent of  the profits from placement of the advertisements, but it will  also receive a three-month advance on the funds which it so  badly needs for production of its programs. The holding company  will pay out in advance the sum at which "Ostankino" estimates  its advertising time for the quarter. The viewer will also not  lose out. At present, I fully understand his irritation when  there are 15 minutes of advertising in a row--at the end of a  broadcast, between broadcasts, and at the beginning of the next  broadcast. Now we will be able to build an advertising schedule  which does not exhaust the television viewers. Advertising  should not take up more than 15 percent of the air time, and  will be distributed equally throughout the course of the day.    This means that some broadcasts will not have any  advertisements at all, while in those such as "Field of  Miracles" their presence is not only justified, but also  economically expedient. Advertisements for alcoholic beverages  and tobacco products may be aired during the evening hours. It  is true, I must concede--significant changes will not take place  right away. We must not forget that "Ostankino" has already  concluded agreements until the end of the year. Naturally,  "Reklama-Holding" will have to work in a mixed regimen,  fulfilling the former obligations while trying to mildly  implement its own policy.    [Correspondent] How will the holding company's price policy  be formulated?    [Kuvaldin] The most preferable scheme is the following:  "Ostankino" appraises its advertising time and defines its  amount. This advertising time is "cut up" into packets, which  include "prime" and "non-prime" time. These packets are then put  up for auction, with the starting price being the "Ostankino"  price plus 10-15 percent. Understandably, it is profitable for  the holding company to sell the advertising time at a higher  price. First of all, because the founders expect dividends, and  secondly because it is necessary to justify the expenditures for  maintenance of the agency. The arithmetic here is simple: The  higher the price at which the holding company sells the  advertising time, the greater profits both the joint stock  company and its founders will receive. However, it is  inexpedient to raise the price endlessly, or it will be  impossible to find buyers. By the way, one of the tasks of the  joint-stock company is to help "Ostankino" reach real  advertising valuations.    [Correspondent] What will be the relationship between  "Reklama-Holding" and independent producers working at channel  one?    [Kuvaldin] Their interests, undoubtedly, must not be  infringed upon. The producer must receive as much as his program  costs by estimate and in accordance with its rating. If we  proceed from notions of profit, then the holding company is  interested in a good channel and quality broadcasts. A dull and  boring channel cannot have expensive advertising, and expensive  and high quality advertising is one of the means of reducing its  volumes.    [Correspondent] There are mixed feelings at "Ostankino"  about  the creation of the joint-stock company. What, in your opinion,  is the reason for this?    [Kuvaldin] As in any new endeavor, they doubt its success  simply because we have never had anything like it before.  Moreover, the centralization of advertising touches upon the  personal, corporative interests of some workers at "Ostankino."  Small advertising services in the studios are being cut, and the  company itself will change its relations with its  producers--studios and associations. "Ostankino" will buy  broadcasts from them, and the number of purchased broadcasts  will determine the staff numbers of the studios, their financial  condition and their capacity for providing their associates with  social benefits.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Security Service Chief Yevhen Marchuk and </F> State Protection Service Chief Mykhaylo Hayduk by unidentified  reporter; place and date not given; from "Without a Protocol"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Marchuk] The Ukrainian  Security Service has been actively cooperating with the State  Protection Service. One of the primary goals of the Security  Service is fighting terrorism. To fight terrorism we must  interact with the State Protection Service. I want to point out  that the Security Service performs a wide range of tasks that  exceed the framework of functions of the State Protection  Department. Speaking of the problem of fighting terrorism as a  pyramid, the State Protection Service is at the very top, while  the Ukrainian Security Service deals with more fundamental,  concealed aspects of the same problems. Thus, we disclose  persons threatening terrorist acts against political leaders,  the state leadership, or people's deputies at all levels from  the village to the Supreme Council. When this work enters its  completion stage we interact with the State Protection Service.  I want to emphasize that for both services the political views  of threatened individuals make absolutely no difference. In  1993, the Security Service has investigated more than 120 cases  of threats to statesmen and deputies at all levels, presidential  representatives, and the president himself. Some 90 cases were  disclosed, including threats of terrorist acts against  Vyacheslav Chornovil, Deputies Ostroushchenko and Izmalkov, and  former Defense Minister Morozov. Thus, you see that we pay no  attention to the political views of these people, and this  problem has no political connotation for the Security Service.  By the way, we also disclosed threats against Russian President  Yeltsin and Moldovan President Snegur, as well as a terrorist  act against a foreign embassy in Moscow, prepared by foreign  citizens on Ukrainian territory. I want to point out that this  is an international problem.    [Reporter] I believe that the experience of foreign  countries might be useful to us. These countries encountered a  lot more problems of this kind. There have been a lot of  terrorist acts in the United States, India, and so on. Do you  have any contacts with appropriate services from other states?    [Hayduk] The State Protection Department is working on  improving its activities and studying the foreign experience.  For example, a conference was held in Hungary in November 1993,  attended by representatives of 32 states, including Ukraine and  Russia. The conference discussed the issues of fighting  terrorism and granting security to political leaders. We also  held a three-week seminar in Kiev with U.S. special services on  the coordination of efforts and the joint resolution of legal  issues, conducted practical classes on the physical and  psychological fitness of functionaries. By the way, under an  agreement with Yevhen Marchuk, a department will be opened at  the Kiev Security Service Institute in 1994 for training  specialists for our department.</p>

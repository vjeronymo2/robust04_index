			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 50% CUT SET IN FEDERAL WATER SUPPLIES IN STATE;  </P> <P> ACTION REQUIRED BY DROUGHT MAY CAUSE SOME FARMERS TO FAIL AND DRIVE UP FOOD  PRICES  </P> <P> Central Valley farmers and some Northern California cities served by federal  water projects are being told their deliveries will be cut by up to 50%, a move  that could put some farmers out of business and lead to water rationing in  urban areas, federal officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> The cutbacks by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, California's largest single  supplier of water, are likely to reduce the state's crop production by an  estimated $250 million and drive up food prices in local supermarkets.  </P> <P> Brought on by the state's third dry year in a row, the reductions will take  effect March 1. It will be the first time since the drought of 1976-77 that the  federal water system will be unable to provide all the water its contractors  are entitled to receive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Tough Year'  </P> <P> "Some farmers are going to go belly up," said John B. Budd, a spokesman for the  Bureau of Reclamation. "They just won't be able to make it through the year.  It's going to be a tough year for everybody."  </P> <P> The reduction in the amount of water available through the federal system  compounds an already bleak situation. Officials of the state water project,  which provides the state with nearly half as much water as the federal system,  already has announced that farmers can expect a 40% cutback in water supplies  this year.  </P> <P> "California's water picture remains dominated by drought," the state Department  of Water Resources said in its February water report. "The next two months will  determine whether there will be enough water, or whether California will have  its first three-year critically dry spell of this century."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Far Below Normal  </P> <P> Both the federal and state decisions to reduce water supplies could be altered  if California is drenched by huge storms in the next two months. However, the  state is so far behind in precipitation that it would take a storm of the  magnitude seen only once every 100 years to bring California up to normal  levels, Budd said.  </P> <P> Not only will the expected water shortage hurt farmers and inconvenience city  dwellers, it is likely to further damage sensitive salmon fisheries, reduce the  amount of hydroelectric power that can be produced and limit recreational  activities on federal and state reservoirs.  </P> <P> The federal and state cutbacks will not directly affect Los Angeles and other  Southern California communities. However, Los Angeles is experiencing problems  of its own because of reduced snowpack in the eastern Sierra Nevada, the source  of most of the city's water.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles is going to be better off than San Francisco is," Budd said.  "They're going to have some conservation measures they'll have to go along  with, but that's a way of life."  </P> <P> Among the urban areas that depend most heavily on water from the Bureau of  Reclamation are the San Jose region and communities east of Sacramento such as  Orangevale and Fair Oaks. With reduced supplies of federal water, these areas  could face serious shortages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Jose Problems  </P> <P> In the Santa Clara Valley, for example, San Jose and its neighboring cities  will receive half of their federal allotment. They already have heavily tapped  the ground water supply during the last two dry years. Now increased pumping  could cause the earth to subside, snapping underground pipes and undermining  the foundations of buildings.  </P> <P> Neil Schild, assistant regional director of the Bureau of Reclamation, said the  agency will try to help the San Jose region find alternate supplies, but water  rationing ultimately may be necessary.  </P> <P> Among farmers, the federal cutbacks pose the greatest threat to growers in the  western San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys, whose contracts with the bureau  allow for reductions of 50%.  </P> <P> Farmers located nearer the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers face cutbacks of  only 25% because their contracts take into account the original water rights  attached to the property before the federal water system was constructed.  </P> <P> Schild estimated that the water cutbacks will affect 1 million acres of  farmland. Some farmers may decide to let their land lie fallow or plant crops  that require less water. Other growers may pump additional water from the  ground, manage their supplies better or find more expensive sources of water,  which in turn would drive up the cost of food.  </P> <P> "Some will divert to ground water," Schild said. "Others simply are not going  to make it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notification Deadline  </P> <P> Farmers must be notified by Feb. 15 of any cutbacks in their federal allotments  so they can decide what crops to plant and how many acres to farm, Schild said.  If California does not receive substantial rainfall in the next seven weeks,  any increases in the supply would be too late for most farmers to alter their  plans.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Reclamation's decision to reduce water supplies comes as  California recovers from a storm that blanketed the state and dropped snow in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Federal officials said it will take much more than a storm like that to avert a  drought. The ground is so dry it soaks up the rainwater "like a sponge," Budd  said. Federal and state reservoirs, nearly drained during the last two years,  remain far below normal levels. And this year's snowpack, while great for  skiing, has an unusually low water content, reducing the amount of expected  runoff.  </P> <P> The last time there were three consecutive dry years in California was in 1614,  judging from an analysis of the rings on ancient trees. It has never happened  in the state's recorded history.  </P> <P> Last year, the Bureau of Reclamation delivered about 6.5 million acre feet of  water to its customers. This year, the bureau expects to deliver only about 4  million acre feet.  </P> <P> "There is a possibility that it will turn around," Budd said. "I just think you  have to plan for the worst."  </P></p>

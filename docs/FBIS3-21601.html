Only three of the  ex-Soviet countries, the Baltic republics, are not attending.  The other twelve countries sent twenty specialists on  disarmament and customs officers to attend the seminar.    Japan's Foreign Ministry, the main organiser of the five-day  seminar, told ITAR-TASS that earlier such contacts had been  carried out only on bilateral level, including with Russia.    But as Tokyo grows ever more concerned over the growing  scale  of arms trading, including illegal, in Asia, Japan's Foreign  Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Industry have  decided to considerably increase the range of participants in  the seminar within the frame of the general technical assistance  to new independent states.    The seminar's chief task is to demonstrate to ex-Soviet  republics, in most of which the custom services are just gaining  their footing, the latest achievements for use in combatting  illegal trade operations and discuss measures undertaken by the  Japanese government to supervise armaments, disarmament and the  proliferation of weapons and their components.</p>

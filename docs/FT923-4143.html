			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Boral cuts payout as profits slip THE directors of Boral, the Australian building products and engineering group, have been forced to cut the annual dividend to 16 cents a share from 20 cents, after a 28 per cent fall earnings for the year to June. Net profits fell to ADollars 151.98m (USDollars 108.5m) from ADollars 211.37m on a 5 per cent fall in sales to ADollars 3.77bn from ADollars 3.98bn. The cut in dividend will avoid the company covering the payout from reserves, which will fall to ADollars 148.5m from ADollars 179.4m. Despite the lower result, the directors said there were signs of improvement for the current year. They forecast a modest improvement in earnings, despite the disappointing Australian and US economies. The directors said the construction of non-domestic buildings in Australia was likely to fall further and no early recovery was foreseen in the UK building market. However, the company expected a bigger earnings contribution from mainland Europe. The company's north American and European subsidiaries incurred small losses while pre-tax earnings in Australia fell to ADollars 359.9m from ADollars 472.8m. A divisional breakdown showed the housing products area was the company's best, lifting pre-tax earnings to ADollars 149.2m from ADollars 105.5m. Construction materials profits fell to ADollars 134.4m from ADollars 205.8m. The overall result showed net profits of ADollars 121.4m compared with ADollars 122.2m. Depreciation rose to ADollars 186.2m from ADollars 177.8m while interest expenses fell to ADollars 96.8m from ADollars 121.8m.</p>

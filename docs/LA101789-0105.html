			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH LAKE TAHOE;  </P> <P> U.S. SET TO TRIPLE DEAD TREE LOGGING  </P> <P> The U.S. Forest Service plans to triple the amount of logging in the Tahoe  Basin next year in an effort to clear an estimated one out of five dead and  dying fir trees in the Sierra Nevada, officials said. Three years of drought  and an ongoing attack by the fir engraver beetle have wiped out large sections  of forest and speckled the once-emerald-green basin with brown trees. "Look at  any hillside and 10% to 100% of the trees are dead in any given area," said the  Forest Service's John Swanson in South Lake Tahoe. "There are well over 50  million board-feet in the Tahoe Basin that are dead or dying trees. They may  look alive but they aren't."  </P></p>

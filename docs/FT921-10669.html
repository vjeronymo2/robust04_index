			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Profits fall to Dollars 79.9m at Kroger KROGER, one of the large US supermarket chains, has reported a fall in full-year profits from Dollars 82.4m in 1990 to Dollars 79.9m last year, writes Nikki Tait. However, the 1991 figure is scored after a Dollars 20.8m extraordinary loss relating to the early retirement of debt, compared with a Dollars 910,000 deficit in the previous year. Sales during the 12 months increased by a modest 5.4 per cent to Dollars 21.3bn, with same-store sales rising 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 3 per cent in the year. The company, like others in its sector, warned that the highly competitive conditions seen last year were spilling into 1992. Kroger, which operates over 1,250 stores in 25 states and geared itself up in a defensive restructuring in 1988, opened or expanded 42 stores last year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Vlado Pandzic, chairman of caucus of </F> Croat deputies, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not given: "There  Are Differences, But Not Divisions"]    [Text] Unanimity among Croat deputies is proof of our  political will to work on making the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Federation a reality, says the chairman of the caucus of Croat  deputies.    We spoke with Dr. Vlado Pandzic, the chairman of the caucus  of Croat deputies, right before he left Sarajevo, where he had  participated in the session of the Constitutional Assembly of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and then in the session of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly that followed as a continuation.  The reason for our interview was in fact these two meetings, and  Dr. Pandzic had this to say in evaluating the results achieved:    [Pandzic] Everything that was anticipated was also done, so  that I can say that a big step was taken in realizing the  Federation Constitution. The federation got a president and vice  president, and certain decisions, drafts, and proposals for laws  were adopted, which are a precondition for carrying out the  further work of setting up the federation.    [Sabic] Were there any changes in mutual relations between  the first and second sessions of the Constitutional Assembly,  was there any discernible change in the prevailing atmosphere in  the Assembly meeting rooms?    [Pandzic] One could say that the atmosphere was better at  the  second session, that work proceeded somewhat faster.... As with  any beginning, at the first session there was a certain amount  of disorientation, but nevertheless we overcame that  successfully. It is important that at both the first and the  second session a high level of preparedness on the part of the  deputies was discernible, there were no "derailments" from the  agenda, the deputies demonstrated the will to achieve what had  been planned, while at the second session one could discern a  little more certainty that everything on the agenda would be  completed at that session. Perhaps it can be said that some  individuals stood out in terms of their disorientation, but that  does not essentially alter the overall impression.    [Sabic] No less than two months passed between the enactment  of the federation and the election of the federation's leaders,  but the Constitution states that they be chosen as soon as the  Constitution is adopted. Do you think that the next steps will  not fall that far behind schedule?    [Pandzic] I call those two months lost time, which does not  mean that that should be understand literally, because during  that time some doubts and disagreements were resolved,  everything that had generated a certain level of tension.  Perhaps we could have taken several more steps during those two  months, but I think that we will pick up the pace a little. This  is reflected by the fact that in two weeks there will be another  session where the government will be elected.    [Sabic] The last session of the Constitutional Assembly was  interrupted by unexpected breaks, the session began late.... It  is surmised that there were disagreements that had to be ironed  out behind closed doors.    [Pandzic] A certain number of deputies arrived in Sarajevo  late, and because of that the session was late in starting, so  that on the first day of the session only a small part of the  planned business was covered. The next day, in fact after  meetings between the chairmen of the caucuses and the Assembly  presidency, full agreement was reached. And right before the  election of the federation president and vice president, there  was a brief interruption in the session. The chairman of the  Assembly wanted to fully clarify the issue so that unnecessary  questions would not be raised later on, and for that purpose he  organized a short meeting. It must be kept in mind that the  Assembly is meeting in Sarajevo, a city that is completely  encircled, in a hall that cannot be called adequate, while the  Serb forces are positioned all of several hundred meters away.    [Sabic] It can often be heard in Sarajevo that there are  plenty of Croat deputies who are opposed to the implementation  of the Federation Constitution. Is that perhaps one of the  reasons for the delays in the session?    [Pandzic] It cannot be said that there are no differences in  views of the federation agreement. However, that is not  discernible in the Assembly itself. The differences are more  evident at meetings of the caucus of Croat deputies, there one  might get certain impressions that could not exactly be called  the best, but that must not be the real conclusion. The most  essential thing is that all Croat deputies raised their hands  for the Federation Constitution.    [Sabic] Both from the Assembly podium and on other  occasions,  you often emphasize the unanimity of the Croat deputies in  expressing their views on any issue. Why do you think that such  unanimity is essential?    [Pandzic] It would be enough to determine that there is a  majority. Still, I think that it is not unimportant to mention  that there is unanimity, because that, among other things,  refutes the allegations of a supposed division among the Croat  deputies. Through unanimity, we demonstrate our political will  to work on making the federation a reality.    [Sabic] For deputies who live outside Sarajevo, the fact  that  they receive meeting materials immediately before the session  begins is a big problem. Will there be changes in that in the  future?    [Pandzic] That is indeed a rather big problem that also made  the deputies' work more difficult. Very few people managed to  read through everything that they were supposed to. I must say  that this time these materials were very well prepared, very  precise, that they did not raise issues that slow down the work,  and some of them, the Federation Constitution for example, we  received printed in both the Croatian and the Bosniak language.  It was agreed that in the future materials will be provided in a  timely fashion, so that this problem too will be removed from  the agenda.</p>

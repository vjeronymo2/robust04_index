			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Aim at the climate, not the weather A book which made a lasting impression on me in my last year at high school was Peter Drucker's The End of Economic Man, published in 1939. Although the author had already long been resident in the US, it was in the best tradition of central European speculative thought. His thesis (speaking from memory) was that Nazism was neither a form of capitalism nor of socialism, but a revolt against the whole utilitarian, nicely calculated 'lore of less or more', in favour of more primitive collective urges. In subsequent years Drucker has become best known as an American management guru; and, as someone who would not be allowed to manage the proverbial whelk-stall, I lost track of him. But I could not believe that he had lost his wider interests; and sure enough, his list of public works shows that he has continued to reflect on society, ideas and politics. His latest venture, published last year when he was 84, is a kind of summa. Although entitled Post-Capitalist Society (published by Butterworth-Heinemann), it is free both of Spenglerian gloom and of the posturings of futurologists. Instead, he focuses on trends already visible. He is now sure that market values are here to stay and regards longing for an imaginary medieval past as mainly a reflection of ignorance of what the Middle Ages were really like. The emerging society is post-capitalist in the sense that the Marxist vision of a few private owners versus an army of propertyless workers is dead. Indeed, workers own the enterprises through their pension funds. Moreover, physical capital is no longer dominant and is now subordinate to what mainstream economists call human capital and Drucker prefers to call 'knowledge'. Mainstream economists may say that he is unduly preoccupied with Marxism and the reaction to it, and they no longer think of variables such as Land, Labour and Capital in upper-case letters, but of innumerable products and factors of production designated by algebraic letter. For this very reason, much of their work is cold and uninformative. As it is based on current realities, Drucker's vision of the knowledge society cannot be entirely surprising. But the all-important details are more perceptively highlighted than elsewhere. For instance, the emerging society is individualistic - it is full of specialists who cannot be bossed about by their superiors who lack the knowledge to do so - but it is still highly dependent on organisations. Drucker has spotted that 'contracting out' is the Big Idea common to advanced corporate practice, privatisation schemes and voucher proposals for schools and universities. The key is that people should concentrate on what they are trained to do and do best. When cleaning is done by directly-employed Mrs Mops, it will usually be a low-grade activity hardly worth the attention of the deputy chief executive. Contracted out to a specialist company, it becomes a principal activity in which employees can take a pride - as I have seen when staying late at the office. On the larger question of the nation state, Drucker points out that it has lost its dominance, but it is still the only fully developed political institution. Indeed, the effect of money and information becoming transnational is that states can be of almost any size. When his native Austria was forcibly separated from the Hapsburg empire after the first world war, it was universally condemned (even by its own inhabitants) as too small to survive. Yet it has recently prospered, along with even smaller states like Slovenia. One of Drucker's most eloquent asides is on the futility of military aid to friendly regimes. 'To the threat: if you do not give us these arms we'll get them elsewhere, the proper answer is: go ahead.' In no instance has such aid stabilised a region; too often the recipients became 'international terrorists who use the military aid they receive to turn their country into a land-based pirate ship to terrorise the international community', as Saddam Hussein did. Drucker is also always interesting on Japan, which he treats as a traditional nation-state. Like many European countries before the first world war, Japanese governments have been certainly prepared to give their local industries a helping hand, but stayed clear of social engineering or massive expenditure programmes. In the end, the reason why I decided to write about Post-Capitalist Society is that, in a couple of paragraphs, he makes more sense of macro-economic policy than most lifetime specialists. 'Every government promises to cure recessions. But this is pure quackery. No government has been able to deliver.' Political leaders, he argues, should instead try to regain the ability to avert major depressions. This means balancing budgets, not only in normal times but even in modest recessions, so that governments can afford to borrow to invest in the infrastructure, which is always in bad repair, when a real slump threatens. How to do so without encouraging the mega-state on which Drucker is as scathing as anyone is, of course, a problem. But he has a good point when he argues that recent Japanese attempts to encourage consumption instead sparked off a property boom from whose residue the country is still recovering. Drucker's central economic point, however, is that governments should concentrate on influencing the climate instead of on futile attempts to change the weather - a fruitful analogy, which it is astonishing has not been used more often.</p>

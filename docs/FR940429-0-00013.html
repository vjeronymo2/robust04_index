			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA is now accepting 1994&hyph;95 registrations. The Registration Statement has not been revised for the 1994&hyph;95 Registration Year. Registrants should file a registration statement and pay the associated fee in advance of July 1, 1994, in order to ensure that a 1994&hyph;95 Registration Number has been provided by that date to comply with the recordkeeping requirements, including the requirement that the number be made available on board each truck and truck tractor (not including trailers and semi-trailers) used to transport hazardous materials subject to the registration requirements. A Certificate of Registration is generally mailed within three weeks of RSPA's receipt of a Registration Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons who engage in any of the specified activities during a Registration Year are required to register for that year. Persons who engaged in these activities during Registration Year 1992&hyph;93 (September 16, 1992, through June 30, 1993) or 1993&hyph;94 (July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994) and have not filed a registration statement and paid the associated fee of $300.00 for each year for which registration is required should contact RSPA to obtain the required form (DOT F 5800.2). Persons who fail to register for any registration year in which they engaged in such activities are subject to civil penalties for each day a covered function is performed. The legal obligation to register for a year in which any of the specified activities was conducted does not end with the registration year. Registration after the completion of a registration year may also involve the imposition of a late fee and interest in addition to a civil penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the 1994&hyph;95 Registration Year, RSPA has entered into an agreement with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to test an alternative procedure for filing the Federal Registration Statement for motor carriers who are also subject to the State of Ohio's registration program. Ohio Revised Code Section 4905.80 requires that motor carriers transporting in or through Ohio hazardous materials that must be placarded, require the display of vehicle markings, or must be manifested register with PUCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motor carriers who are subject to the Federal 1994&hyph;95 Hazardous Materials Registration requirement, may elect to submit a completed Federal Registration Statement DOT Form F 5800.2, through PUCO together with the associated fee of $300.00 payable to the U.S. Department of Transportation. This option for the submittal of the Federal registration documents through PUCO is being offered to certain motor carriers to demonstrate if this procedure is more cost-effective or otherwise less burdensome to industry and government. Since this procedure is optional, a motor carrier subject to Ohio's registration requirement may elect to register in the Federal program directly with the U.S. Department of Transportation, as specified in 49 CFR 107.616. However, PUCO has agreed to verify that all motor carriers required to register with PUCO are registered with DOT if they are subject to the Federal registration requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A motor carrier subject to both the Federal and PUCO registration requirements who elects to register in the Federal program through PUCO may obtain the required Federal and Ohio forms and related information by contacting the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, Transportation Department, Hazardous Materials Division, 180 East Broad Street, 5th Floor, Columbus, OH 43215&hyph;3793, telephone 614&hyph;466&hyph;7232. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15602&hyph;15605), RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, in which it proposed several additional requirements that may affect persons currently subject to the registration requirements. New provisions proposed in this notice include: (1) A requirement that shippers verify that carriers are registered before using their services and that carriers verify that shippers are registered before accepting a shipment from them; (2) a requirement that vessel operators carry proof of registration on each vessel subject to the registration requirement; and (3) a two-year extension (until July 1, 1996) in the delay in implementation of the registration requirement for foreign offerors of hazardous materials. Persons subject to the registration requirements are advised to watch for further developments in this rulemaking action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Alan I.

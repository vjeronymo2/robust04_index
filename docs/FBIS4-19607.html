			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 21 (AFP) -- Pyongyang officials and  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are discussing  details of a possible new IAEA inspection of suspected nuclear  sites in North Korea, a spokesman for the Agency said here  Thursday [21 April].    David Kyd said the inspection could begin before the end of  the month as the IAEA wants it to be accomplished as soon as  possible since the UN Security Council wants a report on the  matter in May.    He added that if Pyongyang agrees to the new inspections,  the  IAEA investigators would be ready to leave by next week.    Pyongyang refused in March to allow an IAEA team from  gathering crucial samples at a facility in Yongbyon suspected of  producing weapons-grade plutonium.    The IAEA then voted to ask the UN Security Council to take  up  the issue of North Korea's obstinate refusal to allow  inspections of its nuclear sites but stopped short of calling  for sanctions against Pyongyang.    Kyd said that the current negotiations are not focussing on  the controversial sites involved in the last visit by the  inspectors.</p>

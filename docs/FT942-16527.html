			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Grubb optimistic on Tokyo Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers in London remained optimistic on the outlook for Tokyo, believing that Mr Hosawawa's resignation might clarify the political situation and accelerate the political fusion process. He has raised his year-end forecast for the Nikkei index from 20,000 to 24,000, saying that the economy appeared to be bottoming out: he expected gains in domestic sales, housing investment and consumption during the fourth quarter and a switch back to equities by local investors as the outlook improved.</p>

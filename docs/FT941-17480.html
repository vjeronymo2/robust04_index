			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Two banks at odds over value of Banesto assets JP Morgan, the US bank that advised Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) before the Bank of Spain ousted its management last week, thought that Banesto was in a better financial condition than the Spanish government has claimed, according to an unpublished official document. The document, prepared by the central bank to justify its sudden intervention, shows that JP Morgan believed that Banesto's assets had been overvalued by at most Pta372bn (Pounds 1.76bn). That is Pta131bn less than the Bank's estimate of a Pta503bn overvaluation, disclosed last week. The Bank last Tuesday im-posed a new management at Banesto, Spain's fourth-largest bank with assets of Pta7,000bn. The intervention is not thought to have been expected by Morgan, even though it had been sharing information with the Bank. Morgan executives are believed to accept that the Bank's action was justified when Banesto's share price fell sharply and a run on deposits began. However, they had thought until then that Banesto could absorb a gradual Pta372bn downward revaluation of its assets if it raised extra capital to compensate. Morgan, which had invested Dollars 175m (Pounds 118.20m) of its and other investors' capital in Banesto through its Corsair investment fund, wrote to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, hours before the intervention to express confidence in Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's president. The overvaluation of assets was discovered by Bank of Spain inspectors in an audit that continued until September. Morgan thought Banesto could raise capital to cope through measures in-cluding a bond issue and the sale of half its controlling stake in Banco Totta y Acores of Portugal. The document shows that the Bank believed that Banesto's loans were overvalued by Pta 223bn after rapid growth in loans 1988 and 1991. It also estimated that there was a Pta 66bn pension fund shortfall, and a Pta81bn overvaluation of La Corporacion, its industrial holding company. The other overvaluations listed by the Bank of Spain in the document were Pta72bn relating to an equity portfolio, Pta25bn for Banesto's 50 per cent holding in Oasis International Group, listed in Banesto's accounts as a hotel company, and Pta36bn overvaluation of capitalised costs. Banesto and JP Morgan gave lower estimates for each category. They were: Pta166bn for loans, Pta52bn for La Corporacion, Pta 55bn for the pension fund shortfall, Pta61bn for the equity portfolio, Pta23bn for capitalised costs and Pta15bn for Oasis International Group. The Bank of Spain said in the document it might have overestimated the overvaluation of Banesto's assets by Pta48bn. It said said Banesto's management 'has not given sufficient documentation to justify' a downward adjustment to the Pta503bn assessment of the overvaluation. In its letter to Mr Rojo, Morgan said it believed that Banesto's 'prospects for future profitability are strong'. It said it 'fully supported' a capital restructuring plan it drew up with Banesto, including a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue due in the second quarter of this year. The letter was written by Mr Roberto Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman, who represented Corsair on the Banesto board. Letter, Page 2 Rise of Alfredo Saenz, Page 8</p>

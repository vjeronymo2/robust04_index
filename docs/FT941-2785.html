			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (3): Expectations continue to soar - Sustainable economic growth appears to be within grasp The Polish economy is expected to show the fastest economic growth in Europe again this year, thanks to higher productivity, rising domestic and foreign investment and growing exports. The gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to rise by 5 per cent after a 4 per cent officially reported increase in 1993 which bankers believe probably understated the real growth in the private sector. Total output is now close to levels attained before the 'shock therapy' reforms of 1990, followed by the collapse of the Soviet market in 1991, which sent output from the old state industries into a tailspin. Sustainable economic growth appears to be within grasp, given reasonable political stability domestically and no destabilising shocks from Poland's eastern neighbours. Industrial output at the end of 1993 was 8.1 per cent higher than a year ago while growth in the under-recorded and previously underdeveloped service sector has risen even faster. But the volume indicators fail to tell the full story of an economy which now produces goods and services of a much higher quality than four years ago - but employs 3m fewer workers to do the job. Socially and politically, high unemployment is a big worry. But economically it means that strong productivity gains are underpinning the transformation of the economy and creating the basis for rising profits, a growing rate of capital accumulation, and job creation. The underlying improvements have been overstated by last year's 900 per cent rise in share prices on the Warsaw stock exchange which pushed price-equity ratios to dizzy heights. But the emergence of a toughly regulated, reasonably efficient stock market is undoubtedly one of the main economic developments of the past 12 months. This year should see rapid expansion in the number of listed companies, from the present 22, and a flood of new issues and capital increases as private companies take advantage of high share prices to raise cheap equity capital. The government is also expected to exploit this new channel by selling off parts of state enterprises through share issues. Strengthening of the financial infrastructure generally is also a high priority with 22,000bn zlotys (Dollars 1bn) earmarked in the budget for re-capitalisation of the state-owned banks while smaller undercapitalised private banks will be taken over by bigger groups under central bank supervision. After lengthy delays, the mass privatisation of more than 400 state enterprises and the transfer of managerial control to 20 new national Investment Funds (NIFs) is expected to be finalised by the autumn, along with the creation of new pension funds, investment trusts and insurance companies. Inflation, measured by the consumer price index, rose sharply at the end of 1993, due to a hiccough over meat prices, although the average dropped to 36 per cent last year from 44 per cent in 1992. Price increases dropped back to 1.6 per cent in January, in line with projections of a decline in inflation to 27 per cent on an annualised basis this year. Prospects for future growth, meanwhile, have been enhanced by last week's London Club agreement for a 42.5 per cent reduction of Poland's Dollars 13.2bn foreign commercial bank debt. This should greatly facilitate the inflow of foreign investment required to modernise the economy and fund ambitious infrastructure schemes. Sustained growth and reducing inflation to single digits by 1998 as planned by the National Bank of Poland, the independent central bank headed by Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, also requires continuing political will to meet IMF-approved monetary and fiscal targets in the face of growing political pressure for higher social spending and trade union demands for higher wages. The centre-left coalition government formed after last September's elections inherited the outlines of a stringent budget. The revised budget with its deficit ceiling of 83,000bn zlotys, around 4.1 per cent of GDP, even survived the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, and a power struggle between the coalition partners over control of economic policy. The successful introduction of value added tax (VAT) last July and the higher overall tax receipts deriving from a rising GDP allowed the new government to raise social spending marginally. Higher revenue and lower than forecast spending kept the 1993 deficit to 3.6 per cent of GDP, well below the 5 per cent target. Parliament approved the 1994 budget on March 5. This paved the way for a new IMF standby agreement, which in turn will ensure implementation of the 20 per cent, second-stage write-down of Poland's official debt at the end of March. This completes the 50 per cent overall write-down in Poland's former Dollars 33bn official debt agreed by the Paris Club in April, 1991. Servicing the foreign debt will be expensive, costing around Dollars 6bn annually by the middle of the next decade. But, short term, Poland's reserves rose last year to Dollars 7.6bn in spite of a Dollars 2.3bn trade deficit last year and the London Club agreement should make future borrowing easier. The stronger reserve position is accounted for partly by the spending of foreigners, including planeloads of shoppers from oil-rich Russian towns and more than 45m German day-trippers attracted by cheaper shopping. But reserves have also benefited from rising foreign investment in the Warsaw stock exchange and in Polish companies and from the capital flight out of Russia last year. Several other indicators also suggest that real incomes and the level of overall economic activity are probably higher than officially stated. An 11 per cent rise in retail sales in real terms last year, indicates that disposable incomes have been rising although official statistics point to a further 2.9 per cent decline in average real wages last year. The progress already made is impressive. Most subsidies and distortions have been removed, many of the most energy intensive and polluting factories, mines and plants have been closed, restructured or down-sized. More than 60 per cent of the economy is now privatised and several former loss-making state sector companies, even in traditional sectors such as shipbuilding have been turned around. Once staid foreign trade organisations, like Budimex and Elektrim, have been privatised and transformed into internationally competitive companies which could form the core of future 'national champions'. The Polish economy still has a long way to go before it can deliver western living standards. But unemployment should peak and start to fall in 1994 as higher investment gets under way. This will ensure the sustainability of an upswing which is already well into its second year and could last for years, provided it is not choked by inflationary increases in public spending and incomes.</p>

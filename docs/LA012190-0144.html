			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OKLAHOMA LOSES BALL, SHOT AND THE GAME TO ARIZONA  </P> <P> Oklahoma had shooting troubles all game long against Arizona. But in the end,  it was the shot the third-ranked Sooners didn't take that cost them Saturday.  </P> <P> Kermit Holmes cost the Sooners a chance at the tying basket when he lost the  ball out of bounds with four seconds left. Arizona's Sean Rooks was fouled one  second later and made two free throws as the 23rd-ranked Wildcats won, 78-74.  </P> <P> The victory was the first in three meetings over the last three years for the  Wildcats (11-3), and marked the first time since 1987-88 that the Sooners  (12-2) lost consecutive games.  </P> <P> "I knew if I made both of them, we'd beat Oklahoma," Rooks said of his two free  throws, which clinched Arizona's 41st consecutive victory at home, the longest  current streak in the nation. "That's a great feeling. I wasn't that confident,  but I knew I could do it."  </P> <P> Arizona limited the high-scoring Sooners to only seven of 28 shots in the first  half and 24 for 69 for the game. In their two losses to Kansas State and  Arizona, the Sooners scored a total of 125 points -- three more than their  average in a 12-0 start.  </P> <P> "You just hope to catch Oklahoma on a bad shooting night," Arizona Coach Lute  Olson said. Olson also was pleased with the way his team handled Oklahoma's  press. Matt Muehlebach, Harvey Mason and Matt Othick combined for only five  turnovers.  </P> <P> The Sooners had a chance to tie, but Mike Harris, driving to the basket,  attempted a bounce pass that Holmes couldn't handle.  </P> <P> "The pass surprised me," said Holmes, who thought Harris "was going to shoot it  the way he was penetrating."  </P> <P> Rooks and Jud Buechler led the Wildcats with 18 points. Skeeter Henry led the  Sooners with 14.  </P></p>

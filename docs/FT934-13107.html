			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Forestry helps Repola to profits ANOTHER strong performance from its forest operations helped Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, achieve profits of FM86m (Dollars 15.1m) in the first eight months, after sales grew 12 per cent to FM16.8bn. The result compares with a FM415m loss in the same period in 1992 and reflects the benefits of the weaker Finnish markka and increased production at its main unit, United Paper Mills (UPM). Operating profits more than doubled to FM1.79bn from FM818m. However, financing costs rose to FM1.7bn from FM1.23bn partly because foreign exchange losses increased to FM408m from FM109m. UPM saw sales rise 21 per cent to FM10.8bn and pre-tax profits increase to FM725m from FM133m. Sales fell 3 per cent to FM5bn at Rauma, the group's metals and engineering unit, although the division's pre-tax loss fell sharply to FM15m from FM238m. Rosenlaw, the company's packaging unit, lifted sales by 7 per cent to FM910m as it swung to a FM21 pre-tax profit from a FM27m loss last time round. Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry company, said it is considering selling part of its 21 per cent stake in Repola. The holding, a hangover from a failed bid attempt in 1990, has a total market value of FM2.8bn (Dollars 491m) and a book value of FM2.1bn. Morgan Stanley International and Alfred Berg have been retained as advisers. The group declined to comment on a market report that suggested it planned to sell half of its holding of 31.6m shares for FM84.5 per share to raise FM1.38bn. Repola's share price has doubled this year to FM88 per share in line with the improved performance of the Finnish exporting sector. Mr Timo Poranen, Metsa-Serla's chief executive, said recently that the stake was not essential for Metsa-Serla's business co-operation with UPM. The group also has a stated strategy of strengthening its balance sheet. Metsa-Serla swung to a FM112m profit after financial items in the first eight months from a FM169m loss in the same 1992 period. It is expecting a stronger performance in the final four months and 'a clear profit' for the full year, after 1992's FM290m deficit. Sales rose 7.2 per cent to FM5.34bn from FM5.03bn, with full-year sales expected to exceed FM8bn.</p>

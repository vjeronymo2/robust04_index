			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Domtar chairman and chief executive ousted Mr Pierre Desjardins, president and chief executive of Domtar, the Canadian paper, packaging and building materials group, has been ousted after a boardroom dispute over policy and management style. Domtar's part-time board chairman, Mr Paul Gobeil, has also been removed. Domtar confirmed the contracts of both executives were ended as of Sunday. Insiders estimate that under the terms of their contracts, Mr Desjardins stands to collect about CDollars 1.7m (USDollars 1.2m) and Mr Gobeil nearly CDollars 500,000 as golden handshakes. Mr Desjardins became head of Domtar in 1990 when profits were tumbling with the North American recession. He had been head of John Labatt's Canadian brewing operation. Former Liberal cabinet minister Mr Gobeil joined Domtar in 1993. Mr Stephen Larson, who joined Domtar as president in 1991 from Boise Cascade, the US group, but who left last July following disagreements, has been named Domtar's president and chief operating officer. He is also a director.</p>

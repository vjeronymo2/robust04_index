			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Clarke writes to all MPs over EU payments Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday wrote to all MPs to win their support for a bill increasing Britain's contributions to the European Union. The chancellor's unusual move followed threats by some Tory Eurosceptics to block the bill in retaliation for the cabinet's climbdown over Post Office privatisation. The overall battle plan for EU legislation received cabinet backing on Thursday after an hour-long meeting. Mr John Major, the prime minister, urged cabinet colleagues to make clear that the measure - the European Community finance bill - would lock in arrangements for British rebates from the EU until the end of the century. Mr Clarke admitted in his letter that the bill, to be introduced in the next session of parliament starting next week, will result in net costs for the UK. But he insisted that these would be small - at Pounds 75m in the 1995-96 financial year, rising to Pounds 250m in 1999 - and much less than those faced by other EU states. He stressed that the UK rebate, or abatement, which was negotiated by Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister in the 1980s, will continue. The abatement, which Mr Clarke said had saved Pounds 16bn since 1984, will continue to limit British payments to the EU budget. Tory Maastricht rebels are split over the bill, which must be passed to fix EU budgets to the end of the century. Some are determined to oppose it - but others will support the government in the interests of party unity. One Eurosceptic predicted yesterday that 'less than half a dozen' Conservative MPs would oppose the measure - insufficient to overturn the government's 14-strong Commons majority, even if all opposition MPs also vote against the government. Mr Clarke admitted that many MPs would wonder why the government had agreed a settlement that increased the revenue that the European Union can raise from its member states, especially when national budgets were under pressure. But he said the deal, agreed in 1992, was 'very tough'. The 1992 settlement, he said, provided for an average increase in EU expenditure commitments of 3.3 per cent a year in real terms from 1992 to 1999. This was a much lower increase than the 5.3 per cent annual real increase agreed for 1987 to 1992. However, the rate of growth of real EU spending is likely to be much higher than that for British government spending which will be detailed in the UK Budget later this month. The UK has usually been the second largest net contributor to the EU budget after Germany. But the chancellor said he expected France and the Netherlands would be making bigger net contributions per head than Britain by the end of the century.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] After the talks with President Tudjman in Zagreb  this afternoon, Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin looked  more than satisfied when he met reporters. According to him,  important agreements have been reached.    [Churkin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] "I had two main tasks today. First, to make sure  that all sides are ready for the very important meeting in  Geneva on Thursday. Second, I was trying to find a way out of  the deadlock in the talks on economic cooperation between Zagreb  and Knin."    [Announcer] Churkin expects that all negotiating parties  will  turn up in Geneva, for -- as he puts it -- the negotiators have  an obligation to the world community.    [Churkin] "On the second subject, I have an impression that  the deadlock in the economic talks has been resolved. I am  encouraged that we will soon see the beginning of the talks on  economic cooperation, which will immediately come up with  concrete economic measures, which will in turn enable further  important steps to normalize relations between Zagreb and Knin."    [Announcer] Although Churkin announced further talks, the  question of the venue and the date for the talks still remains  open.    [Churkin] "I am not in a position at this point to make an  announcement, but I believe that a venue will be found to their  mutual satisfaction. As I said, the most important thing is  that the deadlock has been resolved."    [Announcer] Churkin expects a great deal from the Geneva  talks. He believes that the world community is at this point  offering the greatest chances for peace, and it is up to the  negotiators to accept it. To use his full influence on all  parties in the Geneva negotiations, he is to travel to Sarajevo  tomorrow for talks with Alija Izetbegovic and Kresimir Zubak.</p>

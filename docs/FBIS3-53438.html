Malhotra, has said that the committee headed by him has  recommended privatization of the insurance business only to  protect the interests of the insuring public. In an interview  to PTI, he asserted that the U.S. threat to retaliate against  India if it did not open up its insurance industry did not weigh  with the committee. He said that opening up the insurance sector  would lead to better service by existing companies and also by  the new entrants.</p>

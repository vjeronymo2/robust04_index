Master Sergeant Moussa Adamou of the Bonou Gendarmerie Brigade  almost lost his life during the squabble. He was saved by his  colleagues, who rescued him from the Fulanis. Here with the  details is Isidore Zinsou:    [Zinsou] Indeed, for a few days now there have been  persistent rumors concering the movements of Fulani cattlemen  and their cattle towards the pastures in Gnahui-Zume, in Bonou  subprefecture in the Oueme District. We remember the incidents  that took place last year during their crossing of the region,  incidents that left bitter memories in the district. This time,  it is during the end of year festivities that the Fulanis  cattelmen settled in Ketou in the Oueme district. Informed of  the situation, the Bonou Gendarmerie Brigade sent a four-member  team to the locality on 3 January, along with two members of the  Association for the Development of the Bonou Subprefecture. The  presence of the team on the field has merely reactivated the  aggressiveness of the Fulanis, who were armed with sophisticated  weapons. The result of the clashes is four wounded gendarmes  and a pair of handcuffs that were taken away by the Fulanis  cattlemen. The gendarme master sergeant was wounded on his  forehead and arms. As for the members of the team, they were  all beaten up with clubs by the Fulanis. The gendarmes seized  nine 12-caliber cartridges and a sophiscated French-manufactured  gun.    According to some of the region's inhabitants, the Fulani  assailants -- some 30 Fulanis armed with clubs and guns --  stormed certain houses searching for gendarmes. The same  sources said that the Fulanis were ready to fight back any  attack from the people of Bonou. It should be recalled that  such incidents between the people of Oueme Valley and Fulani  cattlemen are frequent every year in December. Last year,  several people were killed in similar incidents.    Let us simply wish for calm to return to the region.</p>

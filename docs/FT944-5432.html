			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: The changing face of taxation - You cannot impose levies on an international market Why is a British chancellor of the exchequer proposing to freeze the tax on beer but remove another slice of the tax subsidies on housing? This is surely not traditional British political behaviour. And why is he doubling valued added tax on household fuel, at substantial political cost, while also considering removing the withholding tax on government bond interest, a change that would gain not a single vote at the next election? It is easy to be impressed by the political bluster that may be used to justify such decisions, but less easy to distinguish the long-term pressures which are pushing the tax system in particular directions. A British Budget statement is a curious ritual in which an apparently all-powerful finance minister produces a series of rabbits from a battered red box. Last Tuesday's speech by Kenneth Clarke was duller than most, but he still revelled in his ability to select arbitrary targets without warning or prior consultation. He proposed a tax on kiddies' arcade video games; surely you cannot get much meaner than that, although he knows the teenage lobby is a lot less powerful than the pensioner pressure groups which may yet scupper the proposed domestic energy VAT increase. Yet, when a government can no longer command a reliable parliamentary majority, the chancellor has to accept limits to his power. Once, in 1977, Denis Healey had to reverse a Budget petrol tax increase when the Liberals proved tiresome over the cost to Liberal-minded folk in remote country districts. There is, however, a more important way in which tax gathering has become increasingly constrained. The economy has become open. Capital, goods and people flow readily across borders. This produces faster economic growth, lower costs and greater choice. But when tax authorities fail to recognise the implications, strange distortions follow inevitably. Take the European Union's so-called single market. This has generated a bizarre chain of alcoholic drink transfers - from Italy and Spain into France, from France into the UK, and from the UK into Ireland. This northwards cascade of booze follows the geographical progression of alcohol taxation. Consider also the way little Luxembourg has become one of Europe's biggest centres for investment funds, with assets worth more than Dollars 250bn - substantially bigger than those of the UK's unit trust industry. This is due almost entirely to the tax-free status of funds there; this has proved a magnet for European tax-dodgers, especially in Germany. Britain is responding belatedly by introducing new, open-ended investment companies (Oeics) which will be able to pay dividends tax-free to foreigners. These Oeics probably will supplant unit trusts in due course. Clarke also is tempted to open up the gilt-edged market fully to foreigners because this would cut the government's borrowing costs. An open sale and re-purchase (or 'repo') market would permit large-scale speculative trading and, by improving liquidity, would make gilts more attractive to the world's fickle and foot-loose investors. Yet, the Inland Revenue might have to stop deducting tax on gilt interest payments at source because global investors cannot be bothered to buy securities, on which they must claim back tax, when there are plenty of untaxed bonds they can buy instead. You cannot impose tax on an international market: after all, that was precisely why the Eurobond market came to London in the 1960s: to escape from US withholding tax. But to pay gilt-edged interest gross of tax could turn out to be a charter for evasion by domestic investors in Britain. Ultimately, the tax authorities will have to wake up to the truth: that, if you eliminate borders, you can tax only the things that cannot move to a more friendly jurisdiction. You must stop trying to tax investments and company profits and goods that can be transported easily, and concentrate on taxing jobs, property and internal services. Yes, property: it is quite likely that our houses will, over a period of years, finally cease to be subsidised and will become taxed quite highly. Owner-occupied housing became a remarkable tax shelter after the Conservatives abolished the old Schedule A tax in 1963. Houses were exempt from capital gains tax, and there was income tax relief on mortgage interest at anything up to 83 per cent. This tax haven status lasted until 1974, but then began to be undermined as inflation ate into the value of Healey's once-generous Pounds 25,000 ceiling for mortgages qualifying for tax relief. From next April, interest tax relief will be limited to 15 per cent on Pounds 30,000 of debt - worth no more than about Pounds 400 a year at present mortgage rates. This residual benefit is likely to be phased out, perhaps under the cover of income tax cuts elsewhere, over the next two or three years. Capital gains tax on first homes might come next. How different is the trend in taxing investment. In the post-war environment especially (but not only), when Labour was in power, and when investors trapped in the UK by tough foreign exchange controls were sitting ducks for penal taxation, their 'unearned' income was taxed at premium rates. The worst year was 1968-69 when Roy Jenkins imposed a special 12-month surcharge which pushed the top tax rate on investment income to 136 per cent. Now, however, the top rate is 40 per cent. Moreover, there are useful tax-free personal pension plans, Tessas and Peps, the latter accumulating in a substantial way over a period of years and now open to corporate bonds as well as equities (although, curiously, not to the government's own gilt-edged bonds). Clarke has added venture capital trusts to the list of tax shelters. How different this is to the style of Jenkins. But this is not just because Clarke is of a different political persuasion. It is because we live in a different world.</p>

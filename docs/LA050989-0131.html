			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BABY FOUND DEAD WHEN SLEEPING FATHER WAKES  </P> <P> Newport Beach police are investigating the death of an infant girl who  apparently died when her father rolled on top of her while asleep on a couch in  their home, a spokesman said Monday.  </P> <P> Six-week-old Tyra Corbett was pronounced dead Sunday morning at Hoag Hospital.  Her father, James B. Corbett III, 21, was arrested on suspicion of involuntary  manslaughter and freed on $10,000 bond Sunday night, according to Newport Beach  Police Officer Robert Oakley.  </P> <P> Oakley said the baby's mother, Michelle Marie Koger, 20, awoke about 7:20 a.m.  Sunday in the family's apartment in the 1300 block of West Balboa Boulevard and  went to the crib to check on her daughter.  </P> <P> Discovering the baby gone, she went into the living room, where she found  Corbett asleep on the couch, he said. Koger shook Corbett to awake him, "and  when he rolls over, the baby's underneath him."  </P> <P> The infant was not breathing, he said, and the couple called paramedics, who  rushed Tyra to the hospital.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the coroner's office said a cause of death has not been  determined pending tissue and toxicological studies. Oakley said a doctor's  report indicates that there was no evidence of other abuse but that police are  investigating "to determine all the facts in the case in order to present them  properly in court."  </P> <P> Investigators are also examining whether the father was under the influence of  alcohol or drugs at the time, he said. Although it appears that the baby died  when her father rolled on top of her and that no foul play was involved, Oakley  said, the possibility of foul play "will be definitely investigated."  </P> <P> Oakley said it was not known why Corbett took the baby from her crib.  </P> <P> Neither Corbett nor Koger could be reached for comment.  </P></p>

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 107 of the Guide, the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, or warrants. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Amex now proposes to list for trading under section 107 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part on a static index composed of ten actively-traded equity securities to be determined and published by Lehman Brothers on or about July 1, 1994 (``Index''). The securities to be included in the Index will be announced by Lehman Brothers at or as close as possible to the time of the offering of the Notes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27753 (March 1, 1990), 55 FR 8626 (March 8, 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Notes will be non-convertible debt securities and will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107A of the Guide. Specifically, the Notes must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (2) a minimum of 400 holders; (3) an aggregate market value of at least $20 million; and (4) a term of at least one year. Additionally, the issuer of the Notes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Lehman Brothers) must have assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10 million, and pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As an alternative to these financial criteria, the issuer may have either: (1) Assets in excess of $200 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $10 million; or (2) assets in excess of $100 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $20 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the Notes will provide for maturity within approximately one year from the date of issue. Notes may provide for periodic payments and/or payments at maturity based in whole or in part on changes in the value of the Index. In addition, the Notes may feature a ``cap'' on the maximum amount and/or a ``floor'' on the minimum amount to be paid either periodically or at maturity. Prior to the commencement of listing and trading of the Notes, the Exchange shall distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities, including appropriate suitability criteria and/or guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ten components of the Index shall meet the following criteria: (1) A minimum market capitalization of $75 million, except that one component security may have a market capitalization of not less than $50 million; (2) trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than one million shares, except that one component security may have a trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than 500,000 shares; (3) at least nine of the ten components of the Index will meet the then current criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; (4) all components of the Index will be listed on the Amex or the New York Stock Exchange, or will be National Market securities traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System; and (5) no more than two components of the Index shall be non-U.S. securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the appropriate regulatory organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index will be calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the component securities is represented in an approximately equal dollar amount in the Index. To create the Index, a portfolio of ten equity securities will be established by the issuer, Lehman Brothers, representing an investment of $10,000 in each component security (rounded to the nearest whole share). The value of the Index will equal the current market value of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the component securities divided by the current Index divisor. The Index divisor will initially be set to provide a benchmark value of 100.00 at the close of trading on the day preceding the establishment of the Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of shares of each component stock in the Index will remain fixed except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend (other than an ordinary cash dividend), a stock distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component securities. The number of shares of each component security may also be adjusted, if necessary, in the event of a merger, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation of an issuer or in certain other events such as the distribution of property by an issuer to shareholders, the expropriation or nationalization of a foreign issuer of the imposition of certain foreign taxes on shareholders of a foreign issuer. Shares of a component security may be replaced (or supplemented) with other securities under certain circumstances, such as the conversion of a component stock into another class of security, the termination of a depositary receipt program, or the spin-off of a subsidiary. If the security remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure continuity of the value of the Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

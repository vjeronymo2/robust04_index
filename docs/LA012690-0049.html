			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Bogdan Perzynski is a Polish artist living in Austin, Tex. His work appears as  a set of meditations on cultural stereotypes, global tensions, censorship and  basic human urges.  </P> <P> Smartly designed and clearly dry-humored, Perzynski's four installations are  slow to yield their meanings.  </P> <P> In "Skitseuphrenia," the word is spelled out phonetically on four pennants.  Blowups of engravings of Isaac Newton and Nicolaus Copernicus rest on the floor  next to a real tandem bicycle (presumably a symbol for the mental disorder).  Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy, is turned on his head in a kind of  literal one-upmanship (his notion of the universe didn't include Newton's law  of gravitation).  </P> <P> The point seems to be that major theories about the universe used to change  slowly -- the two scientists lived centuries apart -- but we now live in an  unsettling world of radical upheaval, particularly in the political sphere (the  pennants -- signifying the "sport" of warring factions -- are blood-red).  Nonetheless, the piece remains a kind of rebus in which each part stands for  something but the separate parts don't enhance one's impression of the whole.  </P> <P> In "Pleasure," dollar bills, dried leaves, tableware wrapped in red napkins, an  animal silhouetted against a block of painted camouflage print and a trio of  different dictionaries in glass cases seem to be calling attention to the  conflicting interpretations that can be put on the notion of pleasure. One  man's meat is another man's poison -- but it depends who is labeling the  poison. A group of prints delves into the same themes by combining drawn and  photographic imagery.

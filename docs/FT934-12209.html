			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (13): Joint ventures bring expertise - Profile: Associated Motorways FOR many Colombo businesspeople, the war against Tamil separatists in the north of the country seems very remote, writes Kieran Cooke. 'We really don't notice it much down here,' says Mr Tilak de Zoyza, managing director of the Associated Motorways (AMW) car industry group. AMW is one of Sri Lanka's biggest importers of cars and motorcycles, mainly from Japan. But its main business is what is known as tyre rebuilding. AMW collects used tyres and employs the latest technology to rebuild them. The rebuilt tyres have 80 per cent of the life of a new tyre. AMW's tyre rebuilding facility is one of the biggest in the region. Mr de Zoyza feels there could be more economic progress if the war ended. But of more immediate concern is government economic policy. 'There has been a remarkable change over the past four years,' says Mr de Zoyza. 'Former President Premadasa pushed through a whole series of measures to liberalise the economy. We were given tax incentives to encourage us to buy new machinery and employ more people. 'As a result, business has been investing far more and reaping the dividends. This year AMW will have a turnover of about SLRs720m; double that of three years ago.' Improved investment incentives plus the easing of exchange controls mean that companies have been able to enter into joint ventures with overseas investors, introducing much-needed technology and expertise to Sri Lankan industry. AMW has recently entered into a joint venture to manufacture tyres with the giant RPG group of India. It has started another tyre retreading operation with a Malaysian company and Mr de Zoyza is thinking of going into the shoe business, again with a company from Malaysia. 'The whole business atmosphere has changed in recent years,' says Mr de Zoyza. 'While interest rates are high - more than 20 per cent - credit is not so tightly controlled as it once was. The loosening of foreign exchange controls has been a key development. 'Not long ago one of the big state banks gave me a credit card with a limit of Dollars 10,000. I've never had a credit card in my life. Such a thing was unthinkable only a few years ago.' The AMW group now employs more than 2,000 people. AMW's capital has been increased by its listing on the Colombo stock exchange. Foreign shareholders control more than 20 per cent of the group's equity. 'We now realise we can't just depend on the home market for growth,' says Mr de Zoyza. 'We must export and we are expanding our manufacturing base to make us more competitive in the region.' AMW has several links with Japanese conglomerates. For many years it has been manufacturing motorcycle and bicycle tyres in collaboration with the Japanese Inoui group. It is also hoping to resurrect an old relationship with Yuasa, the Japanese battery manufacturer. 'The rising yen is creating problems for Japanese business,' says Mr de Zoyza. 'Companies like ours are building up the necessary expertise and industrial base to offer an alternative, low-cost manufacturing facility. 'Despite the war I'm optimistic about the future.'</p>

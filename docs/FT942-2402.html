			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Lib dem spokesman advises union to sever ties with Labour If the trade union movement is serious about adopting Continental-style social partnership it will have to stop being politically tied to the Labour party, Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, told a conference organised by The Guardian newspaper and the Fabian Society. Mr Carlile said: 'The unions will never become full partners in industry if they are tied to one party.' He is in favour of unions sponsoring MPs from other parties, including the Liberal Democrats. He also suggested unions should help small companies by providing venture capital. 'They would get a better return than they have got from investing in the Labour party,' he said. Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the IRSF civil service union, told the conference that 99 per cent of his union's members had agreed to having their union dues deducted from pay by their employer, as required by the government's new legislation on 'check-off'.</p>

While some  members called for stern measures against Togo, others urged the  government to exercise restraint. This is because any war will  result in the destruction of lives and property. This followed  a statement by the member for Hoehoe-South, Mr. Koffi Kedem, at  today's sitting of the house in Accra. The statement called for  a quick and resolute response from the government for the  crimes, unwarranted murders, and flagrant violation of the  country's territory by Togo. They invited the minister of  foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, to brief parliament on the  situation.</p>

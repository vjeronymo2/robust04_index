This is our newscast's  confidential report. The serious dispute between Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff and U.S. Government authorities in the  past days, added to his differences with top officials in  President Cesar Gaviria's government on all his recent actions,  has brought up the possibility of his resignation.    According to information obtained by this newscast, de  Greiff  is seriously considering the possibility of officially tendering  his resignation next Monday, when he returns from the United  States. Entirely trustworthy sources have asserted that the  prosecutor general will resign because he is disappointed with,  what he has called, the Colombian Government's lack of  solidarity to confront the strong criticism by U.S. authorities  who accuse him of being weak in his negotiations with the drug  traffickers.    This newscast has also established that next week, the  prosecutor general will also present a long document where he  will clarify his actions with legal arguments and point out that  all his measures have been in accord with the strict  implementation of the new criminal law. Prosecutor General de  Grieff and the Supreme Court chief justice met today to talk,  precisely, about the need to change this law for a stronger one.    In addition, de Grieff will declare that the Prosecutor  General's Office is hindered in continuing the investigation of  the case of the attack on the Avianca plane and will ask the  government to appoint ad hoc officials to this case, which  caused his differences with the United States to increase.</p>

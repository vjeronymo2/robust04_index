			<p>BFN     [Text] An Armenian parliamentary delegation headed by  Deputy Speaker Aram Saakyan arrived in Tbilisi today. The  delegation had a meeting with Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman  of the Georgian Supreme Council and head of state. The  conversation dealt with fruitfully developing relations between  Armenia and Georgia.    Problems common for the two countries have been considered.  In particular, the Armenian representatives pointed out that  the return of refugees to Abkhazia is very important for them,  too, because a lot of ethnic Armenians, who have also been  affected by the conflict, live in Abkhazia. Shevardnadze has  said that the Georgian side will appreciate the involvement of  the Republic of Armenia in the settlement of the issue.    The conversation also touched upon the work of the two  parliaments. The sides have shared their experience.    The meeting was attended by Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, the  deputy speaker of the Georgian Supreme Council.</p>

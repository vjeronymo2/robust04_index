			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews by Max Jacobson.  Prices are based on average dinner costs for a party of two without wine.  </P> <P> $--less than $15  </P> <P> $$--$15 to $39  </P> <P> $$$--$40 to $75  </P> <P> $$$$--more than $75  </P> <P> AMERICAN  </P> <P> * Burrell's Rib Cage, 305 N. Hesperian St., Santa Ana. (714) 835-9936. Open  daily, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Also at 1701 E. Mc Fadden Ave., J, Santa Ana. (714)  541-3073. Open Mondays through Thursdays 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and  Saturdays till 11 p.m., Sundays till 9 p.m. $  </P> <P>  Wanna sample of what Magic Johnson and Richard Nixon say is the area's best  barbecue? Come on down to Burrell's and see what the shouting is about. You'll  eat from plastic boxes in a dark smoky room and you'll probably get sauce on  your shirt. The good news is you won't care. Beef brisket is as soft and lean  as a baby's cheek, and chopped pork shoulder is a symphony of textures. Save  room for the especially terrific homemade sausage, crumbly and charred crisp.  It's what a food critic lives for.  </P> <P> CHINESE  </P> <P> * China Muslim, 18331 E. Colima Road, Rowland Heights. (818) 810-2499. Open  every day from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. $  </P> <P> No one eats the rice at China Muslim, a restaurant just over the county line  where the food of China's rugged western provinces is well represented.  Instead, everybody eats the sze ma da bing, a giant sesame bread served  steaming hot from the oven. Try such halal (conforming to Islamic dietary law)  dishes as fragrant shredded tripe, shallot rubbed chicken and lamb with pan  fried noodle. An exotic, unusual restaurant.  </P> <P> INDIAN  </P> <P> * Bukhara, 7954 Edinger Ave., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-3171. Open daily from  11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5 to 10:30 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Bukhara may have a slightly generic menu but the cooking is generally fresh and  honest. The lunch buffet is incredibly generous at a mere $5.95 -- five  vegetable dishes, hot naan bread, onion bhaji and two chicken dishes. Evenings,  tandoori appetizers are the best bet, even if they do suffer from an excess of  food coloring. Sauced dishes are good too, even if they are all prepared with  the same spices. Leave room for the kulfi ice cream, made from boiled milk and  crushed nuts. It's great.  </P> <P> MEXICAN  </P> <P> * Colima, 130 N. Fairview, Santa Ana. (714) 836-1254. Open seven days a week,  7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. $  </P> <P> Colima is your basic storefront Mexican restaurant but what comes out of the  kitchen is far from ordinary. A woman named Lupe oversees the cooking and makes  wonderful, hand-made tortillas daily. Her sons assist. Such fresh seafoods as  snapper, shrimp, octopus, perch and catfish are the specialties, prepared in a  variety of styles. Don't miss the rompope, egg nog with a kick like a crazed  burro.  </P> <P> THAI  </P> <P> * Thainakorn, 24401 Ridge Route, Laguna Hills. (714) 586-0596. Open daily  except Mondays from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11  p.m. $$  </P> <P> Thainakorn of Laguna Hills is a surburban dinner house serving a smoothed over  version of fare from northeast Thailand, normally one of the world's hottest  cuisines. Dine on standby Thai such as pat Thai noodles and sour shrimp soup  or, better yet, specialties from the blackboard like crispy, exotically spiced  Thai sausage, Chinese watercress with fermented soy, or wild boar in red curry  paste. But leave the fire extinguisher at home.  </P></p>

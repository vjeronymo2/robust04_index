			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Minister sees early end to Malaysia ban The British and Malaysian governments are 'definitely on the way to solving' the trade rift between the two countries, Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said yesterday. At the end of February Malaysia imposed a ban on giving government contracts to British companies in retaliation for critical reports in the British media about the Kuala Lumpur government. 'They went out of their way to make us welcome,' said Mr Needham, after meetings in Malaysia with senior officials. 'They even offered us scones and cream tea. It was real strawberry jam. We are definitely on the way to solving the problem.' Mr Needham, who arrived on a surprise visit on Monday, said it was not a question of whether the ban would be lifted, more when. He is due to report back to London today. Malaysian officials also feel that the ban on British companies will be lifted 'in a matter of weeks rather than months', according to one senior finance ministry official. Malaysia has been one of the biggest markets in the Far East for British goods and services in recent years. When it imposed its ban the Malaysian government said that up to Pounds 4bn worth of contracts with British companies could be affected. Mr Needham has met Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister, and Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the trade minister. He brought a letter from Mr Major to Dr Mahathir and is believed to have proposed setting up consultative groups on subjects ranging from the transfer of technology to education and healthcare. 'We have to set up a system through which we can understand their sensitivities and they can learn about our problems,' said Mr Needham. 'We need to build a far closer relationship.' The main focus of Malaysian anger was an article in The Sunday Times alleging that a British company had been involved in negotiations to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir in exchange for a multi-million-pound contract. Dr Mahathir accused The Sunday Times - and the British media in general - of telling lies. 'All I want is the truth,' he said. 'But the British media is incapable of telling the truth.' Mr Needham is due to return to Kuala Lumpur as leader of a British trade delegation in just over a week.</p>

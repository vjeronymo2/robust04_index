			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Mitsubishi bank's bad loans put at double under US rules Evidence of the damage inflicted on Japanese banks by bad loans emerged yesterday when Mitsubishi Bank disclosed that its non-performing loans - calculated by US accounting standards - were almost double the amount disclosed in Japan. Mitsubishi, one of the 11 main commercial Japanese banks, is listed on the New York stock exchange where it is required to file accounts to conform with Securities and Exchange Commission criteria. It reported bad loans of Y1,150bn (Pounds 7.3bn) for the year ended March 31, against a figure of Y572bn yen in its Japanese accounts last month. In the late 1980s, the so-called 'bubble era', Japanese banks provided vast sums to companies, many of which indulged in speculative property and stock investment that cost them dearly when prices collapsed and the economy contracted. Under Japanese rules, banks count as non-performing only loans to bankrupt companies and to those with interest in arrears for six months or more. US accounting practice requires banks to disclose the amount of restructured loans, on which interest payments are reduced in order to keep borrowers afloat. Japanese banks have been forced to restructure loans to many troubled clients, but the extent of the damage has been unclear. Mitsubishi disclosed that its restructured loans jumped by 182 per cent overall in the year, while its restructured loans to businesses in Japan rose 272 per cent. According to its Japanese accounts, total problem loans rose by 14 per cent over the same period. Mitsubishi is generally regarded as one of the strongest of the Japanese banks. Its non-performing loans declared in Japan represent 1.8 per cent of total loans, against a sector average of 3.8 per cent. The US results show that figure to be closer to 4 per cent, and if other banks' restructured loans are in the same range as Mitsubishi's, some may have non-performing loans representing 13 per cent of their loan book. Another sign of the difficulties of Japanese banks came yesterday when bank officials suggested that the annual wage increase at the 11 main commercial banks might be the lowest on record. Employers have offered a pay rise of just 0.7 per cent in response to union demands for a 1.5 per cent increase, and the final figure is likely to be closer to the employers' offer. Japanese accounting procedures have been widely criticised for not giving a true picture of bank balance sheets, and investors have had to guess at the likely total of non-performing loans. In Mitsubishi's case, the most pessimistic independent estimate - by Salomon Brothers, the US securities house - put the probable figure around Y740bn, well below the new figures released. Banks say they would like to increase their provisions for bad loans but face opposition from the finance ministry, which is anxious to avoid the loss in revenue such a measure would have on the country's finances.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the  State Duma Committee on Security, will, after the spring  parliamentary recess, make public documentary evidence in his  possession of infringements of privatization regulations by the  State Committee for the Management of State Property. He told  this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent in a telephone conversation  today.    Viktor Ilyukhin is unperturbed by the news that Anatoliy  Chubays has decided to bring a court action against him for  slander. "As a lawyer," he underlined, "I judge the documents I  have collected to be very serious. They show convincingly that  the methods which Anatoliy Chubays is using to carry out the  transfer of state property into private hands serve the  interests of only 15 to 20 percent of Russia's population."    Without waiting for the court to consider, the chairman of  the Duma Security Committee has decided to inform press  representatives of the contents of these documents on  approximately 11-12 May -- immediately after the end of the  lower chamber of parliament's recess.</p>

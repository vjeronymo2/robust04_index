			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pauli Andersen: "Clean Water"] </F>   [Text] The European conception of clean drinking water will  be profoundly challenged in coming years. The chemical industry  and a number of EU [European Union] nations will permit drinking  water to contain toxins, as long as it does not harm humans.  Denmark has said no to more toxins in the waters. But Danish  scientists maintain this position is unreasonable.    "Never drink water," said W.C. Fields, who would never have  dreamed of mixing a drop of the stuff into his shot glass of  whiskey.    The Danes were not listening. They drink several billion  liters of it each year. All in good conscience. For, as long as  there have been humans on this earth, clean groundwater has been  a given as profound as life itself.    Yet, even as the second millennium is humming its final  refrain, the conception of this pristine necessity of life has  been challenged by something resembling the first bar of the  virgin spring's swan song.    The threat arises from chemicals leached from old industrial  sites and nitrates from the use of agricultural fertilizer. To  this may be added new information about raw water that arrives  at water purification plants polluted with pesticides. Denmark's  Geological Survey (DGU) has just published this finding in a  report on the state of the groundwater.    How great is the threat? Have they found quantities in the  groundwater so minuscule they are incapable of causing harm?  Is the perception of pollution in reality a deception  perpetrated by instruments so sensitive they (to use a  scientist's words) could measure Napoleon's urine production on  an anxious morning at the front?    Can Denmark and Europe sacrifice with equanimity the  principle of uncontaminated groundwater for the sake of  maintaining our present-day intensive and industrialized  agricultural operations? Or is the discovery of toxic sprays and  nitrates in the groundwater so alarming that agriculture must  accustom itself to the use of much less fertilizer and poisons?    That is a question that will occupy an important place on  the  EU agenda in the coming year.  <H5>  Pressure on the EU </H5>   Billions and billions of kroner are at issue. The chemicals  industry is afraid that restrictions on the use of pesticides  will cause their profits to plummet. And many governments in EU  countries have so much difficulty in achieving the requirement  of zero-contaminated groundwater that they are facing  extraordinary expenditure for water purification, if the  regulations are not relaxed.    It is estimated that 25 billion kroner will be used in  Denmark over the course of 30 to 100 years for cleaning up old  dump sites and industrial locales. Purification of water or the  relocation of water wells because of the nitrate and pesticide  content in reservoirs is expected to cost the society an  additional billion.    Reflecting the concerns of agriculture, the economy, and the  environment, the dilemma has taken the form of an assault upon  two EU directives. A number of member countries are demanding  that the regulations on certification of plant toxins and  protection of the groundwater be relaxed. The main argument  being advanced is that it is all right for groundwater to  contain traces of pesticides when it is a question of harmless  quantities.    Following an Irish initiative, the Belgian chairmanship  shortly before Christmas made the proposal that the World Health  Organization's water quality standards, rather than the  principle of zero contamination, should be applied to pesticides  in drinking water.    Ireland, Great Britain, France, Spain, and Belgium support  this proposal. If they are to avoid billions in expenditure for  purification, threshold values will have to be set at a level  they can achieve, according to one of the main arguments.    The push for more relaxed regulations for pesticides in  drinking water has come at a time when the EU's fifth  environmental program is advocating stronger protection of  groundwater and a lower consumption of pesticides. It also comes  at a time when the EU heads of state have auspiciously announced  "that the major battles on behalf of the environment will be won  or lost during the course of this decade."    The official Danish position is as clear as uncontaminated  drinking water. More relaxed regulations will be a major setback.    But Danish scientists are posing the question whether  healthwise it is even reasonable for Denmark to insist upon the  principle of uncontaminated drinking water.  <H5>  Critical Scientists </H5>   Associate Professor Erik Arvin of the Laboratory for  Technical Hygiene at Denmark's Technical University is one of  the critical voices:    "Pesticides in the microscopic quantities found in Danish  groundwater are not harmful. However, Danish environmental  policy in the groundwater issue is determined almost exclusively  by what it is technically feasible to measure. The attitude is,  if it can be measured, it's toxic.    ``An ordinary halt in traffic causes the ingestion of 30 to  40 times the concentration of chlorinated solvent as is found in  groundwater. And a public pool is a downright gas chamber viewed  from this perspective,'' he said.    Veterinarian Bent Fenger, director of WHO's European Water  and Sewage Office, dared to lay his head on the block when it  came to the health and scientific threshold values the  organization has established for chemicals in drinking water.  Although the values are up to 1,000 times higher than the  existing threshold values of 0.1 microgram (in principle, zero),  he guaranteed them to be so safe that human health is not an  issue as long as the values are not exceeded. This would hold  true even if there were many different substances present in the  water at the same time.    "The threshold values build upon a thorough scientific  documentation of materials with built-in safety factors of up to  100,000," said Fenger.  <H5>  Pesticides and Cancer </H5>   In some of the scientific investigations on pesticides under  discussion, one may read that many of these substances are  carcinogenic. This is true of a study published in 1992 by Dr.  Flemming Lander, a Danish physician who studied occupational  diseases.    Lander demonstrated a frequency of up to five times the  average number of cancer cases among gardeners. That is, among  people who have frequent contact with pesticides.    On the basis of his work with cancer patients and  pesticides,  Lander stated that, as far as health was concerned, it was  playing the lottery to place threshold values on the pesticide  content of drinking water.    His study, which included 4,000 gardeners, did not mention  types or doses of the pesticides the gardeners had been exposed  to. But an organization under WHO, the International Agency for  Cancer Research (IARC), has recorded a number of pesticides that  are potentially cancer causing. This includes, among others,  five of the eight chemicals that DGU measured in treated water.    "We register chemicals that have the ability to cause  cancer.  But our records do not tell what doses are necessary to cause  it," said biologist Henrik Moller from IARC in Lyon.    How much or how little of these substances must be present  to  cause cancer or other health problems has simply not been  evaluated by Danish environment administrators. The idea that an  evaluation of levels dangerous to health should supplant the  guiding principle of zero contamination runs up against strong  resistance from environmentalists.    Finn Bro Rasmussen, chairman of the EU's advisory  Environmental Chemicals Committee, considered it absurd to place  one's fate in the hands of science in so basic a question as  groundwater.    And in the Danish Environmental Board, Gunver Bennekou,  director of the Office of Preventive Means, agreed:    "You can perhaps run a risk with food or medicine. Because  those substances can quickly be removed if we learn something  new. But with groundwater it is a question of an ongoing process  over many years. In other words, our knowledge is of no use if  we find out that we set our threshold values too high," she said.    Anders Baekgaard, director of the Danish Purification Plant  Association, said:    "We would have considerable difficulty explaining to our  consumers that they can feel easy about drinking water with  toxic residues or solvents in it. But it is also a bad idea to  relax quality standards in an area, like water, that is an  important pillar in the maintenance of life itself."  <H5>  The People's Voice </H5>   The voice of the people is as yet very meek. The battle over  drinking water has so far not appealed to popular movements to  anything like the same degree as the question of nuclear power  did, for example.    Danish environmental opinion on the subject has been  virtually synonymous with agronomist Lone Albrektsen. She  started the Greenpeace agricultural campaign. Ever since the  organization shut down that aspect of its work, she has worked  alone on her own to capture people's attention concerning the  groundwater problem.    Her main point is that the threat to the groundwater cannot  be eliminated unless agriculture is radically transformed into  an extensive and ecological operation.    "If EU support to today's industrialized agriculture were to  be given instead to ecological operations, ecological  agriculture would pay for itself far better in the long run than  conventional agriculture. At the same time, society would save  the money for prevention of pollution that conventional  agriculture generates. To slack off on environmental  requirements for the sake of encouraging the current form of  agriculture would be an unforgivable experiment with the health  of our own and future generations," said Albrektsen.</p>

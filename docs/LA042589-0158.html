			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CRITIC NOMINATED FOR TOP CIVIL RIGHTS POST  </P> <P> President Bush today nominated William Lucas, a black Republican critic of  affirmative action, as the Justice Department's civil rights chief, setting up  a potentially bruising Senate confirmation fight.  </P> <P> The previously announced opposition to Lucas by the NAACP, the nation's largest  civil rights group, could energize liberal opposition to the nominee.  </P> <P> NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks said in a statement Monday that  Lucas is not qualified to be the government's chief enforcer of civil rights  laws.  </P> <P> The White House formally announced Lucas' selection as assistant attorney  general in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division in a  one-sentence statement issued in San Jose, where Bush had spent the night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pushed by Thornburgh  </P> <P> Lucas had been pushed for the job by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.  </P> <P> In a statement, Thornburgh called Lucas "a talented, decent and compassionate  person whom I have known for a number of years."  </P> <P> "Bill Lucas is fully committed to the vigorous and fair enforcement of our  country's civil rights laws and to removing barriers to equal opportunity for  all our citizens," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> People for the American Way, a well-financed liberal lobbying group, joined  Hooks in expressing reservations about Lucas.  </P> <P> Lucas "is someone with no track record and a lot of question marks," said the  group's president, Arthur J. Kropp.  </P> <P> "The questions will have to be resolved before the civil rights community can  support him," said Kropp, who heads a 270,000-member organization that helped  defeat Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987.  </P> <P> Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said opposition by the  National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People "doesn't change a thing  for us."  </P> <P> Lucas has been criticized by several civil rights leaders since Thornburgh  revealed in February that he had urged Bush to nominate him for the position.  </P> <P> The 61-year-old Lucas, a former sheriff and executive of Wayne County, ran  unsuccessfully as the GOP's nominee for Michigan governor in 1986. A former  Democrat, Lucas has been considered for other federal positions in the Bush  Administration.  </P> <P> Civil rights leaders have cited Lucas' record as sheriff to demonstrate their  view that he is not qualified to run a Justice Department division responsible  for prosecuting local police for brutality.  </P> <P> In 1976, Lucas was held legally responsible by a federal appeals court for  failure to investigate allegations that a prisoner was beaten while in the  custody of sheriff's deputies. Lucas said he was unaware of the allegations at  the time, but the court found he had failed to institute training procedures to  prevent brutality by his deputies.  </P> <P> That same year, Lucas was cited for contempt of court for failing to reduce  overcrowding and improve conditions at the county jail.  </P> <P> Lucas' claim on an old resume that he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in  the Justice Department's civil rights division during the early 1960s has also  sparked controversy.  </P> <P> Lucas actually worked as a legal assistant and resigned after he failed the  District of Columbia Bar examination.  </P></p>

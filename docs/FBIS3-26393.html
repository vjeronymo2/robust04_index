The organizing committee for "An In-Depth Look at Economic  Returns in China" sponsored a "Forum on Deng Xiaoping's Ideas  Concerning the Improvement of Economic Returns." In an  impromptu speech at the forum, Honorary Chairman Bo Yibo said:  The country's economy is now growing vigorously, while initial  successes have been made in macroeconomic regulation and  control. The situation is heartening. The whole nation, full  of confidence, is trying hard to push China's economy to a new  height by following the principle of seizing the current  opportunity for development, deepening reform, opening wider to  the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining  stability. All of you present here today have charge of  improving economic returns. As you are in this business, you  must be soberly aware of the fact that low economic returns  nationwide remain largely unchanged. For example, the composite  index for industrial economic returns fell at the end of 1993.  We must, in particular, watch out for the bad tendency arising  in some localities toward blindly undertaking construction  projects, overextending construction scale, blindly seeking  development speed, and neglecting economic returns. The scale  of fixed assets investment is so large as to exceed what China's  financial capabilities can withstand. Regarding publicity on  economic work, not enough attention has been given to  highlighting the importance of improving economic returns.  Under these circumstances, it is necessary to study in a  comprehensive manner -- and to unify our thinking on -- Comrade  Xiaoping's ideas on combining development speed with economic  returns to make sure that high speed and high economic returns  promote each other and help bring about the sustained, rapid,  and healthy growth of China's economy.    Comrade Bo Yibo spoke of his understanding of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's exposition on the relationship between development  speed and economic returns. Comrade Xiaoping's ideas of  "development being the last word" and "being conducive to the  three causes" [developing the productive forces of socialist  society; increasing the overall strength of socialist society;  and improving the people's living standard] are the operative  ideas concerning pushing China's economy to a new height.  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "If development is possible, we  should not block the way. Localities with suitable conditions  should carry out development as quickly as they can. As long as  attention is paid to economic efficiency, product quality, and  foreign economic exchange, we need not be worried about  anything." He also said: "We must strive really hard to upgrade  the economy to a new level every few years. We are, certainly,  not encouraging unrealistic high growth rates. Rather, we should  do solid work, stress economic returns, and bring about steady  and well-balanced development." As far as I know, this has been  Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea. Over the past 10-plus  years, he has repeatedly stressed this dialectical unity between  development speed and high economic returns. We must try our  best to achieve a relatively high growth rate. It is both  possible and necessary for China to achieve an annual growth  rate of 8 to 9 percent in line with its economic strength,  financial capabilities, and materials supply. We must combine  development speed with economic returns, product quality, and  market demand. A low development speed and underproduction will  adversely affect the improvement of China's overall economic  strength and living standards; we must not allow this to happen.  Neither excessive stockpiles nor redundant construction should  be tolerated. Inventories of industrial enterprises covered in  government budgets amounted to 170 billion yuan at the end of  last year. What a gargantuan figure this is! What does it  signify? Comrades: Think about it!    In conclusion, Bo Yibo stressed: An organic combination of  high speed with high economic returns serves as an "inevitable  road" for us to achieve the strategy of modernizing China in  three phases. This is not only an economic issue, but also a  political one.    Also speaking at yesterday's forum were Wang Zhongyu,  minister in charge of State Economics and Trade Commission; and  Sun Shangqing, director of the Development Research Center of  the State Council. They noted that in order to raise the  nation's economy to a new height and improve its overall level,  we must combine development speed with high economic returns.  The fundamental way to improve economic returns lies in raising  the technological level of enterprises and lowering production  costs. Other speakers included Fan Jingyi, editor in chief of  RENMIN RIBAO; Yang Weiguang, director of the China Central  Television; Min Fanlu, deputy editor in chief of the XINHUA news  agency; and Ai Feng, member of the Editorial Board of RENMIN  RIBAO.</p>

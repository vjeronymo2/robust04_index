			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ANNE' MINISERIES INSPIRE WEEKLY SERIES 'AVONLEA'  </P> <P> The Disney Channel's two Emmy Award-winning miniseries, "Anne of Green Gables"  and "Anne of Avonlea," have spawned "Avonlea," a rewarding, hourlong weekly  series for all ages, beginning tonight at 8.  </P> <P> Based again on the books of Lucy Maud Montgomery, "Avonlea" is the story of  privileged 10-year-old Sara Stanley, who must come to rustic Prince Edward  Island to live with relatives when her widowed father encounters financial  trouble.  </P> <P> She's unhappy at first, but spirited (naturally), and quickly becomes the  ringleader of adventure and mischief among the town's children, disarming and  exasperating the adults at the same time.  </P> <P> In the lead is wide-eyed, gap-toothed Sarah Polley, one of the most beguiling  child actors around (her credits include "Ramona," the Canadian TV series based  on the Beverly Cleary books, and Terry Gilliam's film, "The Adventures of Baron  Munchausen"). She shares the small screen with a marvelous cast. Among the many  actors playing unforgettable characters in the first three episodes are Jackie  Burroughs (who plays Aunt "I'm just doing my duty" Hetty); Frances Hyland as  Sara's prim nanny, horrified by the primitive town, and R.H. Thomson as a  painfully shy, reclusive genius.  </P> <P> Colleen Dewhurst and Patricia Hamilton are another plus, reprising their "Anne  of Green Gables" roles as Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde.  </P> <P> Executive producer Kevin Sullivan, who was the creative force behind the "Anne"  miniseries, here offers family programming filled with warmth and charm and  more: It's stunningly filmed, with the kind of expansive outdoor vistas and  attention to authenticityrarely seen on weekly television.

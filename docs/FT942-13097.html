			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK dismay over backing for Dehaene candidacy The British government yesterday reacted with dismay to signals that Chancellor Helmut Kohl may back Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, for the presidency of the European Commission. On the eve of talks at Chequers later today between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Kohl, Downing Street made no formal comment on the potential candidacy of Mr Dehaene. A senior prime ministerial aide would say only: 'We don't know much about him.' Although officials in Bonn confirmed that the question of the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president would be an important item on the bilateral summit agenda, they certainly do not want anything to sour a determined effort to repair the two governments' recently rather tattered relations. Both sides agree the main focus of today's meeting will be on a long-term strategy to bring the former communist countries of eastern Europe steadily towards eventual membership of both the European Union and Nato. Mr Kohl, who faces a series of elections this year in Germany, is acutely conscious of the internal political pressures on Mr Major, and does not want to give any ammunition to his opponents. On the other hand, he is obviously disappointed at the erratic European policy-making of the British government, not least on the issue of enlargement of the Union. 'We have worked together extremely well in the past, and we want to do so again,' a German official said. 'We want to develop a common policy (on central and eastern Europe). This is an example of the sort of concrete alliance Mr Major has also talked about.' However, the determination of both sides to stress their common ground was belied by the visible dismay among British ministers and officials that Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand may be preparing to back another avowed European 'federalist' to succeed Mr Delors. Ministers predicted such an appointment - supposed to be made at the EU summit in Corfu in June - would provoke uproar among the growing band of Eurosceptics on Tory backbenches at Westminster. In his talks with the German Chancellor today Mr Major is expected to press again the alternative candidacies of Sir Leon Brittan, the British Commission vice-president, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Netherlands' outgoing prime minister. But Whitehall officials said Mr Major did not want to find himself in the position of threatening to veto Mr Dehaene only to find himself forced subsequently to retreat, as he was forced to over European Union voting rights.</p>

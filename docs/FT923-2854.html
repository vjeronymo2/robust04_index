			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / GM alters Polish assembly plans GENERAL MOTORS, the world's largest vehicle maker, is seeking to start small-scale car assembly in Poland by autumn next year. The company, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the Polish Government and FSO, the Polish state-owned car maker in February, has presented a revised plan to the Polish authorities. This calls for the start-up of assembly of Opel cars in Warsaw - probably the Opel/Vauxhall Astra small family car - within 9 months of a final agreement being reached. The revised deal, which could be finalised by mid-November, involves assembly initially of up to 10,000 cars a year at a facility within the existing FSO plant. It is expected that FSO would hold a minority stake in a joint venture with GM. The plan involves a more modest first step into local assembly in Poland than GM had envisaged in February, but at the same time it is seeking to bring forward the start-up date. Under the terms of the original memorandum of understanding it was planned that GM would invest initially up to Dollars 75m in plant and equipment at the antiquated FSO plant for the production of the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, GM's best-selling car in western Europe. It intended to establish a capacity to produce a total of 35,000 Astras a year on three shifts. It has now decided, however, that this plan must be split into two stages.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling In an equity market already weighed down by dividend worries yesterday, it was distinctly unhelpful that sterling should have slipped back below DM2.90 for the first time since the UK election. In one sense, it is hard to see what the fuss is about. Sterling is once more caught in the crossfire between a weak dollar and a strong D-Mark, the belief being that whereas US interest rates may well be cut again in the near future, a cut in German rates looks more remote by the day. But whereas sterling's trade-weighted level of 93.0 is a touch off its peak, it is still higher than at almost any time in the past year and the same level as a week ago. All the same, it does not do to be complacent. Sterling is now back at the bottom of the ERM, with the gap between it and the next lowest member - at present the Italian lira - the widest since before the election. Since the Danish vote on Maastricht, the market has seen both Denmark and Italy raise rates. It is perhaps now minded to see if the UK government can be pushed into doing the same: or if not, to find out just how strong is the Tory party's commitment to the system in the light of the latest sniping from Mrs Thatcher. All the same, it is worth recalling that sterling is still some 12 pfennigs above its absolute floor against the D-Mark. Back in January, the gap was less than half that. It would doubtless be embarrassing if sterling were to fall through its narrow band floor of DM2.8844. But the government still has plenty of ammunition in hand before resorting to the nuclear option of raising interest rates.</p>

It is the firm's first office in China, and the 63rd  overseas  investment bank in Beijing.    Set up in 1869, the firm is a New York-based private  partnership and it is a leading, full-service international  investment banking and securities firm.    Goldman Sachs has 148 partners and about 8,200 employees  located in offices in 30 major cities worldwide.    Henry Paulson, a partner of Goldman and member of the firm's  management committee, said that one of the focuses of the  business is on Asia.    He said that the reason why his firm invested great sums in  China was its belief that China's economy and its financial  market will be one of the important parts of the global economy.    Peter Wheeler, the firm's Beijing chief representative, said  that in 1993, Goldman Sachs acted as lead or co-lead manager in  11 bond issues for Chinese companies, totalling 2 billion U.S.  dollars in Europe, the United States and Asia.    Early this year, the firm was a co-lead manager for China's  global bond offering of 1 billion U.S. dollars.    With the improvement of the investment environment in China,  more overseas banks have entered China's market.    Now about 100 overseas banks from more than 20 countries  have  set up branches or offices in China.</p>

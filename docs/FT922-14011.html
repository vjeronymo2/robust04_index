			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Colony looks on in sorrow - Ballot Box This may be the last British general election that matters much to Hong Kong, and the colony is disappointed. The virtual absence of Hong Kong as an election issue has bruised the collective ego. The place is also worried that Britain will be ungovernable if there is a hung parliament and, more to the point, that the resulting deadlock could delay indefi- nitely the choice of a new governor. Newspapers have jumped on the suggestion, from some Whitehall official, that Lord Wilson, the colony's recently ennobled governor, might stay on a bit longer than the newspapers first thought. When not worrying about a hung parliament, Hong Kong wrings its hands over the prospect of a Labour government. It is worried about the impact on the stock market, about what a Labour victory would mean for UK-China relations and, most of all, about what a Labour win would mean for Hong Kong. Yet, as one diplomat pointed out yesterday, the joint declaration has been signed and the basic law promulgated. No election in Britain is going to change that.</p>

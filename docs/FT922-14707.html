			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election worries depress sterling STERLING came under pressure yesterday as a fresh wave of nerves about the UK general election affected financial markets. The pound lost 1 pfennig against a stronger D-Mark to close in London at DM2.835, recovering only slightly in New York where it finished at DM2.8366. Share prices also fell as investors showed worries about the outcome of Thursday's poll. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares shed 22.7 to 2,382.7 for a 65-point loss on the week. Investors' fears focus on the repercussions of a Labour victory or a hung parliament. In either case, the markets believe, nervous investors might decide to switch funds out of sterling. If that happened, base rates might have to rise, holding back hopes of economic recovery. Some signs emerged yesterday of investors switching out of the pound. This drove sterling down to within about 5 pfennigs of its DM2.78 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. Over the week, the pound has lost just over 2 pfennigs. Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank, the US bank, expected a further fall in the pound next week due to investors' anxieties about whether a Labour government would keep sterling in its ERM band. He added: 'In my view, Mr John Smith (the shadow chancellor) would not devalue the pound. Even if he had to raise interest rates after the election, the effect would be temporary and so I can see no great long-term risk to investors holding pounds.' Others took a less sanguine view. Ms Christine Shields, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: 'The markets are approaching the election with a great deal of trepidation.' The pound's weakness against the D-Mark was exacerbated by the effects of investors buying the German unit against the dollar, which fell on worries about a faltering US economic recovery. The dollar shed nearly 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM1.6265. In New York it ended at DM1.62665. Against the dollar, the pound was stronger, gaining nearly 1 1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.7435 in London and Dollars 1.74365 in New York. Government gilt-edged securities - which steadied yesterday after recent falls - have shed up to 1 1/2 points over the week. Currencies, Page 13 London stocks, Page 15 Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ICE TIME CLIMATE, SCIENCE AND LIFE ON EARTH BY THOMAS  LEVENSON (HARPER &amp; ROW: $9.95)  </P> <P> In his compelling introduction to the science of climatology, Thomas Levenson  explains the origins of the Earth's atmosphere and its evolution through  biochemical processes. He traces the history of meteorology and climatology,  emphasizing how the use of sophisticated computer models is increasing human  understanding of global weather patterns, and concludes by describing the  ominous effects of pollution and deforestation on world weather.  </P> <P> An associate producer of "Nova," Levenson excels at translating complex  problems into terms that the general reader can easily understand, including  why each quarter-pound fast-food burger that someone consumes causes the  destruction of up to 1,000 pounds of tropical rain forest biomass. After  surveying the damage done to the Earth in recent decades, Levenson concludes  that he chose to become an environmentalist because, "I do not want to define  myself as one of those whose greatest monument is blight."  </P></p>

The positive balance  reached $1.4 billion, as compared with $1 billion in January of  last year.    The volume of export comprised $2.5 billion, increasing by  1.3 percent as compared with January of 1993 (we must note that  the average export prices on a number of goods in January of  1994 were significantly lower than the January 1993 level). The  relative share of power sources within the structure of export  declined by 7 percent, and comprised 50 percent. Export  deliveries of crude oil declined by 16 percent, to 5 million  tonnes. On the other hand, deliveries of petroleum products  increased by 38 percent, to 1.676 million tonnes, and of natural  by 14 percent, to 10.121 billion cubic meters.    Import comprised $1.1 billion, declining by 23 percent as  compared with January of last year. Import deliveries of basic  staple food products continued to decline. The import of grain  declined by 57 percent, of meat--by 64 percent, of butter--by 91  percent, and of tea--by 63 percent. The main reasons for the  continued decline in import, explained the deputy chief of the  MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] Main Economic  Administration, Vladimir Kiselev, were the introduction of  increased excise tax rates on certain types of goods at the end  of 1993, the repeal of subsidy coefficients on centralized  import for state needs which became effective on 1 January 1994,  as well as the lack of resolution in the question of exempting  goods of centralized import from the payment of NDS [value-added  tax] and import duties. A significant role here was played also  by the sharp decline in the exchange rate of the ruble at the  beginning of the year, as well as the increase in import tariffs  which was planned for March of 1994.

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALE OF MARINES IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> Reports that U.S. troop morale is fading, coupled with Defense Secretary Dick  Cheney's claim that Saddam Hussein may lash out against Western military  forces, are ominous portents of war in the gulf. Consider the context: rising  oil prices, Iraq's tenacity during the war with Iran, grudging acknowledgment  of the hypocritical, self-serving nature of Western claims and actions against  Hussein, and mounting concern over the expense of merely maintaining our  forces, let alone engaging in war.  </P> <P> These factors are combining to force President Bush to resolve the conflict  within a few weeks, or face the prospect of growing domestic disillusionment  and criticism.  </P> <P> The media tell us that the military buildup is approaching the level necessary  to launch an offensive against Iraqi forces; a high-ranking defense chief is  sacked, not for what he said, but because he said it, and historians with  highly selective memories announce that a Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is an  insufficient U.S. policy goal -- the proper one being the destruction of the  Iraqi military.  </P> <P> I can't help but believe that we are being conditioned for a U.S.-staged "Iraq  Incident," an incident that will then be used to justify a massive U.S.  response.  </P> <P> The great tragedy is that so much is at stake. Human lives, cheap oil, Kuwaiti  sovereignty -- these are important, but what seems to be overlooked is the  effect this crisis' outcome will have on the nature of the future world order.  It is imperative that American policy-makers as well as citizens, realize that  the manner in which the present gulf crisis is resolved will decide what  preparations Third World nations make for the next international dispute.  </P> <P> DAVID J.

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHP BEGINS PROGRAM TO INSPECT TRUCKS PASSING THROUGH MOORPARK  </P> <P> Trucks in the Moorpark area will be subject to inspection at least once a week  under a program that began Wednesday to reduce the volume of traffic on city  streets.  </P> <P> Truck traffic through Moorpark has almost doubled in the past five years, from  an average of 1,800 trips daily in 1983 to 3,500 in 1988, according to a  Caltrans survey.  </P> <P> About a third of the truckers drive through Moorpark to avoid the Conejo Grade  inspection station on the Ventura Freeway between Thousand Oaks and Camarillo,  said Sgt. Terry Carroll of the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> "They won't be able to avoid us as easily now," Carroll said.  </P> <P> At least once a week at various locations throughout Moorpark, the CHP and the  Ventura County Sheriff's Department will check brakes and other mechanical  features, and make sure trucks and their drivers are properly registered,  Carroll said. Violators will be ticketed and, in some cases, detained until the  necessary repairs are completed.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, officers set up a roadside inspection station on Los Angeles  Avenue near Gabbert Road. CHP Sgt. Al Bowers said about 300 trucks will be  inspected Wednesday and Thursday. Each inspection takes about 15 minutes unless  the vehicle needs extensive repairs, he said.  </P> <P> By midday, officers had detained the driver of a moving van for having a rear  tire with a hole the size of a softball, among other violations. Repairs,  estimated at about $500, would have to be made before the driver could move on,  officers said.  </P> <P> Some truckers complained about the delay, though none would admit to using the  route through Moorpark as a means of avoiding the inspection station on the  Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> Moorpark officials are working with Caltrans and the CHP to build a permanent  truck inspection site on the western outskirts of the city. The station would  generate revenue for Moorpark and encourage truckers to comply with safety  standards, said Richard Hare, Moorpark's deputy city manager.  </P></p>

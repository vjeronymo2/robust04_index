			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger wheat surplus forecast THE WORLD wheat production surplus is likely to grow next season to 8m tonnes from 7m in 1992-93, according to the International Wheat Council's latest report. The council forecasts 1993-94 production at 568m tonnes, 'given normal weather and growing conditions', compared with the 562m tonnes now estimated for 1992-93. It puts 1993-94 consumption at 560m tonnes, up from 555m tonnes this season. Although harvests are expected to be smaller in Western Europe (following a reduction in the European Community's planted area), the former Soviet Union, Asia and the Far East, those falls are expected to be more than compensated by rises in eastern Europe as the sharp fall in 1992-93 is partially recovered, and in North, South and Central America, the Near East, Africa and Australia. On the consumption side the council points out that the big slide in wheat use from 1990-91's exceptional 574m tonnes to the 555m tonnes estimated for 1992-93 concealed a continuing growth in food use in developing countries. And it is to the developing world that it looks for 1993-94's overall growth  -forecasting an 8m-tonne rise to 310m tonnes, compared with a 3m-tonne fall to 250m tonnes in the industrialised world. The report raises the wheat council's estimate of the total 1992-93 grain crop to 1.416bn tonnes from last month's figure of 1.412m tonnes, with most of the rise coming from a 3m-tonne increase in the coarse grain's estimate, now 854m tonnes. Total grain consumption for 1992-93 is unchanged at 1.385bn tonnes. 'Confusion continues to surround the pattern of grain shipments to the republics of the former Soviet Union,' says the IWC report. 'Some existing credit lines have been reactivated, others modified and some remain suspended.' In order to get round these problems, it notes, Russia has engaged in grain barter deals involving aluminium, nickel, uranium, diamonds and timber with Australia, Canada, the EC and under the US Export Enhancement Program.</p>

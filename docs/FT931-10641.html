			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: Frankfurt gives London a run for its money At a time when Europe's monetary arrangements are a by-word for disorder, the policies of the Bundesbank and the Bank of England appear to be converging. The least publicised aspect of the Bundesbank's measures last Thursday may turn out to be the most important: the decision to create an asset-based money market in Germany, akin to that in London but without the anachronism of discount houses. The German move came barely two weeks after the UK government announced that Mr Eddie George would be Bank of England governor from July 1 and that the Bank's 'central responsibility' in future would be - like that of the Bundesbank - to achieve price stability. But it would be wrong to suppose that such convergence will result in harmony or add to stability. The Bundesbank's money market reforms are part of a determined campaign by the German monetary authorities to challenge the City as Europe's premier financial centre and ensure that European economic and monetary union, if it should ever come to pass, will carry a 'made in Germany' stamp. Last week's Bundesbank decision to offer through tender DM25bn worth of three, six and nine-month bills to banks, non-banks and foreign institutions has several goals. It gives the Bundesbank an extra weapon to mop up speculative currency inflows by enabling it to offer such paper to non-banks for the first time. It will also give it a better chance of controlling M3, its wayward money supply measure. More important, it fills an important gap in the range of German money market instruments and so will broaden the appeal of Frankfurt to foreign institutions. The Bundesbank's announcement that minimum reserve requirements on banks' time and savings deposits would be more than halved to 2 per cent of liabilities removes a big competitive disadvantage for banks in Frankfurt and other German centres vis-a-vis London and Luxembourg. It should encourage the repatriation of short-term D-Mark deposits from the Euromarket. At the same time, the Bundesbank is pressing ahead with efforts to ensure that an eventual Europe-wide monetary policy is modelled on continental rather than UK practices. As Economics Notebook reported five weeks ago, that would entail Europe-wide money supply targets as part of a stringent counter-inflationary policy and tough approach to lender of last resort responsibilities. The dramatic cut in the minimum reserve rates does not mean that the Bundesbank is abandoning this instrument of monetary control. The minimum reserve system, often criticised abroad as a tax on banks, is less onerous than it appears because German banks are able to obtain funds from the central bank at less than money market rates through the Bundesbank's discount facility. But by forcing the banks to use the discount window, it gives the Bundesbank a valuable insight into their operations. For that reason, Germany wants to have Europe-wide minimum reserve requirements if and when a European central bank system begins operating in the proposed third stage of Emu. With the European Monetary System in turmoil, nobody can be sure that Emu will go ahead as planned. But by taking a leaf out of the Bank of England's book and actively promoting its own financial centres, the Bundesbank is doing its best to ensure that, with or without Emu, Frankfurt gives London a run for its money. But the strategy is not without risk. From a German viewpoint, the Bank of England is a worrying model to follow. A conglomerate among central banks, its interests range from the newly ordained primary goal of helping to achieve price stability, through oversight of Britain's banks and important financial markets in London, to the broader objectives of supporting the City and UK industry. Like many conglomerates, the Bank has at times had difficulty reconciling differing claims on its management resources and so ended up doing some things badly. The supervision failures in the BCCI affair were a case in point. That the Bundesbank should give added importance to promoting Finanzplatz Deutschland opens the question whether it will risk conflict with its overriding commitment to price stability in Germany. Such doubts have been fuelled by the circumstances of last week's interest rate reductions. The Bundesbank would like its quarter point reduction in discount rate and half point cut in lombard rate to 8 and 9 per cent respectively to be seen in the context of its financial market liberalisation. But the general perception is that the Bundesbank succumbed to political pressure to cut rates to preserve the European exchange rate mechanism which was facing possible terminal collapse because of a flight of funds from the Danish krone. The rate cuts came only days after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, indicated that lower borrowing costs were not justified because of inflationary pressures in Germany. They have cast doubt on the Bundesbank's counter-inflationary credibility and the D-Mark as the anchor of the ERM. Ironically, the Bundesbank may have undermined one of the cornerstones of Emu by acting to defuse tension in the ERM. For if the Bundesbank cannot be trusted to maintain its independence and commitment to price stability, how can the same be expected of an untried European central bank if ever the EC moves to a single currency and monetary policy? To sow new doubts over the future of Emu may well fit in with the secret wishes of Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues on the Bundesbank's decision-making council. But the cost has been that Bundesbank policies now seem almost as incalculable as those of Mr Norman Lamont and the UK Treasury: a convergence that can appeal to no-one in Frankfurt.</p>

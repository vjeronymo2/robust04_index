			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Broader scrutiny of accounts demanded LABOUR is pressing the government to introduce mechanisms to scrutinise companies in financial difficulties such as Land Travel, the tour operator which went into liquidation in July. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said yesterday he would call on the Department of Trade and Industry to examine all company accounts about which auditors express doubts. He also wants auditors to be required to notify the DTI directly of their concerns once accounts have been filed. UK company legislation requires the accounts of all 1.1m limited liability companies to be examined by independent auditors each year. Accounts must be 'qualified' if auditors have doubts about the financial information provided by the company or the prospects for its survival. About 6 per cent of accounts were qualified last year. This information is publicly available at Companies House, the government's corporate information agency responsible for registering and holding information on limited liability businesses, but there is no mechanism to detect incoming qualified accounts and no policy of scrutinising them. Mr Griffiths is concerned that the DTI did not investigate Land Travel before its collapse, even though its accounts were heavily qualified and showed net liabilities over the previous two financial years. The DTI says it has powers to investigate companies which are drawn to its attention, but that it lacks the resources to examine every set of accounts. Mr Griffiths' proposals met with a mildly positive response from the accountancy profession. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Standards Board, said: 'There might be a case for some kind of central accounts ombudsman. It would be a load off the mind of the auditor.' Anyone can request, for a fee, a company's accounts from Companies House, but the agency simply processes the accounts and does not scrutinise their contents. Accountancy column, Page 11</p>

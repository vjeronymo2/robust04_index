			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: A Little Older - Theatre Summer fare from the Edinburgh Festival, like August grouse, often becomes autumn fodder in London. Now A Little Older, proudly bearing 'The Independent Fringe Award', has arrived at the Hampstead Theatre. It is a good play - curt, serious and funny - but never an award-winner; perhaps no other candidates of sufficient merit presented themselves. Still, it makes an absorbing evening, intelligently acted. John Binnie's text typifies the British way of drama: the journey backward to find the way forward. This resembles nothing so much as Freudian psychoanalysis, a search for scenes in childhood to cure the adult. Denis Potter perfected the form in The Singing Detective (1989) and the same burden of the past weighed on Rodney Ackland's play The Dark River (1943). A Little Older, serious and considered, centres on Isla, an amnesiac and aphasic car-crash victim. Her friend Sandy visits her in hospital. When she fails to recover her speech, action and memory, he prompts her with shared school experiences from 1960s Glasgow. She responds. Their past emerges: she is a wild roly-poly vicar's daughter, eager for experience, and he is a quiet boy discovering he is gay. Eventually, his affection and perseverance return her to normal life. The play has moments of cliche ('What are her chances, doctor?') and patches of dark humour ('You've had an accident' - 'Really?'). Its poignancy lies in showing the inability of the once able-bodied, the tiredness of the infirm. But when action in the play means Isla's memory is working, the plot relies too much on the telling and not enough on the showing. The best scene shows Isla's memory working better than Sandy's. She remembers snow falling one Christmas Eve. That incident completes the therapy. Stephen Docherty and Mari Binnie as Sandy and Isla maintain close rapport throughout. They have unerring confidence in each other, as befits an invalid and friend. They make scenes turn on a gesture, a shrug. Both extract judicious humour from a serious situation. Robert Rabey's bare set needs Tariq Hussain's inventive lighting to shift focus between past and present, while John Binnie'directs with verve. Like a good therapist, he finds a reason for every detail in the text. Hampstead Theatre, Swiss Cottage (071-722-9301)</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel-General A. Sergeyev, Commander of </F> the Volga Military District, by Oleg Bedula, date and place not  given, under the general heading "The Army and Society" and the  rubric "Draft 93-94": "If You Haven't Served in the Army You  Are Not Fit to Get Married" -- first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] Over 100,000 young men will be sent to Russian  Armed Forces military districts and fleets from the Volga and  Urals region during the present draft. Our correspondent asked  Colonel-General A. Sergeyev, commander of the Volga Military  District, to describe how the draft is going.    [Bedula] Anatoliy Ipatovich, your speech at the end of the  year to the scientific and practical conference at the assembly  of leading Russian Defense Ministry personnel had a great  impact. Specifically, the statement that Volga Military District  commissariats in conjunction with Internal Affairs Ministry and  Prosecutor's Office structural subdivisions are taking  additional measures to ensure that all deserters, "draft  dodgers," and "refuseniks" are brought into line. Is the draft  situation really worse than six months ago?    [Sergeyev] That is a realistic assessment of the actual  situation at a specific moment. I am convinced that draft  problems can be resolved more effectively if the local  authorities and law and order bodies work in constant and close  cooperation with the military commissariats. It is precisely in  those republics and oblasts where the internal affairs organs  and prosecutor's office have been paying less attention to the  draft that there is a "shortfall." Specifically, I am talking  about Tatarstan, the Komi Republic, and Samara and Kirov Oblasts.    [Bedula] I recall how two years ago you invited leaders of  the representative and executive bodies in all the Volga and  Urals region republics and oblasts to an enlarged Military  Council. Judging by the officials' speeches, close cooperation  and collaboration were established at that time on all questions  affecting day-to-day Army activity in the territories.    [Sergeyev] It is not all straightforward here. The majority  of leaders have kept their word, we have established good  working contacts with them, and we have mutual understanding and  mutual assistance. It is a different matter that in some  republics public movements which take a negative view of  military service as a whole have gained in strength. When these  anti-Army feelings are expressed in legal form by local  authority decision, you have the beginnings of overt or covert  resistance to federal laws. For example, the Tatarstan  parliament recently "amended" a Russian presidential edict by  adopting a decree "On the Performance of Military Service by  Citizens of the Republic of Tatarstan." According to this  document young men studying in daytime study departments of  elementary and secondary general education institutions and  students who have not completed their studies cannot be drafted  into military service. Likewise, young men whose immediate  relatives have died or been disabled during military service are  also exempt from military service. As a result, we cannot call  up close to 9,000 potential draftees. It seems to bother no one  in the republic that the parliament's decree contravenes not  only a separate provision of the Constitution and the laws of  Tatarstan itself but also the federal law which says that  defense questions are delegated by the republics to the center.    [Bedula] Incidentally, neighboring Bashkortostan, whose  population is close to that of Tatarstan in ethnic composition,  outlook, and way of life, takes a completely different view of  military service. Why is that?    [Sergeyev] Yes, Bashkortostan has virtually always fulfilled  the General Staff's order 100 percent. But the whole point, it  seems, is that on the state, social, and family levels Army  service is regarded there as a form of schooling which a  physically fit young man has no moral right to shirk.  Furthermore, in the countryside a girl's parents still question  whether they should let their daughter marry someone who has not  done military service.    The current draft is also proceeding well in Bashkortostan.  The republic's government has allocated the necessary money --  500 million rubles [R]. All the relevant questions are being  resolved promptly and without undue drama. It has been decided  that students at technical colleges and vocational and technical  schools can complete their studies, take their diplomas, and in  January-February we will draft them.    We are being actively helped by the Bashkortostan committee  for the social protection of servicemen and their families. The  committee staged the second congress of parents of soldiers and  sailors in an interesting way. The Orthodox cathedral and the  main mosque in Ufa held ceremonial services to bless the  fatherland's defenders and honor the memory of those who have  died discharging their military duty. District representatives  and military lawyers answered questions from servicemen, their  parents, and the public. The work of the congress was widely  covered by the mass media.    The committee members' principled approach is shown by the  fact that out of 3,214 requests for draft deferral, 451 were  rejected as unjustified. Nevertheless, there are "draft  dodgers" in Bashkortostan: A total of 389 people failed to  attend the draft centers. That number would have been  considerably smaller if the Prosecutor's Office had taken a more  principled line. The number of citizens charged by the  Prosecutor's Office with avoidance of military service is  minimal.    [Bedula] What is life like generally for a deserter from the  moment that he leaves the unit?    [Sergeyev] Bad. In Tatarstan, for instance, there were  quite a few people who succumbed to All-Tatarstan Public Center  propaganda and stole back into the republic to march under  national banners. But it turns out that no one was expecting  them here. As a result, the "returners" were left to face some  serious problems by themselves: There was no possibility of  drafting them into a unit on the republic's territory to  complete their service here and there was no legal justification  for discharging them into the reserve. No one offered them a  job. Who needs a man with no documents? Consequently, many  went back to their units and made amends...    [Bedula] It is no secret that one reason for desertion is  the collapse of the system of military-patriotic education which  existed in schools, vocational and technical schools, technical  colleges, and social organizations. No worthwhile alternative  has been found yet. Is it really inevitable that we will  squander the considerable potential of young people's  preparation for service?    [Sergeyev] Much has indeed been lost. But some things have  been gained. Recently I learned that in Bashkortostan boys  virtually from junior class age dream of serving in the  "Mosfilm" Movie Studio's cavalry regiment. Recruits to this  unusual military unit traditionally come from draftees from  Bashkiria. The current draft is no exception -- 15 young men  have already been sent to Golitsyno, near Moscow, where the  cavalry regiment is stationed. There is just as much competition  for the right to serve on the submarine Komsomolets Bashkirii.  Similarly people from Samara and Penza maintain their right to  serve in the "president's" regiment. Recently the General Staff  received a letter from the Chuvashia leadership requesting that  this year young men be drafted to serve on the submarine  Chuvashskiy Komsomolets. The Dzerzhinskiy internal troops  division is very popular with future draftees from Saratov  Oblast. Requests from local authorities and the public to send  draftees there are granted whenever possible.    When draftees are sent specifically to "their" division,  regiment, or category of troops it is not only the Army which  gains. Traditions are established in schools, at enterprises,  in cities, and in whole republics. Pride will not allow a young  man to do service that is inferior to that of his older friends  or his neighbors in the apartment block or on his street.    Can people fail to be moved by the tradition which has been  revived in Orenburg Oblast's Pervomayskiy Rayon: When draftees  are being given a send-off, each one receives a small bag  containing a handful of his native soil. There has not yet been  a single case of desertion by a soldier who has been given such  a sacred gift.    [Bedula] Nevertheless, increasingly frequently it is being  said that this year's draftees are the "wrong sort," that  completely different approaches are needed with them because the  traditional methods of education are not working....    [Sergeyev] The directorate for work with personnel has  studied this problem and come up with some surprising  conclusions. The nature of the inner conflicts that draftees are  suffering from is due not to national interests, as used to be  the case, but to their social status before joining the Army.  There are quite a few soldiers in service now who have engaged  in no socially useful activity. There is another section  consisting of draftees from families with wealthy parents,  sometimes commercial traders, and some of the draftees were  engaged in trade themselves. A third group -- the most numerous  -- comes from the families of workers and peasants. Finally  there is a fourth group -- soldiers with less than perfect  health but passed as fit by the medical commissions. If we  manage to correctly assess the different forms of relationships  that develop among soldiers in all four groups and elaborate  forms of work with them, we will keep potential "runaways" in  military formation. That is why many officers now sit on  republic draft commissions. They have a specific task: To  study, analyze, and systematize all problems relating to the  draft and give specific recommendations on work with young  people. Not just to the troops but also to the organs of public  education, social organizations, and committees of soldiers'  mothers.    Of course, the "anti-desertion" campaign will be as  productive as possible if all society becomes really interested  in it. The forms of work with young people of draft age are  most diverse. In Udmurtia, for example, draftees are subject to  a fine of one-half the minimum wage the first time that they  fail to appear before the military commissariat. The total fine  is increased for failure to turn up a second time. With the  introduction of financial sanctions the number of "draft  dodgers" in the republic fell noticeably. I know that in the  Volga region and Urals republics they are studying the question  of making deserters repay the cost of the investigation. After  all, it costs the Armed Forces between R70,000 and R100,000 to  find and bring back one deserter. But given that some Komi  Republic enterprise leaders are inciting young men to refuse to  serve "for peanuts" by promising them wages of half a million,  we will still be tackling the problem of desertion for a long  time to come.    [Bedula] Anatoliy Ipatovich, reports are coming in from  local level about a lack of coordination in the military  department's work and mistakes in organizing the draft.    [Sergeyev] Indeed, there have been mistakes. The Defense  Ministry Central Directorate of Military Transport  Communications and the Central Finance Directorate took too long  to resolve the question of allocating money for the transport of  young draftees to the Far East and the Transbaykal region by  civil aircraft.    There have been occasions when induction officers from the  District fail to arrive to meet new recruits at the prescribed  time. But there have been far more instances of a different  kind -- of well organized work by commissariats. To assess the  situation here in general terms, the present draft has been  complex but is proceeding normally. The Army and the Navy will  receive a worthy batch of new recruits.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Repola registers loss of FM1.8bn REPOLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, yesterday reported an unexpectedly large pre-tax loss of FM1.86bn (Dollars 413m) for 1991 and halved its dividend to FM0.65. Repola, which had a profit of FM961m in 1990, predicted results in 1992 would remain poor, although better than in 1991, due to continued market weakness. Sales declined by 5 per cent to FM22bn, while the operating profit fell 63 per cent to FM577m. Repola blamed its deficit mainly on foreign exchange losses of FM584m stemming from the devaluation of the Finnish markka, as well as restructuring costs associated with its pulp and shipbuilding operations. All three of Repola's industrial groups posted losses. The United Paper Mills unit had a pre-tax loss of FM775, reflecting a sales decrease for pulp, sawn timber and joinery products. Rauma, the metals and engineering unit, had a loss of FM609m, while Rosenlaw, the plastic packaging division, reported a loss of FM73m. Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of FM564m for 1991, against a deficit of FM41m in 1990. It predicted a smaller loss in 1992 due to the devaluation of the Finnish markka, cost-cutting measures and lower prices for wood raw materials.</p>

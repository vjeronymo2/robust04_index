			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;  </P> <P> HILLSIDE PLAN THWARTED  </P> <P> An attempt by the City Council to replace Sierra Madre's recently approved  strict hillside development ordinance with a less stringent version was  thwarted Tuesday when attorneys for hillside property owners questioned whether  city officials had followed state environmental regulations.  </P> <P> Attorney Carl West, representing property owner Michael Heflin, said the city  should have conducted a complete environmental impact report on the proposed  ordinance instead of the less-detailed environmental study conducted by  consultant John Bitterly.  </P> <P> The council delayed the matter until Feb. 6 to allow Bitterly time to prepare  answers to the objections.  </P> <P> The ordinance, adopted Jan. 9, limits hillside construction in five vertical  zones with densities ranging from 5 to 40 acres per house. The council's  version creates three horizontal zones with building limitations ranging from  15,000 square feet to 40 acres per house.  </P></p>

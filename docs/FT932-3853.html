			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ferruzzi group extends losses in Milan INDIVIDUAL companies got a lot of attention, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt, Vienna, Lisbon and Warsaw were closed for public holidays. MILAN witnessed further turbulence in Ferruzzi group shares although the overall mood was positive with some strong gains in a number of major issues. As a result the Comit index nudged 7.34 higher at 533.24. Nevertheless, it was the collapse of the Ferruzzi share price which attracted most attention. The shares lost another L24 to L805, but ended off the day's low of L795. During the session Mr Carlo Sama, the managing director, said that the group would not be asking for a suspension in trading. Since the restructuring plan was announced last weekend the shares have fallen by 12 per cent. Some brokers commented that there was great uncertainty as to the future structure of the group, with speculation of asset sales and/or a debt for equity swap involving the major creditor banks. Clarification would have to wait for a shareholders meeting that could be held before the end of the month. Montedison slid L47 to close at L980 before improving slightly on the kerb to L992. The telecommunications sector was particularly active on foreign buying after the government said that it would accelerate the privatisation process: Stet advanced L94 to L3,244, then to L3,300 on the kerb, while Sip put on L57 to L2,146. PARIS fell back from the day's high although activity was subdued in the absence of Frankfurt. The CAC-40 index slipped 4.01 to 1,911.22 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. A rate cut of between 25-50 basis points is expected soon, with some brokers predicting Monday as the likely date. LVMH fell back FFr27 to FFr3,683 after forecasting lower first half profits, while Suez, up FFr5.50 at FFr297, remained active on hopes of resolving its shareholding conflict with UAP, down FFr8 at FFr575. AMSTERDAM closed mixed in active trading. The CBS Tendency and most blue chips were slightly firmer, the index ending 0.3 better at 107.3. But the day's most active stock, ING, dropped Fl 3.60 to Fl 62.90 as analysts decided that unchanged first quarter net profits per share from the financial services group were about 10 per cent off the expected level. BRUSSELS featured strong advances in the chemical blue chip, Solvay, and the holding company Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) as the Bel-20 index rose 5.5 to 1,212.94. Solvay built on Wednesday's gains, up another BFr175 to BFr11,775, while SGB put on BFr45 to BFr2,150 as its non-ferrous metals unit, Union Miniere closed BFr55 higher at BFr2,135, helped by the strength of the dollar. ZURICH saw another SFr60 rise to SFr1,700 in Surveillance on its share buy-back plan, for a two-day gain of SFr160, as the SMI index eased 2.2 to 2,309.2. MADRID extended its technical recovery, the general index closing 1.26 higher at 257.55 in modest turnover of Pta14.4bn. HELSINKI liked the interim reports from Instrumentarium and Okobank and made a technical rebound. The HEX index, which had fallen by nearly 12 per cent since its 1993 high three weeks ago, rose by 23.5, or 2.1 per cent to 1,122.77 in turnover of FM80m. Dealers said that the recovery was fragile but, in London, Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley rated the market as cheap by all measures except earnings - and, there, he expected the dramatic declines of recent years to be reversed by devaluation and falling interest rates over this year and next. ISTANBUL rose again on heavy press speculation that the former economics minister Mrs Tansu Ciller, seen as a keen supporter of the bourse, would become the new prime minister. The market index climbed 149.37, or 1.75 per cent to this week's second all-time closing high of 8,687.16.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices June 10 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1183.98  1183.78   1183.52  1183.85 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1232.92  1231.82   1230.67  1231.58                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1183.90  1183.13   1181.76  1181.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1231.73  1231.13   1231.33  1230.25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jun 9     Jun 8    June 7    June 4    June 3 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1181.59   1168.70   1167.78   1159.95   1160.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1230.01   1218.08   1219.66   1214.21   1217.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1184.33; 200 - 1233.34 Low/day: 100 - 1181.19 200 - 1229.18.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

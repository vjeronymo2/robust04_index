			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Betterware reorganises and recruits executive from Avon BETTERWARE Consumer Products, which sells household goods door-to-door, is reorganising its divisions and taking on an executive from Avon Products, the world's largest direct selling company, as part of its push into continental Europe, writes Jane Fuller. With direct selling established as its core business, the other activities, including garden products, textiles and coffee shops, are being placed in one new consumer products division. The company is simplifying its name to Betterware. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the non-direct selling subsidiaries accounted for only 10 per cent of group profits and might eventually be sold. The expansion of Betterware on the continent would be overseen by Mr Philip Tulimeri, an American recruited from Avon, which sells cosmetics and other goods in about 80 countries. After a successful launch in France last September, the next country on Betterware's agenda would be Spain, Italy or Germany. The company is holding an EGM on Tuesday to approve the reorganisation. Forecasts for the year ended February centre on about Pounds 6.5m pre-tax profit, more than 50 per cent up on last year.</p>

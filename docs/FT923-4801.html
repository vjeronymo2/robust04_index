			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Losses on housing hit Sun Alliance THE problems of the housing market are holding back the pace of recovery at Sun Alliance, the insurer, which yesterday reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 97.9m. The result compared with a loss of Pounds 114.1m at the halfway stage in 1991. Losses per share rose to 14.1p, from 13.5p, and the interim dividend was maintained at 5.25p. Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity business, which insures mortgage lenders against losses on their sales of repossessed properties, were estimated at Pounds 108m. Total provisions against mortgage indemnity claims amounted to Pounds 435m. Mr Roger Neville, chief executive, said: 'The problem will continue until the housing market and the economy generally make a sustained recovery.' The loss overshadowed steady improvements in most other areas, where underwriting results have benefited from rises in premium rates and a fall in losses from subsidence and bad weather. Motor rates have been increased by up to 30 per cent, while rate increases of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent had been achieved in the commercial risks market, according to Mr Scott Nelson, general manager. Rising premium rates helped reduce the overall underwriting loss to Pounds 280.8m (Pounds 305.2m). UK underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 244.7m (Pounds 243.4m) but some Pounds 42m of this loss was due to the group's exposure to the IRA bombs in London this April. Subsidiaries in New Zealand, South Africa, Denmark and Ireland all reported underwriting profits. Life insurance profits rose 9 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 25.9m) while investment income fell to Pounds 155.6m (Pounds 165.2m). UK staff numbers have been cut by 12 per cent in the past 18 months. Shareholders' funds at June 30, excluding the value of the life business, amounted to Pounds 1.39bn. Provision has been made for a fall in UK and overseas property values during the first half. Since the end of last year the solvency margin (which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) has fallen from 69 per cent to 56 per cent. Excluding minority interests the margin was 51 per cent. Details, Page 22</p>

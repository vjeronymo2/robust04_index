Environmental demands were met several years ahead  of time, something that had earlier been regarded as unrealistic  by the industry.  <H5>  Deformed Fish </H5>   Emissions from long-lived organic chlorine  compounds--including the very unfortunate dioxin--was one of the  major environmental issues of the 1980's.    The most extreme sign of it was malformed, sometimes  sterile,  fish in the waters around pulp plants--where emission of  bleaching agents was and is the largest source of pollution.  But, there was also uneasiness concerning the more long-term  accumulation of chlorine compounds on the sea floor, and in  animals and people.    Society registered its concern--the government through tough  environmental measures, consumers through boycotting  chlorine-bleached diapers, coffee filters, and writing paper.  Environmental correctness became a factor in competitiveness.    In 1988, the Riksdag set the goal of cutting emissions in  half, corresponding to 1.8 kilograms of organically bound  chlorine (measured by the so-called AOX [expansion unknown]  method) per ton of pulp production. The effort to reach this  level was to begin no later than 1992. The industry wanted more  lenient standards and a longer time to fulfill them.  <H5>  Alternative Chemicals </H5>   The reality was quite different, all the environmental goals  were exceeded. The industrial average for 1992, according to the  most recent report from the Swedish Environmental Agency, was  approximately 0.6 kilograms AOX per ton of pulp, a reduction of  80 percent in four years.    "Yes, you are correct, it progressed very quickly--through  rapid technical advancement and conversion to other bleaching  chemicals. Above all, in the case of the most dangerous,  long-lived compounds, including dioxin," said Erik Nystrom of  the Swedish Environmental Agency.    The reason is due primarily to the fact that the old  chlorine  gas is no longer used as a bleaching agent. It has been replaced  principally by chlorine dioxide, but also by chlorine-free  alternatives such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone. Deformed pike  are no longer to be found.    The political objective now is to reach levels by the year  2000 at which "the environment is not harmed at all."  <H5>  Closed Systems </H5>   Are we perhaps already there?    "We don't know. There are those who believe that even  today's  chlorine content causes harm, if somewhat more diffuse, but  there are also those who think the opposite. Even completely  chlorine-free bleaching can cause certain problems, but we do  not have sufficient knowledge," said Nystrom.    He feels that other emissions--metals, nutritive salts,  lignin, resin acids--are now receiving greater emphasis and  point to the next step, the "closed factory." Runoff water is  returned to the factory and waste products can be readily  controlled. This also saves energy.    "In three or four years, there is sure to be a number of  factories with closed systems. It can be done with chlorine  dioxide, but is technically simpler with ozone. Furthermore, the  market is demanding ever more chlorine-free paper," said Nystrom.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Aiming for a leaner fitter giant / Analysis of the challenge facing Philippe Jaffre of Elf Aquitaine as France's largest industrial group faces privatisation Elf Aquitaine is the giant of France's public sector. It is the country's largest industrial company and its privatisation, launched yesterday, is the biggest so far in the government's plans to sell corporate assets. The sale of most of the state's 51 per cent stake in the oil group, which is expected to raise about FFr35bn (Dollars 6bn), is an important test of investors' demand for French privatisation issues. Elf is one of the stars of the public sector, but its sale comes as the oil price is languishing below Dollars 14 per barrel and after a year in which profits fell from FFr6.2bn to just over FFr1bn. The success of the issue will depend most directly on the price, which is likely to be announced within the next few weeks. But it will also depend on the strategy pursued by Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over at Elf Tower last August. Since his arrival from Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, Mr Jaffre has indicated grand objectives. 'In each of our core activities, in oil, chemicals and health, market by market and product by product, we must be among the market leaders,' he said at a press conference yesterday. Privatisation will help. 'It will increase our flexibility and will make it easier to raise financial resources.' He added that private sector status would facilitate the formation of alliances with industrial partners. Mr Jaffre's immediate objectives, however, are consolidation rather than growth. The rapid expansion pursued by his predecessor, Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent, which included the purchase of the North Sea assets of Occidental of the US and a 30 per cent stake in Cepsa of Spain, strengthened the group's position among the international oil groups. In the North Sea, for example, Elf went from nowhere to become the fourth largest operator. But the expansion has left Elf with borrowings of more than FFr40bn, gearing of almost 50 per cent. Faced with this legacy, Mr Jaffre has given priority to debt reduction and a concentration of resources on the group's core activities. 'We have to consolidate our position and digest our acquisitions,' he said yesterday. This involves the sale of assets and the cutting of costs. Investments are being scrutinised with respect to their profitability and strategic importance. First to fail the test was the company's fleet of three aircraft which was sold on New Year's Eve. More significant will be the sale of a financial holdings accumulated over the years. The disposals could represent between one-quarter and one-third of Elf's FFr15bn of financial assets. Exploration costs will also be cut. This year's budget has been trimmed by about 10 per cent to FFr3.6bn. It means that the eastern dreams of Mr Le Floch-Prigent, who launched ambitious projects in Kazakhstan and Russia, are likely to take a back seat to the safer bets of the North Sea and the Gulf of Guinea. In exploration and production, as elsewhere, costs will be shared where possible. Particularly pressing is the need to find a partner for Elf's east German project. In its bid to acquire the service station network of Minol in 1992, the French group agreed to rebuild an ageing refinery in Leuna in a project with Thyssen of Germany. It was an expensive commitment, with a total investment of about DM4.3bn (Dollars 2.5m), and one Elf would like to share. Discussions with potential partners are underway, but no agreement has been reached. The new emphasis on financial rigour has its costs. The write-down of some North Sea oil assets and provisions against financial investments were important factors in last year's sharp fall in profits. But the bad news has been cleared away and this year the benefits may start to show. Reduced spending should combine with a stabilisation of demand and prices in the chemicals industry to allow a recovery. The effects of the weak oil price will be partly offset by the relative strength of the US dollar. Mr Jaffre's approach, a reflection of his financial background, has also met with measured approval from the investment community. 'Elf needs a financial expert at the moment, not a reservoir engineer,' says one oil industry analyst. He believes that Mr Jaffre's first steps are in the right direction. But so far they are only the first steps. Mr Bryan Jacoboski, managing director of Paine Webber in New York argues that Elf needs further restructuring, in particular to cut staff costs. 'Elf has one of the lowest rates of profit per employee of all the oil majors,' says Mr Jacoboski. Such comparisons are complicated by Elf's peculiar structure. No other oil major has similar activities in pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals, for example. But they do reflect a feeling in the industry that Elf has moved more slowly on costs than rivals. Restructuring is likely to be implemented without large-scale redundancies. 'Elf has never fired people and there is no reason for that to change,' said Mr Jaffre. Job cuts are likely to be achieved by voluntary measures. 'Its current cost base and its position in its principal markets mean there is strong potential for a sustained rise in profits at Elf,' says one industry analyst. 'The resources are there, now Mr Jaffre must exploit them.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------                    ELF AQUITAINE (FFr bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                       1989     1990     1991     1992   1993**  --------------------------------------------------------------- Sales                149.8    175.5    200.7    200.6    210.0 Net income             7.2     10.6      9.8      6.2      1.1 Total personnel     78,179   89,309   86,930   87,922      n/a  ---------------------------------------------------------------                 Operating income by sector  --------------------------------------------------------------- Exploration, production                           7.6      4.1 Refining, marketing, trading                      0.9      1.4 Chemicals                                         1.6     -0.8 Health                                            1.9      1.8  --------------------------------------------------------------- ** Company estimates  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company results  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

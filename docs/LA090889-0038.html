			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> ANGLERS CATCH AND RELEASE THREATENED BLACK SEA BASS  </P> <P> The catching and releasing of bass came as a surprise for 12 anglers on a  half-day trip aboard the Southern Cal, out of Long Beach Sportfishing.  </P> <P> Capt. Pat Whittaker was just past the Long Beach gap on the way to Horseshoe  Kelp when he noticed birds working near floating kelp.  </P> <P> He made a quick stop, and the anglers started casting anchovies. Within 25  minutes a near-limit of calico bass went into the sacks.  </P> <P> Then the bite shut off. Instead of moving on, Whittaker urged anglers to go to  the bottom and try for white sea bass.  </P> <P> Instead, the unusual took place: Every angler who went to the bottom had a  hookup and reeled in small black sea bass.  </P> <P> Black sea bass is on the endangered species list and must be released unharmed.  Deckhand Myron Ackerman carefully unhooked the bass and returned them to the  sea.  </P> <P> To avoid hooking more, Whittaker moved out of the area.  </P> <P> Jerry Austin of Torrance, fishing from his boat the Jernmo with 12-pound test  line, did battle for 22 minutes with a marlin at Catalina Island, brought it  aboard and released it.  </P> <P> Stan Eckland of Redondo Beach, aboard the Happy Hooker, caught and released  five marlin after weighing one at Avalon. That battler weighed 166 pounds.  </P> <P> Thirty boats are expected to compete in the eighth annual King Harbor Marlin  Club and Marina del Rey Anglers interclub marlin tournament Friday and  Saturday. The clubs are contesting the perpetual trophy as well as individual  awards.  </P> <P> The sixth annual Dave Freeman fire department burn foundation derby will be  held Wednesday . Freeman, of the Los Angeles Fire Department's San Pedro  division, said private boats will depart at 6:30 a.m. and fish until weigh-in  at the Cabrillo launch ramp at 2:30 p.m. First, second and third prizes will be  awarded. The entry fee is $20, with proceeds benefiting the burn foundation.  For information, call (213) 530-9850.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Bob Potter of Manhattan Beach, fishing at Farnsworth Bank  aboard the Blackjack, caught the whopper of the week, a 30-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Darren Wilson of San Pedro, aboard the Sportking at the oil rigs, caught a 20  1/4-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Lou Robinson of Carson, casting from the Sharpshooter at Catalina Island, won  the jackpot with a 20-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Anita Reoies of Long Beach won the jackpot fishing aboard the Admiral with her  18-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Phil Hazelman of Wilmington, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at Santa Barbara  Island's hidden reef, caught a 14 1/2-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Catches: Ron McNab of Monterey Park, fishing aboard the Hitless  Miss at Santa Barbara Island, caught an 18 1/2-pound ling cod.  </P> <P> John Orsano of Alhambra, at the rigs, aboard the Calico Ed, caught a 18-pound  yellowtail.  </P> <P> John Louie of Hacienda Heights, fishing aboard the Redondo Special, won the  jackpot with a 15 1/2-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Ko Lee Chen of Monterey Park, fishing aboard the Matt Walsh, caught a 12-pound  halibut.  </P></p>

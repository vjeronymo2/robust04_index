			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> MORE CHILD WORKERS USED IN SWEATSHOPS  </P> <P> Labor experts estimate that 5,000 to 10,000 children are illegally employed in  New York's garment industry every day, the Daily News reported.  </P> <P> In the first three months of this year, the state Labor Department's Apparel  Industry Task Force found 90 garment district factories illegally employing 128  minors. It was the largest number of violators nabbed in any three-month period  by the task force. But task force officials said tracking down violators is an  arduous job. There are 3,500 registered garment manufacturers in the city and  an equal number that are unregistered. The task force has 24 investigators.  </P></p>

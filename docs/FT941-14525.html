			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Doubt cast on strength of rise in consumer spending The ability of consumer spending to withstand tax increases in the spring is thrown into doubt today by a survey showing that increases in spending are still taking place, but with little or no acceleration. The January regional consumer survey by gallup and business strategies (BSL) says consumers are more pessimistic about prospects for their finances in the coming year. for most regions, this result is the worst since mid-1990. Ms Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of bsl said: 'the results suggest that consumers are taking a realistic view of their position. 'While they clearly recognise that they are going to be worse off over the coming year, they also show every sign of maintaining the steady rise in spending which has been apparent for the last couple of years,' she said. In the three months to December consumer spending increased fastest in the South-West and the south-east and slowest in scotland and wales. the last two regions are also among the most pessimistic about the outlook for unemployment. Consumers remain sceptical that the government will be able to keep inflation low. Ms Rosewell said: 'they expect the rate of inflation to be about 5.5 per cent by the end of 1994, and this may be encouraging them to run down their savings now in order to keep spending levels up.' Less than 45 per cent of consumers think this is a good time to save, compared with more than 65 per cent at the beginning of 1991, according to the survey.</p>

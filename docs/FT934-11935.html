			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: STC takeover referred to MMC THE bid by French telecommunications equipment supplier Alcatel to buy STC Submarine Systems, the UK-based submarine cable business of Canadian telecoms manufacturer Northern Telecom, is to face an investigation by the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and industry, has referred the Pounds 600m (Dollars 906m) deal to the MMC following a recommendation by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. Analysts were surprised by the MMC referral, given the international nature of the undersea cable business and Northern Telecom's determination to sell STC. More than 90 per cent of STC's cable systems are exported. The European Commission's competition directorate cleared the takeover last month. Under the Fair Trading Act, the UK government has the power to refer mergers to the MMC if they create or intensify a market share of more than 25 per cent or involve the takeover of assets worth more than Pounds 30m. STC is a principal supplier of long-distance undersea fibre-optic systems to British Telecommunications. However, BT made no formal objection to the Department of Trade of Industry, although it is known to have had serious reservations about the takeover. The submarine cable division was acquired by Northern Telecom as part of its Pounds 1.9bn takeover of STC in 1990. But the company has no submarine business in North America, and it sits uneasily with its core businesses of transmission, switching, radio/microwave and integrated networks. If the Alcatel deal is not agreed, the future of STC looks highly uncertain. It currently has 1,200 employees, mostly in Greenwich, London. Lex, Page 22</p>

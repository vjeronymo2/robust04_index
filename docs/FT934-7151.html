			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Sport: A lament for the muddy bath - Rugby Union THE LAST man I saw playing rugby union in an old-fashioned scrumcap was my eldest brother, who has a very large head. He looked more than usually ridiculous in it, with his hair standing out in wild tufts between the straps and pads. But there was another, more serious, handicap. The contraption blotted out all sound, including the referee's whistle. He wore it for a single game. On two of three occasions he rampaged downfield, ball in hand, glory beckoning. Each time the unaccustomed exhilaration of having outstripped the defence eventually gave way to suspicion at the absence of pursuit. He stopped and turned, to find us all scoffing at a distance; then trudged back to take his place at the scrum which the referee had summoned. A version of the old-style scrumcap does still have its adherents, particularly in rugby league. Gary Schofield has worn one in the test matches against New Zealand, a helmet which recalls John Wayne as Genghis Khan, galloping across the wastes of Mongolia. But in the union game it has been chucked on to the scrapheap, to join knee-length shorts, banana-shaped boots, and those fat, rain-heavy balls which, on raw November afternoons, descended from grey skies like mortar shells. Elasticated strapping has become the vogue method of protecting ears. This comes either wide and thick, making the wearer look as if he had suffered a shrapnel wound; or thin and mean, as sported by Brian Moore (who is mean, but not thin). The decline and fall of the scrumcap has been mirrored by that of the other icon of rugby, the cauliflower ear. Once, this was the indispensable trademark mark of those warriors of the front and second rows. The shapeless mess of pulverised gristle and cartilage on the side of the head was a badge of honour, a silent legacy of hard times, - murky misdeeds, sacrifices gladly made. Actually, of course, this is sentimental nonsense. No one in his right mind would wish to go through life with ears resembling lumps of uncooked sausage meat. It would be absurd to object to the use of elasticated strapping if it prevents such disfigurement; nor, even, to the spectacle - recently seen on television - of Wade Dooley having his cauliflower ear feasted on by a leech in an effort to get rid of the swelling. Nor, if I am honest, can I become emotional about that time-honoured accessory, the jockstrap. For years the powers that be have been urging the abandonment of this article of dress, on the grounds that it is a seedbed for the infectious and revolting herpes known as scrum-pox. The Rugby Football Union want it replaced by swimming trunks; and it would be mere fogeyishness to argue otherwise. But the communal bath is another matter. It lies at heart of the culture of rugby union. True, the spectacle of a score and more of hairy, fleshy, battle-scarred bodies floundering in a huge tub of muddy water can be something of an affront to those of a sensitive disposition, particularly if the air is booming with the vile obscenity of the usual rugby chorus. On the other hand, a shower cannot provide the balm to raw abrasions, stretched muscles and twisted joints that comes with total immersion. The authorities frown, muttering about disease and uncleanliness. But are there not infections lurking in the cracks between the tiles beneath the showers? To be indelicate, have they not heard of verrucas and allied horrors? So, let the taps gush and the steam rise and the bodies intermingle. Leave the harmless institution of the post-match plunge alone.</p>

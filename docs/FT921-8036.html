			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: TR Pacific net asset value at 79.9p A broadly-based recovery on Pacific stock exchanges following the end of the Gulf war enabled net asset value at TR Pacific Investment Trust to increase from 66.2p to 79.9p over the 1991 year. However, recessionary forces prevented the upturn from being sustained and most markets weakened in the second half. The interim net asset value was 92.7p. A low level of borrowings resulting in a fall to Pounds 150,000 (Pounds 449,000) in interest payable and a reduction in other expenses, particularly bank charges, were behind an increase from Pounds 354,000 to Pounds 696,000 in net revenue. Earnings per share were 1.039p (0.528p). The proposed single dividend is maintained at 0.25p with an additional special distribution of 0.45p.</p>

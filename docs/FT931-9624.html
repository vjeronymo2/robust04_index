			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs divided over 'quick fix' for coal THE CROSS-PARTY consensus over coal on the Commons trade and industry committee was under great strain yesterday with Tory members accusing Mr Richard Caborn, its Labour chairman, of seeking to undermine its original proposals. The clash came as prospective Tory rebels responded to details of a government draft white paper by warning it would face Commons defeat if it pressed ahead with the plan in its current form. Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP for Davyhulme, said the government's proposals did not go far enough and would prompt a revolt 'big enough to defeat the government on the floor of the House.' He was supported by Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the Tory MP for Batley &amp; Spen, who said the plan, which envisages expanding the market for domestic deep-mined coal by some 12m tonnes a year on average for five years, 'looks like a quick fix.' The principal attack on Mr Caborn came from Mr Keith Hampson, a Conservative committee member, who said it looked 'suspiciously like the figures are being reworked in order to enable the Labour party to use the report to justify their campaign to save all the pits.' It seemed 'very strange' for the chairman of the committee to hold a press conference and bring along an expert to rubbish the committee's findings, Mr Hampson added. He said the matter would be raised at the cross-party body's next meeting. The select committee report, published last month, advocated creating an additional market of at least 16m tonnes per year for domestic deep-mined coal by a range of measures including postponing electricity market liberalisation. This implied saving about half of the 31 threatened pits. Mr John Butterfill, another Conservative committee-member, said yesterday he disagreed with Mr Caborn's assertion that the recommendations were a package to take or leave. Mr Caborn's statement had not been discussed with or approved by the committee, he added. Mr Caborn joined the attack on the government's plans, saying they would 'do no more than provide a breathing space for a limited number of pits.' Although room might be made for more than 12m tonnes additional consumption in the first year, the government's package has been widely interpreted as implying the rescue of only a dozen or so pits - based on the traditional scale equating 1m tonnes of coal to one pit and 1,000 jobs. But British Coal said yesterday that productivity improvements over the last year had raised the average pit's output to about 1.5m tonnes per year. This rendered the old rule of thumb invalid. The government's draft calls for the market for deep-mined coal to be expanded by adopting a four-pronged approach: blocking imports of orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel; slowing the planned rundown of coal stocks; cutting output from open-cast mines; and using subsidies to halt growth in coal imports.</p>

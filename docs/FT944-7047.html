			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Lib Dems get tough on gas guzzlers The Liberal Democrats yesterday proposed a dramatic cut in vehicle excise duty for smaller cars, combined with an increase in petrol taxes, to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. The party said in a policy paper fleshing out aspects of its alternative Budget proposals that a rise of 20p a gallon in fuel duty would fund a Pounds 120 a year cut in duty for cars up to 1,500cc. Mr Matthew Taylor, environment spokesman, said the proposals would shift the burden of taxation away from car ownership on to 'excessive' use, especially by owners of inefficient vehicles. He said that the UK's 'addiction' to big cars cost the economy up to Pounds 17bn a year, compared with revenue of Pounds 16.6bn. Mr Taylor said that the combination of a Pounds 10 duty and dearer petrol would cut motoring bills by Pounds 75 a year for average rural drivers, Pounds 90 for average urban drivers and Pounds 85 for drivers travelling less than 7,000 miles a year. Costs would rise by Pounds 60 for the average driver of a 2,000cc car, but would fall by Pounds 135 a year for a 1,300cc vehicle. A business driver averaging 20,000 miles a year in a 2,800cc car at 24 miles a gallon would face an extra bill of Pounds 165. Owning a 1,500cc car would save this driver Pounds 55.</p>

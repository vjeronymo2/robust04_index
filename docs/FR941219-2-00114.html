			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. With respect to the maturity of each GIC, the Agreement enables the Employer to retain the flexibility to decide upon each GIC's maturity whether to make a final Loan in the amount of the Maturity Value, if not paid when due by or on behalf of Confederation, or to purchase the GIC from the Plan. The Employer represents that it is unclear under current conditions whether the purchase of the two GICs by the Employer would jeopardize the ability of the Plan and/or the Employer to successfully assert rights to protection under the insurance guaranty fund laws of the various states. The Employer is concerned that, if the two GICs are transferred from the Plan prior to resolution of issues related to guaranty fund protection, various state guaranty fund associations may deny the full range of protection which would have been conferred on the Plan and its participants through such insurance guaranty laws. For these reasons, the Employer would like to wait until the maturity date of each GIC to determine whether to purchase the GIC from the Plan or to make a Loan to the Plan in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value. The Agreement requires the Employer to make its decision with respect to the maturity of each GIC, and to consummate the Loan or purchase transaction, within thirty business days after the maturity date of each GIC, during which the GIC's Maturity Value will earn interest (Post-Maturity Interest) at the prevailing 30-day U.S. Treasury bill rate, from the date of maturity to the date of the loan or purchase. In the event the Employer chooses to purchase either of the GICs, the purchase price will be cash in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value plus Post-Maturity Interest. The Plan will not incur any expenses related to any sale of the GICs. In the event the Employer chooses to make a final Loan upon the Maturity of each GIC, each Loan will be in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value plus Post-Maturity Interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

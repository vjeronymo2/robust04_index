			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION: JAMES TARANTINO MAKES DRESSING SIMPLY ELEGANT  </P> <P> AMES TARANTINO COULD be dubbed the new Mr. Clean. In the fashion industry, such  high praise is reserved for the very few -- Balenciaga in the '50s, Halston in  the '70s and Armani in the '80s -- who turn tides with nuances rather than  grand gestures. Such designers are beyond fad, perfectly in tune with the way  women want to look: dignified, feminine, sensual.  </P> <P> At 30 and in business only since 1986, Tarantino has already developed a clear  vision. In 1986, he won the California Mart's Rising Star Award, and this year  Christian Lacroix presented him with the Fil d'Argent Award for new designers  at the International Linen Festival in Monte Carlo.  </P> <P> Tarantino, who studied at the Parsons School of Design, works in a small  downtown Los Angeles studio, making modern clothes the old-fashioned way:  sketching, draping, fitting and working out original ideas. The result is  classically styled, high-quality dresses and suits with his distinctive, sleek  signature. Tarantino's clothes are made in upbeat colors and crisp fabrics that  glide over a woman's body, accentuating curves gracefully. They're no-nonsense,  smart clothes.  </P> <P> Bloomingdale's discovered Tarantino about a year ago when its East Coast  merchandise marauders arrived to put together a storewide spring 1989  California promotion. Tarantino's work was a great success, says Barbara  Kennedy, merchandise vice president of dresses, coats and suits for  Bloomingdale's. "We reordered almost every style, and for fall we sold out,  too. His is a very sophisticated taste level."  </P> <P> Customers recognize that. "I grew up wearing my grandmother's Galanos and  Geoffrey Beene, so I'm not that easy to please," says Wendy Fritz of Chicago,  New York and Palm Beach. "James' clothes are elegant, simple and finished so  well. They fit like Claude Montana or Thierry Mugler and when I wear them,  everyone wants to know who the designer is. They're delighted when they learn  about the price."  </P> <P> An average dress sells for about $380, a suit about $550, which is less than  what some designers charge. It's an investment that requires some thought, but  not serious debt, at stores including Nordstrom, Bullocks, I. Magnin, Saks  Fifth Avenue, Fred Segal Santa Monica and Ron Ross in Encino.Barbara Foley  </P></p>

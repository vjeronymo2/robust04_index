			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / MI Group sales side to work only for Citibank THE sales force at MI Group, the life assurance and pensions group, has formed itself into a new company which will sell policies exclusively for Citibank Life Assurance. Mr Simon Ingram, chief executive of MI Group, has formed a company to be known as City Financial Partners Ltd which will include an estimated 700 of MI's 800-strong sales force and administrative staff. The new company is expected to receive regulatory approval by late January and begin operations before the end of the month. He said that CFPL intends to continue the practice of cold-calling prospective clients to sell Citibank policies - a sales tactic which earned MI much adverse publicity. However, Mr Ingram said that only 5 per cent of policy-holders are contacted through cold calling. Citibank's UK life assurance operations, purchased from British National Life Insurance in 1986, are minimal, with only Pounds 100m under management. A spokesman for Citibank said the new link will double the number of tied agents used by the company. A spokesman said the US-based bank is not troubled by MI Group's reputation for a hard-sell approach to life assurance. 'If MI Group were out there operating, then Lautro (the UK regulators) must have been satisfied they were complying with the law,' a spokesman said. Mr Ingram said that CFPL's sales force will be paid only for each policy they sell, although additional bonuses will be paid to agents able to generate more than Pounds 60,000 in commissions annually with a policy cancellation rate of less than 25 per cent every 24 months. Overall, nearly one-third of MI Group's policies are cancelled within two years. MI's existing 150,000 policy holders - with roughly Pounds 500m under management - will continue to have their investments managed by the company. Mr David Young, secretary of MI Group, said the company had decided to abandon its direct sales force because 'expenses do not keep up with premium income.' Citicorp, the biggest US bank that has been struggling to contain losses and cut costs, has replaced the head of its corporate lending and investment banking division and recruited as a vice-chairman Mr H. Onno Ruding, a former Dutch finance minister, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, yesterday briefed his top managers on the changes, which he said were aimed at simplifying the bank's management structure. Mr Reed, who was criticised on Wall Street after announcing an Dollars 885m loss in the third quarter and the halting of dividend payments, yesterday said he expected continuing high loan write-offs for the fourth quarter of 1991. He said the bank would return to profit by the end of 1992 and that its cost-cutting programme was beginning to result in improved margins, which for 1991 would be Dollars 5.8bn, up by 20 per cent on 1990. He said that after taking around Dollars 650m of fourth-quarter commercial loan write-offs and write-downs and a Dollars 200m increase of loan loss provisions the bank would report a Dollars 125m to Dollars 150m fourth-quarter loss. This would translate into a loss of Dollars 475m for all of 1991. A more primitive Citicorp, Page 21</p>

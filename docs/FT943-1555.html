			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Piech set to oust VW finance director Volkswagen's finance director, Mr Werner Schmidt, is expected to be ousted shortly as a consequence of last year's near collapse of the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, is understood to be seeking backing for his removal from key members of the company's non-executive supervisory board which will be asked to decide on the issue on November 25. While he can expect to garner a simple majority in favour of replacing Mr Schmidt from among his political and workforce allies on the board, he is believed to be taking pains to persuade members representing the Deutsche and Dresdner banks that Mr Schmidt, 62, should go at the end of this year. Relations between the two men have been poor since Mr Piech's appointment in January 1993. However, the chairman's determination to unseat Mr Schmidt has hardened recently following completion of a secret auditor's report on the circumstances surrounding last year's unexpected DM1.4bn (Pounds 574m) loss at Seat. Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, chairman, was fired last autumn, and the rest of the top management has since been replaced. Mr Schmidt was chairman of the Spanish company's supervisory board at the time, although there has not been any suggestion so far that he was any more aware of Seat's straits than Mr Piech. Shortly after details of the debacle emerged, Mr Piech remarked that earlier, much-lower estimates of the deficit from Seat's management board amounted to 'misinformation', which, in his view, was 'a crime with penal consequences'. It is believed, however, that further action is unlikely, especially since the situation at Seat is still not resolved, and labour unrest and other pressing problems are building up elsewhere within the group. A controversial Spanish government subsidy of Dollars 308m (Pounds 195m), officially earmarked for Seat's research and development budget, remains unpaid while the European Commission competition authorities examine its legality. Labour unrest is fermenting at the Czech subsidiary, Skoda, where the group wants to cut 800 jobs. VW has responded to a strike in its Brussels factory by transferring some the plant's production to Germany. At home, VW wants to reduce the workforce at its Emden factory, main source of the Passat range, by 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the plant has been given the job of repairing or replacing 9,000 faulty gearboxes discovered in the new generation VW Polo, due to go on sale next month.</p>

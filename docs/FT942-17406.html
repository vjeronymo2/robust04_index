			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / A bid to push the world to rights: The campaign to include worker protection in international trade pacts Last May 209 workers, mainly young women, were killed in a Bangkok toy factory fire. The casualties would have been far fewer if all but one of the exits had not been locked, and if the roof of the building had not collapsed a few minutes after the fire started. The Thailand tragedy, the world's worst factory fire, became a cause celebre for the small but effective lobby campaigning to make acceptance of basic civil and worker rights a condition of Gatt membership. The idea of linking trade agreements with workers' rights - and so preventing developing countries in particular from winning an unfair trading advantage - is not new. Keynes made similar suggestions in the 1930s. But the confluence of growing economic interdependence through trade, persistently high unemployment in the developed world, and the end of the Cold War (the communists did not like worker rights) has given the campaign new impetus. The lobbying threatens to take some of the fizz out of celebrations at Marrakesh next week when ministers from 120 countries gather to sign the Gatt Uruguay Round agreements. Both the US and France say that without some commitment at Marrakesh to discuss workers' rights they will block the setting up of a committee to manage the transition next year from the Gatt to its successor body the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They have support from elsewhere in the European Union, from Canada and from Australia. Such threats are unlikely to undermine the new world trade order in themselves; but according to some supporters of workers' rights such as the AFL-CIO, which represents US trade unions, no move at all on the issue could stir up the US Congress into refusing to ratify the Gatt deal. The US, even under Republican administrations, has long felt aggrieved about what it sees as unfair competition based on a disregard for human rights. Under the present Democrat administration there is a particular interest: Mr Mickey Kantor, trade secretary, previously worked as a union lawyer for Californian farm-workers; President Clinton is a long-standing advocate of the worker-trade link. But the governments of many developing countries are adamant that such a link is at best misguided and at worst 'rust-belt' protectionism, seeking to maintain the living standards of developed country workers. France is regarded as very keen to protect its workers from competition. Opponents argue that a worker-trade link would make it harder for poorer countries to exploit their main comparative advantage - cheap labour - and set back economic development. Mr BK Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador, says the issue had 'the destructive potential for undoing what we have built so assiduously in these seven years'. The arguments on both sides touch on sensitive issues, such as the invasion of national sovereignty and the causes of human suffering. They also lend themselves to misleading caricature: some supporters of workers' rights imply that their opponents would have resisted the abolition of slavery in the 19th century - a step which required protesters to interfere with the rights of nation states. The issue has also created an unusual alliance between western free marketeers and third world governments who do not normally see eye to eye on development issues. But, on the opposing side, many western trade unionists question whether authoritarian governments in the developing world represent their populations. On one level, the arguments seem to have got out of hand. The US government and the international trade union bodies say they only want to talk about the issue at this stage. Mr Mark Anderson, of the AFL-CIO, says: 'I think people in the US will have difficulty understanding why there is so much resistance to just talking about the issue.' Mr Stephen Pursey of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), adds: 'There is a lot of mud-slinging. A lot of people call us protectionist. Let's talk and see if we can find safeguards which are not protectionist.' But opponents have a case for fearing that once the talking begins, action will not be far behind. The ICFTU and similar bodies already have blueprints for the sorts of mechanisms they would like imposed. They want a two-level approach: an outright ban on extreme abuses, such as slave labour, and a framework which allows workers to organise themselves on issues such as pay bargaining and basic health and safety. 'We don't want a minimum wage or anything like that, we just want to ensure some basic civil rights at work, and we want measures which are affordable by poor countries,' says Mr Pursey. He accepts, for instance, that flexibility is required on child labour in countries which depend heavily on young workers, such as India and Brazil. The mechanism he proposes is to make membership of the WTO dependent on ratifying seven conventions drawn up by the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations' body which tries to enforce minimum labour standards - two on forced labour, two on freedom of association, two on discrimination and one on child labour. Sanctions should be imposed only rarely, says Mr Pursey. But unlike the ILO, which has no sanctions available to it, there would at least be the ultimate threat of action against offenders. Countries not properly implementing the conventions might be given two or three years to mend their ways by the WTO before penal tariffs were imposed on the relevant category of exports. Critics believe such a system would have no legitimacy and argue that the 'take off' stage of any country's industrialisation is unavoidably tough. But the ICFTU replies that the 'trickle-down' theory of trade policy - the idea that social conditions improve as trade expands - does not always work. It believes its proposals would help prevent a vicious circle of greater world competitiveness leading to more pressure to cut labour costs. It cites the example of Thailand which has health, safety and building legislation but does not always enforce the protection offered. If it had been policed in the case of the Bangkok toy factory, its owner Kader Industries, under pressure from western retailers to cut prices, may have moved to another country. Only international rules would prevent such a downward spiral of competition, says Mr Pursey. Trying to broker a solution that might satisfy both sides is Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner. He believes there is no reason in principle why trade should not be linked to other economic or social objectives, pointing out that trade agreements are already used to protect endangered species, to reduce the use of CFCs and to control trade in hazardous waste. But to give the Gatt or its successor such a role in the case of workers' rights would be entering unfamiliar territory - its purpose since its formation has been to tear down barriers not erect them. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director general, says that introducing the workers' rights-trade link into the WTO framework, which is meant to be based on consensus, 'would place the system at immediate risk of collapse'. But the world trade order is moving into a new phase with the formation of the more political WTO. Already agreement has been reached on setting up a working party to debate how environmental protection measures could be included in future trade pacts. That working party was set up because there was a consensus in favour. Supporters of workers' rights want a similar working party, but are a long way off from winning such support. Suspicions will continue to linger in the developing world that there is more self-interest than idealism behind the link being made between trade and workers' rights, especially in the US and France. Nonetheless, the issue will not easily be set aside.</p>

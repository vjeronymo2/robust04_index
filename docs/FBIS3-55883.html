In an interview to INTERFAX, he said that the proposal to  elect candidates to all management bodies of the chamber on a  basis of a single list would have little support. Sergey  Shakhray said that the media and independent deputies favor  individual and secret voting for every candidate.    He believes that the parliamentary chairman should have only  two deputies, one from the party list and the other from a  one-seat constituency.</p>

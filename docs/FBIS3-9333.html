			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPK/GGD: "Belgian Foreign Minister Claes -- </F> Czech Republic `At Top of List' for European Union Membership";  as released by Belga Database]    [Excerpt] Prague, 21 Mar (BELGA) -- On Monday, during the  second day of his official visit to Prague, Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes said: "The Czech Republic is the  best-placed country of Central Europe to enter the European  Union (EU)," although it is not currently possible to set a  precise date because the EU will need to be strengthened before  any further enlargement.    At a news conference after a meeting with his Czech  counterpart, Jozef Zieleniec, Claes added that the Czech  Republic will, however, have to accept the Community standards  if it wants to join the EU, since there is no question of again  playing the "British game of opt outs."    Asked by Czech journalists if the Czech Republic could join  the EU before the end of the century, Claes reiterated the need  to first strengthen the EU. He predicted, however, that the  situation developing in Russia could accelerate European  integration.    In this respect, the Belgian foreign minister urged the  Greek  presidency to ensure that the association treaty signed between  the EU and the Czech Republic last November is ratified as soon  as possible.    Claes also insisted that the EU would not treat the  enlargement negotiations as one package and that one country of  the Visegrad group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and  Hungary) could well gain EU membership before the others. He  added: "I am convinced that the Czech Republic will soon meet  the economic conditions for membership."    Claes had previously met with the president of the Czech  parliament and members of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committees. Czech deputies had reminded him of their  "slight disappointment" at not being able to join NATO  immediately. The Foreign Affairs Committee chairman said,  regrettably: "We want to base our action on a policy of  alliance. We do not want to be neutral. The Partnership for  Peace (a type of strengthened cooperation between NATO and the  countries of Eastern Europe) is a simple form of cooperation."    Speaking to the journalists about the Czech  "disappointment,"  Claes stressed that, even if Russia belonged to the Partnership  for Peace, that would not give it the right to have any say in  the enlargement of NATO.    This is the first visit by a Belgian foreign minister to the  Czech Republic, and Foreign Ministry sources say that the two  countries are envisaging adapting and renewing bilateral  agreements. New agreements in the areas of air transport, road  transport, investment, and taxation are expected to be  concluded. [passage omitted]</p>

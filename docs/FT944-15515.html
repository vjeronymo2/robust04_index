			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: PaineWebber/Kidder Non-financial groups do not make good parents for investment banks. General Electric has had to admit as much by selling most of Kidder Peabody to PaineWebber for Dollars 670m. The reason is that investment banks are unruly and sensitive children. Too firm a hand and the most talented brokers, traders and bankers will move to rival organisations. Too lax an approach and trading operations can easily run up large losses. GE now stands condemned of the latter failing. But it is also true that, in the past, Kidder's ability to recruit suffered from the perception that GE was excessively interventionist. Yesterday's sale is the third recent retreat by non-financial groups from US investment banking. This year American Express cut its connection with Shearson Lehman, while last year Sears Roebuck spun off Dean Witter. Though PaineWebber should be a better parent for Kidder than GE, the acquisition will not catapult it into the investment banking big league. Neither PaineWebber nor Kidder is large in advisory work or underwriting. Where the combined group will be a significant force is in US retail broking, though it will still be a long way behind Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney. Even so, PaineWebber will have its work cut out to make a success of the deal. Blending the cultures of the two groups will not be easy and rivals will be circling to see if they can poach Kidder's best staff.</p>

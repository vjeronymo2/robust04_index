			<p>BFN     [Text] The Algerian capital, Algiers, will on 10 May host  the next tripartite meeting between the Malian Government, the  United Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA], and Algeria on the  implementation of the national pact. This is the outcome of the  deliberations of the tripartite meeting in Tamanrasset, Algeria,  which was slated to end yesterday afternoon. Oumar Toure, our  special correspondent in Tamanrasset, filed this report:    The Algiers meeting is slated for 10 May. This will enable  the government delegation to return to Bamako to consult the  government on the response to be given to the movement on a  number of demands, since the national delegation has no mandate  to make decisions on behalf of the Malian people.    The national delegation was charged with presenting a report  on the implementation of the national pact since it was signed  on 11 April 1992. That was the real purpose of the Tamanrasset  meeting but against all expectations, MFUA went to Tamanrasset  with new demands based on the 31 March-9 April Gao meeting.  These demands include, among others, the integration of 2,360  combatants into the Army and the representation of MFUA in some  15 embassies and in a number of government posts.    However, the real disagreement lies in the integration of  2,360 MFUA elements into the Army. The Algerian mediator made  intense behind-the-scenes efforts to settle the disagreement but  unfortunately, the Malian national delegation could not act on  its own and the MFUA representatives were under pressure from  their headquarters. There was therefore no score after the  extra play time. Already, all are poised for penalty kicks in  Algiers.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 5TH-GRADERS MAY GET TO CHOOSE SCHOOL TRANSFERS  </P> <P> Palos Verdes school board members tentatively approved a plan Monday to allow  current fifth-graders at Mira Catalina and Rancho Vista elementary schools to  transfer to the school of their choice next fall.  </P> <P> The plan would save the financially strapped district the cost of buying  portable classrooms and would give the students a wider range of programs to  choose from, according to district officials.  </P> <P> Mira Catalina and Rancho Vista are the only schools within the district where  sixth-graders attend an elementary school. All other sixth-graders are enrolled  in intermediate schools.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the 137 fifth-graders would be allowed to attend either  Ridgecrest or Malaga Cove intermediate schools or Miraleste High School, where  a sixth grade would be created.  </P> <P> Miraleste, which the school board has sought to close because of declining  enrollment, presently serves grades seven through 12. However, district policy  now allows any seventh- or eighth-grader to attend an intermediate school  regardless of where they live.  </P> <P> The district's other two high schools serve grades nine through 12.  </P> <P> Acting school Supt. Wayne Butterbaugh said the district plan can not be carried  out until Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miram Vogel reviews it and  determines whether it violates her earlier court decision.  </P> <P> In 1988, Vogel prohibited the district from closing Miraleste or transferring  any east-side students to west-side schools until it completes an environmental  impact report on school closures districtwide. The district is preparing the  report and expects it to be complete by May.  </P> <P> If the judge agrees that the plan does not violate the court order, the board  is expected to cast a final vote on the matter on March 19, district officials  said.  </P> <P> Butterbaugh said that the district, which faces a $2.9-million deficit this  fiscal year, would save $195,000 if the fifth-graders are allowed to attend  other schools because it would not have to buy three new portable classrooms.  The classrooms are needed to replace existing ones that do not meet state  construction codes, he said.  </P> <P> Mira Catalina Principal Karen Jaconi said she favors allowing the fifth-graders  to transfer to the other campuses because they would then have a counselor and  a vice principal at their disposal.  </P> <P> Also, the school would regain part of its playground where the sixth-graders'  portable classrooms now sit, she said. Sixth-graders began attending the school  three years ago when the district closed an intermediate school because of  declining enrollment.  </P> <P> Barry Hildebrand, vice president of the east-side parents' group that has waged  a lengthy battle to keep Miraleste open, asserted that board members should not  have vote on the plan until Vogel had a chance to review it.  </P> <P> Hildebrand, who unsuccessfully ran for a school board seat last fall, also said  he feared that some fifth-grade students who elect to go to one of the  district's intermediate schools instead of Miraleste High School might not be  required to transfer back to Miraleste once they reach the ninth grade.  </P></p>

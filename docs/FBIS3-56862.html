			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Boris Fedorov announced his  resignation at a news conference today. The decision had been  made as far back as 18 January.    Fedorov's disagreement in principle with the new economic  policy of the government which is being formed at present was  the reason for his resignation. Fedorov also finds it is  impossible for him to stay at his post together with chairman of  the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. Since the president has  kept Gerashchenko, Fedorov has chosen to resign.    The ex-minister said there would be no headlong drop in the  ruble exchange rate in the immediate future since the foundation  of the financial policy had been laid for three months in  advance. He predicted a worsening of the financial situation in  April.    Fedorov said he did not know of any other policy in the  conditions of market economy except monetarist, and any attempts  to improve the industry by issuing money will only lead to  higher inflation.    He sharply criticized the agreement between the Russian  Central Bank and Belarus on the single monetary zone. He  expressed the opinion that Russia would bear the burden of the  decision.    Among his merits, Fedorov mentioned the ruble's relatively  stable rate and an increase in the real income of the population  by 10 percent in 1993.    [Begin Fedorov recording] A populist policy which, I think,  will be chosen, threatens with the ruble rate reaching 12,000 by  the end of the year, average inflation rates -- approximately 30  percent and falling real living standards. At the same time  production will still fall by about five per cent. So none of  the indices will improve. But, as I already said in my New Year  forecast, it is possible that the production of tanks might  increase. [end recording]    Fedorov refused to name his candidate for the post of  finance  minister fearing that, if he named him, the latter would have  not been appointed.</p>

			<p>940413 FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks help papermaker Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, the two main creditor banks of Daishowa Paper, and Marubeni Corporation have sent a group of experts to the debt-laden papermaker to help it in its five-year restructuring plan, agencies report from Tokyo. Daishowa Paper, which is Japan's third-largest papermaker, announced last month that it was aiming to reduce its debts to Y270bn (Dollars 2.6bn) by March 1999, from about Y434bn now. The company, which was established in 1938 by the Saito family, said it has been hit hard after aggressive expansion in the 1980s and the subsequent economic slump. Last month, a delay in plans to sell assets forced Daishowa to downgrade its business forecast for 1993-94.</p>

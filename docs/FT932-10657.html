			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Costain in housing sale talks - Several potential purchasers involved, but no offer made as yet COSTAIN, the heavily borrowed UK construction group, has received approaches from several potential purchasers for its loss-making UK housebuilding operations. The company confirmed yesterday that talks had taken place, but said it had still to receive an offer for the business. Up to half a dozen companies are though to be interested, including Redrow, the privately-owned housebuilder and construction group. Mr Steve Morgan, Redrow's chairman, declined to comment on the speculation, but his company is thought to have been given until next week to submit a formal offer for the UK housebuilding operations. Costain needs the money to reduce its large borrowings. It recently sold its Australian mining operations to Peabody Resources, part of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, in a deal worth Pounds 198m. Despite this, Costain still had borrowings of almost Pounds 153m at the beginning of April, equivalent to 96 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive of the company, which incurred a Pounds 149m pre-tax loss last year, wants to reduce its involvement in UK housebuilding to concentrate on its core businesses of UK and international construction and US coal mining. It has made no secret of the fact that it would sell the UK housing operations at the right price. Costain's residential and commercial property businesses last year reported an operating loss of Pounds 7.1m, against a Pounds 14.6m deficit in 1991. The value of its housing land was written down by a further Pounds 49.5m, following sharp falls in house prices. The company owns about 2,000 housing sites, with an average value, after write-downs, of Pounds 11,000 each. This would indicate a sale value for the UK housing operations of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. Last year slightly more than 400 homes were built, with an average selling price of Pounds 57,000, generating annual turnover of almost Pounds 23m. The recent improvement in house sales has encouraged a revival in interest in acquisitions and purchases of land by housebuilders wishing to expand their operations. This is thought to have prompted the flurry of interest in Costain's housing operations, which operate in south-east England. They suffered as a result of investing heavily in land in the late 1980s as the housing market moved into recession.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tex Reduced project volume and further provisions for exceptional costs hit second half trading at Tex, a provider of consumables to the plastic, steel and energy industries. As a result, the company finished the year to March 31 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 273,000, against a Pounds 94,000 loss, after exceptionals of Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 46,000). At the interim stage, Tex had turned round a Pounds 146,000 loss into a profit of Pounds 486,000, after Pounds 104,000 charges last time for factory closure and redundancy costs. Turnover rose 25 per cent to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 16.7m). Mr Anthony Burrows, chairman, said the slow recovery from the recession had continued, reflected in higher but erratic levels of demand and pressure on margins. Mr Burrows explained that although trading was improving, it was not yet sufficient to recommend a dividend - the last payment was in 1990. Earnings per share were 2.4p (1.5p losses).</p>

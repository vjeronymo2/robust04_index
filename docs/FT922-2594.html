			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Ghost of Dukakis slain by Massachusetts tax-cutter: A Republican governor who calls himself a 'filthy supply sider' A STUFFED armadillo adorns a mantelpiece in the office of Mr William Weld, governor of Massachusetts. It is an appropriate, if unintended, symbol of the thick skin the Republican Mr Weld has required in the 17 months since he became governor and began to make radical changes in the way the traditionally Democratic state is run. Through deep cuts in welfare programmes and the civil service, Mr Weld has succeeded in bringing Massachusett's run-away budget under control - to the point where he is now trying to push through the legislature modest tax cuts in a state formerly known as 'Taxachusetts'. This contrasts with the tax increases many states have been pushing through to cope with a recessionary shortfall in revenues. He has also put Massachusetts at the forefront of America's fledgling 'entrepreneurial government' movement, which seeks to make the bureaucracy more efficient through the use of business techniques and the privatisation of services. All this has made Mr Weld plenty of enemies. Church leaders have accused him of showing a 'callous disregard for the poorest'. Democratic politicians have attacked his proposed tax cuts as irresponsible financial legerdemain. The state's teachers, upset about budget cuts, threatened to strike. But the opinion polls show Mr Weld remains solidly popular with the electorate. That is hardly surprising, given that he was elected on a wave of revulsion against high taxes, politics-as-usual and the Democratic machine of Mr Michael Dukakis, the former governor and 1988 Democratic presidential candidate . Mr Dukakis enjoyed great popularity in the mid-1980s as the state economy outpaced the national average, thanks to a boom in the defence and computer industries, which in turn fed a speculative property bubble. But the bubble burst and New England plunged into a severe recession, which took with it some 10 per cent of the region's jobs and nearly 100 of its banks. The much-vaunted 'Massachusetts miracle' turned to dust, and Mr Dukakis's reputation with it. Mr Weld, a Harvard and Oxford educated lawyer from a wealthy New England family, likes to characterise himself as a 'filthy supply sider' - a follower of the tax-cutting economic theories popularised by former President Ronald Reagan. Yet his blend of policies defies traditional conservative/liberal labelling: on some social issues he is well to the left of Republican orthodoxy, for example favouring abortion rights and strong controls on environmental pollution. At the same time he is tough on crime, wanting to restore the death penalty and impose much tighter prisoner parole guidelines. Some analysts argue that all this makes the 46-year-old governor an example of a new type of politician - drawn from, and appealing to, the 'baby boom' generation - who cuts across traditional ideologies. Certainly, some of the 'entrepreneurial government' ideas he is pursuing are also being tried by Democratic governors, including Mr Bill Clinton, the party's likely presidential nominee, in Arkansas. Mr Weld, however, is taking these ideas further than most other states, with initiatives which include: Slimming the bureaucracy and improving its efficiency by reducing bottlenecks, for example by speeding up the issuing of permits for hazardous waste disposal. He is also trying to bring rocketing medical aid costs under control, one of the most difficult tasks facing any state government. In his 1993 budget he is also trying to shift the focus of debate from 'inputs' - how much money each department receives - to 'outputs' or just what services they will provide with the funds. For example, one target for the Registry of Motor Vehicles is to cut the average wait for a driving licence to 25 minutes. Contracting out to the private sector services previously performed by government agencies. For example, he has closed or consolidated nine under-used hospitals and put their patients in private-sector care. He has put the maintenance of part of the highway system out to bidding and wants to privatise the processing of child support cheques. He is considering selling off two large state assets to private owners - Boston's Logan Airport and the Massachusetts Turnpike. Studies have suggested the former could be worth Dollars 786m (Pounds 431.8m) and the latter Dollars 944m. However, selling either would involve some serious administrative difficulties, and it is not clear that the governor has the political will to pursue this. For one thing, his first priority is to form a regional authority which would develop coherent transport policies. For another, he insists: 'I don't have any bias in favour of privatisation. I dont want to privatise anything unless it works, unless we're going to get a more efficient operation. 'You bear the burden of proving citizens are going to get a superior service for the same price, or same service at a lower price.' Critics point out that his budget balancing has been helped by the first stirrings of a regional economic revival, as well as by the tax increases pushed through by the Dukakis regime. Consumer confidence in New England is up, the unemployment rate is edging down, and the slightly better mood was underlined recently when one of the region's largest financial institutions, Bank of Boston, pledged to ease a credit crunch by making Dollars 3bn available for new business loans. Not everything has gone Mr Weld's way. Under pressure from the Democratic-controlled legislature, which has been surprisingly accommodating to most of his proposals, he has shelved some of his most draconian welfare measures and done an apparent about-face on cuts in education spending. Critics also argue that his reforms are less substantive than his reputation suggests, and point out that Massachusetts remains one of the highest welfare spending states in the US. But a year and a half is too short a time in which to pass judgment on the changes Mr Weld is attempting. As he says: 'Entrepreneurial government is a crap game that keeps on rolling.'</p>

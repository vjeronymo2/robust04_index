			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought shrivels output in Queensland's 'country garden' - For the fourth year in a row the state's grain growers are facing disaster conditions A large roadside billboard greets travellers heading west from Brisbane: 'Welcome to Queensland's Country Garden', it reads. Today, the message seems laughable. As far as the eye can see, there is nothing but scorched earth under a blistering blue sky. This is the Queensland drought, and it has tens of thousands of farmers, working land on Australia's eastern seaboard, praying for rain. If the weather does not break in the next week, all winter planting opportunities will have passed. Worse, this will be the fourth consecutive year and eighth planting season when many grain farmers have faced such conditions. The length and severity of the drought is unprecedented since European settlement, and it is wreaking havoc on the rural economy. Already, 35 per cent of Queensland has been declared a drought area, including major grain-growing areas around the Darling Downs and central tablelands. This figure will almost certainly rise this month. A similar situation persists in New South Wales, where almost 60 per cent of the state was declared to be drought-stricken earlier this week. The only consolation for NSW is that drought is relatively recent. Last year's grain production was good. Even so, many Australian farmers - wheat and cotton growers, in particular - are hurting badly. The Queensland Graingrowers Association reckons that lost production resulting from this year's weather conditions alone will total ADollars 1bn (Pounds 480m), about Dollars A330m in Queensland and the remainder in New South Wales. More broadly, Mr Wayne Goss, Queensland's premier, has calculated that the paucity of rain since 1991 has cost his state around ADollars 2bn-worth of rural production. Allowing for the 'multiplier' effect - as farmers' reduced spending power hits demand for other goods and services - he puts the total damage to Queensland's economy at ADollars 3.6bn. The extent of the 1994 grain disaster has only become apparent in recent weeks, as successive windows for winter planting have passed. Back in March, above average rainfalls actually encouraged farmers to hope that the drought jinx had been broken. Even six weeks ago, in its quarterly crop report, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics was forecasting that the nation would sow about 10.2m hectares to wheat this winter and produce some 15.7m tonnes of the grain. This would have compared with just under 18m tonnes in the previous year. Since then, the situation has changed dramatically. Now Abare warns that, if meteorologists' forecasts of below average rainfalls for the next two months are correct, national production could fall to as little as 10.8m tonnes, with only 8.3m ha sown. In Queensland, the picture will certainly be bleaker. In a 'normal' year, the state might produce 1.5m to 2m tonnes of wheat. Last year, the figure was just over 600,000 tonnes. This year, the Australian Wheat Board says it expects under 500,000 tonnes, and the Queensland Graingrowers Association warns that the figure could be lower still. In New South Wales, where 'average' production exceeds 5m tonnes, the AWB is talking of 2m tonnes, and 'that's assuming normal weather conditions from now on'. Already, the chances of retrieving the winter planting season look slim. 'We're not going to get rain until next weekend at best, so it would be the middle of August before farmers can plant in southern Queensland - and you'd have to be desperate to do that,' says Mr Ian MacFarlane, president of the QGA. With central Queensland already a lost cause, he concludes: 'What we're going to get is what's already in the ground'. And already the implications of both present and cumulative damage are starting to emerge. On the one hand, there is talk of endangered export contracts, even a suggestion that Australia may have to make the rare move of importing wheat. The grain represented the country's seventh most important export category last year, with a trade value of ADollars 2.2bn; and the big problem is that the premium wheat, favoured by Japanese buyers, is grown mainly the drought-affected areas. Of most concern is an agreement to sell about 300,000 tonnes of prime hard wheat to the Japanese, for whom security of supply has always been a prime requirement. 'We are currently reasonably confident that we can satisfy that,' says the Australian Wheat Board, the central agency which handles export sales. But the AWB also acknowledges that total Australian production needs to reach 13m tonnes before it can comfortably handle all export business. This figure will almost certainly be undershot. To ensure that the AWB at least secures the bulk of the available supply of premium wheat, the agency has sharply increased the pool prices in selected regions. It is also shipping lower-grade wheat from other states to satisfy feed buyers in the drought-affected areas - in the hope of reducing their rival calls on the premium product. Unfortunately, this will almost certainly push up feed costs, thus spreading financial impact of the drought. 'The grain farmers are getting the attention, but I guess that forgotten people in all this are the livestock producers, and the agricultural suppliers,' says Mr MacFarlane. Moreover, while both the AWB and grain growers remain fairly sanguine about imports - not least because of quarantine restrictions and the like - they do concede that shortages in niche areas like durum wheat, used to make pasta, may necessitate some selective purchasing from overseas. Secondly, there is the question of assistance for farmers. To date, some ADollars 75m of aid has been provided by state and federal authorities, mainly in the form of interest subsidies. Federal government allowed for a further ADollars 4.5m of assistance in its 1994-95 budget estimates, and Queensland is promising about ADollars 20m. But Queensland grain growers say that the sums are paltry when set against the cashflow crisis in the farm community. They claim that the need for aid surpasses any previous experience - and that a major rethink should encompass everything from the size of re-establishment grants for farmers who want to quit the land, to training facilities for farm workers who are now idle. Later this week, Senator Bob Collins, Australia's primary industry minister, will tour the Darling Downs region. He has already asked for separate assessments of the situation from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, which handles federal relief, and from the Queensland and New South Wales governments. The federal cabinet will discuss the need for further measures next week. In the meantime, some damage may be irreparable. While few Queensland growers think that land will be lost to grain production in the long term - simply because cash-flow should return quickly when the rains come - they do worry that an exodus from the land could occur. Mr MacFarlane quotes figures, which he says are supported by Abare, suggesting that 15 to 20 per cent of farmers could sell up if the drought continues.</p>

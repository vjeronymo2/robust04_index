			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP) -- Employment and peace are to  be the main items on the agenda for the French presidency of the  European Union [European Union] in the first half of 1995, the  two ministers responsible for European affairs said here on  Friday [29 April].    In presenting their view of the future of the Union they  challenged what they saw was the British policy orientated  towards a free-trade area.    They would emphasise the "French vision" of the future of  European cooperation while working closely with Germany which is  to hold the presidency during the second half of this year.    The French strategy was outlined at a press conference by  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and European Affairs Minister Alain  Lamassoure.    France, like Germany, had an ambition to see a "greater  Europe," Juppe said. The Union was "honour bound" with respect  to countries which had emerged from communism in East Europe.    But he warned that once Finland, Sweden, Norway and Austria  had joined the Union as planned at the beginning of next year,  there should be no further enlargement without appropriate  reform of EU institutions.    France wanted to avoid a situation in which the arrival of  new members gave substance to the British view that the European  Union should be reduced to a free-trade area without political  ambitions.    A review of EU institutions has been planned for 1996.  Hungary and Poland have applied to join the Union. The Czech  republic is thought likely also to apply. Germany supports  their applications.    Juppe said he hoped that countries likely to draw closer to  the Union, or to join it, should establish relations of "good  neighbourliness" among themselves.    He noted that on May 26 and 27 Paris would host a conference  to launch the so-called stability pact which is intended to help  settle problems concerning minorities and frontiers in Central  and East Europe.    Regarding peace, Juppe stressed the need for coordination  between the separate functions of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU), which  is the only wholly European body with competence for defence.    He recalled that France and Germany had offered countries in  East Europe the status of associate membership of the WEU.    Juppe also said that the revision of European institutions  from 1996 should be an opportunity formally to include  Strasbourg in the European treaties as the home of the European  parliament to put an end to a dispute with those who favour  Brussels.    On unemployment, Juppe said that a white paper by the EU  commission on employment, which had been adopted by the 12 EU  countries last year, should be taken into consideration.    The white paper argued the case for an increase in  flexibility within the labour market and for a reduction of  social levies so as to reduce the cost of labour.    He also stressed the importance of a programme planned by  the  Union for major public works in the sectors of transportation  and communication networks in order to give concrete meanin to  efforts to boost the economy.    Juppe was cautious about the nomination of Silvio Berlusconi  as Prime Minister of Italy.    Leading figures of the French left-wing opposition have  called for a boycott of neo-Facsict ministers in the new Italian  government.    Juppe aaid that he wanted to be able to continue "working in  confidence" with the government in Rome, holding that a  judgement of its policies would not be possible for several  weeks or months.    He was also reticent with regard to who might succeed  Frenchman Jacques Delors as President of the EU Commission. A  decision is to be taken in Corfu in June and Juppe said merely  that he had "clear ideas" on the matter.    French diplomatic circles frequently mention the name of  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Flemish Christian  Democrat. Britain favours current Commission Vice President Sir  Leon Brittan who has made a name as a proponent of free trade  under EU competition laws, analysts noted.</p>

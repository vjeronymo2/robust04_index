			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Business leaders prefer 'no change'  -Scots Government TWO THIRDS of Scottish business leaders want no change in Scotland's constitutional arrangements, according to an opinion survey. But 23 per cent would like to see some form of Scottish parliament, which would have tax-raising powers, replacing Scotland's existing tier of regional councils. Euram Consulting, an executive recruitment agency, asked 515 of Scotland's senior industrialists, top executives of financial institutions and senior partners of law and accountancy firms to complete a postal survey. Of the 35 per cent who replied, 65 per cent wanted no change. Two per cent wanted a Scottish tax-raising assembly on top of the regional councils and 6 per cent wanted total independence. Among the Scottish public as a whole, support for independence has eased and backing for the constitutional status has risen, according to a Mori opinion poll published at the weekend by The Sunday Times. It put support for independence at 36 per cent, that for devolution at 37 per cent and backing for the status quo at 23 per cent. This contrasts with an ICM poll taken at the end of January for the Scotsman newspaper and ITN which put support for independence at 50 per cent and that for devolution at 27 per cent, with the status quo backed by 19 per cent of those asked. That poll triggered intense interest in the Scottish constitutional issue and also showed a rise in support for the Scottish National party, which backs independence. Backing for the SNP is now put by Mori at 25 per cent. Backing for Labour is 42 per cent, that for the Conservatives 22 per cent and that for the Liberal Democrats 10 per cent. A System Three poll for the Glasgow Herald taken over the same period put Labour at 38 per cent (38 per cent in January), the SNP at 28 per cent (26), Conservatives at 22 per cent (23) and Liberal Democrats at 10 per cent (11).</p>

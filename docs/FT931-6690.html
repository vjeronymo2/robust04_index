			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): To the manoir drawn: the lure of old Brittany - Chris Eales discovers some gentle spring retreats at a reasonable price WHEN MY friends are tired of London, they call me. I live in a manoir, something less than 20 kilometres from the northern coast of Celtic Brittany. British Celts founded this presqu'ile in the fifth century AD. Perhaps this is why mainland Britons have a peculiar affinity with the Bretons. At any rate, the Brits camp in droves each summer and the Brets reckon they get on better with them than with the mecs from Paris. Malheureusement, I tell my friends, there are not enough rooms in this modest, 14th century manoir. It is tucked away in the heart of the Tregor, a tranquil pocket of 900 acres in the Cote d'Armor and bounded by some of Europe's most splendid coastline, right opposite Devon. So, I decided to visit some of the Tregor's many larger manoirs that actually rent out their ancient rooms. All are eminently satisfactory for those who would like a gentle spring retreat at a reasonable price in a place where the land wrestles with the sea. My journey followed the footsteps and magnifying glasses of many posh architectural antiquarians. Professors have crawled all over manoirs here, some counting the rings of their wooden beams to date them. Nobles built and lived in them more than 600 years ago when Brittany was independent of France. Many manoirs were left to tumble by farmers who acquired them after the Revolution, but plenty have been saved and renovated to a high standard. Their chunky stone walls and towers, used originally for defence, remain a dominant feature. Bretons say it rains every day and twice on Sundays, but it forgot to rain the day I made my tour; indeed, the sky was bright blue. I got in the car and weaved off along the Tregor's roads, hardly big enough for more than one vehicle. I was heading toward the Chateau de Brelidy, a 16th century manoir with 10 guest rooms. I was soon lost in the wild, raw countryside of browns, greens, high banks, and the occasional grey of an old stone house puffing smoke. Somewhere, a dog barked. Otherwise, it was quiet. I was not in a hurry. Nobody ever is in Brittany. At the Chateau de Brelidy, I met Hector, a suit of shining armour. I did not know he was a fake until Madame Yoncourt, who owns the manoir, told me. Also on display are stuffed snipe and, oddly, a collection of wedding dresses. Apparently, honeymooners used to stay there. In the hallway, through a glass cabinet, I saw the imprints of a hand on a fourth century drain, dug up in the chateau grounds under the ruins of an 11th century hill fort. Away in the distance were fuzzy tree outlines and the lonely Menez-Bre, at 300 metres the highest point in the area. Like a dot, the summit is crowned by the tiny chapel of St Herve, a blind saint who climbed barefoot to it centuries ago. Legend says he was asked to advise bishops meeting at the chapel. When he arrived, a bishop thought he was a tramp and mocked him. The bishop suddenly went blind. St Herve found water, even on the hill, and splashed it on the bishop's eyes. He saw again. You could spend the whole time within the chateau's splendidly restored walls of stone. Madame Yoncourt cooks dinner, a daily choice of Breton dishes. Specialities are homard a l'armoricaine (lobster), palourdes (cockles) and belons (flat-shelled oysters). There is a library and television lounge, even a full-size billiard table. I drank a demi slowly before I left. The Chateau de Kermezen, a smaller manoir, is about 10 km north of Brelidy, close to the village of Pommerit Jaudy. Here, guests eat and drink with the count and countess of Kermel. No need to tremble. The countess treats her guests as her family and she cooks different local dishes each day. Two stone towers mark its courtyard. One of them once was a pigeonnier in which Breton nobles kept pigeons, which they ate; the number depended on the amount of land the manoir held. Hence, the size of the pigeonnier tells how important the manoir is. This one is impressive and so are its owners. The count, who greeted me first, was wearing Wellington boots and carrying a chainsaw. The countess was at the back, digging the garden where the land declines steeply to the river Jaudy and a gorgeous valley. She told me later, as we sat by the fire sipping whisky: 'The chateau has been in the family since the 1400s. The villagers returned it to us after the Revolution.' The sea is never more than a 20-minute drive from anywhere in the Tregor but from Plougrescant, at the Manoir de Kergrec'h, owned by the viscount and viscountess Stephanie de Roquefeuil, it is merely a delightful stroll away. In fact, this ivy-clad 17-century manoir (there are four guest rooms) is on the Circuit de La Cote des Ajoncs, an inspiring coastal walk lined by ajonc, a distinctive gorse. A dramatic feature of this coast, called the Cote de Granit Rose after its pink-coloured rocks, is to be found at Tregastel where huge slabs of smooth granite tower over the beach. They have been eroded into intriguing shapes - here a tortoise, there a whale. Their completely irregular angles seem man-chiselled, but this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and free to visitors. If magnificent sea and country walks, punctuated by a glass of Muscadet and a dozen oysters, are too relaxing, there is always hunting and fishing. All arrangements will be made at any of the manoirs. And, if risking your cash is favoured, there is a roulette table in the casino at Perros Guirec, the chic-est spot on the coast.

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / DTI clears NatWest of misconduct NATIONAL Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank, was yesterday cleared by a Department of Trade and Industry investigation of allegations that it withheld important documents from a 1989 DTI inquiry into the Blue Arrow affair. The DTI report said there was 'no substance' to other 'allegations of dishonesty and impropriety which have been levelled at senior officers of NatWest'. The report is less pleasant for the Bank of England, showing its supervisors as being not very aggressive in probing alleged wrongdoing at a leading bank. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said it was a welcome end to an episode from which his bank had learned important lessons. He had asked for the investigation to clear NatWest's name, after criticism of it during the 1991 Blue Arrow trial. Mr Tom Frost, NatWest deputy chairman who had been accused of misleading the 1989 inquiry, said: 'I am glad that the record has finally been put straight.' Also cleared of misconduct was Wilde Sapte, the firm of solicitors which advised NatWest during the original DTI inquiry. Details, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

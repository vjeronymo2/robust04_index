			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exco floats with Pounds 220m tag Exco, the money broking arm of the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth group, is proceeding with its flotation, despite the softening demand for new issues and the slowing of activity in the fixed income securities markets. The company will offer up to Pounds 110m of shares, primarily comprising B&amp;C's 40 per cent stake, and the flotation is expected to value the company at about Pounds 220m. The company, which derives half of its profits from money broking and half from fixed income securities trading, is forecasting pre-tax profits growth of at least 21 per cent at the interim stage. This follows what Mr Ron Sandler, chief executive, described as an 'exceptional first quarter', due to increased interest rates in the US and political uncertainty in Japan. He said this would not be carried through for the year, but 1993 earnings should be 'satisfactory'. Exco will be only the second pure money broking and securities company on the stock market, along with Trio. Money broking is a competitive and volatile business, and Exco's issue price will reflect this, with a likely p/e ratio of between 9.5 and 10.5. However, the shares should offer a yield of more than 5 per cent. Exco has achieved substantial earnings growth over the past three years, in the face of an increasingly competitive market place. The trend for money broking commissions has been steadily downwards. In addition, foreign exchange trading - one third of 1993 money broking profits  -has seen a loss of market share to direct trading between the banks. However, Mr Sandler said the broker market for foreign exchange continued to grow in absolute terms, while the group has benefited from the explosive growth in derivative products. The flotation price will be announced on June 29, and dealings are due to commence on July 19. Up to half the company's shares will be offered through a placing and public offer.</p>

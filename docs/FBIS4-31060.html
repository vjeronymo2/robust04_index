About half of  the recorded fall is attributed to the food and tobacco  industry. In the first quarter of 1994 the output of the economy  fell by 2.4 percent as compared with the same quarter in 1993.  The NSI calculated inflation from the start of the year until  the end of April at almost 42 percent: food commodities rose in  price by 48 percent, nonfood goods by 41.3 percent, and services  by 24.9 percent. NSI official Velichka Rangelova predicts that  1994 inflation will exceed 50 percent in May. She explains that  this means that even if the dollar exchange rate is maintained,  which is doubtful, 1994 inflation will certainly be higher than  in the previous year. If the dollar rises, inflation is likely  to exceed 100 percent, which wOULD be a severe blow.

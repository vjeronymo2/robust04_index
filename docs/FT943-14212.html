			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sage enhances market position with acquisition Sage Group, the Newcastle-based accounting software company, has significantly enhanced its market position and product portfolio through the acquisition of Multisoft Financial Systems for an initial Pounds 4m in cash. Sage will make additional payments to the vendors of up to a maximum of Pounds 2.5m subject to sales performance in the period up to September 30 next year. The acquisition, which will be paid for out of cash balances, will supplement Sage's traditional market strength in providing personal computer accounting software mainly for small businesses. Multisoft is a leading supplier of accounting and business software for medium and larger companies and is currently developing a new range of software designed to be run on the 'open-system' client/server networks which are being rapidly introduced in larger companies. This new software will be launched later this year. Commenting on the deal, Mr David Goldman, Sage's chairman, said, 'We regard the acquisition of Multisoft as being very important in terms of our overall strategy. This move consolidates our coverage of the UK accounting market. I am particularly excited about the client/server capability which Multisoft will bring to the group.' The accounting software market for multi-user network systems for medium and larger companies is characterised by more expensive, higher added-value products which are tailored to the needs of the customer. There is no dominant supplier in this large segment of the market at present. Multisoft, which employs 72 people in Alton, Hampshire, was set up in 1983 and was the subject of a management buy-out in 1990. It has an installed client base of more than 8,000, of which 45 per cent are companies with annual turnover of more than Pounds 8m. In the year to June 30, Multisoft's operating profits grew sharply to 'not less than' Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 58,000) on sales of about Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.48m). The net assets being acquired have a book value of Pounds 1.2m.</p>

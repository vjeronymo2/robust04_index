			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (7): World's fifth city - The population boom has put strains on Seoul WHEN Seoul marks its 600th anniversary as the Korean national capital in 1994, it will also be celebrating its position as the fifth biggest city in the world with a population approaching 11m. The city's role as an important Asian urban centre is expected to grow during the next decade, especially if the two Koreas are reunited. By 2001, its inhabitants are expected to number 14m. But Seoul's phenomenal and rapid expansion since the end of the Korean war in 1953 has brought a host of urban ills in its wake. 'Our biggest problems are transportation, housing, pollution and refuse collection,' says Seoul Mayor Rhee Hai-won. Those problems stem from the population explosion the city has experienced in the past 35 years. While the city's population stood at 1.5m in 1955, it swelled rapidly thereafter as the country embarked on a massive industrialisation programme, with factories concentrated in the main cities. As early as 1963, the population had already doubled to 3m and the city's boundaries were also doubled to accommodate the inflow of people moving from rural areas. The result was the transformation of Seoul from a compact city of traditional one-storey wooden houses into an urban sprawl dominated by high-rise buildings and the brownish haze of air pollution. In the process, Seoul has lived up to its name, which means capital in Korean, by becoming the focal point for all aspects of Korean society. The greater Seoul region, which also includes the port city of Inchon and other towns in the surrounding province of Kyonggi, has more than 18m people, accounting for almost 45 per cent of the South Korean population. The region is responsible for more than half of the national economic output, with 60 per cent of the country's industrial facilities located there. Besides being the political, corporate, financial and media capital of South Korea, the Seoul region has almost three-fifths of the nation's universities and close to half its theatres. The speed of the city's growth has defeated earlier attempts to control its development. Urban planning 'was difficult because conditions were changing so quickly,' explains Mayor Rhee. The city adopted in 1990 a master plan that establishes guidelines until the turn of the century. But the possibility of unification could also render these proposals obsolete since it could lead to changes in population growth and a shift in expansion to areas north of the city. The fastest growing area of Seoul since the 1970s has been the Kangnam region south of the Han river, which bisects the city as the Thames does London. While 80 per cent of Seoulites lived in the Kangbuk district north of the Han in 1966, the city's population is now evenly divided between both sides of the river. The construction of the stadia and other facilities south of the Han for 1988 Olympic Games helped accelerate the population move across the river, while transforming Kangnam into the preferred residential area for the city's middle class. The development of Kangnam has been accompanied by efforts to create specialised districts within the area that would form the core for several satellite communities. For example, most national government offices have been moved to Kwachon, just south of the city boundary. The city has built 400,000 housing units, most of them south of the Han, in the last three years, raising the total number of housing units in the city to 1.68m. Another 900,000 housing units are planned to be built by 2001 as demand increases due to the disappearance of the extended family living under one roof. Officials, however, hope that the city's population may reach only 12m, instead of the projected 14m, by the turn of the century if more people are encouraged to live outside the city's boundaries. One means of further dispersing the population would be the construction of a high-speed rail link between Seoul and Pusan. This would bring the cities of Chonan and Taejon within 40 minutes' commuting distance of Seoul and make them more attractive places to live for those working in the capital. But Seoul must still solve its transport problems, which now make commuting a nightmare. Its roads are inadequate to handle the vehicles that carry 75 per cent of the passenger traffic within the city. Congestion is becoming worse as the number of cars reaches 1.4m, although half of the 18m daily commuting trips in Seoul are still made on buses. 'Our most important project in the 1990s is to expand the subway system and make it the main means of travelling in the city,' says Mr Chang Seok Hyo, director of the city planning division of the Seoul Metropolitan Authority. The four lines of the Seoul subway, with 168.5km of track, now carry 25 per cent of the city's passenger traffic. Another four lines will be added by 1996 at a cost of Won6.6 trillion, increasing the size of the system to 332.6km. This should handle about half of the passenger traffic. The addition of a further 120km of track by 2001, which will make the Seoul system as extensive as Tokyo's and one of the largest in the world, will raise its share of passenger traffic to 75 per cent, the same as that now handled by the Tokyo network. But the system is already overwhelmed during rush hours, with passengers squeezed into carriages. Officials hope to add more carriages to trains and introduce more frequent services. Improved maintenance of carriages and the subway's power system will reduce delays. But the importance of the subway system goes beyond reducing road traffic. The future growth of Seoul will be planned around it, with stations serving as the nuclei for new residential neighbourhoods. The subway will be connected to commuter rail lines, which also need to be expanded to reach outlying districts. The city hopes to confine more road traffic to the suburbs and plans to build several circular roads to keep vehicles outside the centre. Another proposal to reduce surface traffic is the construction of four long road tunnels underneath central Seoul that would allow drivers to go quickly from one end of the city to the other. The Won2.4 trillion project, however, has been criticised as wasteful. 'There is opposition to it on both safety and environmental grounds,' concedes Mayor Rhee, 'but I believe that the critics are wrong.' The city plans to start construction of the first tunnel in the second half of 1993. The reduction of road traffic is seen as one means to lower air pollution levels. The Seoul master plan also calls for moving industrial plants away from the city. Other anti-pollution measures include replacing coal and oil as an energy source with liquid natural gas. Water quality will be improved with the construction of new reservoirs and sewage treatment plants. This follows the cleaning up of the Han River.</p>

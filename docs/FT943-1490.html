			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nokia rides the worldwide airwaves boom - The Finnish company is taking on Japan In August 1992, shortly after being appointed Nokia chief executive, Mr Jorma Ollila returned home from a management brainstorming session and wrote down the four phrases which he saw as the key to the company's future. They were 'telecom-oriented', 'global', 'focus', and 'value-added'. Two years on, nobody can accuse Mr Ollila of not sticking to his own brief. The 44-year-old former Citibank executive has focused the group very firmly on telecommunications, and Nokia has developed an increasingly global profile. It is also difficult to argue with the results. As sales have soared, the group has surged back to profit. Even more spectacularly, the group's share price has risen more than 12-fold and, with a market capitalisation of more than FM40bn (Dollars 8.15bn), it accounts for almost 23 per cent of the value of the Helsinki stock exchange. Its star position in the Finnish corporate landscape is highlighted by the cluster of mature slow-growth forestry and engineering industries surrounding it. Is the success down to luck or judgment? Like a surf-rider catching a rolling wave, Nokia happens to have caught the mobile telecommunications boom at just the right time. As the world's second-biggest supplier of mobile phones after Motorola of the US, it has benefited from a surge in global handset sales from 3m in 1982 to 14m last year and to an estimated 25m in 1994. It is also the world's second-largest supplier of digital cellular equipment after Sweden's Ericsson. When explaining the group's rebound, Mr Ollila says external market conditions and the group's focus on certain market segments have been as important as technical innovation. 'The two things which have helped us most have been the entry of new operators into the cellular market and the shift from analogue to digital,' he says. One measure of the group's success is that it has a near-20 per cent share of the world mobile phones market. This means it will supply around 5m phones in 1994, double last year's figure. Another indication of its confidence is its early move into the Japanese market, where it is aiming to capture a 25 per cent share of the digital phone business by 1996. Nokia became the first European manufacturer to enter the Japanese market earlier this year, and it claims to be offering the smallest and lightest handset on the market as well as the only one that carries both English and Japanese characters. Indeed, Nokia's increase in world market share has been to a large extent at the expense of Japanese rather than western rivals. The group's 20 per cent share of the mobile phone market is now not far short of the 26 per cent held by all of Japan's mobile phone manufacturers together. Telecommunications today accounts for more than 60 per cent of group sales, compared with as little as 14 per cent 10 years ago. This dominance is increasing all the time because the group's core telecom businesses are growing at 50 per cent a year, while growth in its other activities - consumer electronics, cable and machinery, tyres and power - is virtually flat. The consumer electronics operations, in particular, have brought Nokia considerable pain in the last two years, culminating in a divisional loss of FM747m last year. Considerable restructuring, including the closure of the group's picture tubes operations, has helped to turn the business round and it is on course to return to the black in the final four months of the year. Despite the prospect of low growth, it is likely that the consumer electronics operations will be retained, assisting the group's ambitions to build a presence in multi-media. But even here, Mr Ollila does not over-stress the synergies between the telecom and consumer electronics side of the business, noting that it is an 'interesting link but not a crucial one'. As for the rest of the group's non-telecom activities, Mr Ollila says bluntly that he is prepared to devote no more than an hour of his attention a month to them. He emphasises that Nokia has no intention of investing heavily in any of its businesses which do not have a clear telecom link. They will either be sold or retained and run on a cash-flow basis. Can the group's out-performance continue? Mr Ollila is optimistic about the short term, saying 'our order book, our market position and our products vis-a-vis our competitors give us a tremendous confidence about the next 18 months'. He is comfortable with analysts' predictions suggesting earnings per share of FM30 this year against FM12.3 in 1993. Further ahead, the worry is not just about competitors' technological innovation. The company fears that a spurt of undisciplined growth could make it more bureaucratic and less able to respond with speed and flexibility to market demands. 'We must be able to manage our growth,' says Mr Ollila. He predicts that 'the 1990s and early 21st century will be the era of the medium-sized company. It is the big companies which will be slower to move'. If this proves correct, one of his main tasks will be to ensure that Nokia itself does not become a sluggish juggernaut in the slow lane.</p>

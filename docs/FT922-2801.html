			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / City urges release of secret retail data LEADING City economists have called on the government to release weekly retail sales figures sent secretly to the Treasury which they say could give extra economic insight to financial markets. The economists say the government's access to the statistics mean that it has additional up-to-date information which is not available to the City when making judgments about areas such as interest rates. They say the weekly sales information - supplied by a group of about 30 large retailers - should be more widely available to help the public debate about the strength of any economic upturn. Mr Peter Spencer, group chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, said the figures should be published to help establish a 'level playing field' for the government and financial markets. Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned bank, said the statistics gave the Treasury a 'small additional leverage' when making decisions. Mr Roger Bootle, chief UK economist at stockbroker Greenwell Montagu, said he could see no reason for the data being kept secret. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment firm, said the lack of wide dissemination of the data did not 'help to make policy-making more transparent'. Apart from the Treasury, the only groups which receive the data are the retailers in the project, which is organised by the British Retailing Consortium, a trade body. Companies involved in the scheme include Kingfisher, Dixons, Burton, Boots and Sears. The consortium said it hoped ultimately to sell the information to anyone who wanted it. Some retailers, however, felt the figures might be commercially sensitive.</p>

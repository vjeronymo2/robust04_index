			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Insurers win accounting exemption INSURANCE companies have been made exempt from some requirements of FRS 3, the new accounting standard on the profit and loss account, through a change published yesterday. The action, the first modification of a published financial reporting standard issued by the Accounting Standards Board, reflects the concern of insurers that compliance would have forced radical changes to their accounts twice within three years. FRS 3 is imposing a fundamental change in many companies' accounts, but insurance companies also face modifications as a result of new legislation on their accounts to be introduced following a European Community directive. The amendment for insurance companies and groups will exempt them from calculating gains and losses on disposals of investments by reference to their carrying amount in the accounts, and from showing any gains and losses in the profit and loss account or statement of total recognised gains and losses. The change will be reconsidered once details of the new EC insurance company accounts legislation - to be circulated by the DTI - are known. The proposals were first highlighted in Fred 5, a draft accounting standard issued in March this year. Amendment to FRS 3: Reporting Financial Performance: Insurance Companies.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The  Japan committee for support to the independent and peaceful  reunification of Korea issued a statement May 13 in protest  against police search of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon).    The statement branded the recent search of the Osaka  Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branch offices by  1,000 police in Osaka as an ill-boding high-handed act which  shows the legal status of the Koreans in Japan is not guaranteed  at all in Japan.    "It is intolerable that unreasonable police repression was  committed against the Koreans in Japan who should have enjoyed  special protection by Japanese authorities for historical  reasons," said the statement, urging the government to take  measures to immediately revoke police search of Chongnyon.    "Since the prime minister of Japan declared at the Diet that  he repented of Japan's past invasion and colonial rule over  Korea, the cabinet is committed to carry the repentance into  practice under the eyes of the people," the statement said.    "The Japanese Government must renounce the hostile policy  toward the DPRK, stop inciting national chauvinism and remember  that its task is not the military policy for imaginary  `emergency in Korea' but normalisation of diplomatic relations  between Japan and the DPRK."    The statement called for extending throughout the nation the  protest campaign against Japanese authorities' repression of  Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan.</p>

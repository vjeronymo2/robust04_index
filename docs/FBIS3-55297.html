Over the  past six years the volume of annual extraction has declined by  over 210 million tonnes. In the past two years the steepness of  the spiral of decline has been characterized by the following  indicators: a decline of 60 million tonnes in 1992 and of a  further 50 million tonnes last year. In brief, the sector is in  a deep crisis.    Why? The whole point is that there can be no talk of one  single reason: Problems have mingled and settled one on top of  another. It is scarcely possible to emerge swiftly and  painlessly from beneath their heavy weight.    First of all we must consider that the quality of the  sector's raw material base has changed -- and not for the  better. The highly productive stocks in local deposits have to  a considerable extent already been worked out, and this is the  primary reason for the intensive reduction in extraction.  Virtually the entire array of oil boreholes has had to be  transferred from the gusher method to mechanized methods of  extraction. It is the turn of the mass commissioning of  low-yielding deposits. The result is a drastic increase in  demand for material and financial resources for the sector's  development.    These increased demands have, unfortunately, come up against  an opposite trend -- a reduction in centralized capital  investments in the development of oil extraction. The year of  maximum extraction, 1988, has by an irony of fate become the  last year in which sufficient funds were earmarked for drilling.  Budget investments were a fair, albeit partial, compensation  for the extremely low prices for oil. Through this policy the  much-maligned administrative edict system nonetheless kept the  sector afloat. The drastic cutting off of budget capital  investments can only be described as a crime, with subsequent  aggravating relapses.    The shortage of finance has meant a reduction in the volume  of investments in the development of deposits, which has led in  particular to the curtailment of drilling work. Thus the volume  of operational drilling for oil has declined from 36 million  meters in 1988 to 20 million meters in 1992, that is it has  nearly halved. The pace of commissioning new deposits and the  provision of wellhead facilities have declined. Because of the  lack of technical and financial assets over 30,000 boreholes are  standing idle, and the necessary operating regimes are not being  ensured at operating wells.    There are also problems of a geopolitical nature, connected  with the big economic and political upheavals in the economies  of the former Union and Russia. Links have been disrupted  between enterprises, and without them the sector's material  resource provision is being disrupted. The breakdown of  traditional contacts with Azerbaijan and Ukraine, on whose  territory the majority of USSR plants producing oil industry  equipment and oil pipes for the entire country were located, has  been a disaster. When will Russia develop a similar industry of  its own?    Not all sources of problems should be sought in the past --  some are emerging now. The sector's plight is being aggravated  by mistakes in the price and tax policies being pursued in the  course of economic reforms. These have not allowed oil industry  enterprises to obtain a sufficient volume of funds of their own  to make up for the centralized budget investments which the  sector used to use for its development. The shortage of  financial resources is fatally compounded by the overall crisis  of nonpayment in the economy, whereby our enterprises, because  of the rapid pace of inflation, take a long time to obtain money  for the output they dispatch. The scale of the nonpayment  problem -- debts to the fuel and energy complex are building up  in an avalanche and are already approaching 10 trillion rubles  -- of course greatly exceeds all others. At any rate, were it  not for nonpayment many financial difficulties would have been  overcome independently by the sector. Now it is in an impasse.    We should not pin hopes on the introduction of promissory  notes. To whom should we present a promissory note? To the  municipal services, to whom we are obliged to supply energy  resources despite their inability to pay? Or to the industrial  enterprises whose fixed capital is worth several times less than  its debts? The process has gone so far that measures  characteristic of an efficient market economy are no help here.    As a result of the simultaneous operation of these and other  adverse factors, the accumulation and mingling of problems  continues. It is not only oil extraction which is in decline --  the entire oil industry is experiencing a slump and crisis is  paralyzing the oil supply system. A paradoxical situation has  taken shape: While we are grieving over the drastic decline in  production we are unable to sell readily the oil we have already  obtained.    Export deliveries are being disrupted. For instance, as of  24 November we had failed to deliver over 2 million tonnes of  oil on schedule. At Novorossiysk, where our main terminal is  located, we have been hampered by stormy weather, but in Ukraine  and Belarus it is not just the elements that call the tune. We  have been obliged to restrict deliveries to them because of  chronic nonpayment. Once they encounter a few frosts they  sometimes take advantage of the fact that oil pipelines cross  their territory and try to lay hands on oil that does not belong  to them, that is, they are simply starting to steal it. Thus in  Belarus, in the Mozyr region, 112,000 tonnes of oil were  recently stolen in a few days.    There are many problems connected with oil storage in Russia  itself. Right now there is no room for nearly 3 million tonnes.  A crisis has overtaken oil refining. Over the first 10 months  of last year its volume declined by 31 million tonnes compared  with the same period in 1992. The production of automobile  gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil was respectively 84, 84.3, and  88.1 percent of the same period in 1992.    Another result of nonpayment has been the overstocking of  oil  refineries. They are not taking new raw material. According to  a situation report for one particular day (24 November) five oil  refineries turned away over 45,000 tonnes of oil. For instance,  the "Angarsknefteorgsintez" association (and that means a little  over 30,000 tonnes) refused deliveries completely. The Saratov  oil refinery refused Kazakhstan oil: It cannot even "digest"  its own Russian crude: Since the start of the year it has  turned away 181,000 tonnes.    The nonpayment problem, while objectively destabilizing the  operation of the finely tuned system of oil and oil refinery  product supply, is also pernicious in that ordinary  extravagance, inefficiency, and carelessness are hidden in its  shadow. One way or another -- even under conditions of the  constant reduction of extraction -- the transport pipeline  network is constantly being overloaded. For instance, in the  course of 24 hours we accepted 890,000 tonnes of oil but were  able to distribute only about 850,000 tonnes, and the rest had  to be left in the system. This counterwave ultimately surges  back to the operating boreholes and may be said to lash them.  That is why they have to be brought to a standstill.    Will anyone see one of the most serious problems behind such  chaos -- the extremely low yield of the oil reservoirs? And is  now the time to worry about it? Despite everything, now is the  time; because if we do not solve it, there is no future, there  are no prospects. Can we really consent to leaving over half of  the petroleum underground? This is impermissible now. After  all, in the future we will have to bore deeper and deeper,  overcoming the increasingly complex geological structure of the  earth's interior. Developing such reserves requires the use of  expensive new equipment, the creation of efficient methods of  increasing the oil yield of productive strata.    Raising the oil yield of the strata thus becomes a strategic  sphere of scientific-technical progress in the sector and  another very important condition of the stabilization and  development of oil extraction. That is precisely why, as more  and more new deposits with reserves which are difficult to  extract are put into exploitation, the scale of testing and the  industrial use of hydrodynamic, chemical, thermal, and gas  methods of increasing the oil yield is growing. Russia has at  its disposal practically all the technologies which are  currently used extensively worldwide. Laboratory research and  industrial testing of unconventional methods of bed stimulation  are also being developed -- vibration-seismic, biotechnological,  and intrastratal generation of working agents.    Since the future of oil extraction is determined by the  application and growth in efficiency of new methods and  technologies, an analysis of the dynamics of this process is  relevant. At present over 20 methods of increasing the oil  yield and over 130 technologies for implementing them are being  applied at experimental and industrial level. Work connected  with them is being conducted at 333 facilities, and over 5  billion tonnes of initial reserves of oil are involved here. In  1992 an extra 33 million tonnes of oil were extracted as a  result of the application of methods for increasing the oil  yield of the strata, including: 24.3 million tonnes from  hydrodynamic methods of stimulation, 6.7 million tonnes from  physical-chemical methods, 1.5 million from thermal methods, and  0.5 million tonnes from gas methods.    The speed at which oil extraction is increaased as a result  of applying the aforementioned methods will depend on the  relationship between the favorable and hindering factors.  Experts are making the following predictions for additional  extraction from applying the new methods: 10-20 million tonnes  by the year 2000, and 20-40 million tonnes by 2010.    So what is hindering us from making full use of the  advantages of the new methods and technologies of raising the  oil yield of the strata? Apart from the shortage of technical  resources and chemical materials, the high proportionate  exploitation costs and capital expense involved in utilizing  them have raised serious obstacles. These are far higher than  in traditional methods of oil extraction. Measures of a  legislative and normative nature are needed, aimed at economic  incentives for the application of efficient new methods of  raising the oil yield of deposits. These measures would enable  us to raise a whole stratum of problems, such as the financing  of scientific-research and experimental-design work in the  creation of new technologies and technical resources and the  development of the material-technical base of institutes  involved in the creation of the new methods. The main thing,  however, is that prospects will be opened up for increasing the  oil yield from deposits with reserves that are difficult of  access.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Tzu-yen (3076 1311 0917): "Lu Ping and Zhou Nan </F> Fight `War of Words' in Shenzhen and Hong Kong"]    [Text] Last Friday evening [4 March], Lu Ping, director of  the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended  the annual Hong Kong and Macao regional meeting of the  International Rotary Club, at which he delivered a long speech  with an emotional color. In a curious coincidence, Zhou Nan,  director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, also made a speech at a  ceremony held in Hong Kong on the morning of the same day, at  which letters of appointment were conferred on regional affairs  advisers. The next day, many newspapers in Hong Kong gave wide  coverage to the content of Lu's speech. The media also made  favorable comments and some people even described it as Lu's  "most pleasant" speech since taking office. As for Zhou's  speech, which was delivered along the "diplomatic line," other  major newspapers, with the exception of some leftist papers,  mentioned it only briefly.    It is extremely rare for the two senior Chinese leaders in  charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs to fight a "war of words"  on the same day. Viewed from the angle of reporting and the  media, it is clear that Lu Ping has won this round. Most Hong  Kong media, however, seem to treat Lu's speech in Shenzhen as a  propaganda stunt aimed at reassuring Hong Kong people, but  readers who are truly familiar with CPC internal operations  should be able to see that Lu made the speech with something in  mind and that it has profound significance.    First, in his speech Lu did not criticize or struggle  against  the British and Chris Patten with a "clear-cut stand" as Zhou  Nan did. Instead of touching on the current Sino-British  tensions and fierce argument, he talked glibly about the  prospects and expectations entertained by the Chinese side and  himself for Hong Kong's bright future, stressing that Hong Kong  would continue to preserve its role as a bridge of capitalism  beyond 1997. The moderate tone is clearly different from the  tough approach taken by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, but tallies with the government work  report delivered by Li Peng at the National People's Congress  session. Obviously, Lu Ping's speech is more in keeping with  the latest spirit of the Chinese leadership on the Hong Kong  issue than Zhou Nan's.  <H5>  Lu Ping Boldly Criticizes Chinese Officials </H5>   Second, in Shenzhen, Lu Ping again raised the slogan of  "Hong  Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of  self-government." Raised in 1982, when the Chinese side worked  out their initial plan for recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong  and regarded as a basic principle Deng Xiaoping's concept of  "one country, two systems," the slogan has not been mentioned  for a long time. After the 4 June Incident, the Chinese side  talked only about "recovering sovereignty," but not of "Hong  Kong people ruling Hong Kong and a high degree of  self-government." However, when enunciating the specific  embodiments of this policy in Shenzhen, Lu quoted many policies  and principles that the Chinese side repeatedly stressed in  those years and in the drafting of which he had a personal hand.    Of all in-service cadres in the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office and even in the entire Chinese Government system, Lu Ping  was the longest-serving official involved in Hong Kong and Macao  affairs. Although there are others more senior than he, they  have "joined the ranks halfway," and although some have worked  longer than he, they have either retired or have been  transferred to other posts. In 1981, when China decided to  study the issue of recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong, Lu was  selected by Liao Chengzhi, then director of the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, and appointed head of a three-man research  group, and so began to get involved in Hong Kong and Macao  affairs. Since then, he has established an indissoluble bond  with the Hong Kong and Macao region. The 13-character principle  on recovering Hong Kong's sovereignty which was studied and  worked out by the group later became China's basic policy in  handling the Hong Kong issue and was incorporated into the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. However, most  cadres now taking charge of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs,  including Zhou Nan, do not quite understand the process in which  these basic policies were deliberated and formulated. Nor do  they know the careful consideration of the Chinese policemakers  of the older generation. Perhaps for this reason, in his  capacity as one experienced in this respect, Lu Ping boldly  criticized some Chinese officials, "including some senior  cadres," saying they do not quite understand the Basic Law and  that "their statements do not tally with the Basic Law."    It has been learned that a substantial number of people in  the Chinese hierarchy have always taken exception to the tough  policy adopted by the authorities toward Hong Kong, holding that  many of the current practices run counter to the policy when  China originally planned to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong.  On many occasions they called on the top leadership to "set  things to rights and make a thorough overhaul," but these views  have never been accepted and even have been suppressed. The  fact that Lu wittingly reaffirmed previous principles and  policies in Shenzhen seems to show that the "non-mainstream"  views have been accepted by the top leadership.  <H3>  Two Major Leftist Papers in Hong Kong Delete Lu Ping's  Statement </H3>   What is strange, however, is that the two major leftist  newspapers in Hong Kong dealt with the speeches of Lu Ping and  Zhou Nan in a way that gives people much food for thought.  Although WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO carried the full text of  their speeches the following day, both put Zhou's speech on the  front page, as if by prior agreement. Lu's speech, however, was  placed in an non- prominent position on page four. WEN WEI PO  even handled Lu's speech as an ordinary contribution by placing  it after the opinion page.    What is more, the two newspapers deleted some of the content  of Lu's speech. When saying that some statements by Chinese  officials did not tally with the Basic Law, Lu explicitly said  that some Chinese officials, "including some senior officials,  do not quite understand the Basic Law, either." However, this  remark was deleted by the two papers. Moreover, toward the end  of his speech Lu Ping left the text of his speech to air his  view on the post-1997 Hong Kong airport issue and the future  political structure. Being quite liberal, this passage was  quite acceptable to Hong Kong people, but it was deleted by the  two papers altogether.    What is the reason behind this alteration? This writer dares  not make a presumptuous judgment, but ordinarily the leftist  papers must seek instructions from the propaganda department of  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY before dealing with such important  manuscripts.</p>

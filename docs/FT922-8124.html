			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor upbeat on growth aims BRITAIN'S return to economic growth would become 'firmly established' in 1992, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons last night. Confidently predicting a further reduction in inflation he said: 'We have a once-in-a-generation chance to push towards price stability'. The chancellor hoped for an increase in demand as the tax cuts made in the March Budget reached pay packets next week, and home-buyers used the extra money at their disposal through reductions in mortgage interest payments. He expected some of the increase in disposable incomes would 'feed through into higher consumer spending'. Mr Lamont's optimism contrasted with the judgment of Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and front runner in Labour's leadership contest, who, on the final day of the debate on the Queen's Speech, led an attack on the government's continuing failure to halt the rise in unemployment. The chancellor also came under fire from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, over his refusal to state the year in which the objective of returning to a balanced budget 'in the medium term' would be achieved. Mr Lamont stressed that he was not 'altering in any way' the forecast of a Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement in the current financial year. The published figures for the PSBR in subsequent years - including the Pounds 32bn for 1993-94 - were 'assumptions' and not forecasts. The chancellor claimed that the projection for the last year covered by the table in the Budget Red Book - which Mr Kinnock emphasised was Pounds 6bn - was 'very close to balance indeed'. Mr Lamont said the uncertainty caused by the possibility of a Labour victory in the general election had held back company investment and orders, and subdued consumer demand. Now the message from forward-looking surveys of business and consumer confidence was clear, and the stock market and foreign exchange markets had signalled their renewed confidence in the government's policies. He emphasised,too, that with last week's  1/2 percentage point cut in bank rate the differential between British and German interest rates had been reduced from about 7 per cent to just a quarter of one per cent, lower than at any time in the past decade. Thanks to the government's refusal to bow to short-term pressures, Britain's inflation performance had improved out of all recognition, he said. Underlying producer-output price inflation was lower than at any time since the early 1970s, and he expected it to fall to below 2 per cent in 1993. The chancellor emphasised the need to control public expenditure, but Mr Smith deplored the lack of any reference in the Queen's Speech to unemployment and the recession, and accused Tory MPs of being interested only in 'the level of their shares on the Stock Exchange'. He said the government had failed to foster the manufacturing sector - the wealth-producing sector of the economy. To taunts from Tory backbenchers over the outcome of the election, Mr Smith said Labour's defeat did not alter the fact that investment was falling, unemployment rising and that the government had failed to support industry. He warned that Britain had no future as a low cost, low-skilled 'bargain-basement economy'.</p>

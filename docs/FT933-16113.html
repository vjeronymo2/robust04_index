			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Simpler reporting regime suggested THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is considering plans to approve a simpler set of financial reporting requirements for smaller British companies. The initiative is designed to ease the burden on companies which would find the board's new standards costly, and for which the public interest in compliance is less essential. It reflects concern from many companies that they will have difficulties in implementing the ambitious and controversial programme of new standards launched by the board. Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, wrote this year suggesting the idea to the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies, the body owned by the leading pro-fessional accountancy bodies. He said he hoped it would canvass the views of practitioners and smaller companies, and possibly commission research on the topic. The idea of a separate set of generally accepted accounting principles for companies of different sizes has been debated in many countries, but few have yet adopted such proposals. The Accounting Standards Board allowed smaller companies to be temporarily exempt from FRS 1, its standard on the cashflow statement which became mandatory last year. Smaller companies are already exempt from supplying all but summary financial information in the returns they are required to make public each year at Companies House, the government's corporate information agency.</p>

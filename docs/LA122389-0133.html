			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE SUDDEN RETURN OF SINGER LEAVES CHORUS FOR 'HOLIDAY AT THE POPS' OUT IN THE  COLD  </P> <P> A chorus of local singers, most of them members of the Irvine Camerata, got  coals in their stockings from the Pacific Symphony this Christmas.  </P> <P> The group of 24 professional singers, dubbed the Holiday Chorus in press  releases, was hastily assembled to fill in on the orchestra's "Holiday at the  Pops" program after originally scheduled singer Maureen McGovern bowed out to  appear in a Broadway production of Kurt Weill's "The Three Penny Opera."  </P> <P> But this week, the singers were just as hastily dropped from the program when  McGovern suddenly found herself free after all, with the early closing of the  much-panned show, which starred rock singer Sting.  </P> <P> "Holiday at the Pops" was scheduled to be offered Friday and repeats tonight at  the Orange County Performing Arts Center. The 24 singers dropped from the  program will not be paid the agreed-on $200-per-person concert fee, but each  was offered a pair of tickets to one of the performances, according to Bruce  Bales, assistant director of the Irvine Camerata.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of very disgruntled singers," Bales said. Many turned down  other paying gigs during this most lucrative of seasons for singers, while some  purchased concert tickets for family and friends or changed travel plans.  </P> <P> Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's executive director, said through a spokesman  that the Pacific regretted any inconvenience to the singers. Some orchestra  subscribers were unhappy when McGovern originally canceled, he said, and when  she became available again, "we had to make every effort" to get her back on  the program and said there was not enough time on the program to include the  chorus.  </P> <P> Bales had provided the Pacific with a list of singers in mid-November and  conducted an informal rehearsal.  </P> <P> Singers had learned about 30 minutes' worth of music, including two songs in  Spanish. Some did not learn that they were being dropped from the program until  Wednesday, the day they were to have their first major rehearsal. Bales said he  understands the orchestra's decision to put McGovern back on the program (she  was advertised as the concert's star attraction when tickets went on sale) and  realizes that the Pacific had the sudden situation "dumped in their laps."  Still, he said, "it really has been unfair to the singers."  </P></p>

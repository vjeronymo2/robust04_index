At first the story was put about that the tragedy occurred  as  the result of mortar fire, allegedly from positions held by  Serbian armed formations. Later, when the real scale of this  inhuman carnage began to become apparent, people started saying  that the fire might not have come from Serbian positions but  from some others. Then they started saying that the series of  explosions occurred right on the spot as the result of charges  which had been laid earlier and which someone (but who?!) set  off.    It is beyond doubt that, whoever was to blame for this  tragedy, this killer (or killers) must be punished and appear  before a court. Is this not the reason why the international  tribunal in The Hague for crimes against the person on territory  in the former Yugoslavia was set up? Only I believe that this  killer will never be found. There are several points which  cause me to think along these lines.    Right after the tragedy, the Serbian side in Bosnia issued a  statement in which it urged the holding of an international  investigation into the crime that had been committed and  guaranteed unimpeded access to the site for international  experts. Why would it do this if some people accuse precisely  it of the tragedy?    There are other disconcerting points. This is not the first  such instance, you know. More than a year ago, also in  Sarajevo, a shell allegedly fired from a tank gun killed 20  people and injured dozens of peaceful residents at a bus stop  close to the market in the Muslim districts. Then too there  were demands for the Serb tankman who allegedly drove up to that  spot and fired the shot to be called to account. There were  calls for NATO aircraft to start bombing Serbian positions  without delay. Then it turned out that neither the tank nor the  mythical Serbian tankman had existed. The author of that  tragedy was never found.    It cannot escape your notice that both these events occurred  on the eve of the conclusion of peace talks among the three  warring sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time the talks  were wrecked.    By the beginning of 1994 the Serbs and Croats had virtually  completely agreed their positions and displayed readiness to end  hostilities. The Muslim side had also begun to voice  satisfaction with the talks. The very dangerous military  conflict at the center of Europe seemed to be finally  approaching a peaceful outcome. But suddenly (suddenly?) the  position of the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership hardened, and  it demanded territorial concessions from the Serbs and Croats.  In the end, the concessions were made. The talks were led out  of the impasse. But the Muslim side again, for the umpteenth  time, pulled out of the talks process and left Geneva virtually  without advancing any new terms at all, but demanding that the  West make bombing strikes against Serbian positions.    Once again the impasse was being surmounted, and the Serbs,  Croats, and Muslims were to meet once again in Geneva 10  February to continue the peace talks process. The tragedy in  Sarajevo could prevent that meeting.    But who would benefit from wrecking the peace talks even at  the cost of spilling a lot of blood of Sarajevo's peaceful  residents? This is the hardest question. In any case it is  perfectly obvious that neither the Serbs, nor the Croats, nor  the Muslim leadership itself benefit from the talks being  wrecked.    There is evidently still someone who cannot stomach the  possible peaceful outcome of the Balkan conflict. It is this  "someone" who is resorting to provocations, not afraid of blood.  It seems to me that he must be sought not among those who are  already tired of fighting and shedding their blood. The  shortest way to find him could be to ascertain just who is  constantly pressuring the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership and  compelling it to walk out of the talks time after time. But  this, so it seems to me, is a matter for the international  tribunal in The Hague.</p>

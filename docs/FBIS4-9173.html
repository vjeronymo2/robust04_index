			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by R. Barjaktarevic: "Montenegro Is Not a Serbian </F> State"]    [Text] Pristina -- "It is obvious that I cannot have a  favorable opinion about any proposal that turns Montenegro into  a region. This means that the proposal, which comes from  Belgrade, that would lead to Montenegro losing its statehood is  unacceptable to us. The authors of such ideas and projects are  mistaken, since Montenegrin statehood has been forged by the  nation through burdensome history, and that is why the current  Montenegrin generation has the moral duty to take a dignified  patriotic stand toward such tendencies that are aimed at  obstructing the revival of Montenegrin statehood. I regard as  frivolous all the theories about a new constitution based on  regionalization."    This is what Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic said  in an extensive interview for the Pristina ZERI.    Asked about the possibility of creating a union of Serbian  states, which would also include Montenegro, Lekic said:    "We are discussing ideas, thoughts. However, they not only  have not been discussed and verified at the official state  levels, but they have not even been defined. In any case, in  connection with our position, that is, the Montenegro's  position, there are many open questions. As for an association,  that is links between the Serb Krajina and the republic of  Srpska, I can see some difficulties in Montenegro participating  in such a creation. To start with, Montenegro is not a Serbian  state, but a state of the people who live in it, that is, a  civil state."    The Montenegrin foreign minister said that there were "no  secret connections between Montenegro and Italy," and he also  said that relations with Albania were better since "whenever I  travel abroad, I fly from the Tirana airport." As for Kosovo,  he said: "The basic thing is to start a serious dialogue, but  it is hard to say what kinds of solutions will be found. In any  case, it would be best if the solutions were to reflect the will  of all the citizens. I support certain rights for Kosovo,  autonomy, certain subjectivity."</p>

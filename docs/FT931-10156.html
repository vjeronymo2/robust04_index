			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh reforms may cost Pounds 154m REFORM of local government in Wales which will see the end of two-tier authorities will cost between Pounds 61m and Pounds 154m over 15 years, according to a report for the government by management consultants Touche Ross. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, is expected to decide in the next few weeks on the exact form of the reorganisation. The eight counties and 37 district councils are to be replaced by unitary authorities. A Welsh Office discussion paper last year suggested the 45 councils could be replaced by 15, 18, 23 or 27 unitary authorities. Touche Ross says the 15-council option would cost between Pounds 61m and Pounds 154m, and the 27-authority option would cost between Pounds 67m and Pounds 152m.</p>

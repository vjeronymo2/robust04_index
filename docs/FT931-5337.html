			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / NCP denies wanting to damage rival THE OPERATION to spy on Europarks, a business rival of National Car Parks, to obtain confidential details of its finances was never intended to damage the company, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. The objective of the operation by KAS, the private security company, was to discover whether Europarks won business using improper methods, Mr Jeremy Roberts QC, for Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS manager, said. The company's trading position was never harmed, even though Mr Gordon Layton, the NCP chief executive who ordered the operation, was in a position to do this, he said. Mr Roberts admitted that KAS had an arrogant mentality, which included thinking its staff could break the law. But Mr Hewitt took his instructions from superiors who included Sir David Stirling, the former head of the SAS. Mr Hewitt and Mr Layton both deny conspiring to defraud Europarks. The trial continues on Monday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The "Defense Issues Forum" (with Kotaro Higuchi as  chairman), a private advisory council to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, held its seventh meeting at the Prime Minister's  Official Residence on 18 April to discuss various issues such as  the current situation concerning UN peacekeeping operation (PKO)  activities and the creation of a new organization to promote PKO  participation and disarmament and arms control. As advocated by  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SPDJ] and other parties,  the argument for a new organization for PKO participation  concerns the concept of creating a new organization other than  the Self-Defense Forces.    Chairman Higuchi said that in the course of the discussions,  a majority of the panel members voiced their opposition to the  plan. For example, one said, "When the United Nation requests  the dispatch of military personnel, the military ranks of the  personnel are specified." And another said: "Even if a new  organization should be created, it would be considered by the  international community to be a military force and its members  to be servicemen. Therefore, it will not be efficient to take  the trouble to create a new organization."</p>

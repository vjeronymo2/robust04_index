			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A PUZZLING SEARCH FOR A PROPHETIC DESTINY;  </P> <P> THE HEALER BY AHARON APPELFELD TRANSLATED FROM HEBREW BY JEFFREY M. GREEN GROVE  WEIDENFELD $16.95, 184 PAGES  </P> <P> "In the autumn they arrived. The way had been long, exhausting, and toward the  end it had been beyond the mother's strength."  </P> <P> So begins Aharon Appelfeld's fable "The Healer," about the great sea change  that overtook Central Europe's Jews in the 1930s; a tidal wave that would bear  millions to death and others to salvation in Israel. It has an evident biblical  cast. Oddly, what it suggests is the Nativity story, particularly as we read of  a strangely distanced father and of the inn at which the family dismounts.  </P> <P> It is a puzzle why this Christian echo should be sounded in a story of Viennese  Jews, whose secure bourgeois status, attained after centuries of struggle, was  shattered almost in a day. Appelfeld's story is full of such puzzles, and yet  its gist is clear. If anything, it is too clear. Perhaps directness bordering  on the obvious, in a writer of such artfulness, is its ultimate puzzle.  </P> <P> Felix, a prosperous businessman, has arrived with his family, after a terrible  three-day journey by train and cart, in a remote village in the Carpathian  Mountains. It is inhabited entirely by Jews; its distinction is the presence of  an old Talmudic scholar with a reputation as a healer.  </P> <P> Felix is angry, and his anger masks a deep unsettlement. He is a believer in  science, in Western civilization and -- like many European Jews at the time --  in the possibility of full integration. But his beloved daughter, Helga, a  pianist, has fallen into a wasting depression that the doctors cannot cure. His  wife, Henrietta, has heard of the healer and stands up out of her accustomed  submissiveness to insist on visiting him.  </P> <P> Felix acquiesces, but the journey and the months that he spends in the village  are a kind of annihilation. In Vienna, he was the family's patriarchal center;  here, as Henrietta and Helga patiently follow the healer's injunction to learn  Hebrew and study the Bible, he feels irrelevant and estranged.  </P> <P> More deeply, though, he feels the overthrow of all his Western values, of the  civilized assimilation that is his life. "If a man leaves his home and journeys  into the desert he is guilty," he protests, as they arrive in this very  different Jewish world of peasants and foresters. And the recourse to a  rabbinical healer is pure scandal to him, evoking an ancestral legacy that  stands for separation from his European world.  </P> <P> "We will not pray on orders," he objects. But neither his wife nor his daughter  listens. They become remote, and Felix drifts into a kind of hallucinatory  depression, one that colors the dreamlike tone, arbitrary jumps and disjointed  connections with which the story is told.  </P> <P> Such a style suggests, sometimes movingly, the imminent extinction of both a  life and a way of life. Felix's confused perceptions, in their way, are a kind  of "Death of Ivan Illich." But Appelfeld can be coarse and careless in his use  of it; to write of disconnection requires the finest of fictional connections.  Part of the coarseness may be due to an unappealing translation.  </P> <P> In any case, the thrust of Appelfeld's parable is plain and powerful. The  family's exodus, the search for a prophetic destiny that is the contrary of  assimilation, the village of Jews who work the soil -- all these prefigure the  land of Israel as the alternative to destruction.  </P> <P> Where Appelfeld shows his strength is in his avoidance of sentimentality. By  centering the story in Felix's confused perception, he suggests that salvation  has its own desolateness. The village, the healer, and Helga's and Henrietta's  conversion have no particular allure. On the contrary, if there is any focus of  sympathy, it is upon Felix's dying dream of civilization.  </P> <P> That it is indeed dying is made clear in the book's last and best section.  Traveling first-class on the train back to Vienna -- Helga and Henrietta remain  in the village -- Felix is back in his European comforts. But the hospitable  dining-car waitress makes anti-Semitic remarks as she serves an excellent meal,  and a police inspector harasses him for being Jewish. There is nothing happy  about salvation: All it does is save.  </P> <P>  Next: Elaine Kendall reviews "A Place I've Never Been" by David Leavitt  (Viking).  </P> <P> </P></p>

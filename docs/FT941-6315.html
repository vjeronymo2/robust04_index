			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Profits rise 25% at Abbey National: Banking group lifts dividend 22% and reduces cover target Abbey National, the banking group, yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1993 to Pounds 704m, from Pounds 564m. The board is recommending an increase in the full-year dividend of 22 per cent to 14p. Lord Tugendhat, Abbey chairman, said that given the good results and prospects for the group, the board had moved away from its earlier aim of dividend cover of three times or more, and concluded that cover of between two and three times was appropriate. The recommended 1993 dividend is covered 2.1 times by earnings. The greatest proportional profit rises came from the group's treasury and life assurance oper-ations, while the core UK retail banking business rose 14 per cent to Pounds 618m. Pre-tax profit from the treasury operation rose to Pounds 145m, from Pounds 100m. Profits from Scottish Mutual, the life assurance arm which deals through independent financial advisers, and from Abbey National Life, whose products are sold only through Abbey branches and which became operational in February 1993, rose to Pounds 61m (Pounds 39m). The group's continental European and offshore operations incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 105m, compared with a loss of Pounds 46m in 1992, largely because of the steep increase in provisions for commercial lending in France. Overall, provisions for the continental businesses jumped to Pounds 99m from Pounds 47m, while those for UK operations fell from Pounds 227m to Pounds 119m. The sale in August of the group's Cornerstone estate agency chain incurred an exceptional loss of Pounds 30m. Net mortgage lending rose to Pounds 3.2bn in 1993, from Pounds 2.5bn,after aggressive promotion of fixed rate mortgages. However, Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, did not expect the group's 18.5 per cent share of the UK mortgage market in 1993 to be repeated. It was likely to drop to its previous 12-14 per cent range. This year, Mr Birch expected a substantial increase in profits from the life assurance businesses and a drop in provisions. Further growth is also expected in the treasury operations, but the rate of increase is thought unlikely to be as rapid as in the past two years. The group did not intend to employ more than 35 per cent of its capital in this area: currently its investment assets use 27 per cent of capital. Abbey attracted Pounds 1.2bn retail savings, as it did in 1992, but because the UK retail savings market has contracted, its market share rose to 7.8 per cent, against 5.1 per cent. Total assets rose 16 per cent to Pounds 83.8bn. The cost/income ratio remained at 44.5 per cent. Mr Birch said the rise in operating costs from Pounds 706m to Pounds 763m reflected payments made under its profit-sharing scheme; salary rises; and modernising its 670 UK branches. Lex, Page 24</p>

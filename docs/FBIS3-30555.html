There are indications that the projectile which hit  the market in Sarajevo could have been fired from the positions  of the Muslim Army's Second Motorized Brigade, two to three  kilometers north-east of Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb military sources  told TANJUG.    The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday categorically denied being  responsible for the crime, and called for the immediate setting  up of a joint commission of representatives of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Serb and Muslim sides to  investigate the crime. The proposal was turned down by the  Muslim side. UNPROFOR military experts have analyzed the crater  left by the shell but have not so far been able to determine for  sure from which side the shell was fired.    U.N. military observers at the Bosnian Serb military command  at Lukavica and Bosnian Serb military sources agree on one point  -- that the number of casualties is too high to have been caused  by a single 120mm mortar shell.</p>

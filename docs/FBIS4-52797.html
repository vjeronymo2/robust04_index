			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [MAINICHI SHIMBUN interview with Masayoshi Takemura, head of </F> Sakigake [Harbinger]; place and date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the Hata  administration?    [Takemura] Both Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito  have come to the front, which makes it difficult for the  well-rounded Tsutomu Hata to display his personal coloring.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The withdrawal of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the governing coalition was triggered  by the formation of a new alliance called "Kaishin" [Innovation].    [Takemura] The claim that under the single-seat constituency  system the ruling coalition parties must be unified had come to  the surface since the latter half of the Hosokawa  administration. They tried all possible means, such as the  formation of another new party [shin-shinto], a parliamentary  alliance, a policy study group, a basic problems council,  "Kaikaku" [Reform] and "Kaishin." We had the impression that  their way of doing things was rough and we could side with them.  A glance into the formation of Kaishin shows that they lack  reflection. Their contention that the continued existence of  the powerful Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] across the river  necessitates the unification of anti-LDP forces leads to the  preservation and encouragement of the LDP forces despite the  fact that a political realignment terminating the 1955 system  has already begun. A bold political realignment, including the  LDP, should be implemented.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your stance toward the  administration led by Shinseito?    [Takemura] We cooperate with the present administration from  the outside. We cannot become an opposition party until a  budget bill and other related bills submitted by the Hosokawa  administration are passed. We will make our judgment after a  close watch on the policies of the new administration and on its  method of implementing them.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the basic policies  of the ruling coalition parties?    [Takemura] We are generally in favor of the coalition  parties, because their fundamental idea is based on the  continuity of reform. However, serious problems are lurking in  their security measures and their policy toward North Korea.  The word "universal security" they used sounds like collective  security advocated by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa.  That idea is a big logical jump from the past governmental view  that "collective security is doubtful from the standpoint of the  Constitution of Japan." The statement that "Japan will actively  participate in the peacemaking activities of the United Nations"  could be construed to mean that "peacemaking activities" include  the dispatch of peacekeeping forces or even peace-enforcement  forces. Why was the word "keeping" left out? Concerning the  North Korea issue, it is stated that "if the United Nations  adopts a policy, Japan will follow it," which could be construed  to mean Japan will follow it unconditionally. Former Prime  Minister Hosokawa replied to parliamentary interpellations that  "if the United Nations adopts a resolution, Japan will cooperate  with it within the limits of the Constitution." Compared with  Hosokawa's reply, the current coalition parties have taken a  rather bold step, saying that "Japan will follow even the policy  of the United Nations."    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your view on the behavior of  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa?    [Takemura] He is a tough man. I have a feeling that he  is a little hasty. Everyone makes a mistake. If a man makes a  mistake, he should examine himself and make a fresh start, but  Ozawa does not do so. He just dashes forward repeatedly with  great vigor, and it is difficult for us to grow accustomed to  such behavior. The basic principle of democracy is to recognize  the existence of different opinions and to coexist with them.  Ozawa's behavior has left a deep sense of incompatibility in  the political world. Some criticize the existence of a dual  power structure. The Hosokawa administration should have  essentially reflected on the activities of the secretary  generals meeting of the coalition parties, and the idea of the  national welfare tax was symbolic of their activities. If the  ruling coalition parties band together, they can encircle the  LDP and win an overwhelming victory over it. There is a  possibility that a one-party administration or the  administration of one-party plus something will come into being.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration will face great  difficulty in conducting state affairs.    [Takemura] The government and the ruling parties will settle  the tax reform issue in June. However, since there is no  guarantee that the Diet will pass the tax reform bill presented  by some political parties, the United States will be  distrustful. Since the basic principle of democracy is decision  by the majority, a minority government will not last long. Both  Shinseito and Komeito will contrive to gain a majority by luring  some Dietmen from the LDP and the SDPJ. If they fail to do so,  there are no prospects for them. Then, they have no alternative  but to start over again. However, if the electoral  redistricting panel can draw up an electoral redistricting bill  through an extension of the Diet session, we had better aim at  the passage of the bill.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Are you thinking of forming a  parliamentary alliance with the SDPJ?    [Takemura] We will act in concert with the SDPJ, but that  does not mean we will form an alliance with them. Before the  upcoming election, we intend to form new, firm political forces  ranging from the LDP to the SDPJ.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your political idea?    [Takemura] The protection of the Constitution has become a  word that connotes a specific color. We are thinking of using  the the word "chiken" [the appreciation of the Constitution] or  the word "kakken" [the revitalization of the Constitution], but  we have not found a proper word yet. We want to publish our  party platform, because we will soon greet the first anniversary  of our party. We want to fly a flag which is appealing to a  wide circle of people.</p>

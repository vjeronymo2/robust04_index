			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: S African retailer surges 68% for year Wooltru, the South African food and clothing retailer, boosted net income 68 per cent to R255.7m (Dollars 71.6m) in the year to June 30 from R151.8m a year ago, reports Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Sales grew 20 per cent to R6.68bn from R5.56bn, while net income before tax rose 57 per cent to R389.8m from R247.6m last year. The dividend was raised 40 per cent to 28 cents, up from 20 cents. Mr Colin Hall, chief executive, expects the company's strong growth to continue. 'The results are excellent. All the divisions have performed very well indeed,' he said. The growth came from all three main divisions, with flagship Woolworths leading the way with a 21 per cent advance. It attributed this to improved systems and logistics and the successful introduction of an in-house charge card to all stores. The company has decided to issue the final dividend of 18 cents in the form of scrip by way of a capitalisation issue rather than a cash payingment.</p>

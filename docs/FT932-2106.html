			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Azerbaijani rebel leader wants top posts: Militia chief wrestles for power with former communist boss MR Heydar Aliyev, the Brezhnev-era communist boss who on Friday assumed power in Azerbaijan, was last night locked in a struggle with the military rebel whose revolt helped catapult him to the presidency. The leader of the revolt, Mr Surat Husseynov, whose forces last night moved to within six miles of the capital, Baku, has demanded political and military power, diplomats said. According to Mr Aliyev, Mr Husseynov wants to become prime minister, and to control the interior and defence ministries, and the state security arm, the KGB. Mr Aliyev accused Mr Husseynov of attempting a coup d'etat, and said: 'I won't allow that. I'll do my best to avoid this.' Mr Aliyev, a former KGB and communist party chief, emerged from six years of political exile to become acting president on Friday, when the republic's beleaguered elected president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, secretly left the capital in a pre-dawn flight, and took refuge in his home village. The political crisis was triggered on June 4 when Mr Husseynov's private army, approximately 3,000 strong, seized Azerbaijan's second largest city, Gyanja, and demanded Mr Elchibey's resignation. It was initially thought that Mr Husseynov and Mr Aliyev were political allies, but it has since become clear that the army rebel has his own agenda. Earlier yesterday Mr Aliyev said he had been negotiating secretly with Mr Husseynov to halt the rebellion. Around 50 of Mr Husseynov's men set up barracades on the western approach to the city and said they were under the command of Mr Husseynov's deputy in Baku, Mr Rahim Gaziev, a former defence minister. They claimed that another group of rebels was coming from the other main road into the capital from the north. Mr Aliyev yesterday urged Mr Elchibey to return to Baku, castigating him for leaving the capital. 'The captain should be the last to leave the ship,' Mr Aliyev said. In a separate development, Azerbaijan's political crisis may be imperilling attempts to end the five-year-old war in the Azerbaijan region of Nagorno-Karabakh. A meeting planned in Baku this week to start implementing a peace plan has been cancelled.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] The second stage of the large-scale Japanese  humanitarian action has begun in the Far East. About 2,000  tonnes of foodstuffs have been delivered here, including  vegetable oils and canned meat, dairy, and fruit products which  will be sold to the population at moderate prices. This  long-term campaign is being conducted within the framework of an  intergovernmental memorandum on urgent Japanese humanitarian  assistance to the Russian Federation.    The first stage was carried out during the spring of last  year. The money raised helped purchase modern medical equipment  and equip medical institutions. This year it will be used to  implement the program of social assistance to invalids. It  should be noted that all stages of the humanitarian action are  being strictly monitored not only by Russian social protection  services but by the Japanese side as well. During the 27  March-4 April period a group of experts from the Japanese  Ministry of Foreign Affairs will carry out a working tour of the  Far East. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the  assistance in the region and to determine the best way of  rendering it in the future.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: UK industry in jeopardy from regulators Sir, In 1975, 35 per cent of Britain's northern manufacturing employment was in shipbuilding, steel and coal. Today it is less than 3 per cent, and if Swan Hunter and the final round of pit closures go ahead, it will be even less. But the north is still a premier manufacturing region and exports 45 per cent of its GDP. It has world-class businesses in new areas such as semi-conductors, automotive products, pharmaceuticals and service industries and has combined traditional strengths with new and sophisticated uses of modern technology in industries such as engineering, steel and chemicals. One of these world-class businesses - BNFL - is being prevented from contributing to the wealth, employment and exports of the region because it cannot begin to undertake the Pounds 9bn of export orders in the Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria. The plant, completed at the end of last year, has still not been authorised to operate - a situation you rightly described as 'a nightmare' ('Nuclear scheme that became a 16-year Whitehall nightmare', May 8). Most industrial plants require authorisations from regulatory bodies such as HMIP, MAFF and the NRA which are set after they have been built, but before they can start operation. If, as has been suggested, these bodies should now also consider the 'need' for new plants once they have been constructed, we are on the route to industrial disaster. What responsible board would authorise expenditure on a big new industrial plant if it is to be subject to the double jeopardy - after obtaining planning permission - of facing the possibility of a decision by a whole series of regulators as to whether there is a 'need' for it before it can start to operate. Regulators need to work more closely with industry, not against it. If current laws are stifling business in this way, it is incumbent on the government to change them quickly.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chong-min, former president of Taeyang </F> Trading Company, a firm run by the Workers Party of Korea]    [Excerpts]  <H5>  1. "Wishing you happiness" Disappeared </H5>   The weather in early January in North Korea is usually very  cold, and in this frigid weather the communists stage a  propaganda barrage, including political-ideological campaigns,  to idolize Kim Il-song and his son, Kim Chong-il. That is why  the new year atmosphere in North Korea is entirely different  from what it used to be before liberation. And it is one of the  main features of this season that the Workers Party [WPK]  bustles about trying to make people feel that the atmosphere is  less oppressive.    In North Korea there is a lot of propaganda going on every  month. But February is special because Kim Chong-il's birthday  falls then. The lunar new year, the founding anniversary of the  Academy of Sciences, and Machine Industry Day also fall in  February. Formerly, the founding anniversary of Korean People's  Army (KPA) was also observed then, and February marks the  proclamation of the Communist Manifesto. But as arrangements for  the transfer of power between the Kims took hold, Kim Chong-il's  birthday came to assume special significance, and people have  to bustle about at home and in their organizations making  preparations to celebrate the "February Holiday," Kim  Chong-il's birthday. [passage omitted]    In North Korea the word "happiness" is interpreted by and  large in a Confucian or superstitious sense. The communists  have long claimed that there is no such thing as Heaven or  Buddha, nor God. The Workers Party emphasizes that "No one  should depend on Heaven and God, unscientific beings, but  realize that he can be happy only under the solicitude and care  of Kim Il-song and his son." That is why to say "Wish you  happiness" would be tantamount to an insult to Kim Il-song and  his son. [passage omitted]    The typical greetings exchanged among North Korean people on  New Year's Day are "Congratulations on the New Year." Some go  one step farther and say, "Be healthy in the New Year." The  highest form of greeting is to say, "Let us work harder to be  loyal to the leader and the party."    The words people use in addressing one another in North  Korea differ slightly depending on one's social status. The  word "tongji" [comrade in English] is used in addressing a  superior, and the word "tongmu" [friend, or comrade in English]  in addressing a subordinate. The word "sonsaeng" [teacher] is  used among teachers when they address each other, or by a  junior when he addresses his many years senior. In most cases  "tongmu" or "tongji" is used.    By the superior-subordinate relationship here is meant not  only the relationship in offices between superiors and  inferiors but also the differences in social status and sex. It  is customary for women to use the word "tongji," which is  considered more honorific than the word "tongmu," in addressing  a male colleague who is equal in rank and about the same age,  for the simple reason that he is a male.    To give typical examples of how North Koreans address one  another, they put either the surname or given name and his  title before the word "tongmu,' for instance, "so and so  guidance worker tongmu." In addressing a soldier, one puts his  military rank before the word tongmu. In addressing an  unmarried woman whose name is not known, the words "chonyo  tongmu" are used.    During their stay in Pyongyang, members of the South Korean  delegation to the last North-South high-level talks were said  to have used the word "agassi" when they talked to waitresses  or female guides in their hotels or at the parties, and this  evoked an ire of the waitresses and female guides. But as far  as these waitresses were concerned, their protest was quite  natural or so it seems.    This is because the meaning of the word "agassi" is  distorted in North Korea, and it implies a mean word associated  with bar hostesses or toys for playboys.   <H5>    2. Origin of "February Holiday" </H5>   In the month of February all North Koreans are busy  preparing for Kim Chong-il's birthday. This, together with the  rigidity of social customs, produces an atmosphere giving the  impression that no other human beings exist except Kim Il-song  and his son in the North. Kim Chong-il's birthday began to be  officially marked inside the party in 1973 shortly after he  emerged as the future successor. The observation of his birthday  gradually expanded until it became an official national  holiday, observed both partywide and nationwide, beginning in  1976.    As is well known, the Workers Party carried out concrete  campaigns to highlight the image of Kim Chong-il as heir to Kim  Il-song after he was formally designated as such under  meticulously worked out many-sided plans.    Kim Chong-il was born to Kim Il-song and his wife, Kim  Chong-suk, in the former Soviet Union's far east where the  senior Kim and his wife were spending relatively peaceful days  after having taken refuge there from mopping-up operations by  the Japanese Kanto Army. While partially acknowledging the  circumstances surrounding Kim Chong- il's birth, the North  Korean Communists worked out an elaborate plan to conceal  information on the place of his birth.    Under this plan it must have been not so difficult to change  his birthplace from the Soviet Union to Mt. Paektu and present  him as a genius from his childhood.    Unexpected difficulties were encountered in the attempt to  squash all kinds of sordid rumors and scandals about Kim  Chong-il that circulated in the days when he was enroled at  Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Namsan Higher Middle  School. The main reason is that he indulged in so many unsavory  acts. But in those days these scandals were regarded as  something to be proud of in view of his great importance as the  son of Kim Il-song instead of being looked upon as misconduct.  Naturally it became an awfully difficult to conceal them.    It must have been under Kim Il-song's orders that the North  Korean Workers Party did its best in those days to preserve Kim  Chong-il's "authority and prestige." This is apparent from the  fact that the party presented "the 10-point program for  establishing the unitary ideology system of the party" in 1974,  strongly demanding the idolization not only of Kim Il-song but  also of Kim Chong-il in accordance with the principle of "the  unitary leadership system."    The Kim Il-song clan concentrated its influence in such a  way as to enhance Kim Chong-il's position, and this caused  various secondary problems. It is well-known among party  insiders that in those days Kim Chong-il's most intimate  college classmates who were involved in his misconduct were  ruthlessly punished.    During the early part of Kim Chong-il's leadingship in art,  filmdom in particular, with his post at the party's Department  of Propaganda and Agitation, he indulged in debauchery with  beautiful women in movie and theater circles for quite a long  time.    Shortly after Kim Chong-il was appointed as party secretary  in charge of the WPK Department of Organization in his capacity  as the future successor to power, his birthday was observed as a  party holiday beginning in 1974, when he was 32. On his 34th  birthday on 16 February 1976, his birthday was designated as a  national holiday, and ever since it has been observed as such.   <H5>    3. Kim Chong-il's Birthday and Lunar New Year </H5>   North Korea reinstated traditional festivals such as lunar  New Year's Day in preparation for the eventuality that it would  be compelled by its domestic situation to agree to inter-Korean  personnel exchanges not only at an official level but also at a  private level. North Korea feared that through North-South  talks South Koreans might come to notice that many traditional  national festivals had long since disappeared, and North Koreans  might come to notice how the South Koreans still observed  traditional national festivals.    True, North Korea revived some of the old festivals  including the lunar New Year and the Tano Festival (the fifth  day of the fifth lunar month). But the peculiar characteristics  of the communist regime permitted the revival of these  festivals only in form. Inasmuch as the lunar New Year happens  to fall in about the same season with Kim Chong- il's birthday,  it was an impossible thing to revive this festival in its  original form. North Korea could have attached some  significance to it, but did not do so because of Kim Chong-il's  birthday.    In those days in North Korea, as is the case now, it was  inconceivable to think Kim Chong-il could be involved in any  misconduct. Kim Il-song never permitted the disclosure of Kim  Chong-il's debauchery, which remains the junior Kim's major  misbehavior.    A countless number of those infamous pimps who vied with  each other in those days to curry favor with Kim Chong-il were  subsequently sacrificed to prove that not Kim Chong-il, but the  sycophants were responsible for all his flaws that appeared  before or after he was designated as Kim Il-song's future  successor. They include: Chon Mun- sop, then commander of the  Guard Force; Chang Yun-pil, then adjutant general for security  at Guard Department I, the General Bureau of Security; Pak  Sung-un, then deputy director of propaganda at the political  affairs bureau, the Ministry of Public Security; and Cha Kye-  ryong, then head of the Movie Actors Group.    Kim Chong-il continued to indulge in debauchery even after  he was designated the successor, producing many more toadies.  Kim Il- song's second wife, Kim Song-ae, dropped hints to him  about Kim Chong- il's misconduct. But Kim Il-song squashed them  recalling her interference when they were young and suspecting  that Kim Song-ae might be dropping such hints in retaliation  for her fall in her prestige in as a result of Kim Chong-il's  designation as successor.    However, at about the time Kim Chong-il's sex scandals were  on the verge of becoming public, his relatives, including Hwang  Chang-yop and his wife and Yang Hyong-sop, were officially  informed of the misconduct, making them concerned about its  possible consequences. With this happening, Kim Il-song became  enraged and exercised his authority to bring the trouble under  control.    First, Kim Il-song examined Kim Chong-il's performance as  successor in the making, and after determining the causes of  the trouble, dealt with those responsible. Later, during a  top-level session of the December 1977 WPK Plenum, he placed  "special organizational issues" on the agenda. With Kim Il-song  in the chair, the meeting did not scrutinize Kim Chong-il's  conduct, but nevertheless evaluated his performance very  closely. From beginning to end, the meeting examined "problems  that have cropped up within the party."    Following the Plenum, the party removed Kim Chong-il's  portraits from some places and suspended the campaign to  idolize him. In addition, such strict restrictions were placed  on matters requiring Kim Chong- il's full participation that he  was allowed to handle them only with the approval of Kim  Il-song.    In those days ordinary homes were not allowed to hang Kim  Chong-il's portraits; only the Party Central Committee and  other party organizations at the central level were allowed to  do so. That is why ordinary people had practically no way of  knowing about this ruffled father- son relationship. However, it  is true that people got the impression that the frenzied  campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il had nearly come to a halt and  that Kim Chong-il himself was so circumspect as to take a back  seat.    With things coming to this, the question of making Kim  Chong-il the successor became a subject of open discussion  once again beginning in the late 1970's because Kim Il-song had  no way of choosing anyone other than Kim Chong-il as his  successor. In 1973, a year after Kim Il-song's 60th birthday in  1972, Kim Chong-il was appointed as Party secretary in charge  of organization. However, there was a time when various  adulatory titles for Kim Chong-il disappeared for a  while--titles such as "the Party Center," "the sagacious  leader," "the great Kimilsongist," and "the lodestar."    In those days a harsh punishment was meted out to Yi  Yong-mu, Kim Chong-il's notorious pimp who was promoted to the  directorship of the General Political Bureau, the Ministry of  People's Armed Forces, from its deputy directorship. Many of  his associates also became a subject of discussion as possible  targets of punishment.    Some of these pimps were hit hard by Kim Chong-il himself  for the mistakes they committed as pimps, and others were  punished by his father because they were too sycophantic to Kim  Chong-il.    Then Minister of Culture Pak Chong-sin, the former South  Korean stage actress who defected to the North, ended up losing  her position because she, a middle-aged woman, offered no help  to Kim Chong-il in his debauchery and was in fact regarded as a  source of trouble by meddling in every move of famous actresses.    On the surface, the sole excuse used in dismissing people in  North Korea is the failure to implement party policy and the  distortion of Kim Il- song's instructions. In all cases, the  real reason was that officials had called for righteousness  against the wrongdoings of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il or they  failed to please their whims.    This same Kim Chong-il came into the spotlight once again  during the process of making preparations for the Sixth WPK  Congress in 1979, and he has remained in the spotlight ever  since. Leaving his work and daily life aside for future  discussion, here I will briefly describe how North Korea  celebrates Kim Chong-il's birthday.   <H5>    4. Additional North Korean National Holiday </H5>   As was the case with Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il has tried  hard to attach great significance to his birthday. [passage  omitted]    There was one change that took place for the first time  after Kim Chong-il was elevated to his post as director of the  WPK Department of Organization and Guidance. Ordinary people  came to know of it two to three years later. There are many  who still do not know about it. The change was the replacement  of license numbers of cadres' private cars with the numerals  indicating the date of Kim Chong-il's birthday.    Beginning in the mid-70's Kim Chong-il personally presented  sedans to cadres as gifts. All these cars carried license  numbers beginning with 2-16. This practice continues. North  Koreans call these sedans "gift cars" or "Central Party cars."  [passage omitted]    Cars carrying license numbers beginning with 2-16 can pass  check points in the suburbs of Pyongyang and travel anywhere in  the country without a travel pass, curfew pass, or Sunday pass.    North Korea raised the lower limit on the ranks of officials  eligible for the private use of automobiles by one or two  grades beginning in the early 1970's due to the gasoline  shortage. Lower ranking officials had to use official cars  dispatched upon request. Even the operation of dispatched cars  was strictly controlled, with their use banned on Sundays and at  nighttime.    Kim Chong-il presents signed "citations" and "watches  bearing his name" to close aides. Anyone who receives a citation  or a gift watch from Kim Il-song or Kim Chong-il who retires  under the age limit, is entitled to receive his pre-retirement  salary. For this reason, these citations and watches are highly  coveted.    These are luxury watches made to order, and have a large  variety, including gold Rolexes and Omegas. They are allocated  according to the ranks of the awardees. Of course, retirement  pay varies according to rank.    Anyone who had an opportunity to meet Kim Il-song or Kim  Chong-il on official business, or who was granted an audience in  recognition of meritorious service, will be recorded as one  granted an audience. He will not only be given social  prominence but also be assured of a monetary reward in his old  age. Of course, its size varies depending on the substance and  nature of the audience.    In North Korea no cadres, party members, or non-party  officials are allowed to exchange gifts. This is because the ban  on exchange of gifts is stipulated in the 10 Party principles  on the grounds that gift exchanges are bound to result in an  unprincipled collaboration.    When a cadre is discovered exchanging gifts, he becomes a  "target of disciplinary action" and is subject to charges of  violating the unitary ideology system. He is subjected to  disciplinary action by the party or loses his job. However, it  is a stark reality that despite these strict controls, the  practice of exchanging gifts is rampant due to chronic  scarcities and shortages.    But things are different with Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il.  As was the case with Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il is fond of  exchanging gifts. While watching him playing his gift-exchange  game, one may question whether he is administering the affairs  of state or playing house. This is because he indulges so much  in the game of exchanging gifts and other tokens with his aides  and toadies. [passage omitted]    On his birthday Kim Chong-il gives gifts to his close aides,  top cadres, and even second-echelon officials in the  Secretariat according to rank. He pays more attention to  choosing gifts on his birthday than he does on the occasion of  the "DPRK Foundation Day" or "Party Foundation Day."    In some cases he gives far more and far better gifts on his  birthday than on his father's. Most probably, he might be doing  so under special instructions from Kim Il-song.    With the establishment of Kim Il-song's and Kim Chong-il's  practice of exchanging gifts with others, a gift section was  formally set up in the WPK Central Committee to prepare all  gifts to be presented. In addition, the Office of the President  and the second bureau of the General Bureau of Security each  have their own special sections to handle gifts from Kim  Il-song and Kim Chong-il.    In special cases, Kim Chong-il presents automobiles to some  cadres on his birthday on 16 February. Ordinarily, daily  necessities and food items are the bulk of the gifts. Generally,  the list includes: fabric for suits, shirts and ties,  underwear, briefcases, suitcases, and various home electronic  appliances, books of poetry, quotations from Kim Il-song or Kim  Chong-il, fountain pens, ballpoints, calendars, etc., etc.  Included in food items are: venison, pheasant, various kinds of  meat, canned meat, tangerines, candies, and alcoholic beverages  (one or two bottles).    Gifts are presented collectively to each unit of each party  organization sometimes, and individually at others. With food  gift items, it is customary to share them with people in the  same office or subordinates. But occasionally, this is not the  case with some recipients.    Before Kim Chong-il's birthday was designated as an official  holiday, Kim Il-song on the occasion of his 60th birthday had a  serious and lengthy discussion with his aides to examine  various problems that might arise in the future when Chong-il's  birthday was to be observed as a national holiday so that they  might work out measures to deal with them in advance. The  reason was that they believed that the observance of Kim  Chong-il's birthday would be of great importance in idolizing  him.    Kim Chong-il was born on 16 February 1942. In those days the  date 8 February was observed as People's Armed Forces Day in  commemoration of the founding of the KPA on that date in 1948.  Therefore, realistically it would be a problem if they were to  observe two national days in the same month, about a week  apart. The reason was that they had to highlight Kim Chong-il's  birthday, and yet it would be illogical to downgrade Armed  Forces Day.    After much thought, the WPK had at a fantastic idea. The 8  February holiday would be merged with the founding anniversary  of the People's Revolutionary Army Day on 25 April, integrating  the two into People's Armed Forces Day. The Party claimed that  this was in line with the KPA being the successor to the  People's Revolutionary Army. The underlying thought was that the  date of birth is something that cannot be changed and that by  combining the two armed forces days, the party would be able  not only to highlight the KPA as the inheritor of the  revolutionary tradition but also to enable the KPA to take  pride in its history, which is as long as that of the army of  any other country.   <H5>    5. Birthday Functions </H5>   Functions on Kim Chong-il's birthday do not differ much from  those on Kim Il-song's except for the peculiar focus of the  former. Emphasis is placed on highlighting Kim Chong-il's image  as an "artistic genius" and "the sun of the future."    Customarily, he loathes appearing at formal conferences or  official gatherings. On the contrary, he rather likes informal  get-togethers, such as social gatherings, private parties,  concerts, and drinking parties. [passage omitted]    The subjects of conversation at social gatherings held at  Kim Chong-il's initiative are mostly political issues and  matters related to the idolization of him, or sex problems  discussed in the background of music and dance.    It is no exaggeration to say that the basic established  theories behind current party policies in North Korea have  their origin in conversations at these sundry informal  gatherings such as private parties organized by Kim Chong-il's  aides in his honor, where all problems converge so that he and  his aides might discuss them.    Parties are organized prior to Kim Chong-il's birthday  presumably to decide the scope and form of the celebration.  Subjects of discussion will include: the direction of political  work; the substance of propaganda and agitation; the direction  of art and cultural work; matters relating to report meetings,  commemorative lecture meetings, and seminars; the direction of  overseas propaganda; the direction for birthday celebrations  giving full play to the characteristics of each sector; the  substance, methods, and forms of events that will be held by  agencies at all levels and by the general public in celebration  of the birthday.    Needless to say, not all these matters are discussed each  time. Except for policy issues concerning the birthday  observance and some of the matters relating to the scope, form,  and substance of the observance, it is a rule to follow past  practice even without specific instructions.    In the early 1970's, his birthday began to be observed.  Subsequently, the scope and substance of its celebration  gradually expanded and diversified each year except for about a  one year hiatus in around 1978. Mass artistic presentations  developed as the main form of celebration. In the beginning the  observance of Kim Chong-il's birthday was overshadowed by Kim  Il-song's, but it is significant that the observance  increasingly became an open affair and finally developed into a  public observance full of political paraphernalia.    Until the late 1980's the general substance and form of  celebration consisted of art performances in each unit and  organization in addition to those presented by national art  organizations. On the whole, performances at each unit took the  form of a mass presentation by administrative, party, and other  cadres of the unit. Strikingly, they have sought artistic  impressions of loyalty through inter-unit competition.    Normally each unit presents art performances three or four  times. But they spend several months making preparations. Some  go so far as to concentrate on rehearsals leaving work aside.  Others lacking their own talents appoint outsiders or expert  artists to certain positions in advance and call them up when  they need them as members of the cast in their presentations in  honor of Kim Chong-il's birthday. Powerful organizations such  as the Central Committee are more prone to this kind of  expediency.    Kim Chong-il or Kim Il-song takes part in the best program  selected from art performances presented by non-professional  groups, and the cast of that program will win the trust and  special consideration of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. That is  why all units are vying each other to, in their words, "offer  happiness and satisfaction." That is what is going on in North  Korea today.    All kinds of things occur in preparation for performances.  Some cadres, total strangers to the arts, are compelled to  participate because they cannot decline, for it involves the  question of loyalty. The moment they appear on stage, they  stand like a totem pole, unable to utter their lines, or they  act so awkwardly that the audience breaks into laughter. It is  so comical that Kim Chong-il likes it. That is why more and  more people are participating in birthday performances, and  some interesting performances are staged.    Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il mobilize various party and  government organizations to exact birthday gifts from our 20  million fellow countrymen in the North. As on Kim Il-song's  birthday, all organizations and certain individuals are forced  to present letters of congratulations on Kim Chong-il's  birthday. This was established as a routine political formality.  [passage omitted]    They have even created a special flower called the Kim  Chong-il flower just as they previously created the Kim Il-song  flower.    On Kim Chong-il's birthday, all units and inhabitants have  to present their gifts, which are roughly divided into four  categories: first, foreign currency as a token of loyalty;  second, gold as a token of loyalty; gifts of loyalty (health  food, agricultural products, traditional native products,  fishery products, and various ornaments and valuables); fourth,  the selection of the Kim Chong-il's ideal maiden.

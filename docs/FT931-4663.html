			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television In the past few years Britain, or more accurately you and I, have paid billions of pounds replacing the rates system with the poll tax. Now we are paying billions of pounds to replace the poll tax with the council tax  .which looks remarkably like the rates system. Dispatches (9.00 C4) looks at the way key decisions were taken while public attention was directed elsewhere, and at the politicians most closely involved. Margaret Thatcher promised in 1974 that she would abolish the rates, , but Nigel Lawson, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, fought against the idea. It may be worth remembering that the BBC2 drama series Mr Wroe's Virgins (9.25) only claims to be based partly on real events. Today's story about Hannah, an atheist and socialist who becomes involved in the political struggles of the Ashton spinners, sounds as though it should fit in remarkably well with the beliefs of the women's movement in the 1990s (well, 1970s and 80s, anyway). QED focuses on Mike Burrows, inventor of the 'superbike' on which Chris Boardman won a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics.(9.30 BBC1).</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Monks urges less hostility to unions Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, told the government last night that ending hostility towards unions could help the party retain power at the next election. He warned ministers that attacks on unions were no longer an automatic way of winning votes. He added: 'Even if that were ever the case, it certainly is not true any more. People now look to trade unions to support them in a world of work that is uncertain and insecure.' Mr Monks, the first TUC chief to speak at a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference, said more and more workers afraid of losing their jobs were looking to the unions for support. However, he said, a visit by a union leader to a political party conference would pass with little comment in any other European country. 'Only in Britain is there such deep distrust and mutual suspicion between trade unions and government.' To take over Labour's lead in the opinion polls the Conservatives would require the votes of 'many more trade unionists'. Mr Monks said it could not be 'good politics' for the Conservatives to continue to be seen as anti-union when an opinion poll had recorded 89 per cent support for the view that unions were necessary to protect people's interests at work. The problem faced by the government was that most people recognised that the relationship between employer and employee was 'fundamentally one-sided'. Mr Monks said: 'The world of work is autocratic and dominated by top-down management power, and getting more so.' He attacked the government for excluding Britain from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Monks argued that people reluctant to accept that an economic recovery was under way were hardly likely to believe that having fewer rights at work than were available in other countries was a crucial ingredient for success.</p>

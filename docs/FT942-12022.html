			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / People: Happy time for Keehn to step down Silas Keehn, tall, and much more youthful looking than his 64 years, is stepping down as President of Chicago's Federal Reserve Bank with the same kind of statesmanship that characterises the 13 years he has spent ministering to the financial health of America's heartland, writes Laurie Morse. 'This seems a very good time for a transition,' Keehn says. 'Happily, things are going right. Bank reserves are adequate (after a difficult period in 1990 and 1991) and the economy is doing well, particularly in the midwest.' The Chicago Fed's voice in US monetary policy, in the form of a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, rotates every other year with the Cleveland Reserve Bank. Thus, Keehn says, if his successor is appointed this summer, the new appointee will have time to get to know the system before Chicago gets the vote again in 1995. With Keehn's departure, the Fed will lose a monetary policy moderate. While circumspect in his public pronouncements, Keehn has a reputation for keeping a balanced view of the trade-offs between inflation and economic growth. Having spent 23 years at Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank before joining the Fed, Keehn has a banker's view of policy. The Chicago Reserve Bank, one of 12 nationwide, serves Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, an area that encompasses an unusual mix of agriculture, manufacturing, and financial services. Keehn's successor will be appointed by the board of directors of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, which has organised a search committee. Although the search is expected to take several months, James Annable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago, is thought to top the list of potential candidates.</p>

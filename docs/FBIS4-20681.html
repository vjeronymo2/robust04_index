However, cases of sewage treatment by  methane fermentation are very rare, and the application of this  technique outside of tropical and subtropical areas would  involve many problems yet to be solved.    The development of a field test was conducted on a scale of  240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. The target was to establish  a bioreactor system capable of achieving a 60 percent or higher  gasification rate for organic matter in sewage, supplied at an  organic load of 2 kg BOD-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] or more.  <H5>  Properties of Raw Sewage </H5>   The properties of raw sewage are shown in Table 1. The ratio  of dissolved organic matter to total organic matter is only 18  to 25 percent.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1. Properties of Raw Sewage                                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |mg-l[.sup]-1[/] |                  |mg-l[.sup]-1[/] |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |BOD               |173               |SS                |197               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |BOD (sol.)        |31                |NH[.sub]4[/]-N  |20.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CODcr             |293               |VFA               |3.3               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CODcr (sol.)      |72.6              |SO[.sub]1[/]    |33.2              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Process Flow </H5>   A flow sheet of the process is shown in Figure 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-49A>      Figure 1. Process Flow Sheet of Field Test Plant for Sewage Treatment </FIG>   <H5>  Charging of Seed Sludge </H5>   The anaerobic bioreactor (UASB) and hydrolyzation reactor  were fed with seed sludge. The seed sludge for UASB was imported  from the Netherlands. Its volume was 30.4 m[.sup]3[/], about  40 percent of the UASB volume, and it had 78,000  mg-l[.sup]-1[/] of TS and 58,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] of VS, or  1,778 kg as VS.    The seed sludge for the hydrolyzation reactor was digested  sludge in the existing treatment plant and had a volume of 6.55  m[.sup]3[/], or 67.9 kg as VS. UASB started out treating 56  m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/], and the treatment volume  increased in stages as determined by the characteristics of the  effluent. In three months, treatment volume reached 240  m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/].  <H5>  Results </H5> <H5>  Hydrolyzation Reactor </H5>   The results are shown in Table 2. When the SRT was 445 days  and the temperature in the reactor was 25C, 84.8 percent of  the VSS charged was decomposed, and methane gas was generated at  a rate of 335 l per kg of the charged VSS or 395 l per kg of the  decomposed VSS. When the SRT was 144 days, the VSS decomposition  rate was 76.8 percent. Judging from the fact that the VSS  decomposition rate reached only about 40 percent at 25C  without membrane separation, such results are attributable to  the combination with the membrane separation system. When the  return from the tank to concentrate the backwashing of the  aerobic reactor was charged together, its ratio to the total  charged VSS, increased from 30 percent to 39 percent, and from  52 percent to 70 percent of the VSS decomposed at an SRT of 25  to 29 days at 25C. In this case, methane gas was generated  at a rate of from 153 l to 206 l per kg of the decomposed VSS.     The concentrated water of the backwash mainly consisted of  excess sludge from the aerobic reactor. It is far more difficult  for this water to undergo hydrolyzation and solubilization than  the concentrated water from the suspended solids separation  device, and the higher its proportion in the charged VSS to the  hydrolyzed liquid, the lower the VSS decomposition rate gets.  When the proportion of the VSS from the concentrating tank of  the backwash to the total charged VSS was about 35 percent, with  no membrane separation system combined, the VSS decomposition  rate would be around 45 percent at 35C. The VSS  decomposition rate of 52 percent or more at 25C is thus  attributable to the use of the membrane separation system.  <H5>  Membrane Module System </H5>   The membrane module system is designed to treat hydrolyzed  liquid from the hydrolyzation reactor. Physical characteristics  and the operating conditions are indicated in Table 3. A  cross-flow filtering method is used, and the operation is  carried out at a constant membrane linear velocity.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

The mean temperature in this reactor was  17.8C.    The BOD and SS content of the water inflow were reduced at  20C from 140 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] to 68 mg-l[.sup]-1[/]  and from 178 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] to 59 mg-l[.sup]-1[/],  respectively, while the daily volume of excess sludge generated  was 8.4 kg, or 0.035 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of waste water.    Both sides of the anaerobic bioreactor are provided with 15  sampling valves at 200-mm intervals between a height of 300mm  and 3,100mm from the bottom. The liquid in the reactor was  sampled with these valves to measure the VSS, and the results  are shown in Figure 2. After the rated treatment capacity of 240  m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] came to be fully utilized, the  distribution of the concentration hardly varied, standing at  10,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in the vicinity of the  gas-solid-liquid separating section.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-51A>      Figure 2. Distribution of VSS Concentration in Anaerobic Bioreactor </FIG>     The part in which the VSS was 10,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] or  more was assumed to be the effective volume of the anaerobic  bioreactor, and the load on this effective volume was  calculated. The results showed that the load on the effective  volume was 1.7 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] in terms of  BOD, or 2.8 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] in terms of COD.  When the backwash discharge from the aerobic reactor was  returned to the separating device (filter), the load became 2.0  kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/].    When the temperature in the reactor reached about 20C,  the gas conversion rate changed from 44 percent to 84 percent in  terms of BOD, or from 22 percent to 53 percent in terms of COD.  The gas conversion rate in terms of BOD (COD) is defined by the  oxygen required to completely oxidize the methane produced to  the total BOD (COD) load.    The number of granules in the reactor 230 to 320 days after  beginning treatment of 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] is  shown in Table 4. A granule was defined as being larger than  0.5mm[.sup]2[/], and the number of granules is based on the  number present in 1 ml of the mixed liquor.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4. Number of Granules                                                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |in 234 days       |in 293 days       |in 319 days       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1                 |511               |100               |382               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2                 |742               |-                 |409               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3                 |459               |170               |159               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5                 |152               |105               |104               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |7                 |31                |8                 |25                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |8                 |11                |8                 |25                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |9                 |12                |3                 |30                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1                 |11                |-                 |12                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The number of granules decreases from the lower part close  to  the inlet pipe towards the upper part in the reactor. In the  effective volume, there are from 100 to 150 granules per ml.    There is a clear difference in the concentration of calcium  ions between seeding sludge and SS in raw sewage, as shown in  Table 5.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 5. Concentration of Calcium Ion                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |in the seeding sludge    |in the SS of raw sewage  |in the granule           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |0.29                     |7.3                      |1.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      According to this fact, measuring the calcium concentration  in the granules at 260 to 300 days after beginning treatment of  240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] confirm to the theory that  the granules partly consist of seeding sludge and partly of SS  in raw sewage. Some of the seeding sludge becomes thin depending  on the load.    The methanogenic activities of the liquid samples in the  reactor, taken from the bottom, middle, and top layers of the  anaerobic bioreactor, were measured by the following method.  Measuring the volume of methane product under shaking the vials  after being put the substrate, formic acid or acetic acid, into  on the constant load. [as published] The shaking temperature was  equalized to that in the reactor at the time of sampling.    Methanogenic activity is significantly affected by the  temperature in the bioreactor. The acetic acid-fermenting  methanogenic activity was found to be higher in the middle and  bottom layers than in the top layer.  <H5>  Aerobic Reactor </H5>   Air for aeration was 1.8 Nm[.sup]3[/] per m[.sup]3[/]  of treated water. Backwashing was automatically conducted twice  a day by each reactor. When backwashing water was 75  m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] and backwashing air 60  Nm[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/], the backwashing effect was  sufficient to keep the SS concentration in the drainage after  backwashing below 100 mg-l[.sup]-1[/].    The mean values of BOD and SS in the treated water were 10  mg-l[.sup]-1[/] and 8.9 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], respectively,  under a volumetric organic load of 1.9  kg-BOD-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. BOD reduction rate was  81.5 percent, and SS reduction rate was 84.7 percent.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The average quality indicators of the input water were 173  mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in BOD and 197 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in SS, and  those for the treated water were 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in BOD  and 8.9 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in SS. The average temperature in the  anaerobic bioreactor was 17.8C. When a flow was used in  which the drain from the backwashing of the aerobic rector was  treated within the system and the average temperature in the  anaerobic bioreactor was 20C, the BOD and SS contents of  the final treated water were 13 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] (4.4  mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in ATU BOD) and 8.4 mg-l[.sup]-1[/],  respectively.    When the average temperature in the anaerobic bioreactor was  no less than 20C, a gas conversion rate of 60 percent or  more (in terms of BOD) was attained.    Excess sludge was generated at a daily rate of 8.46 kg from  the hydrolyzation reactor and 8.4 kg from the anaerobic  bioreactor. The daily rate from the whole plant was 16.86 kg,  which amounts to 0.07 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of raw sewage.    When followed by post-treatment with an aerobic reactor,  treatment with the two-phase methane fermentation system  comprising a hydrolyzation reactor combined with separating  membranes and a sludge blanket bioreactor (UASB) was found to  steadily provide treated water of about 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/]  both in BOD and in SS. The volume of excess sludge was 0.07 kg  per m[.sup]3[/] of raw sewage. This suggests that anaerobic  treatment of raw sewage may be feasible in other than tropical  and subtropical areas. The results also indicate that less  excess sludge was generated than when using activated sludge.    Regarding the hydrolyzation reactor combined with separating  membranes, the reduction rate for volatile suspended solids  charged into the membrane fermentation reactor reached from 76.8  percent to 84.8 percent under the condition that the temperature  in the reactor is 25C and only the raw sludge was charged  from the separating device.    Charging into the methane fermentation reactor the sludge  mixed the concentrated backwashing with the separated sludge  from the separating device, the reduction rate for volatile  suspended solids showed from 52 percent to 70 percent at  25C. Such high reduction rates for volatile suspended  solids is attributable to the additional use of a membrane  separation system.  <H5>  Acknowledgements </H5>   As a member of the Aqua Renaissance Research Association  (ARRA), we are conducting this investigation under the auspices  of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development  Organization.

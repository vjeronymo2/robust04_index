			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: 'Death' and 'Desire' - East Berlin is gripped by US drama IN BERLIN last week, the lyrics 'I want to live in America' surged out on to the dimly lit Friedrichstrasse in the east as the Metropol, a 1960s-style music hall, celebrated the hundredth performance of a West Side Story which opened within weeks of the Berlin Wall's collapse. Up the road, the sold-out premiere of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman at another former eastern playhouse, the Maxim Gorki Theater, demonstrated the serious side of a passion that is now gripping German-speaking theatres: a love-affair with modern American drama, and especially with the kind of mid-century American play in whose post-war concerns so many contemporary German dilemmas are finding a voice and a symbol. Salesman, cannonaded as communist propaganda when it appeared on Broadway in 1949, is of course the perfect play for the old east Germany. The sense of a threatening new order; the salesman left behind, forced to admit that his life has been run by dreams and lies; his awakening sense that the capitalist spirit he had so fervently embraced is now pinching him where it hurts; the fear that failure means no longer belonging to society: Willy Loman's crisis rings true not for Honecker's Germany but for the former eastern states today. The Maxim Gorki production has almost the vigour of a new play, the sense of rediscovery enhanced by a fresh and sensitive translation from Volker Schlorndorff, who filmed the play in 1985, and by one of the most intently involved audiences I have seen. The piece comes with programme notes from ex-DDR dramatist Heiner Muller - that capitalism's only enemy is now itself, that Germans cannot distinguish between advertisement and reality, and this is the core of Klaus Manchen's interpretation of Willy. From his first moment on stage, back to the audience, large suitcase drooping from each hand, Manchen expresses the world-weariness not just of 30 years on the road, but of a man caught in a lifelong web of deceit and self-justification. Manchen is big, fat and impeccably dressed: the desperation for approval, the clinging to his pinstripes and hat as talismans of the right way to be, is the more poignant and vulnerable in so imposing a man. We never learn the contents of his suitcase, but Manchen begins at once selling himself - to his wife, his children. He can neither give up nor live up to his image of successful salesman, and the conflict isolates him. He looks wildly round the stage, the audience, to be met by blank incomprehension at the intensity of his fantasy. His voice, veering from soft fatigue to raw shriek, suggests a potential heart attack victim; the face gets greyer and wan, he visibly ages during the performance. Director Siegfried Buhr packs in psychologically acute support - Gotz Schubert as Biff and Thomas Ruhmann as Happy fight convincingly in their thirties the battles that should have happened in adolescence, as Biff finally grasps - but never lets the father-son relationship deflect the tragic impulse that propels the piece. Other roles are played with Brechtian dramatic economy - explorer-brother Ben (Gottfried Richter), for instance, is crystal clear as a glamorous symbol to Willy but shows no emotions himself. Staging echoes the theme of masks and dreams. Huge cubes and rectangles form the tower blocks hemming in the Loman apartment; slits between the granite let in views of an infinite cityscape. Contemporary action takes place mostly in shadowy corners or doorways; scenes reenacting Willy's memories are by contrast bathed in spotlight, his boasting playfulness with his boys a theatrical performance, the glow fading as he crumbles back to his true insecurity. Stars pop up like jewels on the big black shapes, hinting at romance, at the grandiose idea of commercial heroism - suicide for the insurance premium, the ultimate self-sell - which we know will kill Willy. Following the Berlin version, another Salesman opens in Hamburg's main theatre this week, Miller's View from the Bridge opens in Dusseldorf, Edward Albee has just premiered in Cologne, while in Vienna I caught A Streetcar Named Desire, the new production in one of the most ambitious American ventures, the Volkstheater's Tennessee Williams cycle. The play, written two years before Miller's, works through sentimental romance the same theme of social alienation. Viennese theatre has a special quality of encapsulating the mood and setting of a piece at a mesmeric, almost suffocating pitch; this marks both classic and modern works at the Burgtheater as well as the lighter Volkstheater, and is perhaps a reflection of the museum-like claustrophobia of the city itself. With Williams such an approach cannot be bettered; few dramatists delineate their own world more precisely, and the Volkstheater's evocation of his vulgar-lush southern town is worth seeing for the set alone. The 'raffish charm' Williams demanded is all here. The New Orleans corner house, weathered grey, with white frame, rickety stairs, ornamented gable; the palm tree leaning against a telegraph pole; trains shuttling through; Jim Beam and Shell in neon, spin on a revolving platform. Inside is the shabby Kowalski house; outside a half-moon dance floor with a blues pianist. Beyond, the sky turns turquoise, pink, bloodshot; jazz rhythms come and go; sirens wail; a rainbow arches overhead: director Horst Ruprecht's backcloth of beauty, cruelty, ugliness is never still. Ruprecht extends raffish charm to character too. Everyone is a shade too nice: we need more meance from Josef Bilous as the brutish Pole Kowalski, and a more hardened neurosis from Kirsta Stadler as his genteel sister-in-law Blanche. This checks Williams' highly strung extremes - in the key fight between the sensitive (Blanche) and the materialist (Stanley), there is some sympathy for the latter, though there is no risk of running out of it for the former, who can be a tiresomely self-indulgent prima donna. Ms Stadler instead gives Blanche initial control and some humour, and excellently conveys the desperation of the fallen woman straining after innocence which later turns to insanity. A refrain, introduced by a tinkling glockenspiel and ending with a gunshot, recurs each time her memories are danced out on the crescent platform, and enhances the sense of obsession. The tenderness of the portrayal suffuses the theatre - just too sweetly. It is hard not to compare the smouldering beast Marlon Brando in deadly conflict with wistful fluttering Vivien Leigh, in the film version; here the tension is many volts lower.</p>

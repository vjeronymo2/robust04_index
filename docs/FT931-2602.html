			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mandarin earnings rise to Dollars 40m - Hong Kong Results MANDARIN Oriental Inter-national, the Jardine-controlled hotel group, yesterday reported an 8 per cent rise in net 1992 earnings to USDollars 40.3m from USDollars 37.5m in 1991. Turnover rose 16.5 per cent to USDollars 148.4m from USDollars 127.2m. The company will pay a final dividend of 3.59 cents a share, making 5 cents a share for the year - the same as in 1991. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said 1992 marked a return to profit growth for the company. He said the start to 1993 was encouraging and in line with expectations. Turning to 1992, Mr Keswick painted a picture of uneven performance throughout Asia. Its hotels in Hong Kong and Philippines witnessed a pick-up in business. In Thailand and Indonesia, they fared less well due to political disturbances in the former and tough market conditions in the latter. He said Mandarin Oriental was continuing to pursue opportunities in the region. He gave an an example its plan to operate a hotel in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Group of Seven embraces the Sinatra Doctrine - Policymakers are intent on doing it their way THE officials briefing the press did not use the expression, but yesterday's opening session of the world economic summit in Munich confirmed that the 'Sinatra Doctrine' now dominates global economic policymaking. Fourteen years ago in Bonn the first economic summit to be held on German soil saw agreement on an elaborate trade-off among the big industrial powers with the aim of spurring world growth. The latest summit in Germany is celebrating the fact that everybody 'does it my way'. After the first sessions of talks among the leaders of the Group of Seven countries and their finance ministers yesterday, it became clear there would be no dilution of national economic priorities as a result of the meeting. All seven heads of government and their finance ministers registered dismay at the weak state of global economic recovery. But it was equally clear that German interest rates would stay high for as long as necessary to defeat inflation, even though last week's half percentage point cut in the US discount rate to a 29-year low of 3 per cent has brought the gap between comparable US and German official rates to a yawning 6.75 percentage points. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, reaffirmed Britain's policy of maintaining a strict control on public spending with the aim of eventually bringing down interest rates. He made clear that he sought no quick fix for the UK economy. He was prepared to accept the disciplines of the European exchange rate mechanism, and strive to put sterling into the narrow bands of the ERM at DM2.95 in the hope of lower interest rates in the long term. Japan, which has come under pressure from its international trading partners to boost its domestic economy, showed it was in no hurry to comply. The government in Tokyo might at some time decide on further spending measures, but the moment for that would be in the autumn, after assessment of whether the front-end loading of public spending in the first half of the current fiscal year - starting in April - had had any effect. In the meantime, Mr Yuichi Ezawa, director general of the international finance bureau of the Ministry of Finance, assured journalists that the recent fall in the Tokyo stock market and other signs of financial fragility in Japan would not have a noticeably adverse effect on the real economy. Indeed, Japan's economy, Mr Ezawa said, was already showing signs of recovery and was on the way to achieving sustained non-inflationary growth. Although there has been much talk in the ruling Liberal Democrat party of a Y7,000bn-Y10,000bn (Pounds 29.4bn-Pounds 42bn) boost to the economy this autumn, he underlined that Japan was still enjoying full employment. The government wished to avoid too much reliance on short-term policy measures for fear of triggering a stop-go cycle, he added. Germany too was anxious yesterday to stress the medium-term nature of its policies. Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, insisted that Germany had contributed a great deal to the world economy and would do more. The shift in its current account balance of payments from a surplus of DM108bn in 1989 to a DM33bn (Pounds 11.3bn) deficit in 1991 was proof of that. Germany had not and would not suffer recession. Indeed, according to the OECD, growth this year of 1.75 per cent was likely to be followed by 2.75 per cent growth next year, he said. What the German government could not ignore, however, was the 'intolerable and unacceptable' annual inflation rate of 4.5 per cent. Although inflation is expected to fall to about 4 per cent by the end of the year, the rapid growth of money supply meant the Bundesbank could not cut interest rates at an early stage. The Bonn government fully understood the Bundesbank's position, Mr Vogel said. He offered some crumbs of comfort. Although the government decided a tough 1993 budget at the start of this month, it had at the same time suspended the special 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge that had been levied to finance the absorption of eastern Germany. The US, which earlier this year put pressure on Germany to redress its fiscal imbalances with the hope that this would lead to lower interest rates, has so far applauded the German budget moves and the apparent intention of Japan to boost its economy if necessary. The US administration cannot appear too gloomy about world economic prospects so close to the November presidential election. Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday that US growth of 2.5-3.0 per cent was attainable this year and he predicted 'banner years' in 1993-4 if commitment to growth to be undertaken at the summit was fulfilled. 'Growth,' Mr Brady said, 'is not a light switch to be turned off and on, but a flame that needs to be fed.' He repeated that US exports would lead the nation's expansion as it had over the last five years. He cited the recent agreement to build a BMW car plant in South Carolina as evidence that 'hard-nosed businessmen' had confidence in the US economy. The weekend decision by Italy to raise its discount rate by a full percentage point to 13 per cent and lop L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) off the budget served as a timely reminder of the hostile economic climate facing the industrialised countries. While Italy's G7 partners welcomed the move to deal with the country's huge budget deficit, the fact that the deficit will partly be pared by tax increases bodes ill for consumption in an economy where demand is already growing too slowly to prevent rising unemployment and business failures.</p>

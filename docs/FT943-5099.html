			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Broadcasters discuss plans for digital TV The BBC, Channel 4 and ITV representatives are working on plans for digital terrestrial television in the UK. Exploratory meetings have been held between the broadcasting organisations, and more are planned. A key stage in the process, however, is to agree on a European standard for digital terrestrial television. The Digital Video Broadcasting project, which brings together 140 broadcasting organisations and manufacturers, has already produced standards for digital satellite cable and is working on an agreed standard for digital terrestrial TV. The new system would have up to 16 new channels and would use digital rather than existing analogue technology, but would be broadcast from normal land transmitters. The clearest hint that the BBC was interested in developing digital terrestrial services came in July in the white paper on the future of the corporation. The document, taking its cue from the BBC, said the corporation intends to start experimental digital terrestrial services next year. It would hold talks with equipment manufacturers on the availability of receivers and invest in equipment to produce programmes in wide-screen format. 'It would aim to launch digital services, which could be received in wide-screen or conventional format, by the autumn of 1997,' the white paper said. The BBC is conducting a feasibility study on digital terrestrial and will take into account the plans of Britain's other broadcasters. In July the government outlined its decision on the future of Channel 5 - a compromise that set limits to the reach of a conventional Channel 5 in order to retain enough frequencies for the eventual launch of digital services. The existing broadcasters, including the operator of a Channel 5, would get a digital channel to match each of their existing channels. This would be for 'simulcasting' so that no one would be deprived of service. Broadcasters such as the BBC hope they would also get additional channels to launch new services. Mr Stephen Castell, a communications consultant, says he intends to bid for a Channel 5 licence to provide a digital multi-channel service. Mr Castell is not backed by any of the large groups, which are planning to operate a conventional analogue Channel 5. Instead he is promoting the idea of 'owner-viewers' who would invest in his company, Channel 5 Digital Television, and get a free receiver and discounted access to premium channels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Apr (TANJUG) -- Nikola Koljevic, vice  president of the Srpska republic, had a meeting in Pale this  afternoon with the UN secretary general's envoy (Sergio de Melo)  and with Andreas Kuhn, delegate of the International Committee  of the Red Cross [ICRC].    The talks that took place on this occasion referred to the  situation in Prijedor and Gorazde and to ways of improving the  humanitarian situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We agreed to make it possible for the people who wish to  leave the territory of the Srpska republic to do so. We will  provide the necessary security measures and guarantees. Those  who wish to stay will be protected by the Serb authorities,  Koljevic said after the talks.    Koljevic also said that the representatives of the  international organizations were told that the Serb authorities  insist on the Serbs in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and central Bosnia being  given the same treatment, including the right to leave  Muslim-controlled territory, if they so wish.    He added that the Srpska republic's authorities will discuss  all possibilities for giving ICRC representatives access to  Gorazde as soon as possible.    The UN secretary general's envoy said that "this is not a  time for dangerous military activities" and that "the most  important thing is the protection of the Gorazde area."    The ICRC representative said the agreement that was reached  will "satisfy both sides and will provide the answer to the  question of how to solve the situation in Prijedor."    He also said that a number of "specific measures for  improving the humanitarian situation in Gorazde" have been  agreed and that the ICRC intends to send food and medicine there  as soon as possible.</p>

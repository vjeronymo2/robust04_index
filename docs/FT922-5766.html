			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Stability amid turmoil - Yen shrugs off changes in the Japanese economy DOMESTIC financial and political turmoil and far-reaching global political change have left the yen remarkably unscathed over the past year. In the fiscal year 1991, the dollar averaged Y133, with the currency moving in a range of Y15, the second smallest fluctuation since it floated against the dollar in 1973. The currency has shrugged off significant changes affecting the Japanese economy such as long-bond yields falling from last year's 9 per cent to the recent 5.2 per cent, and the stock market down more than 55 per cent from its peak. The stock market scandals and political bribery allegations that shook Japan last year failed to rock the yen. The authorities have shown that they are able to stabilise currency markets. Earlier this year, the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve Bank of New York were selling dollars in co-ordinated intervention. According to Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Flemings in Tokyo, increased information has also decreased currency fluctuation. 'Dollar/yen movements are becoming limited because information is discounted into the rate every day,' he says. However, the middle- and long-term trend in supply and demand points to a strengthening of the yen. Japan's current account surplus for the fiscal year to March 1991 surged by 167 per cent from the previous year to Dollars 90bn. Official figures disclosed a record surplus of Dollars 113bn in the trade account, and a surplus of Dollars 40bn in the long-term capital account, the first surplus since 1980. The long-term capital account surplus followed a sharp increase to Dollars 101bn in foreign net purchases of Japanese securities from Dollars 60bn. Foreigners bought a net Dollars 36.77bn in Japanese stocks, up from Dollars 15.92bn in fiscal 1990. Japanese investment in overseas markets has started to shrink, as excess liquidity has been squeezed out, and overseas and domestic interest rate differentials have narrowed. In 1991, Japanese direct investment was Dollars 23.6bn, down from Dollars 44.9bn, reflecting tougher financial conditions at home and the world recession. Long-term capital flows are expected to remain in surplus for Japan as Japanese investors continue to favour domestic investments and foreigners remain net buyers of Japanese equities, prompting Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, to forecast that the yen will strengthen to Y115 against the dollar. In addition to payments surpluses, Mr Masao Susaki, head of research at the Bank of Tokyo, says that dollar/yen forward contracts affect the currency rate. 'Japanese exporters and speculators made positions in dollar selling forward contracts in the late 80s and have been rolling the positions over,' says Mr Susaki. He says investors and exporters will start selling the dollar against the yen from mid-1992. Mr Susaki expects the average dollar/yen rate to be around Y123 this fiscal year. Mr Hideki Furuya, senior economist at Sanwa Research Institute, says that economic fundamentals dominate the yen currency movements, and political and financial scandals tend to be secondary factors in the long run. Mr Furuya says that while the yen has weakened on the back of a slowing Japanese economy, recent economic figures indicate a gradual recovery. After declines in industrial production, inventory growth has slowed to a 7 per cent increase in March, down from a peak 13 per cent in December. Housing demand is showing signs of a recovery, reflecting the fall in interest rates on housing loans. The economy is also expected to benefit from the government's stimulatory package, which brings forward 75 per cent of this fiscal year's public works spending into the first half. According to Mr Furuya, this will have the same impact as an increase of Y3,000bn in spending. Reflecting the gradual recovery of the economy and a rise in long-term interest rates towards the end of the year, Mr Furuya forecasts the yen will rise to Y125. Mr Summerville, at Jardine Fleming, sees the D-Mark/yen rate averaging between Y70 and Y75 in fiscal year 1992.</p>

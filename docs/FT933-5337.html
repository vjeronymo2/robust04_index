			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Iacocca resigns as Chrysler director MR Lee Iacocca, who retired as chairman of Chrysler last December, yesterday unexpectedly resigned as a director of the automotive group and chairman of its boardroom executive committee. His departure marks the end of an era at Chrysler. The outgoing, feisty Mr Iacocca has been synonymous with the company since the late 1970s, when he joined from Ford Motor and saved the business from bankruptcy. Mr Iacocca had been scheduled to remain as chairman of the executive committee until the end of 1994. The company said there had been no pressure on him to resign. The decision had been strictly Mr Iacocca's. Mr Robert Eaton, who succeeded Mr Iacocca as chairman of the group, will now also take over as head of the executive committee. Mr Iacocca, 68, will remain as a Chrysler consultant to the end of 1994. Mr Iacocca said: 'It's not fashionable for former chief executives to serve on the boards of their companies any more. It's been a fantastic ride but it's time to let the younger people do the driving.' Observers noted the move could also give him greater freedom to dispose of his large shareholding in the company.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Lloyd's acts to ensure a fresh supply of capital: A look at the prospects of a new wave of investors for the market MR ROBERT Hiscox, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, waxes lyrical about the prospects of a new wave of investors at the insurance market. 'The US investment banks are beating a path to my door,' he says. Lloyd's moved to revamp its capital structure last year. But the publication last month of a business plan outlining the basic terms on which new incorporated capital can participate, has unleashed frenetic activity among the market's 100 or so insurance agencies. While Mr Hiscox has been crossing the Atlantic with bewildering frequency, other agents and brokers are working on plans ranging from the incorporation of existing Names, to the establishment of ambitious new investment funds. 'People are running around on corporate capital all over the place,' says Mr Cliff Hampton, of Phoenix Securities, a specialist securities house which is also working on its own schemes. Almost universally at Lloyd's, an influx of incorporated capital - which would have limited liability - is seen as essential for halting the decline in the market's capacity to compete in international commercial insurance and reinsurance markets. The market's traditional capital supply - individual Names trading on the basis of unlimited liability - is drying up in the wake of losses of some Pounds 6bn in the past five years. Capital supplied by Names is expected to fall to less than Pounds 8bn in 1994, compared with Pounds 11.1bn in 1991. Corporate capital could come from several sources: Existing wealthy Names: can now form companies - with limited liability. To do this though they would need assets of at least Pounds 1 1/2 m - compared with the Pounds 250,000 required by existing Names. Existing less wealthy Names: Members' agencies are also working on schemes which would allow Names to form groups trading on a limited liability basis. Insurance companies: Two Lloyd's agencies have set up 'consortium' arrangements, in which the insurance company underwrites business alongside the Lloyd's syndicate. Japanese insurance companies are understood to be expressing tentative interest. Venture capital: A number of investment banks - mainly from the US - are looking to venture capitalists to back new funds, through private placements. These would trade at the Lloyd's of London market as corporate Names. They will be encouraged by the backing offered by private US investors - such as Texas-based financier Mr Richard Rainwater and Vermont-based Mr Jack Byrne - to a number of new Bermudan reinsurance companies over the past year. Institutions: A number of agents hope to establish funds, backed by institutional investors or directly by individuals who would buy shares in investment trusts sold on the retail market. 'It would be the nearest thing to buying shares in Lloyd's,' says Mr Michael Wade, a broker who has teamed up with Sedgwick Group, the Lloyd's agency and broker, to examine the possibilities here. There are hopes that some of these new funds and new companies could be listed on the New York or London stock exchanges, making the investments more liquid and providing capital with an exit route. US investment banks like JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers, and international insurance brokers like Marsh McLennan and Johnson &amp; Higgins, are most active in exploring these new ventures. The banks believe that sharply increased insurance rates create attractive opportunities for profit, while the brokers are keen to find new sources of capacity to allow them to place clients' business more easily. Morgan and Marsh have already teamed up a number of new Bermuda-based ventures - including one which will supply reinsurance exclusively to Lloyd's syndicates. 'We've taken a lot of interest in Lloyd's over the last six months,' said Mr David Jarvis of Salomon Brothers. 'We have not made a final conclusion but we are looking at a number of possibilities. The insurance market is going through a period of very considerable change and all these things are very interesting to us.' Matters should become clearer when Lloyd's publishes a rulebook in the summer, providing more details on legal and accounting arrangements, as well as on the regulatory and tax implications for incorporated Names. Lloyd's plans to control the amount of capital which comes into the market to avoid the growth of capacity, which led to disastrous rate competition in the late 1980s. This will possibly be achieved through a a bidding system, although the rules as to how this will work have still to be spelled out. Some agents fear that the new rules will be too late to allow any corporate Name to participate in 1994. Lloyd's must surmount a number of obstacles if its plans are to be successful. It still has to convince the markets that billions of dollars of old liabilities from US asbestosis and pollution claims can be isolated in a new reinsurance company, whose formation is a centrepiece of the new business plan. Many investors will also want to see evidence that a settlement of the litigation dogging the market is on the horizon before they commit themselves. Moreover, many agents and syndicates may still have ground to make up before they can meet the much tougher standards of professionalism and disclosure that corporate investors will demand. 'Attracting corporate capital is not like falling off a log,' says one senior industry analyst in London. 'The businesses at Lloyd's will have to develop presentations that have real arithmetic substance. It won't be enough simply to say we think we can make 50 per cent underwriting margins.' Mr Hiscox admits it will be hard work. 'There are a lot of horses out there and a lot of water to drink. But there is also a lot of barbed wire in between.'</p>

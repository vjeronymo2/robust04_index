			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN OF DIVORCE FORCED UP IN THE AIR  </P> <P> Michael Bullard belongs to three frequent flier clubs and has accumulated  enough miles in the air, he says, for "oh, about 43 free trips to China."  </P> <P> So excuse him if he's a little tired of flight attendants who think they're  teaching second grade.  </P> <P> "They squeak their voices, and they say, 'Now, this is how you fasten your seat  belt,' " says Michael, a guy with an earnest, freckled face and glasses perched  on the tip of his nose. "Then they make you read the safety instruction card.  I'm like, I've read it a million times. I could draw the card for you."  </P> <P> "God," he says, rolling his eyes, "they treat me like I'm 7 years old."  </P> <P> Since Michael turned 11 last December -- well, the magnitude of the insult is  evident. Michael, who lives with his mother and stepfather in Sherman Oaks,  flies several times a year to visit his father in upstate New York. He's one of  a growing segment of the passenger population: kids who commute by themselves  between divorced parents.  </P> <P> Airline officials are reporting a dramatic increase in the number of children  between 5 and 11 who fly unaccompanied by an adult. United Airlines carried  200,000 unaccompanied minors in 1989, up from 100,000 in 1987. Based on  conversations with the young passengers, United estimates that more than half  are flying between divorced parents. Other major airlines, including American,  TWA and Delta, report an increase but say they don't keep written statistics.  </P> <P> Paul Carlson, a child psychologist who practices in Tarzana, says he has  noticed more of his young clients are commuting by themselves between parents.  Until a few years ago, he says, "a parent would either go along with the kids  or send an aunt or a nanny along. Now, kids have a great amount of  responsibility placed on themselves."  </P> <P> Some, like Michael, handle it well. They're grateful for the chance to visit  the other parent, and they seem to gain a sense of independence from traveling  alone. To them it's as easy as traversing the Valley on the Ventura Freeway,  only a bit more exciting. "Especially the turbulence," Michael says.  </P> <P> But for others, the commute isn't so simple. Some kids are afraid of flying,  some are intimidated by strangers in an unfamiliar setting, and some don't want  to leave the parent they're living with.  </P> <P> Still others do want to leave. In January, a 12-year-old boy, tired of bouncing  between his mom in Boston and his dad in Ft. Lauderdale, decided that he wanted  to live with his dad instead of his mom. He was such a veteran of air travel  that -- without his mother knowing -- he was able to catch a cab to Logan  Airport, slip past gate attendants and stow away on a Delta Air Lines flight to  Florida.  </P> <P> Michael isn't planning an escape from Sherman Oaks, but he's no slouch either  when it comes to airport knowledge.  </P> <P> "O'Hare, that's the worst," says Michael, who has commuted since age 5. "They  have H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 and they go all the way through the alphabet with 15  numbers for each gate. But I like LAX because it's organized, and in Austin  there's just 12 gates. Atlanta and Pittsburgh, you can handle them because  there's no one there. But a place like Dallas-Ft. Worth, there's too many  people -- it's crazy."  </P> <P> So many kids are flying alone these days that in some cities many airlines,  including United, TWA and American, have established special rooms where they  supervise kids during layovers.  </P> <P> Mary Taylor, who supervises the unaccompanied minor room at United's Denver  hub, has seen many children of divorce pass through.  </P> <P> "I had one little boy who had just come from visiting his dad in Florida, and  he started telling me, 'I'm gonna move back with my Dad. My Dad wants me.' He  was just on cloud nine."  </P> <P> Some of the older kids resent having to stay in the room with younger kids,  Taylor says. "They say, 'I'm big enough. I know what I'm doing.' I think a lot  of it has to do with the kids feeling like they're being used. . . . And I'm  sure they're frustrated with the fact that mommy and daddy can't be together."  </P> <P> Because air travel can be such a hassle, airlines prohibit kids under 5 from  flying alone. And those between 5 and 7 can take only direct flights. Some  airlines charge $30 for escorting kids to connecting flights.  </P> <P> In addition, the adult who brings the child to the airport must provide the  name, address and telephone number of the adult on the other end. The person  picking up the child must show identification, which is especially important if  there's a custody dispute, says United spokeswoman Sara Dornaker.  </P> <P> Carlson says parents need to prepare their children for the experience or  problems are bound to occur.  </P> <P> "Many kids don't know they ought to be drinking liquids and snacking, and they  sometimes forget to go to the bathroom," Carlson says.  </P> <P> And some of them end up very fatigued. "Adults have trouble understanding the  time perception of kids," he says. "A 5 1/2-hour flight can seem like a 15  1/2-hour flight to a kid."  </P> <P> Carlson says it's helpful to explain the concept of air travel in a concrete  manner, perhaps with a toy airplane. It's also useful, he says, to make a  cassette tape "saying aunt so-and-so is going to meet you at LaGuardia."  </P> <P> While flying alone can be troublesome, for some kids it also has benefits.  </P> <P> Jenna Ferer, 20, thinks commuting alone gave her an unusual sense of  independence, which later fueled her desire to travel worldwide.  </P> <P> "It gave me traveler's blood," says Ferer, who spent last year traveling alone  through Israel, Egypt, India and Nepal.  </P> <P> From the time Ferer was 5, she flew to see her dad in San Francisco and to  vacation with him in Cabo San Lucas. While traveling as a child in the United  States was no problem, she says, "The airports in Mexico were just a big mess.  I remember going through customs. It felt like being in a movie, with bamboo  and palm leaves on the roofs and a dirt floor in the terminal.  </P> <P> "I thought it was really cool," says Jenna, who often traveled with her  brother, who is a year older.  </P> <P> But Jenna often feared her father wouldn't be there to pick her up.  </P> <P> "We were put on a plane without anything being explained, and we were expected  to intellectualize it. I learned not to trust my feelings. . . . I think I was  upset about it, but I stuffed it down," she says.  </P> <P> Some kids don't hide their feelings. Dornaker, United's spokeswoman and a  former flight attendant, says she saw a 7-year-old girl and her 5-year-old  brother break into tears just after takeoff.  </P> <P> "They just sobbed their little eyes out after departure. I think it was the  first time they had been separated from the parent they were living with. It  was heart-rending."  </P> <P> The flight attendants tried to comfort the kids by serving their meal as  quickly as possible, and they soon cheered up. After the meal, Dornaker says,  the girl came up to her and said, "Did you find the tip we left on your tray?"  </P> <P> Michael is anything but anxious on a Thursday in February when he's flying to  Austin, Tex., to meet his dad for a short vacation.  </P> <P> Carrying a big black bag full of "junk my mom packed," Michael trudges through  the Continental terminal at LAX. "It's just a regular thing to me," he says.  </P> <P> While his mom, Laverne Maule, checks him in, Michael sits on a bench and draws  cartoons. A few minutes later, Maule gives him his ticket and pins an orange  badge onto his shirt, signifying that he's flying alone. Michael isn't pleased.  </P> <P> "It makes you feel really geeky," he says, scrunching his face.  </P> <P> When it's time to board, Michael and his mom walk up a ramp that leads to the  door of the plane.  </P> <P> "Guess I'll see ya Monday," Michael says, shrugging his shoulders.  </P> <P> "Yeah," Maule says, giving her son a kiss on the cheek. "Guess I'll see ya  Monday."  </P> <P> Michael acts as if he's going no farther than the bathroom. He's planning to  pass the time reading, playing Nintendo and talking to the other passengers.  </P> <P> For Maule, the trip is tougher.  </P> <P> "It would be better if he didn't fly so much," she says. "It's time consuming  and expensive, and there's some fear of problems happening. I worry until he  gets there, and I worry until he gets back."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : PACIFIC BEACH  </P> <P> The manager of a Pacific Beach fast-food restaurant was in fair condition  Saturday after having been kidnaped, robbed and shot by two thieves who whisked  him off a San Diego street and forced him to go with them in a car to Jamul,  police said.  </P> <P> The suspects, who accosted the victim on a Pacific Beach street at 10:30 a.m,  drove him 25 miles southeast to Jamul, where he was shot but managed to escape,  said Bill Robinson, a San Diego police spokesman.  </P> <P> The victim, manager of the Denny's restaurant on Garnet Avenue in Pacific  Beach, was identified only as Bob Lipske. He is in his mid-30s, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Many details of the case -- including the reason why Lipske was shot and how he  escaped his captors -- are unknown.  </P> <P> Lipske was shot in the abdomen, the spokesman said. The wound was not  considered critical, although Lipske was expected to spend at least one night  at Sharp Memorial Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Once free in Jamul, Robinson said, Lipske staggered to a fire station, where  authorities were notified. He was airlifted to Sharp.  </P> <P> Lipske was robbed of $5,800, the total of restaurant receipts that he was  carrying, Robinson said. He was about to deposit them in a Pacific Beach bank  when the two suspects approached him as he walked along Garnet Avenue and  forced him into the car, which was parked nearby, the police spokesman said.  </P> <P> The vehicle used in the kidnaping has since been recovered, police said.  </P> <P> San Diego police are seeking the two suspects on charges of armed robbery and  kidnaping, both felonies. Only vague descriptions were available.  </P></p>

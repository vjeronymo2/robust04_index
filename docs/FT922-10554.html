			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Trade News: US hits India's trade status in patent dispute PRESIDENT Bush yesterday slashed Dollars 60m worth of Indian products from its duty-free preference scheme for poor countries in retaliation for India's continued refusal to provide patent protection for foreign pharmaceutical and chemical products. The sanctions, imposed after years of US complaints, are directed towards Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and related products. Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, said the action is 'meant to be a rifle shot absolutely focused on the entities that are benefiting from the theft of our patents'. In the Uruguay Round and in bilateral negotiations with the US, India has resisted US demands arguing that, as a developing country, it is entitled to different 'rules of the game' in trade. However, under US pressure it last February agreed to expand market access for foreign films and provide more protection for foreign trademarks. 'Because India is negotiating in one areas it doesn't mean we are satisfied with how the pharmaceutical issue is being treated,' Mrs Hills said. 'We suffer the loss in this country of roughly Dollars 60bn in the theft of our intellectual property . . . We are as keenly interested in protecting intangible property as we are in protecting tangible property.' In a related action, Mrs Hills announced that under the annual 'Special 301' review, Taiwan has been added to a special list - along with India and Thailand - of countries considered the worst offenders in failing to provide intellectual property rights protection. They could be subject to retaliation this year. Although Taiwan has proposed improvements in its intellectual property laws, it has made 'little progress' in enacting or implementing them, Mrs Hills said. Thailand was listed because of failure to enforce copyright protection and deficiencies in its patent protection. 'Thailand is energetically trying to correct its problems,' Mrs Hills said. 'But there is a brand new government. I cannot tell you what action we will take until we meet.' Mrs Hills named nine trading partners, including the EC, to a 'priority watch list' for its inadequate intellectual property protection. The EC was named for its Broadcast Direction, which requires states to ensure 'where practicable' a majority of broadcast time for European programmes.</p>

The Council is concerned about the impacts on traditional fishermen and the rural coastal communities where they reside, focusing on those displaced by Americanization of the joint venture fisheries as well as those displaced from other declining fisheries and industries. An integrated industry is important in dealing with severe stock declines in other fisheries, most notably in the salmon industry, which also is stressing the shore-based processing industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the traditional whiting fishery must be viewed in the context of the overall groundfish fishery. Most traditional whiting fishermen (those receiving ``A'' permits in the limited entry fishery) operate in other groundfish fisheries as well. These fisheries have been managed under increasingly restrictive landing limits, and are harvested near their levels of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), which means they cannot sustain additional effort. Of the three options considered, Option 1 (the proposed rule) provides the greatest stability to the harvesting and processing communities in part because it provides for the longest season for the shoreside sector (which could last until late July/mid-October in 1994&hyph;1996) and should divert the greatest effort from other fully-utilized fisheries. Diversion of effort from these other fisheries is intended to prolong their seasons, delay reductions in trip limits, and maintain employment opportunities in both fishing and processing sectors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, the catcher/processor trawl fleet entered the fishery off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1990 and has targeted only on whiting. Consequently, its participation in the whiting fishery does not divert effort from other west coast fisheries, and, by taking the harvest guideline quickly, may reduce market opportunities for catcher vessels that do not process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The no allocation option (Option 3) could encourage a brief fishery conducted primarily by at-sea processors, with the entire harvest guideline being taken by the end of June. This would divert effort back to the other fully-utilized groundfish fisheries, could accelerate the need for reduced trip limits in those fisheries, and result in shortened seasons for the shoreside fishing and processing industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fishing opportunities for the at-sea fleet also have been substantially reduced, particularly off Alaska and the former Soviet Union, and therefore whiting has become more important to this fleet as well. The Council concluded that the social and demographic description included in the December 1992 EA/RIR (prepared for the 1993 allocation decision) clearly showed that the relative importance of whiting to the coastal communities exceeds the relative importance to the Seattle metropolitan area where most of the at-sea processing fleet is based (although a large percentage of employees are recruited from throughout the western United States). The Council agrees that neither sector should receive a disproportionate amount of the harvest guideline, as could occur under the no allocation option (Option 3). It also believes that the greater national benefit will be derived by giving some protection to the traditional catcher vessels that deliver to shore-based processors, and the communities in which they are based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although each of these options would influence participation by each sector, none of the options would preempt any sector entirely. The social impacts of Option 1 upon the Seattle-based at-sea processing fleet are small relative to those already occurring under the limited entry program. Because the fleet composition under the limited entry program is still relatively unknown, undertaking a rigorous social analysis is premature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council also recommended Option 1 because industry consensus in support of this option indicated a willingness to compromise that is unprecedented and should be encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> A LOOK AT THE 'CRISIS' WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Stop me if you've heard this before . . . didja hear the one about the hole in  the ozone layer? Oh, well, what about the one about the danger of global  warming? Oh, that too? Well, maybe the one about the perils of air pollution?  </P> <P> "Crisis in the Atmosphere" -- a comprehensive look at the major environmental  threats our planet faces -- covers all of these areas and more. But despite its  overall excellence, the program seems a little flat, a victim of the  I've-seen-this-somewhere-before syndrome.  </P> <P> That's too bad, because this "Infinite Voyage" segment airing at 8 tonight on  Channels 28 and 15, and at 9 on Channels 50 and 24, is definitely worth a look.  Producer-writer Lionel Friedberg delivers a well-written, well-illustrated look  at the ecological mess we've gotten ourselves into.  </P> <P> "Crisis" manages to avoid a strident tone, offering a neat balancing act  focusing on what one scientist calls the "spectrum of opinion in between the  extremes" -- those who believe it is already too late and those who believe  there is no problem in the first place. Segments include a look at a Swiss  laboratory charting atmospheric carbon dioxide build-up, a Colorado lab where  computers project global warming's effect on the weather, and an overview of  the work of the scientist who sounded the alarm about chlorofluorocarbons  destroying the ozone layer.  </P> <P> Of particular interest is the segment on the South Coast Air Quality Management  District's 20-year plan to reduce the sources of what sadly has become Los  Angeles' most visible features: smog. "Crisis" graphically illustrates the  problem and delineates the proposed solutions.  </P> <P> "Crisis" offers other solutions, ranging from reducing fossil fuel use to  controlling population growth -- issues that most politicians do their best to  avoid. "Crisis' " reasonable approach and measured tone can do much to advance  the environmental cause. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

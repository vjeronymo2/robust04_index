			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: No help from GM needed Sir, Is it me, or might one call Mr Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen a bit self-absorbed in thinking that US group General Motors is trying not only to destroy his company, but to undermine the Germany economy as well ('VW chief in furious attack on GM', July 28)? I may be wrong on this, but I would imagine that the German economy is perfectly capable of destroying itself with or without the help of Volkswagen or General Motors.

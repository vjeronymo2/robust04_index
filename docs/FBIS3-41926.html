BKA Warns Against Uranium </F> Dealers'']    [Text] The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA)  is sounding the alarm! Increasingly often, gangs of profiteers  from the ex-USSR are trying to sell nuclear material. In 1993  alone, 23 uranium dealers were caught, more than 150  investigation proceedings were instituted, and 50 kg of deadly  uranium was confiscated. BKA President Zachert told BILD:  ``With nuclear crime, a new quality of organized crime has  developed. It seems to be possible that nuclear material of  different origins is falling into unauthorized hands.''</p>

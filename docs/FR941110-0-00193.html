			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In cases of repeated or uncorrected deficiencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing a flat, one time civil money penalty for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies would ignore the statutory requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies as specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 1919(h)(2)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act. While we are providing in redesignated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.438 that penalties are increased for repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, we do not accept the recommendation to double  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fines because mandating the magnitude of the increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would detract from the kind of flexibility the Congress gave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Secretary and the States. With regard to uncorrected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, we may propose to increase a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty for those cases in which a lower level penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount was imposed should those uncorrected deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assign a flat, one time fine to a single deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of its seriousness does not take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration the factors included in section 1128A of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act and specified in &sect;488.438 of this final rule, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignores the fact that the Act mandates that a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty, when imposed, be computed for each day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance. The Act contemplates the imposition of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties for whatever period HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines the noncompliance exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter asked if the hearing officer makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assessment decision on the amount of the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As previously stated, when a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests a hearing on the noncompliance which led to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposition of the civil money penalty, HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not initiate collection of the penalty until a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative decision is rendered which upholds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of noncompliance. Upon further analysis, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are adding a paragraph to redesignated &sect;488.438 to explain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reviewability of the civil money penalty that is imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a SNF or NF for noncompliance with participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. We now specify that in any case in which an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative review authority) finds that the basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing a civil money penalty exists, as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.430, the administrative law judge or State hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer (or higher administrative review authority) may not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero; review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exercise of discretion by the Secretary or the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose a civil money penalty; or consider any factors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing the amount of the penalty other than those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified at &sect;488.438(f). In other words, when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative review authority) finds noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting the imposition of the civil money penalty, he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she must remedy it with some amount of penalty consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the ranges of penalty amounts established in &sect;488.438.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision is consistent with other provisions specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rule to motivate a SNF's and NF's compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements in which we state that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers have the opportunity to appeal certifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is also consistent with section 1128A(d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, which requires that specific factors be considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the amount of any penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.440&blank;Effective Date and Duration of Penalty <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received many comments on the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the civil money penalty. Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the effective date:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Be stayed if a hearing is requested;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Begin on the date an appeals decision is issued; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Begin on the date the facility receives notice of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter recommended that no civil money penalty be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed if the facility is in compliance by the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters advocated that this regulatory section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changed to require that the effective date of the civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty be the date when the deficiency began as can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be documented by the surveyors. They said that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date provision of the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Implies a ``grace period'' for providers to correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is inconsistent with OBRA '87;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contradicts &sect;488.230(a)(2) of the proposed rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Undermines the States' ability to use civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Defeats the deterrent effect of this remedy and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of encouraging prompt compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

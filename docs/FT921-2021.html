			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil proposals spark rally in coffee prices WORLD COFFEE prices moved sharply upwards yesterday on overnight news that Brazil's private sector had given the government proposals for a new international coffee pact with economic clauses. While it remains far from clear exactly what the proposals would entail, Brazilian government officials say that by next week the details will be ironed out on their negotiating position. They will present it to the International Coffee Organisation meeting in London early next month. London's May robusta contract closed last night at Dollars 874 a tonne, up Dollars 15 on the day, but still Dollars 1 below the high struck during trading last Thursday when Brazilian exporters announced that they were ending their opposition to an export quota system. In New York, the May arabica contract was 1.20 cents up by midday at 74.9 cents a lb. Leading associations in all sectors of Brazil's coffee industry - of growers, processors, exporters and instant coffee producers - have reached a consensus in favour of some sort of international quota system. This has convinced the government to run counter to its free market philosophy and support controls on the coffee trade. As the world's leading producer of coffee, Brazil is being cautious about the effects of a bold announcement of its goals in the negotiations. 'This is an enormously sensitive issue,' admitted Mr Clodoaldo Hugueney Filho, the foreign ministry's representative at the Wednesday meeting. 'It can affect the market, so we are going to be very careful.' Despite the apparent common front in the Brazilian private sector, there are still many dissenting voices opposed to the establishment of quotas. This may help determine the attitudes of Brazilian negotiators at the April 3 meeting of producer countries that will precede the general talks. Last year, Brazil exported 21m sacks, 33 per cent of the global supply. Mr Pedro de Camargo Neto, president of the Brazilian Rural Society, a producer group opposed to quotas, believes that most Brazilian private sector representatives are not inclined to accept a significant reduction in their output. 'If we go to quotas, it will have to be 30 per cent,' he said. 'Even my colleagues who are in favour of quotas believe that it has to be an agreement that is good for Brazil.' Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said last night that the Brazilians would have little option but to go for export quotas. The abandonment of export quotas in July 1989 is thought to have cost Latin American producers Dollars 6bn in lost revenues. Observers believe the April ICO meeting will not end with any concrete proposals for a new coffee agreement, but that negotiations will be well in hand. 'I think it's very positive,' said one analyst yesterday. 'It's the first time for two or three years that the Brazilians have tried to be helpful,' said a trader.</p>

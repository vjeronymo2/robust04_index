			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: THE LINE OF THE SUN BY JUDITH ORTIZ COFER (UNIVERSITY OF  GEORGIA PRESS: $19.95; 291 PP.)  </P> <P> Split into two equal and utterly different halves, Judith Ortiz Cofer's novel  concerns the break in tradition that defines the first generation of a Puerto  Rican family in New York. The narrator of the novel, Marisol, was born in the  family's native village, Salud, but was brought to the mainland as a baby. In  the first half of the novel, she tells the mythic tales of the Puerto Rican  village where her father and her wild uncle Guzman grew up together. Cofer is a  poet -- this is her first novel -- and in her descriptions of the small town,  her eye for detail brings alive the stifling and magical world of village life:  the seething hostilities carried over decades, the power of wives, the privacy  that people manage to maintain even in crowded shacks. A pious brand of  Catholicism puts the priest nominally at the center of village life. But  spirits are also a serious force to be contended with; cleansing and protecting  rituals are practiced daily, and the dead are as much a part of the village as  the living. Mama Cielo, mother of Guzman and Marisol's mother Ramona, receives  a rocking chair as an inheritance from her mother-in-law, but "not trusting her  motives even in death, Mama Cielo had always kept the rocker out on the porch."  </P> <P> From childhood on, Guzman is called "the devil's child" because of his  uncontrollable, wayward habits. Although his mother's favorite, he brings her  nothing but grief. At 15, he flouts all of Salud's conventions by running off  to live with La Cabra, a village outcast who is consulted in secret for love  potions but is openly scorned as the lost woman of the village. Guzman and his  best friend, Rafael, make plans to escape the village. For poor Puerto Ricans  who have never traveled beyond the nearby market town, the other place in the  world is Nueva York, "la tierra de nieve" -- the land of snow.  </P> <P> In the telling of these stories, Marisol is all but absent, surfacing only  occasionally in the identification of characters as "my uncle" or "my father's  family." The second half of the novel consists of Marisol's life in El  Building, a tenement in New Jersey where Rafael has brought his wife and baby.  Rafael is in the Navy and determined to become Americanized. On his rare visits  to his family, he speaks only English to his children and rarely reminisces  about his childhood. Marisol's knowledge of Puerto Rico comes mainly through  tales told by her mother of her wild brother Guzman, who has not been heard  from in years but continues to be the main topic in letters from Mama Cielo  back in Salud. When Guzman suddenly surfaces at El Building, Marisol finally  confronts a part of her family's past.  </P> <P> Cofer's narrative is a bit jerky, occasionally repeating itself, as if many  sketches had been strung together. But many of the passages are beautiful,  particularly the scenes where Guzman wanders Salud at night, taking leave of  the village he plans to abandon forever. The lasting impression from Cofer's  novel is the gulf that separates poverty-stricken life on the island and the  trapped, tenement life on the Mainland. Although all the immigrants say they  will return to Puerto Rico one day, funerals are the only thing that draw them  back. For the rest, their desire to return to the village only with all the  outward signs of success -- a big car, lots of money -- keep them as  inextricably bound to the life of El Building as they were in the native  village.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: RECOMMENDATION FOR EL TORITO GRILL -- WITH RESERVATIONS  </P> <P> You should probably know that although they will gladly take your reservation  when you call, and although the sign at the desk loudly proclaims "reservations  taken," they do not really take reservations at the new El Torito Grill, 9595  Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, (213) 550-1599. What they do is put you at the  head of the waiting list when you arrive. And although the restaurant has been  open barely a week, is the size of a small airport and is densely filled with  tables, that list is bound to be sizable by the time you get there. Already the  place is packed.  </P> <P> When you finally get a table you will discover that it is in a room so loud  that you won't be able to hear the baby at the next table crying. Once the  waiter has brought exotic drinks like Pink Cadillac Margaritas and mixed  guacamole at your table, you may not care. So you'll go on to various  combinations of tacos, taquitos, enchiladas and the like (all very reasonably  priced), or a rather ornate series of Southwestern specials. "It's a Hasidic  quesadilla," a man at one table was saying as we passed, contemplating a  concoction filled with smoked salmon, jicama, apples and toasted pinenuts with  cilantro and green chile pesto.  </P> <P> As for dessert -- are you ready for banana-filled chocolate enchiladas?

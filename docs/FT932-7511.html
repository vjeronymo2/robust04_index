			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Africa in Newbury THERE are theatres that you long to return to, regardless of the plays you see performed in them. On this, my second visit to the Watermill Theatre near Newbury, I was moved to find all as I had remembered: the mill-stream running fast round two sides of the little theatre, dozens of fish plopping out of the water, birdsong loud and varied. Inside the old group of redbrick buildings, the pleasant bar and restaurant (pity about the canned music), and - just before you enter the auditorium - a view of water hurtling past the millwheel. Such settings confirm a notion of traditional England. How the Watermill's directors must be tempted to continue that notion with a nostalgic, cosy, repertory. The thrill of this play, however, is quite the opposite. Athol Fugard's My Children] My Africa] - new in 1989, seen at the National Theatre in 1990 - plunges an audience straight into South Africa. Two different black generations are in conflict over the pursuit of racial equality. The teacher, Mr M, believes in the peaceable route of education; Thami, his brightest student, is involved in more violent protest. The main thrust of the play is in their dialectic, with frequently strong results. One snag, however: either man is mainly just a type, there to flesh out the debate within black South Africa. A play lives in its detail; Fugard gives us too little detail about these two. And too much rhetoric, with big Hollywood lines like 'What is wrong with this world that it wants to waste you all like that? My children] My Africa]' When Mr M. tells Thami briefly of his loneliness when Thami had deserted him for the new protest movement, we get a psychological insight that is welcome but rare. Between these two, however, there is the bright white girl Isabel. She beats Thami in public debate, she enters into an English-literature contest as his partner, she quickly learns to love Mr M. Although she too is there to embody another aspect of the debate, and to represent thousands like her, Fugard makes her an individual. We know of her reluctance to lose, her thrill in success, her ambitions to be a journalist, her rapacious eagerness for life and understanding. The imbalance between the roles may have been affected by certain small cuts taken (for the sake of political accuracy) by the director Alby James and his South African associate Molefe Pheto. This production is, in other respects, gripping. Burt Caesar and Len Trusty have been perfectly chosen for Mr M and Thami for vocal and physical reasons. Mairead Carty lights up Isabel from within straightaway. She knows how Isabel breathes: a little two-note giggle that punctuates her talk, a little outward puff through the nostrils that is part of her excitement. Too bad that Fugard ends the play by giving her one of the play's more corny Bette Davis lines ('The future is still ours, Mr M'). I prefer to recall her angry tears as she talks of her mother's repression and ignorance, because they do more to make South Africa come to life on a Berkshire stage. Watermill, Bagnor, Newbury, until June 12</p>

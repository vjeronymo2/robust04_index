			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: UAL chief 'far from satisfied' United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a sharp reduction in fourth-quarter net losses to Dollars 64m from Dollars 224m, leaving net losses for the full year at Dollars 50m, compared with Dollars 957m last time. One factor contributing to the improvement was the flight attendants' strike at one of its biggest rivals, American Airlines, last November. United also benefited from the fall in oil prices, which reduced the cost of aviation fuel. But like the other US airlines, United is continuing to suffer tough competition on its domestic short-haul routes from low-cost competitors, such as Southwest Airlines. Last month it negotiated a deal with its unions giving employees a majority stake in United in exchange for wage cuts and productivity improvements aimed at improving its competitiveness. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, said that although the fourth-quarter and full-year figures showed a vast improvement over the previous year, United was 'far from satisfied with what must be characterised as unacceptable results'. 'Further, an analysis by market shows that on domestic short-haul routes, we continue to report our most severe losses due principally to the rapid expansion of low-cost carriers and the clear preference of consumers for low fares.' Fourth-quarter revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn from Dollars 3.2bn, and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.02 from Dollars 9.27. For the year, revenues rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 14.5bn from Dollars 12.9bn and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.40 from Dollars 39.75 - though the previous year's full-year figure included an after-tax charge of Dollars 540m for accounting changes.</p>

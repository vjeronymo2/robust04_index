			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall as trading account closes FURTHER consideration of the UK government's autumn economic statement and profit-taking ahead of the close of the equity trading account prompted a sharp fall in government bonds and drove the FT-SE Index down through the 2,700 mark again yesterday. Disquiet was expressed by many City analysts on the outlook for government funding which, some suggested, might crowd out demand for equities next year. The latest inflation data, showing an unchanged annual rate of 3.6 per cent in October, was a slight disappointment while a regional survey from the Confederation of British Industry indicated that the UK economic recession was widening to afflict new areas. Losses in government bonds ranged to nearly a full point at the long end of the range. Index-linked gilts, the market's favourite inflation-hedge instruments, suffered similar losses. In equities, the weight of profit-taking fell on the Footsie-listed stocks. Many second-line issues, including motor industry stocks expected to benefit from the abolition of car tax, stood up well. The FT-SE Index, on the downward path from the opening, was additionally weakened as the premium on the December futures contract melted away. The Index closed 28.9 off at 2,697.5, near to the lowest level of the day. This week has seen the Footsie lose 5.2 as the Autumn Statement proved to have been well discounted. Traders moved in yesterday to take significant profits in consumer and building stocks and dollar weakness took toll of the international blue chips. Equity strategists appeared uncertain as to their views on the near-term outlook. While admitting that government funding problems could prove an important factor, one leading analyst concluded by saying: 'We are not worrying about gilts today.' Another commented: 'We need another one-point cut in base rates,' adding that Budget deficits could prove a problem 'down the road'. Profit-taking was fairly widespread but took in most of the retail and building stocks which had been regarded as the most obvious beneficiaries from the chancellor's moves to cut interest rates and to encourage economic activity. Seaq-reported volume was high at 622.9m shares, underlining the weight of the selling pressure. Thursday's 735.4m shares reflected retail business worth a healthy Pounds 1.3bn. Retail business recovered this week as investors anticipated the cut in base rates and reflationary measures in the chancellor's statement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "The Astronomical Military Expenditure </F> and Reduction of the Oil Income"]    [Text] Esteemed listeners. The clerics' regime which is  known to be a dictatorial, tension-generating one is constantly  seeking to purchase various kinds of weapons so as to continue  its evil actions, and it is expending astronomical sums for this  purpose. In the past few years, the clerics have formulated and  implemented extensive programs to expand their armed forces for  the purpose of suppressing the discontented people in the  country, and to continue their efforts to create tension abroad  in the past few years. These programs required enormous outlay.    What has transpired on this issue so far is that right from  the outset, the clerics' regime allocated nearly $40 billion for  this program and on the basis of the agreements, a large part of  the sum has been used and this program is expected to continue  in the future. At present, the clerical regime is seeking to  implement the last stages of its military program. In the past  five years, the officials of the Islamic Republic signed a $10  billion agreement for the ordnance purchases from Russia, a $3  billion agreement with the DPRK, and have completed a $5 billion  transaction with the PRC.    In addition, the clerics' regime is pursuing an ambitious  scheme to acquire a nuclear bomb and it is expected to implement  this scheme in the next few years. For this purpose, it has  initiated (?preparations) and is not stinting on any expenditure  in this regard.    The regime's megalomaniac policy of generating tension does  not take into consideration that it has already spent large sums  of tens of billions of dollars from the country's budget for the  purchase of miscellaneous weapons and is still pursuing this  policy. It is also motivating and encouraging various hardline  and Islamic fundamentalist groups in other countries which  demands even more expenditure on the part of the regime.    The clerics have displayed particular generosity in this  regard and have spent freely for this purpose. The training of  agents and the establishment of terrorist networks in most of  the countries of the world by the clerics' regime also entails  massive expenditure. It is obvious that to meet these costs, the  clerics' regime had counted on their oil income to a great  extent and this income has declined considerably at present.    In view of the fact that the reduction of the oil income has  not affected the regime's military program and its policy of  generating tension, and as we can perceive, the clerics continue  to pursue their policy of fanning discord and arming their  forces more than ever. Even if Iran is an affluent country, one  can foresee that in the not so distant future, it will become a  backward country and will bring the people face to face with  difficult conditions.    With the slump in oil prices on the international market and  a concomitant budget deficit of 20 percent, the rate of  inflation soared to nearly 30 percent per month. It is for this  reason that the regime is unable to pay its installments and  interest on the $28 billion worth of foreign debts. In brief,  the regime's purchases of ordnance and military equipment  continues unchanged but the oil income has dwindled. There is  no doubt that eventually, such a situation will be to the  detriment of the people in the future.    At present, more than two-thirds of our people are living on  or even below the poverty line. The regime is only extending  long term promises of future prosperity for resolving these  problems and is asking people to be patient and bear with them,  instead of providing some solutions. In general, the erroneous  policies and conduct of the regime has disrupted the lives of  the people on the one hand and with the implementation of its  military program on the other, it has created other (?problems)  for the outside world, which will transform Iran into a center  of even greater tension and crises in the region in the future  which will have unforeseen consequences.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)(i) The authorized official shall select among the cost estimating and valuation methodologies set forth in this section, or methodologies that meet the acceptance criterion of either paragraph (b)(3) or (c)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The authorized official shall define the objectives to be achieved by the application of the methodologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The authorized official shall follow the guidance provided in this section for choosing among the methodologies that will be used in the Damage Determination phase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The authorized official shall describe his selection of methodologies and objectives in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The authorized official shall determine that the following criteria have been met when choosing among the cost estimating and valuation methodologies. The authorized official shall document this determination in the Report of the Assessment. Only those methodologies shall be chosen:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) That are feasible and reliable for a particular incident and type of damage to be measured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) That can be performed at a reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) That avoid double counting or that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) That are cost-effective, as that term is used in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) Costs for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources are the amount of money determined by the authorized official as necessary to complete all actions identified in the selected alternative for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, as selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan of &sect;11.81 of this part. Such costs shall include direct and indirect costs, consistent with the provisions of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Direct costs are those that are identified by the authorized official as attributed to the selected alternative. Direct costs are those charged directly to the conduct of the selected alternative including, but not limited to, the compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted to the completion of the selected alternative; cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for the purpose of the action; equipment and other capital expenditures; and other items of expense identified by the authorized official that are expected to be incurred in the performance of the selected alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Indirect costs are costs of activities or items that support the selected alternative, but that cannot practically be directly accounted for as costs of the selected alternative. The simplest example of indirect costs is traditional overhead, e.g., a portion of the lease costs of the buildings that contain the offices of trustee employees involved in work on the selected alternative may, under some circumstances, be considered as an indirect cost. In referring to costs that cannot practically be directly accounted for, this subpart means to include costs that are not readily assignable to the selected alternative without a level of effort disproportionate to the results achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An indirect cost rate for overhead costs may, at the discretion of the authorized official, be applied instead of calculating indirect costs where the benefits derived from the estimation of indirect costs do not outweigh the costs of the indirect cost estimation. When an indirect cost rate is used, the authorized official shall document the assumptions from which that rate has been derived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost estimating methodologies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The authorized official may choose among the cost estimating methodologies listed in this section or may choose other methodologies that meet the acceptance criterion in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Nothing in this section precludes the use of a combination of cost estimating methodologies so long as the authorized official does not double count or uses techniques that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comparison methodology <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This methodology may be used for unique or difficult design and estimating conditions. This methodology requires the construction of a simple design for which an estimate can be found and applied to the unique or difficult design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unit methodology <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This methodology derives an estimate based on the cost per unit of a particular item. Many other names exist for describing the same basic approach, such as order of magnitude, lump sum, module estimating, flat rates, and involve various refinements. Data used by this methodology may be collected from technical literature or previous cost expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Probability methodologies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Under these methodologies, the cost estimate represents an ``average'' value. These methodologies require information which is called certain, or deterministic, to derive the expected value of the cost estimate. Expected value estimates and range estimates represent two types of probability methodologies that may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Factor methodology <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This methodology derives a cost estimate by summing the product of several items or activities. Other terms such as ratio and percentage methodologies describe the same basic approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

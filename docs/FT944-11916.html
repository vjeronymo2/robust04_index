			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally following currency intervention - Market Report Currency market developments set the pace for UK equities yesterday, pushing aside the market's second thoughts on the Bank of England's inflation report as it weighed the outcome of the regular monthly meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. Share prices slipped away steadily in the afternoon, but rallied sharply when the US Federal Reserve stepped in to rescue the dollar. A fall of 26 points on the FT-SE 100-share Index was cut to 15 at the close for a final reading of 3,081.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 2.3 off at 3,522. The equity market was led by British government bonds, which reacted sharply to the dollar's performance. Wall Street also recovered an early fall to edge into plus territory as London closed for the day. The session opened with the Footsie climbing just above 3,000 as the market at first extended its favourable response to the Bank of England inflation report announced late on Tuesday. But the mood had already been damped down by wider publication of the Bank's hint that UK base rates may still have to rise over the coming months to keep inflation on target. Equities were soon unsettled by falls in UK bonds. Confidence continued to crumble further during the morning, but it was not until London began to assess prospects for the opening on Wall Street and its reaction to the dollar's weakness that the blue chip international stocks turned distinctly downwards. London analysts doubted whether currency intervention alone would solve the dollar's problems, and noted that there had been no concerted action involving European central banks. Some suggested that markets would not settle down unless the US Federal Reserve took the next step in dollar support by lifting interest rates. However, such a step would apply pressure for a similar move in UK base rates. Oil shares, in spite of this week's good results from British Petroleum and from the major US companies, slipped lower. The chemicals sector was upset both by the dollar and by trends in some European chemical stocks. Pharmaceuticals, also closely influenced by the US dollar and by Wall Street, closed with minor losses. Good results from BAT Industries failed to protect the stock against weakness in the US currency. On the domestic front, views on the implications of the Bank's inflation report shifted a little after analysts had taken a closer look. Strategists returned to the perception that base rates would rise either at the end of this year or the beginning of next, whatever happened in the meantime. Suggestions that the Bank might want to act sooner were parried with the comment that it would be difficult to explain an early rate rise in the wake of the Bank's favourable comments on inflation. Retail stocks, always the most closely linked to interest rate prospects, edged higher yesterday but this in part reflected good trading news from J. Sainsbury, the food supermarket group. Seaq volume rallied from a slow start but the day's total of 493.6m shares was below Tuesday's figure. Traders believed that much of the day's business reflected hurried position switching by marketmakers as the mood turned in what has become a highly volatile UK stock market. Customer, or retail, business has remaind fairly satisfactory, and returned a worth of just above Pounds 1bn on Tuesday. But some analysts point out that a significant fall in the daily total of bargains transacted implies that genuine investment business in the UK stock market is being concentrated in fewer and fewer institutional deals. These deals benefit securities houses with good lists of institutional clients but leave others on the sidelines.</p>

Dr. Sha'th told reporters that today marks the beginning of  a  return to negotiations here in Taba on the basis of the  principles included in the agreement and the concepts worked out  in Cairo. He noted that this meeting, which has brought us  again to Taba, will lead us in the shortest possible time to  formulate a full agreement on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.  He described today's negotiations in Taba as successful and  useful, noting that all issues were reviewed in preparation for  forming subcommittees tomorrow to formulate clauses relating to  security, the transfer of civil powers, and the general  agreement. He voiced his hope that this work will be completed  as quickly as possible. [passage omitted]</p>

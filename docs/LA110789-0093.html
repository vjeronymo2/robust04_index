			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PLAYING SENDS DANE TO NEW HEIGHTS  </P> <P> Cara Dane's work around the volleyball net has her up around the clouds these  days.  </P> <P> After several stellar performances this season, Dane, a senior middle blocker  at Los Alamitos High School and The Times' Athlete of the Week, is now flying  the friendly skies of recruiting trips.  </P> <P> Last weekend, Dane visited Duke University. Soon she will be taking a trip to  California. In all, Dane said nearly 50 schools have contacted her.  </P> <P> "I get sick of the calls from half of the (recruiters)," Dane said. "But it's  also important to me because I want to get a scholarship."  </P> <P> Tuesday against El Dorado, Dane had 28 kills to lead Los Alamitos to a 15-5,  15-10, 15-6 victory. On Thursday, she had 16 kills in a 15-3, 15-9, 15-4 loss  to Esperanza.  </P> <P> "She can go anywhere she wants," Los Alamitos Coach Jami Moore said. "She has a  3.8 (grade point average) and there is a scarcity of middle blockers.  </P> <P> As with many top volleyball players, club volleyball has helped improve Dane's  performance. Dane played with the Mission Valley Club before this season.  </P> <P> "Club is where my whole game is," Dane said. "You have to try out for the team  so the teams are generally better (than high school teams). It's a lot more  intense -- but you can do more things with your ability."  </P> <P> Despite the dropoff in competitive level from club play and league play, Dane  is looking forward to the Southern Section playoffs.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos (10-5 overall, 6-4 in the Empire League) has clinched third place  and a playoff spot for the second consecutive season. Los Alamitos will play at  San Gabriel Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Dana Birch swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, to lead the Estancia High School  girls' tennis team to a 15-3 victory over Newport Harbor Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tanja Brix, a sophomore at University High School, won her second Sea View  League cross-country championship in 17 minutes 33 seconds at Irvine Regional  Park Friday.  </P> <P> Marni Hichborn had 22 kills to lead the El Dorado girls' volleyball team to a  15-11, 12-15, 15-10, 15-7 victory over Villa Park Tuesday.  </P> <P> Cathi Peck won the Pacific Coast League cross-country title with a time of  18:40 at Laguna Hills High School Friday to help Woodbridge win the girls'  championship.  </P> <P> Martha Pinto of Katella won the Empire League cross-country title with the time  of 18:38 at Carbon Canyon Park Friday.  </P> <P> Cara Dane  </P> <P> Los Alamitos High School  </P> <P> Position: Middle blocker  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-2, 150, Senior.  </P> <P> Last Week: Dane had 28 kills in a victory over El Dorado and 16 kills in a loss  to Esperanza.  </P> <P> Season: Dane averages 18 kills a match.  </P></p>

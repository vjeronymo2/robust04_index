			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: Lu Ping: Poor Start to Vital Visit] </F>   [Text] So, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, you have finally got here. It has taken you a  while, but let us hope the wait has been worth it.    It must be said that first impressions left a lot to be  desired. You arrived at Hung Hom KCR station without saying a  word, despite the fact that a senior member of your entourage  said that the New China News Agency (Xinhua) was organising a  press conference for you. Xinhua staff later denied knowing  anything about a press conference.    This looks really bad. It gives the impression that either  you, Xinhua, or perhaps both have very little idea about either  the art of public relations, basic organisational skills or  perhaps both. We would like to think that matters will improve  on this front.    The less time you spend inside the luxury Xinhua villa in  Stanley the better.    Many things have changed since your last visit in 1992, some  that you know about, some you do not. So make the most of your  visit. Make sure that by the time you leave you know what is  going on in Hong Kong. In theory, that should not be difficult.    You can start by talking and listening to as many different  people as possible, not just the fawning flunkies who will be  crawling at your feet every step you take.    Relying on information from a bevy of pro-Beijing sycophants  is both silly and dangerous. Silly because the majority of  these people have not got the guts to tell you anything that you  do not want to hear. Dangerous because it leaves you in the  dark about what is really going on in Hong Kong and what most  people here are thinking.    When you talk to people, speak in plain terms, not in  diplo-babble. Let them know what is happening about the new  airport, Container Terminal 9, and all the other big issues that  need to be sorted out as soon as possible for the good of the  territory.    The average person in Hong Kong wants reassuring that life  will go on as normal for them and their children after 1997.  They want to know what China is doing to guarantee the  much-touted "stability and prosperity" of Hong Kong. They want  to believe that China understands both how Hong Kong works and  the people who live here.    There are many things people do not want to hear. They do  not want to hear you attempt to score a series of political  points against Governor Chris Patten or the British government.  They certainly do not want to hear yet another round of  bickering between you and the Governor. They do not want to  know. They are bored with it. They have heard it all before.    They have already told you through an opinion poll conducted  by this newspaper that your decision not to meet Patten was a  bad one. Seven out of 10 people interviewed thought you should  talk to him.    The exchange of unpleasantries that accompanied the snub was  also unnecessary. You said you were too busy to meet him. He  said: "I've got a busy programme...so I don't feel particularly  neglected." What nonsense. How silly.    When you are listening, listen hard. Again, do not just  listen to people who are going to tell you what you already  know. Listen to people who may tell you things you do not want  to hear (there are plenty of them).    One thing many people in Hong Kong have to say is: "If it  ain't broke, don't fix it." In other words, the less  interference, the less meddling, the better.    How times have changed since your last visit in 1992. Then,  it was all sweetness and light -- well, almost. There were  occasional spats about the airport (at least some things do not  change) and changes to the committee structure of the  Legislative Council, a subject that seemed controversial at the  time.    That, of course, was before the arrival of that "Man of  Guilt" Patten and his strange ideas about electoral reform.    In 1992, Lord Wilson (then just humble Sir David) said his  regular meetings with you were a good idea as they gave both  sides a chance to discuss matters of concern. It is just the  sort of jolly sensible thing that a reserved and scholarly  diplomat would say. And he was right, of course.    But Lord Wilson is history, as are many of the policies and  attitudes associated with his governorship. Gone are the days  when almost every legislative councillor accepted almost  everything they were told by government. Gone too is a  government that snaps to attention every time Beijing barks an  order.    Instead, we have political parties that bicker and rant just  like political parties do in other countries. We have  legislators who make a nuisance of themselves by calling for  inquiries and asking difficult questions.    All this may appear rather odd to you, even disturbing. It  was always going to be easier to inherit a docile population  accustomed to doing what it was told.    Please take careful note that this is not the case. Beijing  should know this. Times have changed. Please change with them.    We hope you enjoy your stay and look forward to your next  trip. Let us hope it is not another two years before you visit  again. You cannot afford to wait that long. Nor can Hong Kong.</p>

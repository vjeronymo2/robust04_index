			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Labour may end role of unions in leadership elections THE ROLE of trade unions in the election of Labour leaders could end this autumn, it emerged yesterday, as the party ordered an inquest into what went wrong in its general election campaign. Labour's packaging of policy was also under attack last night from deputy leader Mr Roy Hattersley, who told ITN that the Sheffield election rally 'epitomised five to 10 years of mistakes'. The move to end the unions' role would significantly reduce the party's historic links with the trade unions. It follows mounting criticism of their conduct in the current leadership contest, not least the refusal of several of the largest to ballot members. Front runner in the leadership race, Mr John Smith, meanwhile, was putting the finishing touches to a 6,000-word manifesto to be launched today aimed at quashing criticism that he has so far offered few new ideas. A novel proposal in the document is for a 'special commission' into social justice aimed at creating a broad non-Tory consensus on how to reconcile pressing social needs without unduly raising the tax burden. It would ally political parties with interest groups and aim to put fresh pressure on the government. The shadow chancellor will also emphasise his intention to run an open-door leadership, responsive to the views of all sections of the party. Mr Robin Cook, his campaign manager, said last night: 'He wants the leadership election to open up debate about the future, not to close it down.' Labour's national executive committee had agreed that the rules for future leadership elections should be reviewed immediately and the review completed before the party's conference in October, Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, said. He would not rule out the possibility of ending the electoral college system which gives 40 per cent of the votes to unions and 30 per cent each for MPs and individual members. The current leadership battle between Mr Smith and Mr Bryan Gould, which will be over by July 18, would not be affected by any changes. Meanwhile, plans for an investigation into Labour's election defeat were under way, as members of the NEC asked the organisation committee to conduct a comprehensive inquest into what went wrong, and to report before the autumn conference. But a preliminary assessment by Mr Whitty concluded that voters' last-minute fears of the uncertainties over the recession and the impact of a Labour victory had scared them into the Conservative camp. Mr Neil Kinnock, party leader, said: 'It was a choice between fear and hope and fear was what won out.' Mr Hattersley said the party had to answer the question of why people's fear of Labour had cost it the election. There were two or three explanations. 'Certainly the lies about Labour tax policy frightened a lot of people. The question is why we didn't overcome those lies,' he said. Criticising the emphasis on packaging, he told ITN: 'We have packaged our product wonderfully. We have packaged it so well that too many people have described the package without describing the contents.' Labour's lucky 13, Page 8 Editorial comment, Page 20</p>

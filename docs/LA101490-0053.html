			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: INSPECTOR IMANISHI INVESTIGATES BY SEICHO MATSUMOTO (SOHO:  $9.95)  </P> <P> The foremost mystery writer in Japan, Seicho Matsumoto has published more than  450 books; "Inspector Imanishi" first appeared as a magazine serial, then as a  novel in 1961, and sold more than 4.5 million copies. Eitaro Imanishi, the  title character, is an unassuming but respected cop in Tokyo's murder division.  </P> <P> A low-key, understated character in the best American pulp tradition, he also  writes haiku and raises bonsai (hobbies it's difficult to imagine Sam Spade  pursuing). When a body mysteriously appears in the Tokyo railway yard, Imanishi  begins a curious chase that takes him from the posh hangouts of the avant-garde  Nouveau Group to a spa in rural Honshu. In addition to being a good whodunit,  "Inspector" offers a vivid portrait of the confused Japanese culture of the  early '60s: The dignified old abacus maker/poet/calligrapher Imanishi  encounters at the hot springs and the affected, Westernized artists of the  Nouveau Group represent two strains that continue to divide Japanese society.  </P></p>

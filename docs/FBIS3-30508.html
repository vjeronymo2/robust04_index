			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A while ago we received from the Foreign Affairs  Ministry a Slovak Government memorandum on our country joining  the Partnership for Peace program.    The memorandum points out that the NATO summit brought  closer  the prospects of Slovakia's full incorporation into a developed  Europe, including the economic, political, and security aspects  thereof. The summit has offered further possibilities of  involvement in setting up new models of cooperation within  Europe by supporting the development of the European security  and defense (?identity).    The Slovak Republic is aware that the development of  security  mechanisms is a process. These mechanisms will guarantee  stability on the continent. This has been reflected in the  proposals and programs put forward by the Brussels summit. The  Slovak Republic will continue to pursue its initiatives aimed at  obtaining full NATO membership, as well as the security  guarantees that are needed for successful completion of the  economic transformation and the strengthening of democracy, says  the Slovak Government's memorandum about [Slovakia] joining the  Partnership for Peace program.</p>

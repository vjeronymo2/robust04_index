			<p>BFN     [Text] Conducting a conscientious investigation and study  by delving deep into the nine unprofitable and difficult  enterprises of Shijiazhuang city, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, pointed out: To resolve  enterprises' difficulties, we cannot be lazy, but should use the  spirit of reform to make explorations and use reform methods to  resolve difficulties.    Cheng Weigao said: Many reasons contribute to enterprises'  deficits. We should wait, depend on nothing, and adopt  different methods for them. As for enterprises that have been  running in debt and have suffered serious losses for a long  time, Cheng Weigao maintained: We should help them upgrade and  update their products, accelerate technological transformation,  and develop new products. Or we should help them use existing  resources to carry out some other production. In the course of  transforming mechanisms of enterprises and readjusting their  production and operational structures, we should help  unprofitable enterprises accelerate the readjustment of their  organizational structures by encouraging them to incorporate or  integrate themselves with others, to narrow their accounting  units, to carry out the system of being run by the people but  owned by the state, and to bring in foreign funds. For  enterprises whose products are readily marketable, whose market  prospects are relatively bright, but nonetheless suffer losses  and are forced to stop production owing to a temporary lack of  circulating funds, Cheng Weigao demanded: Such enterprises  themselves should mete out plans for reducing losses, and  governments and banks at all levels should help them tide over  difficulties. In particular, for unprofitable enterprises which  engage in production throughout the year and continue to sell  their products, the unprofitable enterprises which engage in  production on a season basis and sell their products throughout  the year, and the enterprises whose products are related to the  national economy and people's lives, the financial, tax,  banking, industrial, commercial, and other related functional  departments in all localities but suffer losses should give  appropriate treatment to them within the scope of their powers.    Cheng Weigao stressed: This year, most reform measures will  be set forth. Party committees and governments at all levels  should become even more liberated in their ideas, even more  dynamic in reform, and better in mental state in order to help  unprofitable enterprises surmount difficulties and get out of  difficult state on the basis of conducting in-depth  investigation and study.</p>

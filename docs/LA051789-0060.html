			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEW AIRPORT ON DENVER BALLOT; SEATTLE WEIGHS HEIGHT LIMITS  </P> <P> Voters in the mile-high city decided in a referendum Tuesday whether to build  the city's proposed new airport, a $2.3-billion project supporters claim will  give Colorado an economic boost and opponents contend is not needed.  </P> <P> The $1-million, months-long public relations campaign leading up to the  referendum was the most expensive on an issue in the city's history.  </P> <P> The airport, to be built 28 miles northeast of downtown Denver on 53 square  miles of land annexed from Adams County, would be called Denver International.  </P> <P> Supporters, who include all members of the state's congressional delegation,  Gov. Roy Romer and Mayor Federico Pena, contend the airport will make Denver a  major transportation hub and guarantee the state's economic viability for years  to come.  </P> <P> J. D. MacFarlane, a former Colorado attorney general and a leading opponent of  the new airport, contends it is not needed and claims the city will recover  from its slump without the project.  </P> <P> In Seattle, meanwhile, voters were deciding whether to preserve their mountain  view and put a height limit on one of the tallest downtown skylines in the  West.  </P> <P> About 25% of Seattle's 291,903 voters were expected to vote on their  referendum, prompted by complaints about the "Manhattanization" of the city.  </P> <P> The so-called CAP referendum, for Citizens Alternative Plan, would limit new  buildings to 450 feet, about 38 stories, and restrict density downtown for 10  years while a long-range plan for urban Seattle is put in place.  </P> <P> The city of 500,000, situated across Puget Sound from the Olympic Mountains,  already has more than 10 buildings higher than 450 feet.  </P> <P> In other voting Tuesday, Pittsburgh residents were to decide whether to  nominate a 71-year-old "Jewish grandmother" for a full term as mayor in a  five-way Democratic primary that will give the winner almost certain victory in  November.  </P> <P> Mayor Sophie Masloff, 71, was City Council president last year when she was  appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri.  </P></p>

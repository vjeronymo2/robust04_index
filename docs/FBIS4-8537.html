			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Excerpt] Knin, April 11 (TANJUG) -- President of the  republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) Milan Martic said the R.S.K.  accepted talks with Croatia on economic relations, but on an  equal footing.    After talking with U.S. Zagreb Ambassador Peter Galbraith  Monday [11 April], he assessed that the plan for economic  cooperation of the international community, that is, the  conference on former Yugoslavia and Croatia offered contained  [as received] a number of elements with which the R.S.K. agreed  and with which it could agree.    At the beginning of the talk with Galbraith, Martic issued a  strong protest to the U.S. Government and U.S. President Bill  Clinton because of, as he put it, "unprecedented bombing of Serb  positions" around Gorazde in southeastern Bosnia.    This act of force did not contribute to peace and must not  be  repeated, said Martic, recalling the mutual commitments of the  R.S.K. and the Srpska republic (R.S.) on joint defense.    Galbraith told newsmen NATO action around Gorazde was  justified and that the U.S. has responded to commitments to the  allies in NATO, the international community and the U.N.    The U.S. NATO planes bombed Sunday and Monday (April 10 and  11) positions of the Srpska army near Gorazde, a Moslem enclave  and U.N.-declared safe area, which should have been  demilitarized last spring.    Galbraith stated satisfaction with the talk on Monday and  stressed he expected complicated talks between the  representatives of the R.S.K. and Croatia and believed in its  success if both sides, as he said, showed flexibility. The  R.S.K.-Croatia accord on cessation of hostilities, signed on  March 30 at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, was being implemented  successfully. [passage omitted]</p>

Under the  new situation in which the socialist market economy system is  being promoted and established, this is an important measure to  strengthen macroeconomic management in order to maintain  people's living conditions and deepen price reform.    Maintaining relatively stable prices of basic necessities  and  services for residents has a direct bearing on the immediate  interests of the broad masses of the people, as well as on  economic development, the deepening of reform, and social  stability. Among commodities and services included in the  "circular" by the State Council for supervision and examination,  most have had price restrictions lifted and have been handed  over to local governments for management. Of these, most are  basic necessities such as the "shopping basket," "rice bag," and  "stove," which account for a relatively big proportion of  residents' expenditure. Changes in the prices of these  commodities and services have already become a focus of concern  among the masses. To stabilize the prices of basic necessities  and services for residents, the party and government have  already adopted a series of measures, such as increasing  effective supply, strengthening macro regulation and control,  and, in particular, grasping agriculture and the "shopping  basket" project. This time, the State Council has decided to  carry out supervision and examination of the prices of 20  commodities and services, and this is another practical thing  done by the party and government for the masses of people.    At present, the prices of an absolute majority of  commodities  and services have had restrictions lifted, and this is an  important achievement of price reform. However, having lifted  restrictions on prices does not mean that the duty of price  reform has already been accomplished. According to the goals  and demands of the reform of the economic system decided at the  14th party congress, the duty of price reform is to establish  pricing mechanisms in which prices are mainly formed by market  on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to establish a sound  and effective system for the government to regulate and control  market prices. Although we have done a great deal of work in  this area over the years, we still lag behind the goals set by  reform. Recently, the rise in the general level of prices in  the whole country has been relatively big, and the market price  order has been chaotic. One of the reasons is because  corresponding reforms in the macroeconomic regulation and  control and price regulation and control systems have not  followed suit, and because there is no effective regulatory and  control measure to deal with the great increases in commodities  prices after the lifting of price restrictions. The  announcement by the State Council on implementing the "circular"  is a measure for the government to guide and moderately  intervene in market prices after the lifting of restrictions on  prices, and, with this, to promote and establish a price  regulation and control system. This is another practical step  in taking the initiative to adapt to the development needs of  the socialist market economy and deepen price reform.    The price regulatory and control measures mentioned in the  "circular" have a precondition, that is, respect for  enterprises' right to decide prices at their own discretion.  The focus of the supervision and examination is not to stop  enterprises from exercising their power to fix prices of  commodities and services which have already had price  restrictions lifted; it is to carry out appropriate restrictions  on the strength and frequency of price increases for certain  commodities within a certain period of time, and the purpose is  to prevent prices from soaring. The "circular" has set out the  general principle and demand of when the government carries out  price intervention, whereas concrete implementation procedures  will be worked out by local departments in charge of prices  according to actual conditions in localities and will be  implemented after securing approval from local people's  governments.    A price regulation and control system adapted to the needs  of  a socialist market economy must be perfected step by step during  the practice of reform. Establishing a system of supervision  and examination of the prices of basic necessities and services  for residents is an exploration into establishing a new system  of price regulation and control. We believe that with common  efforts by various localities and relevant quarters, and with  the support of the broad masses of the people, the  implementation of this system will surely play a positive role  in deepening reform, stabilizing the overall situation, and  maintaining people's living conditions.</p>

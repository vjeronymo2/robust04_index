			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / First all-seater football league stadium is taking shape SEATING room only: one of the first all-seater football league stadiums to be built since the Taylor Report in 1990 on ground safety is taking shape in south-east London. Millwall FC's 20,000-seat stadium at Senegal Fields will replace The Den nearby, with its 3,000 seats and 17,000 standing places. The Den was built in 1910 at a cost of Pounds 10,000. The Pounds 15m project to build the New Den is on schedule for completion by August. The club's offices will move in May. The cost has been met with the help of Pounds 5m from the sale of the old ground, a Pounds 2.7m grant from Lewisham council and Pounds 2.75m from the Football Trust. The new ground is multi-purpose and of the first 70 licensed events only 36 are football matches. The stadium will have a hospitality suite for 500, a total of 32 executive boxes, compared with three at The Den, and an adjacent sports centre. Millwall Holdings, which runs the club, is one of only three league football clubs quoted on the Stock Exchange. The club is in the Barclays League Division One.</p>

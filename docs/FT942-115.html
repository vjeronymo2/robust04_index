			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Earnings gap for men now 'widest this century' The wages gap between the best and worst paid male workers in Britain is now bigger than at any time this century, according to a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The institute found the pay gap had widened rapidly since 1977. It says that, in real terms, hourly wages for men in the bottom tenth of the earnings league are now below their 1975 level. Wages of the top 10 per cent are more than 50 per cent higher. The report, entitled What Has Happened To Wages?, produces new evidence linking wage levels with education. In 1978 the education 'mark-up' - the percentage difference in wages between men with some post-school education and men who left school at the minimum age - was 41 per cent. By 1990 it had increased to 66 per cent. However, the study, finds the workforce is becoming significantly better educated. Almost 20 per cent of workers born after 1957 had some post-school education, compared with 13 per cent born before 1935. The study also finds that the rise in inequality cannot simply be explained in terms of skill and educational differences. Among men aged 20 to 28 with no post-school education, wages showed significant variation between 1978 and 1992. Wages for the top 10 per cent increased 25 per cent while for the bottom 10 per cent wages (in 1994 prices) fell from Pounds 3.64 an hour in 1978 to Pounds 2.95 an hour in 1992. Overall, 50 per cent of male workers in their 20s earned less per hour in 1992 than the median wage of similar workers in 1978. The report suggests that a minimum wage or job subsidies should be examined. It also notes that several countries - including the US, Canada and France - still have a wider pay disparity than Britain.

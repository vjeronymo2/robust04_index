			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Changes to FT London Share Service statistics WITH EFFECT from today readers of the London Share Service pages will start to notice a capital 'N' against the names of some companies. The symbol indicates that the version of the company's earnings used in the FT's price:earnings ratio and other statistical calculations have been changed to the 'headline earnings' formula devised by a sub-committee of the Institute for Investment Management &amp; Research (IIMR) and proposed in draft form in early March. The FT has chosen the formula proposed by IIMR because it represents the broadest available consensus on a 'single number' treatment of earnings. Although still subject to final review it constitutes the considered response of the institutional investment community to the adoption by the Accounting Standards Board of Financial Reporting Standard 3 on corporate earnings (FRS 3). UK companies will not be required to report their results in line with FRS 3 until after June 22. Many have already done so, however, and the Financial Times has been taking full account of this for the past three months in its company reporting. We believe the number of companies complying with FRS 3 is now large enough to justify using a new basis for earnings wherever it is required for statistical purposes. The aim of the IIMR headline earnings formula is to include a company's actual activities during the reporting period, including those activities which have been with the company only for part of the period. Key features are: All trading profits/losses are included in the earnings number. Items which are abnormal in size or nature are included but should be flagged. Profits and losses on the sale of fixed assets or of businesses should be excluded. This does not apply to assets acquired for resale, such as marketable securities. Profits and losses arising in activities discontinued at some point in the period, or in activities acquired at some point in the period, should remain in the earnings figure. Costs of eliminating a discontinued operation, or of making an acquisition, are excluded. Although it will be surprising if we do not encounter difficulties with some individual companies' figures, we are confident that the IIMR headline earnings formula will provide a factual and robust basis for the statistical calculations on which FT readers rely. Further information on the FT's treatment of earnings is available from The Manager, FT Statistics, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.</p>

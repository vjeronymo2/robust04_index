			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Westinghouse warns of first-quarter earnings dip Westinghouse Electric, the US conglomerate, issued a profits warning last night, confirming recent comments by chairman and chief executive Michael Jordan that the company would perform worse in the first quarter of 1994 than a year before. In a statement after the market closed, Mr Jordan said earnings per share for the period were likely to be 10 cents, down from 14 cents in the first three months of 1993. Higher pension costs and a lower income from licensees were behind the fall, along with a one-time gain from the sale of two radio stations in 1993. Operating profits for the period would be down 10 per cent, he added.</p>

The Political Bureau considered  the developments that have taken place in the country and  discussed ways to settle the current crisis. The Political  Bureau highly praised the efforts to render national dialogue a  success. "The Political Bureau discussed the manifestations of  the continued series of assassinations [words indistinct] and  the other national forces [words indistinct] the assassination  of struggler [words indistinct] in al-Bayda' governorate on 6  January 1994 in Sanaa, and the continued military mobilization  actions and the harassments [word indistinct]. The Political  Bureau noted that these practices are viewed as a serious  exacerbation of the crisis and are a sign on the increasing role  of the quarters and parties that wager on aborting national  dialogue [words indistinct] push the homeland towards the brink  of a catastrophe and [word indistinct] destructive civil war  that will destroy everything and from which only the enemies of  the people will benefit."    "The Political Bureau has warned against threats posed by  the trend attempting to use the agencies of the united state as  a cover to execute the scheme of division, kill democracy," and  "destroy the homeland's unity."    "The Political Bureau stresses that these actions will  exacerbate the crisis, completely conflict with the results and  guidelines reached by the national dialogue committee, and place  obstacles in the face of any objective solutions to the current  crisis."    The Political Bureau also warns against deteriorating  economic conditions and a drop in the citizens' standard living  conditions. It also warns against the growing political crisis  and deteriorating security conditions.    The Political Bureau also notes that there are "fabricated  factors and reasons that are accelerating economic collapse."  These include smuggling, currency forfeiting, speculation in  currency, mishandling of public funds, and the drop in the value  of the national currency. The Political Bureau stressed the  need for finding quick solutions to the economic conditions.    "The Political Bureau concludes that the current crisis is a  comprehensive one with political, economic, social, and [word  indistinct] dimensions and requires quick, comprehensive,  objective, and responsible solutions."    "The Political Bureau notes that the only serious solutions  to the current crisis lie in preserving unity," and the building  of a "democratic, modern, and united state based on a  decentralized, democratic system of local government." Such  solutions would ensure a higher degree of "political  participation by all citizens of the homeland;" help achieve  "economic, cultural, and social progress;" and "strengthen  unity, and end all manifestations and consequences of division."    The Political Bureau stresses the need to give particular  attention to the "issues related to the people's security,  freedom, living conditions, and progress."    Finally, the Political Bureau urges "all political forces,  parties, and organizations and the masses to display further  awareness, cohesion, and unity." It also urges them to silence  the "drums of war," prevent the "conspiracies of partition and  division" and to preserve "unity and democracy."</p>

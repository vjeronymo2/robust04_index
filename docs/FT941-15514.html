			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Embarrassment of riches: UK banks are addressing the problem of how to employ an unfamiliar excess of capital After five years of grappling with huge bad debts, inadequate profits and dissatisfied customers, British high-street banks face an unfamiliar concern. They may be about to start making too much money. 'It makes me more worried about the industry than I've been for a long time,' says one director whose bank is moving from bad times into good ones. Following the lean years when banks made low profits - some even lost money  -and three cut shareholders' dividends, a cash pile does not appear the worst of problems. But when the TSB Group yesterday reported a rebound from breaking even in 1992 to a Pounds 301m pre-tax profit last year, it marked the start of what could be a testing era for bank managements. The broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd estimates that the nine biggest UK banks will add Pounds 3.7bn to their capital this year, 10 times their retained (after tax and dividends) profits of Pounds 369m in 1992. As bad debts fall, a big rise in banks' income will show through. 'Banks have been huge consumers of capital, but are becoming cash cows,' says Mr Peter Toeman, an analyst at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker. Some improvement appeared inevitable. Banks' profits usually rise when economies recover because bad debts fall, and they can earn more from lending. But the scale on which UK banks are now starting to generate cash is greater than in the past for a number of reasons: Managements tried to offset the unprecedented bad debts of the downturn by raising income. They widened interest rate margins on loans, and charged higher fees to businesses and personal customers for services such as cheque clearing. Mr Toeman estimates that returns on assets such as loans have risen about 25 per cent since 1989 as a result. They have also boosted profits by shedding staff and cutting branch networks. Barclays and National Westminster this week announced that they plan 7,700 job losses between them on top of previous cuts. While cost-cutting and the introduction of new technology raise short-term profits, income may be curtailed in the long term because there are fewer branches through which to sell products. Banks traditionally absorb excess capital by taking on fresh loans. But there has been weak demand for loans so far as the economy picks up. Some companies have repaid bank loans, and replaced them with equity and debt securities. Many private customers are wary of taking on debt. So banks may find they are holding capital without the conventional means of employing it. Banks are inherently more profitable as a result of shedding businesses which made inadequate returns. National Westminster decided last year to abandon retail banking in France after it reviewed its operations to see what return they were likely to achieve on average during complete economic cycles. Such judgments have made banks smaller and more profitable despite short-term costs. For all these reasons, banks are likely not only to make but to retain more money than in recent recoveries. As bank executives point out, this might not be a problem in other sectors. 'When industrial companies have cash, people view it as a war chest, a sign of strength,' says Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of TSB Group. But banks face distinct pressures, both because of public perception, and the constraints of the industry. First, customers may be offended by large profits because they have become disenchanted at standards of service. 'There is a hard core of dissatisfaction with banks,' says Mr Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association. A degree of public unpopularity may make banks vulnerable to the imposition of windfall taxes by the government. This was done in the recovery from the 1979-81 recession when Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, then chancellor, imposed a tax on interest-free deposits. Some bankers privately fear a repetition. 'Our profits are particularly emotive,' says one chief executive. Second, banks with capital to spend are at risk of losing more money than other types of company if their investments turn sour. Banks are allowed to lend about 20 times their capital, using money from their depositors and money markets. This means that if a banking venture goes wrong, they stand to lose not just their own investment, but up to 20 times that amount. Thus, shareholders tend to be worried if their banks acquire excess capital. Third, well-capitalised banks may try to lend more despite weak demand. This will lead to competition that could push down margins on lending, and erode fees. There is already evidence of falling margins on loans to large companies, and some banks have frozen small business charges this year. Finally, the more capital a bank has, the harder it is to achieve good returns on it. Banks have adopted returns on equity as their main measure of profit. Barclays is aiming for a 15 per cent after-tax return, and NatWest for a return of 17.5 per cent. The targets are testing in an era of low interest rates. These factors will militate against banks holding excess capital. The problem is defining the right amount. Banks must have at least a 4 per cent ratio of core capital - mostly equity and reserves - to risk-weighted assets. But ratios of 7 per cent are common in the US. 'Four per cent has become old hat,' says Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive. Most banks are rebuilding capital lost as a result of bad debt problems, and are yet to reach the core capital-to-assets ratio of 6 per cent which most industry experts now regard as reasonable. Even after reaching that point, the size of losses from bad debts in the last recession - four times that of previous cycles - could make them anxious to retain capital. 'We face a lot of uncertainty. The view that the world is now a smooth and easy place is not the only one,' says Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive. Yet banks cannot simply sit indefinitely on their cash. 'Banks with too much capital may be able to tough it out for a couple of years, but they will have to do something eventually,' says Mr Ian Harley, Abbey National's finance director. Banks will then have three options. One is to return cash to shareholders. Royal Bank of Scotland sent a signal a month ago by raising its shareholders' dividend for last year by 25 per cent. The expectation that dividends will rise substantially over the next two years is one reason for the sharp rise in banks' share prices last year. Raising dividends too ambitiously would be risky because they might have to be cut again in the event of another recession. Some bank directors muse about returning cash in ways that would not have to be repeated, such as buying back shares. Others look askance at such ideas. 'When I talk about giving money back, everyone looks at me as if I am completely mad,' says one director. A second way of using capital would be for banks to invest in their existing businesses. NatWest and Barclays, for instance, have a target in their investment banking arms in south-east Asia and the US. Banks concentrating on retail banking in Britain could invest in technology and branch improvements. The third possibility is to take over a rival. Many bankers believe there are too many financial services companies competing for custom in the UK. Lloyds tried to take over Midland on these grounds in 1992. As banks generate capital, they will have the capacity to buy each other or take over life insurers, for example. But the process of consolidation is not assured. Banks made costly errors in their last buying spree in the 1980s when they acquired foreign banks which lost money. Mr Chris Ellerton, an analyst at S G Warburg, the stockbroker, says they are likely to be cautious about purchases that do not bring clear benefits. 'The scars of the last mistakes have not healed yet,' he says. The target returns on capital which banks have adopted mean they could find it difficult to find appealing acquisitions. They could thus be left with capital for which they have no obvious use. After the lean years, this may seem like a pleasant challenge. But it could become an unwelcome problem before too long.</p>

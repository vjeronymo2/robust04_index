			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cape cut by lower interest income CAPE, the industrial services and building products group controlled by Charter Consolidated, yesterday reported a slight fall in profits because of lower interest income. Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 11.9m in the year to March 31. Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chairman, said the results were satisfactory given recession in the building industry. At the interim stage, profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 6.52m. Interest income fell from Pounds 1.08m to just Pounds 11,000. The company said cash resources plunged Pounds 12m because of working capital needs and capital expenditure. Turnover increased 21 per cent to Pounds 245.2m, helped by acquisitions and strong overseas sales. The latter rose by more than a third and now account for 44 per cent of turnover, compared to 39 per cent a year ago. Operating profits gained 2 per cent to Pounds 13.2m and were depressed by losses at two building products companies. The building and architectural products division saw profits fall from Pounds 6.88m to Pounds 6.48m while industrial services increased 10 per cent to Pounds 6.69m. Acquisitions, which included the purchase in December from William Baird of contractor Darchem, contributed Pounds 4.9m of sales and Pounds 211,000 of operating profits. Earnings fell from 15.3p to 14.9p. The final dividend is 7.75p for a total of 10.75p (10.5p).</p>

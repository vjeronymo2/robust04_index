			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  ABOUT WINE: EYES OF TEXAS ARE UPON THE GRAPE  </P> <P> It may be hard to imagine a dust-covered, chaps-bedecked cowpoke ridin' in off  the range, hopping down from his steed and asking for a Sauvignon Blanc.  </P> <P> Be assured that the folks at what has been called Domaine Texas don't envision  that image either.  </P> <P> In fact, Domaine Cordier -- the real but most un-Texas-like name of the ranch  -- hopes to appeal to the growing number of sophisticated wine lovers in Texas'  major cities as well as a curious national and international market that  wonders, "Can Texas grow fine wine grapes?"  </P> <P> Well, perhaps no one really wonders about that at present, but after the first  wines of this new property have been released, interest should be sufficient to  sell all that's being made on the range, somewhere south of Odessa.  </P> <P> The first wines of Domaine Cordier will be released to the market in a month.  They were unveiled last week in Dallas and by judicious use of the U.S. mail  and telephone, I not only have tasted the wines but I have also interviewed the  key people responsible for them.  </P> <P> The first wines, which will be distributed in California through Seagram's  Chateau and Estates division, include a Sauvignon Blanc ($7.50), a Chardonnay  ($12) and a Fume Blanc ($8.50), all from the 1988 vintage. A line of red wines  is to be released next year.  </P> <P> The white wines are well made, with the accent on freshness. I preferred the  Sauvignon Blanc to the others. It offers a typical grassy/herbal aroma and  crisp, citrusy aftertaste. The Fume Blanc, which was aged in oak, is more  herbal and complex, but a bit disjointed at present. The Chardonnay is a  light-styled wine with little perceptible oak, and a delicate finish.  </P> <P> Domaine Cordier made 4,000 cases of the Chardonnay, 10,000 cases of the  Sauvignon Blanc and 4,000 cases of the Fume Blanc. That may seem like a lot of  wine, but it's really piddling compared to what the property could have made.  </P> <P> That is because total vineyard plantings thus far are Texas-size: 1,000 acres  outside the southwest Texas city of Ft. Stockton. This means Domaine Cordier  could easily produce 250,000 cases of wine by itself, should it choose, and  very well may when grapevines are fully mature and producing a full crop. Most  have been planted in the last five years.  </P> <P> Wine lovers know the name Cordier. It is the huge French firm that owns such  world-renowned Bordeaux properties as Chateau Gruaud-Larose, Chateau Talbot,  Chateau Meyney and others in Bordeaux.  </P> <P> In addition, Cordier, which does more than half its business in exports, also  owns two properties in Vouvray and two more in Sancerre and was a logical  choice to invest in the germinating Texas wine industry because it has worked  on experimental wine-growing projects in such remote and hitherto hostile  climates as Venezuela, Thailand, and Brazil.  </P> <P> Moreover, the French firm owns Cordier Coutras, 50 miles from Bordeaux, a giant  production facility that makes wines for the French table wine market. It also  produces some base wines for sekt (German sparkling wine) sold to Germany. It  processes about 4.5 million gallons of wine each year.  </P> <P> Grape growing and wine making began in Texas in the early 1970s after a  feasibility study done for Texas A&amp;M University showed that fine wine  grapes could be grown in West Texas. Soon, experimental vineyards were planted  through the University of Texas on a high plateau east of El Paso.  </P> <P> The region around Lubbock became an early producer of fine wine in Texas.  Lubbock, in the Texas hill country in the northern part of the state, is an  hour's drive east of the border to New Mexico, which surprisingly has a long  and rich wine history of its own.  </P> <P> A second region that showed promise, about 1978, was in Tow, about 90 miles  northwest of Austin in the center of the state, adjacent to Buchanan Lake.  There, Ed and Susan Auler began to make fine wine from both French and  French-American hybrid grape varieties. Today their Fall Creek winery is one of  the state's best and most consistent.  </P> <P> The Cordier property developed by the University of Texas about 250 miles  southwest of Lubbock -- and just 100 miles from the Mexican border -- was  originally a joint venture between local interests and Cordier, which acted as  consultant and was a 24% owner.  </P> <P> The venture marketed wines under the brand name Ste. Genevieve (who was the  saint of Paris). Despite the desert-type climate in Pecos County, the region  had a built-in bonus: very cool nights.  </P> <P> So instead of fast-maturing, overripe grapes, one could count on a long growing  season similar to the fine wine regions of the world. Also, on this 3,000-foot  high plateau, there was no rainfall late in the growing season and no humidity  to fret over, meaning that rot, a feared enemy of wine makers, was  non-existent.  </P> <P> Indeed, in the Lubbock area to the north, rot devastated many of the early  winery projects, their owners failing to recognize the severity of the problem.  One Texas wine maker told me recently, "The good ol' boys would rather go  huntin' and fishin' than spray to keep the mold down, and then the grapes'd  come in so black and rotten you couldn't make a decent wine with 'em to save  your life."  </P> <P> For various reasons, the Ste. Genevieve wines didn't sell and in 1987 Cordier  agreed to take over complete control of the project.  </P> <P> Jean-Louis Blanc of Etablissments Cordier in France, who was in Texas to launch  the new brand, said he felt the Texas vineyards had the potential to make great  wine, not merely interesting wine.  </P> <P> "My first impression is that Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon (Blanc),  and Chenin Blanc will be the best varieties," he said.  </P> <P> Unique in this project is a drip-irrigation system in which each vine gets the  appropriate amount of water, doled out by a computer in France.  </P> <P> "We control the water by use of an electronic system," said Blanc."There is a  sensor on the vines that measures the amount of water in the vine. This sensor  speaks to a computer at the winery that is connected to a computer in France,  which determines the (water) need of the vine."  </P> <P> The Ste. Genevieve brand, launched in 1984, will continue to be seen in Texas  as a lower-priced wine. And other Domaine Cordier wines will be available only  in Texas.  </P> <P> Cordier markets wines in 52 countries and David Milligan, president of Chateau  and Estates, said he would show the wines to the trade at the huge VinExpo wine  show in Paris in June. He said there is already interest in Scandinavia and  Japan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Measure of Fame  </P> <P> Besides Auler's Fall Creek project (which is now beginning to market its wines  in California), Bobby Cox's Pheasant Ridge winery near Lubbock has achieved a  measure of fame with some worthy Chardonnays and Cabernets. They are, alas,  priced so high (about $20 a bottle) that even the well-heeled have to swallow  hard to support a fellow Texan.  </P> <P> Despite problems experienced by some Texas hill country wineries, a number have  achieved success. One of the largest is Llano Estacado, which has broad  distribution in Texas but little in California.  </P> <P> One of the more energetic projects to surface recently is a winery called  Teysha, an Indian word meaning friend. It is a project of Clint McPherson and  his son, Kim. Clint was a founder of Llano Estacado and Kim was wine maker  there before both left the partnership.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $13 Million Invested  </P> <P> Cordier is taking its Texas project seriously. It has invested $13 million and  has brought in a wine-making team from France, Lucien Viaud to direct the  vineyard and assist in wine making and Jean Louis Haberer as head wine maker.  </P> <P> "We are all very excited," said Milligan. "We're trying to produce something  that is world class, something that will compete with anybody."  </P> <P> Wines of the Week: Preston Vineyards Estate White and Estate Red ($5 each) --  This is what inexpensive table wines should be. Rather than buy some sweetish  wine called Chardonnay (that may have as much as 75% Chardonnay), try the  Preston Estate White, a blend of four varieties that offers a spicy aroma and  broad yet dry aftertaste. The red, which is 77.5% Carignane and the rest  Zinfandel, is a light-bodied, chillable wine that goes great with pasta. A  berryish note is appealing. (Bonus points to the first person who correctly  finds the misspelled word on the back label of the Estate White. Answer in a  few weeks.)  </P></p>

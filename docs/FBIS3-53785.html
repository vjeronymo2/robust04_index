PPP Parliamentary sources told Dawn that both the Bhutto  ladies had decided to sort out their differences without  involving anybody else and issuing statements against each other.    The PPP parliamentary party held a meeting at the Prime  Minister's House on Sunday [16 Jan], which Begum Nusrat Bhutto  was not at all expected to attend.    But, according to sources, everybody was surprised when she  entered the hall where the meeting was about to begin. All the  participants stood up and loudly said: "Welcome, welcome."    Begum Bhutto then went to the Prime Minister and kissed her.  She also kissed Mr. Asif Ali Zardaris's forehead.    Begum Bhutto, the sources said, kept smiling during the  meeting and exchanged pleasantries with the members. According  to one member, she said how could she quarrel with her own  daughter, specially when Mr. Nawaz Sharif and his colleagues  were all out to take advantage of a family feud.    The sources said Begum Bhutto also briefly chatted with Mr.  Shabbir Chandio, MNA [Member of National Assembly] from Larkana,  and told him that she had decided to work out an amicable  solution to differences with her daughter, without involving  anybody else.    The sources said that the Prime Minister had a detailed  meeting with President Farooq Leghari on Saturday [15 Jan] night  and discussed with him Begum Bhutto's quarrel with her and her  partymen. The President assured her that he would meet PPP's  former chairperson after he returned from a tour of Saudi Arabia  and try for a reconciliation between the Bhutto ladies.    The sources also termed it a ceasefire and according to Ms.  Rukhsona Bungush private secretary to Begum Bhutto there would  not be anything special for another "three or four-days." She  was tightlipped when approached for further comment. She  however, said: "Things are improving, you better wait."    The sources said the Prime Minister and Mr. Asif Ali Zardari  drove to Begum Bhutto's house on Saturday night without any  protocol. They stayed there for quite some time and discussed  their differences on a number of issues.    Begum Bhutto reportedly broke into tears and embraced and  kissed her daughter. She said she was not expecting the Prime  Minister and her husband.    The sources claimed that there was a gradual thaw in  relations but were the mother and the daughter.    "Both Begum Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto have ultimately  realized that their differences could be exploited by the  issueless Opposition led by Nawaz Sharif," a source said,  claiming that a formula was being worked out for a permanent  peace between them.    The entire press corps of the capital reached the Parliament  building on Sunday just to have a first-hand report on the  differences between the Bhutto ladies since Begum Bhutto was to  move a privilege motion and a resolution in the National  Assembly [NA] secretariat to discuss Jan 5 incident at Larkana.    Almost the entire I'ML (N) [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz]  parliamentary party took part in Sunday's proceedings sensing  that there would be a lot of fireworks in the National Assembly.    However, according to NA secretariat sources, she had  decided  not to move any motion in the House.    Party sources said it was difficult to say at this stage  that  differences between the Bhutto ladies had been removed. But the  sources sounded quite optimistic that the meeting held on  Saturday night would ultimately lead to a rapprochment between  the mother and the daughter.</p>

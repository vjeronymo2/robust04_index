			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ENCINO WINS, GETS REMATCH WITH SEOUL  </P> <P> Chris Ferebee struck out nine and Steve Chavez hit a two-run home run Wednesday  as Encino defeated Orland Park, Ill., 7-3, to advance in the Pony League World  Series.  </P> <P> Encino must defeat Seoul tonight and again Friday to win the championship.  Seoul defeated Encino, 4-0, Tuesday.  </P> <P> Chavez's third-inning home run scored Glen Carson and gave Encino a 3-2 lead.  Orland Park, which committed seven errors, made three in the third, allowing  two more runs to score.  </P> <P> With his team trailing, 2-0, in the first, Encino's Justin Paperny singled to  drive in Cesar Martinez, who had doubled.  </P> <P> Orland Park scored a run in the fourth and Encino countered with two insurance  runs in the sixth on Kevin Deitch's double and an RBI single by Jesus Perez.  </P> <P> Although there is no official significance attached to the win, Encino Coach  P.C. Shaw considers it tantamount to the national championship.  </P> <P> "We don't get outclassed by anybody," Shaw said. "Check the record -- Encino  just won the United States."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS observer Lyudmila Aleksandrova under </F> the general heading "Speakers Elected": "In the Federation  Council"]    [Text] The upper chamber of the new Russian parliament --  the Federation Council -- has finally acquired a chairman. As  expected, he is First Vice Premier Vladimir Shumeyko.    True, the intended plan somewhat "misfired": Vladimir  Shumeyko was one vote short in the first ballot, and a whole  five votes short in the second (the minimum necessary being 86  votes). In the second round he was only two votes ahead of his  main rival Petr Romanov. According to observers, this stance by  some Federation Council members who refused to support Vladimir  Shumeyko was largely due to the fact that he is viewed by many,  if not exactly as "the president's man," at least as a  representative of the president's team who is called upon to  fulfill the will of the head of state, imposing it on parliament.    Nevertheless, in the course of last night the attitude of  some Federation Council members changed sufficiently to allow  the first vice premier to muster even more votes than necessary  -- 98.    From the very beginning the newly elected chairman drew an  implied distinction between the Federation Council and the State  Duma, hinting that the upper chamber should positively differ  from the lower when it comes to constructive approach and the  absence of political confrontation. In particular he  highlighted the fact that he would not permit any "lobby  intrigues" or split in the upper chamber. For this purpose  Vladimir Shumeyko asked for a time-out until the following  morning in order to carry out consultations before the election  of deputy speakers. In his words, preliminary discussion of the  candidates is needed so that the vote should not lead to a split  in the chamber and political polarization. He refused to tell  journalists the names of possible candidates for the posts of  his deputies, but obliquely intimated that one of them should be  a representative of the Communists or their sympathizers.    Of special interest is the concept of possible relations  with  the State Duma as voiced by the chairman of the upper chamber.  All the signs suggest that the president's team has already  "rehearsed" the scenario of actions in the event of  nonconstructive forces ultimately gaining the upper hand in the  Duma. At any rate Vladimir Shumeyko stated literally the  following: Under the Constitution, the Federation Council as an  organ and its individual members possess legislative initiative.  The same goes for members of the State Duma. And "in an  extreme case," he went on, it will be possible "in cooperation  with Duma deputies, who really desire to do something, to  elaborate legislative acts in joint committees and commissions  and adopt them straightaway right here."</p>

Their  tete-a-tete meeting took place in a constructive atmosphere at  the Richmond hotel. The two ministers came to the conclusion  that the hostilities between Croats and Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must end immediately. Future relations will  be determined on the basis of an agreement.    The future status of Muslim and Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina appears to be controversial. Proposals have  ranged from the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina along  cantonal lines to the setting up of republics within a  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    The talks, according to reports, were the first to be held  in  a completely frank atmospohere and could form a basis for a  solution.    Croatian Minister Granic explained the features and basic  guidelines of the Croatian-FRY statement on the normalization of  relations: It deals exclusively with humanitarian issues and  those connected with communications and is in no way targeted  against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The negotiating circles say that the international community  as well as influential countries have been putting pressure on  both sides to reach an agreement. The talks held so far appear  to have taken this course.    Minister Granic will this afternoon meet the Austrian and  Romanian foreign ministers who are attending the talks between  Cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg and representatives from the  countries neighboring the former Yugoslavia. He is also  expected to meet Silajdzic once again late this evening.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CONFIDENT WOODARD HELPS VILLANOVA WIN  </P> <P> As it turned out, all Villanova's Greg Woodard needed was some encouragement.  </P> <P> "I told him he could become the best shooter in the country before the game,"  Villanova Coach Rollie Massimino said.  </P> <P> The junior forward responded by making six of eight three-point shots and  scoring 28 points as the Wildcats beat No. 14 Louisiana State, 93-91, in the  Tip-Off game Saturday at Springfield, Mass.  </P> <P> "I believed him," said Woodard, who averaged 11 points a game last season.  "After talking to coach Massimino, I always feel like a different player. He  gives me confidence."  </P> <P> Massimino said his team needed the outside shooting because it couldn't handle  7-foot-1 center Shaquille O'Neal.  </P> <P> "We tried four of five different ways to stop him," Massimino said. "And he  still got the ball, because he is so big and strong."  </P> <P> Despite getting in early foul trouble, O'Neal finished with 24 points and 11  rebounds.  </P> <P> The Tigers pulled to within 92-91 with 47 seconds left on a tip-in and foul  shot by Harold Boudreaux. But then O'Neal, who played most of the second half  with four fouls, missed a baseline jumper and Villanova's Lance Miller got the  rebound with three seconds left.  </P> <P> Miller, who finished with 16 points, was immediately fouled and extended the  lead by making one of two free throws.  </P> <P> No. 5 North Carolina 99, San Diego State 63 -- The Aztecs got closer than 20  points only once in the second half at Chapel Hill, N.C., when Arthur Massey's  layup made it 57-38 with 18:12 left. But a 16-6 run capped by two free throws  by George Lynch with 12 minutes left extended North Carolina's lead to 73-44.  </P> <P> No. 7 Alabama 72, Delaware 47 -- The Crimson Tide wore down the Blue Hens with  a tough defense and a deep bench at Tuscaloosa, Ala.  </P> <P> Alabama pulled away in the last 10 minutes, taking a 53-33 lead on Robert  Horry's jump shot with 7:55 left. The Tide's first 25-point lead came with 3:56  remaining when Marcus Jones' jumper made it 63-38.  </P> <P> No. 8 Indiana 73, Santa Clara 69 -- After the Broncos pulled to within 51-46  with 11:50 left in the semifinals of the Maui tournament at Lahaina, Calbert  Cheaney scored seven consecutive points in the next 1:52 to give the Hoosiers a  58-46 lead and they held on to win.  </P> <P> Santa Clara had a chance in the final minutes, but Damon Bailey twice passed to  Eric Anderson for layups as the 45-second shot clock wound down. After a  rebound basket by LaCoby Phillips' with 15 seconds left made it 71-67, Cheaney  made a dunk shot with eight seconds to play.  </P> <P> No. 16 Georgia Tech 100, Augusta 63 -- Jon Barry made three three-point shots  to key a 28-0 run that enabled the Yellow Jackets to erase a 12-point deficit  at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Augusta led, 35-23, with 6:57 left in the first half when Barry made the first  of his three-point baskets, starting the run that put the Yellow Jackets ahead,  44-35, at the half. Tech scored the first seven points of the second half and  continued to build its lead.  </P> <P> Kenny Anderson scored 24 points and had 11 assists for the Yellow Jackets.  </P> <P> No. 17 Connecticut 68, College of Charleston 52 -- John Gwynn and Chris Smith  each made a three-point basket during a 15-6 run with 6:02 left that enabled  the Huskies to pull away at Storrs, Conn. Smith led all scorers with 27 points.  </P> <P> No. 21 Georgia 90, Richmond 45 -- The Bulldogs used runs of 17-0 and 12-0 to  easily win the Richmond, Va., tournament title.  </P> <P> Georgia set a tournament record for points in a game and winning margin. The  45-point defeat was the worst for the Spiders under 10-year coach Dick Tarrant.  </P> <P> Litterial Green led the Bulldogs with 27 points, including 20 in the first  half.  </P> <P> No. 25 St. John's 135, Central Connecticut 92 -- Malik Sealy set a record with  43 points and helped the Redmen extend their unbeaten record in the title game  of the Joe Lapchick tournament at New York.

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Trade News: PepsiCo expands bottling in China PepsiCo, the US food and soft drinks group, has reached an agreement with the Chinese government that will let it open 10 new bottling plants in China over the next five years, at a cost of Dollars 350m (Pounds 235m). The group already has eight joint-venture bottling plants in China and announced last week that it was setting up a ninth. The new deal, though, would give the group its first access to China's vast interior, more than doubling the group's sales volumes in China, PepsiCo said. The new bottling plants will be joint ventures with government subsidiaries and will produce such PepsiCo-branded drinks as Pepsi-Cola, 7UP and Mirinda, with other carbonated and non-carbonated beverages under local brands. PepsiCo entered China in 1982, since when its production for the market there has risen to 40m cases a year. It said the new agreement would put it at the forefront of international investment in the world's largest consumer market.</p>

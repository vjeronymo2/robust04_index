			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Rathbone Brothers - the heritage continues Family traditions in the City die hard, and none more so than at Rathbone Brothers, the private client banking and asset management group, where William Rathbone, 58 - the tenth of that name and a direct descendant of the company's founder - has just joined the board as a non-executive director. Rathbone, right, is currently director and chief executive of the Royal United Kingdom Beneficent Association (Rukba), a UK charity working on behalf of the elderly. But his main business assocation was with The Ocean Group, the marine freight services company, which he joined in 1959 and stayed with for 29 years, working in Liverpool, West Africa and London. His numerous activities with the group included developing a tanker and bulk division. He joined Rukba in 1988. The charity has an annual turnover of Pounds 8m, with 300 full-time employees and 750 volunteers. It has been 96 years since the last William Rathbone was involved in the management of the eponymous company, founded by William Rathbone II in 1742, when it was a merchant and shipbuilder, based in Liverpool. William Gair Rathbone VII - great-grandfather of the new appointee - retired as a partner in the firm in 1898, when Rathbone's London office closed, not to re-open until 1988, when Comprehensive Financial Services merged with Rathbone. The company's newest director has two children - including William Rathbone XI.</p>

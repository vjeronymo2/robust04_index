			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Four steps to haven ONE OF the taxman's best kept secrets is that, with careful planning, foreign nationals living in the UK can often avoid paying any tax at all. For such people the UK is an excellent tax haven. It is surprising how many foreign nationals do not know this, or, if they do, fail to take action in time, particularly as the amounts of tax at stake are sometimes very large. Consider Mr B, a Middle Eastern businessman, who came to the UK with his family in March 1980. He has Pounds 2m cash in a bank outside the UK and a London residence worth Pounds 300,000 which he acquired in 1986. He uses the deposit interest to meet his living expenses, and he also used it to fund his house purchase. He dies in 1997, his wife having predeceased him. He leaves everything to his children, who all wish to remain in the UK. He has had no contact with the UK Revenue. After his death, his children learn that to obtain probate they must pay inheritance tax of Pounds 860,000 on his worldwide estate of Pounds 2.3m. They then learn that the estate faces an income tax bill of Pounds 640,000 for 17 years' unpaid income tax. Finally, they discover that the entire Pounds 1.5m tax bill could have been avoided if their father had taken four steps. Most of the steps depend upon Mr B having retained his foreign domicile. One's domicile is one's permanent home. Provided appropriate action is taken, foreign nationals living in the UK can often retain their foreign domiciles for many years. The first step Mr B should have taken is to bring capital rather than income into the UK. The capital must be 'clean' capital, that is, it must not contain capital gains or income accruing while Mr B was resident in the UK. This should not have been difficult for Mr B to arrange. He could have put all his cash into one offshore bank account (the capital account) before coming to the UK, and opened a separate, initially empty, offshore account to which the interest earned on the cash would be credited. He would then draw on the capital account alone. So long as Mr B is domiciled outside the UK, only income and gains brought into the UK are subject to tax, and as the capital account contains neither, money paid from it to the UK is tax free. If Mr B exhausted the capital account and had to draw on the income account he would have become liable to income tax on the income brought into the UK. But he could have avoided the tax if, before drawing on the income account, he had restructured it by closing it down and opening suitable new accounts. This is the second step. It requires timing and planning, but it can be used to wash out the income tax liability and create a new 'clean' capital account, which can be drawn on free of tax. The third step is for Mr B to put his non-UK assets, ie his cash, into a suitable offshore trust. This ensures that UK inheritance tax on the cash is avoided on his death. Under the inheritance tax regime, foreign assets are only free of inheritance tax if their owner has been resident in the UK for tax purposes for less than 17 of the last 20 tax years. As tax years cut across calendar years, it is not uncommon for someone who has been in the UK for little more than 15 calendar years to be caught and their worldwide assets become subject to inheritance tax on their death at the rate of 40 per cent above Pounds 150,000. Mr B could have avoided this by putting his assets into a suitable trust. before the 17-year period elapsed. So long as the trust assets are kept out of the UK, no inheritance tax is payable. If the trustees are resident and the trust is run outside the UK, it can be used to avoid capital gains tax in the long term, and to defer income tax. The trap foreign domiciliaries most frequently fall into is to fail to create a suitable trust until it is too late. Anyone of significant means who arrived in the UK more than 10 years ago should be considering creating such a trust. This leaves the house. There are various ways of avoiding tax on it, but the least expensive and most satisfactory is for Mr and Mrs B to make appropriate wills. Under conventional wills it is not possible to avoid inheritance tax on a couple's residence, but inheritance tax at current rates on the first Pounds 300,000 of the matrimonial home can be avoided. This technique, which involves the use of discretionary trusts is also available to UK domiciliaries and I will describe in a future article. If Mr B had used these strategies the tax bill on his death would have been reduced from Pounds 1.5m to nil. Prompt action on arrival in the UK is essential and can pay immense dividends. Even so, with careful planning it is usually possible to achieve significant tax savings provided the 17-year period has not expired.

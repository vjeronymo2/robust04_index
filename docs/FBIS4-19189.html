			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egon Klepsch, president of the European </F> Parliament, by Hartmut Hausmann; place and date not given: "The  Balance Is Positive"]    [Text] [Hausmann] Mr. President, what balance can you  draw for the third electoral term of the directly elected  Parliament?    [Klepsch] I am convinced that the European Parliament [EP]  has gained significantly in importance and influence since the  last direct election of June 1989. This is an essential  understanding that I have gained during my official visits to  the 12 European Union members states, the EFTA [European Free  Trade Association] countries, and outside Europe. In many  countries outside the EU, the European Parliament is regarded as  a model and symbol for democratic parliamentary activities, as a  guarantor for democratic control and the protection of human  rights. The long, untiring efforts by the European Parliament  for stronger, extended powers is reflected in the Maastricht  Treaty. The important thing now is for the European Parliament  to do justice to its new role and contribute to the solution of  pending problems in cooperation with the other EU institutions.  I hope that the citizens of the EU now understand that this  Parliament supports their causes and interests. The voters  should make themselves aware that disenchantment with politics  or with Europe will not get us anywhere. On the contrary, the  fourth direct election to the European Parliament in mid-June  will offer an opportunity for everybody to co-determine the  course of the further process of European integration.    [Hausmann] What were for you personally the highlights of  your presidency in the past two and one-half years?    [Klepsch] Two essential events for the entire history of the  European Community, the signing of the Maastricht Treaty on 7  February 1992 and its implementation on 1 November 1991 [date as  published], took place during my presidency. In September 1992,  the European Parliament itself could celebrate its 40th  anniversary. In six summit meetings -- another one will follow  in late June -- I was able to contribute to the future shaping  of the EU together with the heads of state and government of the  12 EU countries. In a number of meetings and talks with leading  politicians from Europe and other continents I was able to  experience that the EU can and must assume a leading role in  international politics.    [Hausmann] The Maastricht Treaty offers the European  Parliament the basis to strengthen and considerably extend its  powers of democratic control. As important examples I would  like to mention the European Parliament's right of consent to  the nomination of the president of the Commission and the entire  European Commission, which currently consists of 17 members. So  far, the Parliament only had the possibility to remove the  entire Commission via a vote of no-confidence. The Maastricht  Treaty also adjusts the terms of the Commission to the  legislative term of the Parliament, which means it will be  extended from four to five years. That is also of relevance for  the political work.    Maastricht also authorizes the European Parliament to ratify  all EC agreements with third countries that focus on political,  economic, of financial issues. So far, the European Parliament  has had the right to consent to agreements on associate  membership and full membership to the EU -- which is what some  people have not been aware of. The position of the European  Parliament as a democratic control body will be strengthened in  the future also by establishing the post of ombudsman, who will  be elected by the Parliament and is accountable only to  Parliament. The creation of investigating committees is an  additional example regarding the extension of democratic powers  of control. The European Parliament will thus be enabled to  comprehensively control the bureaucracies of the Commission and  the Council of Ministers -- which is where the representatives  of the individual governments make their decisions.    Finally, the Maastricht Treaty concedes to the European  Parliament the right of co-decision, that is to say co-decision  on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers for the  latter's decision with a qualified majority. This power of  consent -- with the absolute majority of 260 deputies --  remains, however, for the time being limited to decrees and  guidelines related to the single market, which was implemented  at the beginning of last year, and to some framework laws, such  as the Fourth Research Framework Program, which was just  discussed by Parliament in the second reading. The European  Parliament has called for the extension of the right to  co-decision to all legislative activities in which the Council  adopts majority resolutions. This extension may be implemented  at the revision conference, planned for 1996; yet it can also be  done without an amendment of the treaty through the evolutive  clause [Evolutivklausel], which is contained in the Maastricht  Treaty. With the regulations of the Maastricht Treaty, the  catalogue of demands of the European Parliament is still far  from being fulfilled.    The essential objectives are and remain:     -  Full right of  co-decision in all activities of the Community, that is to say  in the entire law-making process;    -  The full budget right -- to be  able not only to decide on spending but also on revenues;    -  The  right of consent in the case of amendments to the treaty.    "Interinstitutional agreements" have been concluded, that  is to say agreements between the Council of Ministers, the  Commission, and the European Parliament, for the important areas  of the annual EC budget and the medium-term financial planning  up to the end of the decade, and for everything that was  discussed and negotiated under the headlines of "more democracy,  full transparency, and subsidiarity principle." This has  significantly strengthened the importance of our Parliament.    Still pending are the necessary agreements on setting up  investigating committees and the shaping of the necessary  consultative procedures between the Council and Parliament in  the spheres of common foreign and security policy, economic and  monetary policy, and measures in the domestic and judicial  areas, the three pillars of the Maastricht Treaty.    [Hausmann] Apart from the increase in power for the  legislative procedures itself, Parliament can now exert an  indirect influence on the creation of draft laws, because the  Commission has become dependent on Parliament. Is this not a  shift of power in the institutional balance to the disadvantage  of the Commission?    [Klepsch] I regard that as a justified enlargement of powers  in favor of the European Parliament and not as something to the  disadvantage of the European Commission. It is a procedure to  restore a new balance between EU institutions.    [Hausmann] The greater legislative powers in some  traditional spheres of European policy now contrast with  stripping the Parliament of powers in new spheres of  responsibility of the EU. Foreign and security policy, as well  as domestic and legal policy were placed outside Community  procedures. Why does the Parliament put up with this disrespect  for the elected deputies?    [Klepsch] The European Parliament is certainly not ready to  put up with such disrespect. On the basis of the Martin Report,  we criticized the deficiencies and shortcomings of this treaty  in the first resolutions to the Maastricht Treaty in April 1992.  This includes the planned procedure in domestic and legal  policy and in foreign and security policy. The European  Parliament has called for full integration of treaty pillars  number two and three into the EU sphere of powers and the  appropriate cooperation of the Parliament. We will not put up  with the fact that the right to co-decision is limited only to  the single market and some framework sectors. On the contrary,  we are calling for an extension of the right to co-decision to  all legislative activities.    [Hausmann] Some French politicians reject further powers for  the European Parliament arguing that even today it has more  rights than the French National Assembly. Denmark has also  assumed a negative position in this issue. How much room do you  still have for more democracy?    [Klepsch] The European Parliament will not abandon its  course because of criticism and opposition from national  parliaments to make the activities and decisions of the EU all  in all more transparent and easier to understand, and to  increase the level of democracy. In doing so, we do not act  against the interests of the national parliaments, but we are  seeking close cooperation with them. At the level of national  parliaments, too, the understanding should begin to prevail that  more democracy will ultimately be beneficial to everybody. The  implementation of the Maastricht Treaty stipulations will  certainly help to make EU more democratic to the benefit of all  citizens.    [Hausmann] In 1996, a new government conference is to work  out an internal, institutional reform of the Union. Even now, a  working group consisting of members of the Council, Commission,  and Parliament should work out proposals. Why before the  election, and what are the Parliament's minimum demands?    [Klepsch] We very much welcome the idea of a working group  begining its activities at this early stage. I myself  repeatedly emphasized the necessity of tackling a comprehensive  institutional reform even before the government conference,  scheduled for 1996, and best with the participation of the  current membership candidates. The European Parliament's basic  demand has always aimed at making an enlarged EU able to act and  work. This requires reform at all levels of EU institutions.  This affects especially the mechanism of decisionmaking in the  Council of Ministers. For the European Parliament the necessary  resolutions or provisions have already been made with the  Edinburgh decisions on increasing the number of deputies from  518 to 567, and the Brussels summit decision of December 1993 on  the number of deputies for the membership candidates.    [Hausmann] In the view of the European Parliament, the EU  should develop into a federal state in the long run. Yet, the  German Constitutional Court thinks that this is incompatible  with the current Basic Law. Will the Parliament now revise its  objective?    [Klepsch] As president of the European Parliament I welcomed  the ruling of the German Constitutional Court of October 1993  and described it as being "largely consistent with the ideas of  the European Parliament." I think that the question whether the  EU should develop into a federal state, a confederation, or a  union of states, which is how the Federal Constitutional Court  has defined the current state of integration, is not of primary  importance at this moment. In my view, the most important thing  is now the practical implementation of all regulations of the  Maastricht Treaty on shaping the EU. The European Parliament  will stick to its plan of drafting a "EU Constitution." Work on  it will continue rapidly.    [Hausmann] Despite the summit decision of 1992, according to  which Strasbourg is the seat of the European Parliament and 12  weeks of plenary sessions should be held there, only 11 sessions  took place under your presidency in 1993, with only 11 being  planned for this year, too. Why is the decision of the heads of  state and government not respected, and why are plenary sessions  held in Brussels instead?    [Klepsch] One cannot say that the resolution of the heads of  state and government of the December 1992 Edinburgh summit is  not respected. The only reason the second regular plenary  session on the Community budget in 1993, normally scheduled for  the end of October, was canceled was that the budget  consultations had made good progress and could be concluded  without a second plenary session in October. This year, the  June plenary session in Strasbourg has to be canceled because of  the European election. Besides, the European Council summit in  Edinburgh also ruled that "additional plenary sessions are to be  held in Brussels."</p>

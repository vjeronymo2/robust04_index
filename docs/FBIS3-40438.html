			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Riccardo Romani: "CISE of Milan Uses Gallium </F> Arsenide Solar Cells"]    [Text] Another important step forward in the photovoltaic  conversion of solar energy has been made with gallium arsenide  (GaAs) cell technology. For over 10 years this has been used in  addition to silicon in the constant search for new and more  efficient solutions to the production of electricity using solar  energy. This step has been made by the new generation germanium  substrate GaAs cells developed by researchers at CISE [Center  for Data, Studies, and Experimentation] in Milan (an ENEL  [National Electric Power Company] research company] and  successfully tested for 11 months on the EURECA [European  Retrievable Carrier] platform in space from which they have now  returned for further laboratory tests. The results furnished by  these cells as well as definitively confirming their higher  performance with respect to silicon cells, now open interesting  prospects for further development since their costs are now the  same as those of their competitors, silicon cells.    As has been noted, the development of the two technologies  has always been accompanied by advantages and disadvantages:  reduced costs but low conversion factors (10-14 percent) in the  case of silicon solar cells; in the case of gallium arsenide  cells however, the performance is doubled but with costs up to  four times higher. These differences have obviously induced  researchers all over the world to concentrate their efforts on  silicon cells because of their possible ground applications for  photovoltaic energy (panels for domestic use, experimental  centers etc.), but placing great emphasis on gallium arsenide  cells because of their higher performance levels, the increased  resistance of GaAs to cosmic radiation, and high performance at  low temperatures.    That is, to make them more suitable for military and space  applications. Here, increased performance, reliability, the  reduced size and weight of the panels at equivalent power levels  and consequently an increased scientific payload, not the costs,  are the determining factors when choosing the optimal solution.    Now that the cost difference between GaAs and silicon cells  has been overcome, the new generation GaAs cells tested aboard  EURECA have become more appealing because performance levels are  doubled and because of the other advantages already mentioned  (size, weight, reliability, etc.). A success that CISE  researchers have achieved by replacing the substrate, which was  previously made of the same material, with a thinner but  stronger and much less expensive germanium substrate; and using  a new deposition technology for the fine superficial GaAs layer  on the new substrate. That is, passing from the previous  "liquid phase" deposition technique to the "vapor phase"  technique. The process is based on the natural phenomenon of  epitaxy (under which crystals of different kinds become  associated according to well-determined laws), normally used in  microelectronics to produce crystals in semiconducting  materials. This has now been developed by CISE after an initial  collaboration with Bell Laboratories and almost 10 years of  testing, by depositing GaAs on various substrates (germanium,  silicon) and making other important achievements: uniform  deposition, increased purity of the layers, low-cost processes.    Consequently, this opens up wide-ranging market prospects  for  new generation GaAs solar cells in Europe, both for CISE and the  national aerospace industry, which has to date been conditioned  by strong competition from German silicon technology. In  addition to providing electricity for scientific satellites, the  new technology should also meet with increased approval, with  respect to silicon, in the vast and growing sector of  mini-satellites for telecommunications, remote-sensing and  environmental observation, industrial services because of the  abovementioned advantages of reduced size and weight at the same  price, higher performance levels, more reliability.    Though still at the early stages, this technology could also  start being tested (as already happens in the United States) in  applications on earth. The performance levels, which are double  those of silicon, could promote research and new developments in  single equipment for domestic use, the testing of concentration  devices from current photovoltaic centers on new types of cells,  or attract the interest of the Nordic countries, which receive  less sunlight, in the new solar panels, given the increased  performance of new GaAs cells in interplanetary spaces even at  temperatures of minus 150 degrees Celsius and in the absence of  light. It cannot be excluded therefore that thanks to GaAs,  photovoltaic energy may still hold some good surprises in store.</p>

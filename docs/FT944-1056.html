			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Yet more overheads Sir, As customers of Northern Electric we quake at the prospect that it may eventually be taken over by Trafalgar House, or indeed by some other company. This reaction is open to misinterpretation. It does not stem from any fondness for Northern Electric - in fact, the electricity regulator, Offer, has judged Northern Electric to have been overly successful among the regional electricity companies in relieving customers of their money - but rather from the thought of yet another layer of overheads to be paid for by the captive Northern Electric customers. In this year of all years, in which Offer has so comprehensively demonstrated its ineffectiveness, who can possibly imagine that it could stop Trafalgar House from loading extra costs on to Northern Electric - an apportionment of Trafalgar House board costs, the costs of feeding the lions in Trafalgar Square, etc etc? J Rowbottom, The Stone House Inn, Thruscross, Nr Harrogate, North Yorkshire LS29 9QS</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Biographer and historian - Obituary The writer Sir Peter Quennell died on Wednesday at the age of 88. The news will be heard with sadness by all who value purity and elegance of expression in literature. Quennell was one of those for whom an ugly sentence could cause more pain than an aching tooth. He was a regular contributor to the Financial Times' weekly books page over many decades. An eminent biographer himself, he was a natural choice to review the lives of those famous or obscure authors who inhabit the highways and byways of 18th and 19th century literature. His own extended pen-portraits of Byron, Boswell, Baudelaire, Hogarth, Ruskin and others may still be read with enjoyment. But Quennell's link with the FT was stronger than that of an occasional contributor. He was for many years joint-editor of the journal History Today when it was part of the FT's stable of periodical publications, and he worked from an office within the FT in Bracken House. Quennell and his colleague, Alan Hodge, his co-editor, used to make a striking contrast when they appeared together in the lift, the former tall and matinee-idol-like in appearance, the latter with the anxious countenance and concentration of a scholar. They were firm friends, however, and through Hodge, who had served Brendan Bracken and Churchill, kept alive the spirit of an illustrious past. The then chairman of the FT, Lord Drogheda, was in the habit of sending queries down about recondite literary topics to 'Peter Q' (as he always called him) and receiving an instant response. Born in 1905, Quennell was the son of C H B Quennell, the architect, and Marjorie Quennell, a book-illustrator. The pair published jointly a number of reference books of which A History of Everyday Things is the best known. They sent Quennell to Berkhamsted Grammar School where he was a contemporary of Graham Greene but, far from scarring him for life, it seems to have equipped him with most of the resources required, not merely for success in literature, but also socially. In his youth no fashionable gathering was complete without Quennell's handsome witty presence. He crops up with alarming frequency in the smart memoirs of the period. Quennell showed distinct promise as a poet in his youth, but then found his true metier in biography and literary journalism. He reviewed for a variety of journals with a long spell as chief book critic of the Daily Mail and he was editor of The Cornhill Magazine in the 1940s. Quennell had five wives and two children, a daughter Sarah and a son Alexander, both of whom survive him. He was knighted in 1992. Quennell was a delightful companion with an unexpected gift for mimicry, and he will be much missed by his many friends, both for his conviviality and for his lightly worn erudition.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT SO HANDY?  </P> <P> How can one equate advertising with poor quality workmanship or deduce that the  workmen can't get enough business through referrals? Rubbish! Some of my larger  jobs have come from advertising in local throwaway newspapers, and it is a tool  I use for increasing my business. Should consumers avoid all businesses that  advertise?  </P> <P> Additionally, if a contract is signed by an unlicensed tradesman, the consumer  has little recourse if the work proves to be shoddy, inadequate or left  incomplete. Furthermore, contracts must be of a specific form and content,  including notification of the right to cancel the contract within three  business days of execution.  </P> <P> JERE ROSENBERG  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P> <P>  Rosenberg is a general contractor.  </P> <P> </P></p>

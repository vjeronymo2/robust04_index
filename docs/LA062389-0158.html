			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 17 ARRESTED AT CHINESE UNIVERSITIES;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT PURGE WIDENS, INTELLECTUALS AMONG NEW TARGETS  </P> <P> Police raided six Beijing university campuses today, arresting at least 17  teachers and students and searching for an equal number of others in the  continuing nationwide hunt for fugitive democracy movement activists, Chinese  sources said.  </P> <P> State-run television and radio said a prominent university lecturer was taken  into custody but did not say when.  </P> <P> In a sign that authorities were extending the purge to the intelligentsia,  Chinese sources said arrest warrants were issued for seven prominent  intellectuals, one of whom escaped with his wife to Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Official media announced other arrests in the crackdown on dissent that has  netted more than 2,000 suspects since the uprising by tens of thousands of  Beijing citizens against the June 3 armor-backed military offensive that ended  a 22-day occupation by students of the city's central Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Toll May Be 3,000  </P> <P> Officials say about 300 people, including 100 soldiers, died in the street  battles, but unofficial reports place the death toll at 3,000.  </P> <P> Seven people were executed Thursday in Beijing for participating in the  insurrection and three others Wednesday in Shanghai for torching a train during  nationwide protests against the strike in the capital.  </P> <P> An unknown number of anti-government protesters were reported among 17 people  executed Wednesday for crimes in the northeastern city of Jinan.  </P> <P> The government, meanwhile, escalated its accusations of foreign involvement in  the student-led movement for democratic reforms, charging that the Nationalist  Chinese government of Taiwan instigated unrest in hopes of toppling the  mainland's Communist leadership.  </P> <P> The allegations were part of an official propaganda blitz aimed at convincing  China's 1.2 billion people that the democracy movement was a  "counterrevolutionary rebellion" by "thugs" and "criminals," justifying the  army assault on Tian An Men Square and the crackdown on the largest  anti-government protests in 40 years of Communist rule.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Armed Police  </P> <P> Chinese sources on Beijing campuses said police today seized four people from  the Beijing Film Institute, 10 at the Beijing Normal College of Physical  Culture, one from the Political Science and Law College and two at the Beijing  Institute of Foreign Languages.  </P> <P> Those arrested were students and teachers, but the sources could provide no  breakdown.  </P> <P> They said some police were armed and carried arrest warrants for 17 other  people at the Political Science and Law College and the Beijing College of  Aeronautics. Those suspects, however, were not at the institutions when  officers arrived, the sources said.  </P> <P> Beijing television and national radio evening news broadcasts announced the  arrest of Liu Xiaobo, a lecturer in the Chinese language department of Beijing  Normal University.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "In Order To Change Arab View of U.S. Strength"] </F>   [Text] With the approach of the Jordanian-U.S. summit,  which was described by the prime minister as important in terms  of its timing and its implications, we would like to remind the  U.S. Administration of the reasons for the way the Jordanian  people and the Arab peoples view the United States, despite the  distance that separates us. Over the past few decades, U.S.  policy has dealt with us through Israel's viewpoint and backed  aggression from which we are still suffering. Whenever we try  to show our admiration for the U.S. Administration's interest in  human rights and its rejection of violence and terrorism, we  find out that it is still far from being fair in the way it  takes an interest in these rights and in the way it defines  violence and terrorism.    Instead of being a source of inspiration for many peoples to  promote the principles of freedom on which its first revolution  was founded the United States has become, in the view of many  peoples, as well as our Arab people in particular, an example of  a dominating force supporting the killer against the victim.    Today, as the United States calls for bringing about peace  and stability in our region, it is expected to prove that it  really wants such a fair, comprehensive, and lasting peace.  However, we reaffirm that the current image is not impossible  to change, particularly if the United States eliminates the  reasons behind this image by getting Israel to change its  negotiating position on peace, which will not succeed unless it  is just and comprehensive, and by ending Jordan's suffering and  the blockade, which is deeply affecting Jordan and its people  and which is harming the fraternal Iraqi people following the  Gulf crisis, as the U.S. Administration knows well.    Jordan, severely harmed by the region's events since the  establishment of Israel, expects the United States to turn over  a new leaf and compensate Jordan for all its burdens and the  damage caused to it over decades of crises and conflict, in  which the United States was biased in violation of its declared  principles of freedom, human rights, and the need for security  and stability. We hope that this superpower will not remain a  captive of its own power isolated from the human dimension,  without which power means tyranny and cannot be beautified in  the eyes of nations, regardless of its size.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A_Administration of FHWA Planning and Research Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One State, in which most research is conducted for the State by higher education institutions, stated that the proposed regulation does not pertain to universities as subrecipients and recommended citing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' November, 19, 1993, for universities as subrecipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While the State is the recipient of FHWA planning and research funds, Part 420 also applies to subawards to all categories of subrecipients, including institutions of higher education. In accordance with standard OMB requirements, subawards are to be administered in accordance with the procedures in the OMB Circular and corresponding agency implementing regulations that apply to the type of agency receiving the subaward, whether or not specifically stated in the regulation. To clarify what applies to administration of subawards to institutions of higher education, a new paragraph (o) has been added to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;420.121 as discussed under the section-by-section analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the term ``State highway agency'' be changed to ``State transportation agency'' to maintain consistent nomenclature and reflect reality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Since most of the State agencies to which Federal-aid highway program funds are apportioned are no longer single purpose highway agencies, the FHWA agrees that use of the term ``State transportation agency'' is more appropriate and has made this change. However, 23 U.S.C. 302 requires that a State desiring to avail itself of the provisions of title 23, U.S.C., have a suitably equipped and organized State  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> highway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  department and has been interpreted by the FHWA to restrict reimbursement of a State  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> highway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  department's indirect costs. Therefore, a definition of State transportation agency (STA) has been added to &sect;420.103, as discussed below under the section-by-section analysis, to distinguish a State  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> highway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  department from other State transportation agencies in order to determine whether the agency's indirect costs are allowable under 23 U.S.C. 302.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One State commented that it is using a significant portion of its SPR funds for training, ``since the ISTEA language which was supposed to have covered training was inadvertently left out of that Legislation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The ISTEA in fact continued the funding provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (23 U.S.C. 321) for training of State personnel although at a reduced level of funding. With the exception of a specific type of training cited in 23 U.S.C. 307(c), FHWA planning and research funds may only be used for transportation planning or RD&amp;T related training if the cost of the training is necessary, reasonable, and it benefits the purposes of the grant or subgrant. General training of employees who are not working on grant funded activities is not an allowable cost. This is consistent with OMB cost principles which are applicable to FHWA planning and research fund grants and subgrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One State questioned the estimate of 2,100 burden hours, shown under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act in the NPRM, for the 50 States to comply with the regulation and stated that it will take much more time to develop a procedures manual; procedures for tracking activities, schedules, accomplishment, and fiscal commitments; and procedures to determine the effectiveness of the implementation process, and the utilizations of the RD&amp;T output. The commenter indicated that the State has many of the elements in place, but did not know if the FHWA Division office would accept them or require revisions in content or format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The estimate of 2,100 burden-hours (40 hours per respondent) is for the one-time preparation by each State, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> new certification <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  required by subpart B of the regulation. Many of the other activities cited by the commenter are either required already (e.g., progress reports) and are covered by the cited existing OMB clearances or are standard management practices that the State should already have in place. An updated burden estimate has been prepared. It is estimated that the average one-time burden for preparation of RD&amp;T management process documentation and certification statements is 480 burden-hours (12 weeks x 40 hours per week) per State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

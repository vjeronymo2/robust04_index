			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enrique Vidal] </F>   [Text] Argentine Ambassador Arturo Osorio has said that  Argentina will support Peru's bid to export radioisotopes  produced at the Huarangal nuclear plant. He said this after  visiting the modern facilities located some 33 km north of Lima.  In the company of Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute Director  Conrado Seminario, Osorio made the following comments:    [Begin recording] Osorio: We have visited this  nuclear plant and can appreciate its optimum level of  efficiency, the high level of professional training, and their  excellent skill in handling this delicate nuclear plant, which  also represents a security issue for the world. It conforms to  the strictest nuclear safety regulations and it is really  marvelous. It is a great satisfaction for those of us who have  worked together to build this nuclear power plant as it will  enable us to continue our partnership -- from a commercial  standpoint or through the reciprocal transfer of technology by  means of this great work, which is perhaps the most important  nuclear reactor in Latin America.    Unidentified reporter: Are you hinting at the  possibility of entering into partnership to export?    Osorio: Yes, there that possibility.    Reporter: How could this be turned into something  concrete, Mr. Ambassador?    Osorio: That is a subject for experts to address.  I believe that once the authorities of both countries discuss  things at technical level, we will perhaps have -- in the near  future -- a positive [words indistinct]. [end recording]    That was Argentine Ambassador to Lima Arturo Osorio, after  making a technical inspection of the Huarangal nuclear power  plant and its 10-megawatt reactor accompanied by Conrado  Seminario. The building of this plant, which will also produce  radioisotopes used in medicine and in industry, has been  possible thanks to the technical cooperation of Argentine  experts. We should point out that 35 percent of the electrical  energy consumed in Argentina is produced by nuclear power plants.</p>

Cristiani stated during a news conference that the reports  that appeared in the 4 January edition of U.S. daily "THE  WASHINGTON POST" which includes recently declassified documents  on the past Salvadoran conflict, is based on "unconfirmed"  information.    The U.S. newspaper pointed out that in May 1984 former  President Ronald Reagan sent Vernon Walters, a veteran diplomat  and former military officer, to meet with D'Aubuisson, founder  of the government party Arena, to warn him that he would be held  accountable for any attempt against Pickering. According to the  newspaper report, Walters warned D'Aubuisson that any attack on  Pickering, who had received threats from right-wing death squads  "would result in all U.S. aid being terminated."    However Cristiani, although acknowledging that General  Walters' visit to El Salvador had taken place, explained that it  was to discuss issues related to selecting a provisional  president as a result of the crisis taking place at the time.  Alvaro Magana was finally selected as provisional president.  He added that Walters met with the Major D'Aubuisson, who died  in 1992, because as president of the National Assembly he was at  the time one of the principal players in national politics and  there was urgency to search for a person "agreeable to everyone  to occupy the presidency while the constitution was being drawn  up."    The Salvadoran president regretted that U.S newspapers  published only "one-sided information" and added that he has  documents declassified by the United States and he could also  refer to the thousands of murders involving the former  Salvadoran guerrillas.    Cristiani criticized an alleged propaganda campaign  unleashed  against Arena and emphasized that all the documents carry a  warning heading to the effect that the U.S. State Department  does not guarantee the accuracy of the information, and that it  is simply information gathered by chance.    In November 1992, U.S. President Bill Clinton declassified a  large number of confidential documents related to the Salvadoran  conflict (1980-92) which has caused some controversy in El  Salvador after being published in U.S newspapers.</p>

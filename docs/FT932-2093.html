			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Names' actions to be discussed MR JUSTICE SAVILLE, the High Court judge, will today meet solicitors representing Lloyd's Names and the agents whom they are suing in an attempt to rationalise complex legal actions. Several thousand Names have taken legal action to recover insurance losses. Tomorrow Lloyd's will announce record losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn for the 1990 underwriting year. Some solicitors involved suggest Judge Saville could press for a test case to establish the grounds on which members' agents can be held 'vicariously' liable for the negligence of managing agents.</p>

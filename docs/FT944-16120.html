EA Generali, which is controlled by Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo), said it foresaw a rise in premium income to more than Sch37bn in the full year, and expected again to pay a 15 per cent dividend. The insurer, which covers Austrian, German and some eastern European markets for the Italian Generali group, said the main contributor to growth in the first half was the life insurance division, with a 28 per cent rise in premium volume to Sch5.5bn. In property and accident insurance, premiums grew 9 per cent to Sch13.3bn. The health insurance division saw its premiums rise 11 per cent to Sch1bn. Damage claims grew 'significantly less' than premium income, and group net investment income was up 6.7 per cent to Sch3.7bn.</p>

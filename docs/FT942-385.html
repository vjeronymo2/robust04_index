			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Berkeley jumps to Pounds 39.5m - Company dampens fears over a recent serious decline in UK housing market Fears of a serious decline in the UK housing market since the spring have been overstated according to Berkeley Group, the housebuilder which yesterday announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 39.5m during the 12 months to April 30. Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said: 'The alarm expressed about a faltering market has been exaggerated as far as we are concerned. 'We had a very good May. Although sales were down 10 per cent in June compared with the previous month, prices of new homes have moved ahead and could increase by 2 or 3 per cent this year. Our markets, far from being fragile, remain solid.' The company, which specialises in building executive homes and is strongly represented in central London and south-east England, doubled its size during the recession after selling many of its development sites in 1989, before land prices collapsed. Mr Pidgley yesterday criticised rival housebuilders for again chasing up land prices which, he estimated, had risen by an average of 50 per cent across the country during the past 12 months. 'Sites in Surrey which were selling at an average of Pounds 400,000 an acre last year are now costing more than Pounds 600,000. Around Warwick, sites which were costing Pounds 220,000 are now selling at more than Pounds 400,000 an acre. 'I cannot see that house prices are going to rise sufficiently in the next few years to justify these costs,' said Mr Pidgley. Upward pressure on land prices has come from construction companies which have raised large sums from rights issues during the past 12 months and are looking to expand house building operations. He was more sanguine about the current state of house sales. 'We have gone from the boom of the late 1980s through the recession; this is more like a normal market and people have forgotten what that is like. Sales typically dip at this time of year. I would be more concerned if this was happening in September and October when sales traditionally pick up.' Group turnover last year rose from Pounds 182m to Pounds 228.1m. Trading profits, almost entirely from housebuilding, increased by 81 per cent to Pounds 28.6m (Pounds 15.8m). The number of homes sold rose from 1,226 to 1,404 with average prices increasing from Pounds 149,000 to Pounds 162,000. Profits were further assisted by a Pounds 10.9m windfall gain from Berkeley's share of profits from the sale of commercial properties, mostly out of town retail developments and a large distribution centre. Earnings per share, excluding property profits, rose 51 per cent from 16p to 24.1p. The final dividend is increased to 5.1p, making a total of 7p (6p). COMMENT The views of Berkeley's chief executive may say more about the superior quality of his business than put to rest concerns about the current fragile state of the housing market. To increase earnings per share so sharply in a rights issue year is no mean feat. The company owns or controls 5,500 development plots so has no need to chase high land prices; net margins rose from 9 per cent to 12.5 per cent last year and the balance sheet currently boasts net cash of Pounds 11.5m. Pre-tax profits approaching Pounds 40m this year and Pounds 46m in 1995-96 - excluding commercial property sales - would put the shares on a prospective p/e, two years out, of under 10 which looks a little cheap, given the quality of the company's businesses and its recent record.

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / 'Greener' farming funds trebled Government funds for 'sustainable farming' have been trebled to Pounds 12m to try to reduce the use of agro-chemicals and fertilisers. Industry is providing a further Pounds 12m for a scheme which is backed by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. She said: 'Farming needs to find ways of reducing its use of scarce resources, both to save the farmer money, encourage plant and bird life and protect the rural environment and the welfare of animals.' Sustainable farming is becoming a buzzword in agriculture. The concept has grown out of pressure from the 'green' lobby to halt spiralling use of agro-chemicals. Sustainable methods involve farmers cutting the use of chemicals while maintaining profitability, rather than giving up the use of artificial fertilisers and chemicals by turning to organic production. Projects backed by a government scheme to introduce sustainable methods show how use of weedkillers can be cut by using spraying machines that recognise weeds. Some of the projects show how producers can encourage natural predators to eat harmful crop pests. Another research initiative is aimed at showing farmers how to control nitrogen leaching into the soil when spreading manure. The scheme has attracted growing interest from producers since it was set up two years ago. Mr Rex Chester, a farmer from Hampshire who chairs the management committee for the projects, said: 'Farmers need to respond to the growing public consciousness and concern for wildlife and the environment.' But he pointed to the dilemma for farmers as environmentalists became more strident: 'We can't compete with people who think eating meat is a sin. At the extreme end, the demands become irrational.'</p>

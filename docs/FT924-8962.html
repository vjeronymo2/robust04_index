			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / An unsure first taste THE celestial 11th century South Indian bronzes had no takers; the naughty European enamel cigarette boxes were all snapped up. And the bidding for the novelties such as the Carl Kauba bronze chrysalis ashtray which parts mechanically to reveal a nymphet, or the Austrian Franz Bergman bronze figure of a girl whose skirt lifts up went very well, thank you. But Sotheby's first auction in India, at a luxury hotel in New Delhi, didn't go quite as well as the British auctioneers, and their Indian partners, the Modis, had hoped, even if they are not admitting it. The two-day extravaganza - for it was that for much of the motley crowd in event-starved Delhi - raked in a total of Rs56.4m (Pounds 1.3m), half the estimated figure for the collection of 521 objects. Mr Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's Asian division, who skilfully presided over the proceedings, announced at the end that nearly 63 per cent of the lots were sold and that Sotheby's had been particularly encouraged by the sale of European paintings. Godward's 'Bath of Venus', a 1901 oil of a disrobed beauty, fetched a handsome Rs2.86m (Pounds 57,200) and another work by the last of the British neo-classicists, whose naked ladies were the mild pornography of the day, fetched Rs2.31m (Pounds 46,200). The European paintings, which attracted mostly foreign buyers, sold at full international value, according to Mr Thompson. India's veritable treasure trove of non-Indian art was displayed at the sale and collectors hope that more will emerge, thanks to Sotheby's pressure. In the days of the British Raj, hundreds of European paintings were brought to India, mostly by Indian art collectors or British civil servants to embellish their buildings. Sotheby's in the early 1980s had tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the Indian government to auction works of art of non-Indian origin, much of which lay neglected in the country's grand old bureaucratic residences. Now it has had its way although India's strict antiquity laws still do not permit antiquities of over 100 years to leave the country, which accounts for the restrained bidding in this area. The South Indian Chola bronzes, including two 11th and 12th century bronze figures of the Hindu god, Shiva, were unsold when bidders offered less than half of the estimated prices of Rs5m to Rs8.5m. The bronzes, which span centuries of Indian art, were from the collection of a shipping magnate, Mrs Sumati Morarjee, who confessed she had bought over the years to prevent works of art from leaving the country, but could no longer maintain her collection. The contemporary Indian art section did dismally, but some early 20th century paintings fetched prices considerably higher than their estimates. Amrita Sher-Gil's Village Group (1938) designated, like the artist herself, an Indian art treasure, fetched Rs1.1m (Pounds 22,000), a record price for any modern Indian painting. The European clocks and watches were indiscriminately snapped up by foreign buyers; Indian bidders were more discerning, bidding heavily for single pieces they had set their hearts on. The curiosities and knick-knacks, which one collector termed 'flea-market junk', attracted spirited bidding. The next auction, says Suzanne Tory, Sotheby's India managing director, will be held in a year's time. Doubtless more Indians will be tempted to part with their treasures by then.</p>

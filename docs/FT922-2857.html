			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity Today's annual results from East Midlands Electricity should show pre-tax profits up by more than a third. As other regional electricity companies report, that might come to look positively modest. Norweb is set to report more than doubled pre-tax profits, while its earnings per share will be perhaps 130 per cent higher. To be fair, there is an element of catch-up, thanks to the government's underestimate of inflation in the year of privatisation. But that will scarcely cut much ice with customers and politicians. Nor, given the pressure on other utilities, will it be sufficient to protect the RECs from greater scrutiny by their own regulator. It is hard to see how Offer can avoid commenting on the scale of the profits growth, even if only to stress that customers must benefit as well as shareholders. On that front, the companies face a dilemma. Privately, many of the RECs admit that they can sustain 8 per cent real dividend increases for the foreseeable future. Yet that is twice as much as the government allowed for at privatisation. To date, Professor Littlechild has stuck firmly to a long-term view of his industry. Doubtless he will gradually take a less academic approach. Until it becomes clear what that means for dividends, prudent investors will doubtless prefer the slightly safer water sector.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> HE'S NO. 1;  </P> <P> SEAN ELLIOTT KEEPS DRAWING RAVE REVIEWS  </P> <P> Beads of sweat drip from Arizona All-American forward Sean Elliott as he towels  off after a grueling practice.  </P> <P> Kevin O'Neill, an Arizona assistant coach, sits down next to Elliott and puts  his arm around the player.  </P> <P> O'Neill kisses Elliott's head.  </P> <P> "Sean is a sweet, sweet kid," says O'Neill, who named his own son after  Elliott.  </P> <P> Other college basketball coaches and scouts apparently like Elliott almost as  much as O'Neill does.  </P> <P> "I love Elliott," said former coach Dick Vitale, the volatile commentator for  ABC and ESPN. "I just think from a coach's standpoint, he's absolutely a great  player. He's every adjective you can use."  </P> <P> A 6-foot-8 senior, Elliott is expected to go high in the National Basketball  Assn. draft in June.  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said Elliott could become the first Pacific 10 player to  be selected No. 1 in the draft since Bill Walton, a former Bruin, who was  chosen first by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1974.  </P> <P> "I think Elliott is the No. 1 draft choice in America," Harrick said. "If I  were starting a pro team, he's the first guy I'd pick."  </P> <P> Marty Blake, NBA scouting director, ranks Elliott among the nation's top  players.  </P> <P> "I think Elliott and Danny Ferry (Duke forward) will go 1-2 and don't let  anybody tell you any different," Blake said. "Elliott and Ferry have the talent  to play right away."  </P> <P> Said Paul Evans, Pittsburgh coach: "I think Elliott's a tremendous player. In  fact, he got my vote for player of the year."  </P> <P> Jerry Tarkanian, Nevada Las Vegas coach, said of Elliott, who had 32 points and  15 rebounds against UNLV: "I think he's a phenomenal player. I'm a big fan of  his. He's one of the best college players I've ever seen."  </P> <P> So why all the raves?  </P> <P> Simple. Elliott has had an extraordinary season, averaging 21.8 points, 7.4  rebounds and 4.2 assists for top-ranked Arizona.  </P> <P> THE PRICE OF FAME  </P> <P> Sean Elliott closed his eyes, letting the warm water fall on his tired body.  </P> <P> Elliott had been battered in the Wildcats' season-ending victory over UCLA and  he was unwinding in a deserted shower.  </P> <P> Or so he thought.  </P> <P> As he reached for the soap, he suddenly discovered that he had company.  </P> <P> A radio reporter had joined Elliott in the shower area and was sticking a  microphone in his face.  </P> <P> The intrusion startled Elliott.  </P> <P> "That's the first time that's happened," Elliott said.  </P> <P> An Arizona official quickly hustled the reporter out of the locker room, but  only after the reporter had threatened to fight.  </P> <P> It was a bizarre scene and if the price of fame is losing the last vestige of  privacy, Elliott apparently has paid the price.  </P> <P> "Last year, Sean was a deity but this year he's a god," said Harvey Mason,  junior guard. "You can't get much higher than Sean in Tucson.  </P> <P> In Tucson, where Elliott is top Wildcat, he stirs a commotion wherever he goes.  </P> <P> "When I go to a shopping mall, people don't understand that I don't want to  sign autographs for an hour and a half," Elliott said. "If I don't sign, they  think I'm rude."  </P> <P> Even his mother has become a celebrity. Odiemae Elliott signs almost as many  autographs as Sean.  </P> <P> Elliott, though, works hard on his image. He usually has four or five speaking  engagements a week, talking about the evils of drugs to schoolchildren.  </P> <P> And he apparently has handled his acclaim well. His teammates say that Elliott  is just a regular guy.  </P> <P> "Sean has never been egotistical," said Jud Buechler, junior forward. "He has  one of the best personalities of anyone I've ever met. He could easily be  pompous because it's so obvious that he's in another league. But Sean treats  you like a normal guy."  </P> <P> Off the court, Elliott is the team comedian. He keeps the players loose with  his jokes.  </P> <P> "We call him Silly because Sean is silly most of the time," said Anthony Cook,  the senior center who shared an apartment with Elliott for three years. "People  look at him and think he's shy, but when he's around the fellows, he's a  different person."  </P> <P> Elliott loves to play practical jokes.  </P> <P> On O'Neill's birthday, for instance, Elliott threw a pie in the assistant  coach's face -- in front of 450 people who were attending a basketball class  being taught by O'Neill.  </P> <P> O'Neill got even on Elliott's 21st birthday last month, when he hit Elliott  with a pie after a game.  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar may not know who Elliott is -- at least that's what he said  -- but most of Arizona certainly does.  </P> <P> The Arizona Daily Star published an eight-page special section on Elliott after  he broke Abdul-Jabbar's Pac-10 scoring record last month.  </P> <P> "In Tucson, it gets real hectic," Elliott said. "Sometimes it gets downright  out of control.  </P> <P> "I've heard that it's going to be worse when I get to the NBA, but I'm real  sure it's not going to be as bad as it is now. Tucson is a fishbowl. Everything  you do is observed by people. Everyone knows who you are.  </P> <P> "I'd like to be a normal person. People say that being famous must be fun, but  now that I've tasted both sides, I think there are advantages, but there are  lot of disadvantages as well."  </P> <P> When Elliott feels the world tugging at him, he escapes to his apartment, his  sanctuary. He takes the phone off the hook and spends time alone.  </P> <P> SEAN THE MAGNIFICENT  </P> <P> Sean Elliott was trapped by two defenders in the backcourt. He whirled and  threw a full-court pass to set up teammate Anthony Cook for an easy dunk.  </P> <P> On Arizona's next possession, Elliott pulled up at the three-point arc and  launched a shot that floated through the net.  </P> <P> After taking a pass, Elliott drove the baseline and glided to the basket for a  dunk.  </P> <P> With the game in question, Elliott stepped to the free-throw line and calmly  made two free throws, sealing the victory.  </P> <P> Elliott's versatility has enabled him to become perhaps the nation's best  college basketball player.  </P> <P> "Elliott's an excellent basketball player," said Ralph Miller, Oregon State's  coach. "He has no weaknesses. I think the secret to his success is being  versatile. He's an excellent shooter and ballhandler and he's thoroughly  indoctrinated in the team concept. What more do you need?"  </P> <P> Indeed.  </P> <P> What does Elliott do best?  </P> <P> "The thing Elliott does best is everything," said Billy Tubbs, Oklahoma's  coach. "He puts the ball on the floor well. He passes the ball. He shoots well.  He's a great athlete.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he has a flaw, but you'd have to ask (Arizona Coach) Lute Olson  because I haven't seen any of them."  </P> <P> Olson hasn't, either. He said that Elliott is as versatile as Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> So what motivates Elliott to excel?  </P> <P> "I'm afraid of failure," he said. "Once I got to a level where people started  recognizing me, I didn't want to fall from that level. A lot of athletes get on  the cover of Sports Illustrated and that's the end of that. They don't produce  the way they're supposed to. I didn't want that to happen to me."  </P> <P> Somehow, that doesn't seem likely.  </P></p>

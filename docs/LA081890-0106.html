			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI PUTS HIS DREAM ON LINE;  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL: CERRITOS GUARD CAME TO SOUTHLAND TO PURSUE A COLLEGE  SCHOLARSHIP.  </P> <P> Gali Horev grew up in Israel dreaming of becoming an American basketball star.  Nine months ago, the dream became a possibility when he and his father, Jacob  Horev, moved to Southern California.  </P> <P> The purpose of the move was solely to get Horev the necessary exposure to earn  a scholarship to an American college.  </P> <P> "If Gali doesn't get the scholarship he wants," Jacob Horev said, "then we  probably will get on the first plane back to Israel. We moved here for a  specific reason, and if it doesn't happen, then there is no purpose in  staying."  </P> <P> The Horevs arrived in Los Angeles Nov. 27. One week later, Gali enrolled at  Cerritos High and immediately joined the basketball team. Although he was a  standout for several club teams in Tel Aviv, Horev wasn't geared for the  fast-paced game played in America and saw limited action as a reserve guard for  the Dons.  </P> <P> Unaccustomed to sitting on the bench, Horev used the time to study the  intricacies of the game. Although basketball is popular in Israel, it is  somewhat unsophisticated. It took Horev months to learn all of the different  formations and plays.  </P> <P> "I had to completely change my game style," said Horev, a 6-foot-5, 180-pound  off-guard. "In Israel, basically all we did was run up and down the court and  shoot the ball. Here, the game is much more physical. I wasn't used to all of  the pushing and shoving. The players also are a lot faster.  </P> <P> "But it was still hard for me to sit on the bench, because I believed I could  help the team and make a contribution. I got very anxious, but I realize now  that I just wasn't ready. I've really learned a lot since then."  </P> <P> Horev, 17, has been practicing and playing games almost every day since April.  He was selected to all-star squads for three Slam-n-Jam leagues and was invited  to the Superstar Camp in Santa Barbara last month. He currently is in West  Germany with his high school team playing in a series of exhibitions. The  increased exposure has resulted in some attention from college coaches. Horev  received his first recruiting letter last week, from UC Davis, a Division II  school.  </P> <P> "It was very exciting to get that letter," his father said. "Let's just hope  there are more on the way."  </P> <P> Gali Horev grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city with a population of  325,000. He started playing basketball on the playground when he was 10, but  was persuaded to switch to the more popular game of soccer two years later.  When he found it increasingly difficult to find cleats in his size (he wears a  13 1/2 shoe), Horev decided it was time to take up basketball again.  </P> <P> "Somebody with Gali's size and ability should be on the basketball court and  not the soccer field," said Jacob Horev.  </P> <P> Gali Horev played for Hapoel, one of Tel Aviv's top club teams, as well as for  a team from his high school and one from a local semipro league. He said he  practiced and played games every day for nine months of the year.  </P> <P> "Basketball has been, and is my life," he said.  </P> <P> Horev's immediate future in the sport would have been jeopardized if he had  stayed in Israel. There are no athletic scholarships. More important, however,  everyone must serve three years in the army upon high school graduation. After  the military, many players try out for one of several semipro or professional  leagues in Israel.  </P> <P> But Horev was luckier than most because he had options. His father was a  colonel in the army and a man of moderate wealth. When he retired from the  military in 1988, Jacob Horev decided it was time to devote himself to his son.  </P> <P> "I grew up a poor child with little opportunities," said Horev, who was a  mechanical engineer in the army. "Everything I earned, I did with my own two  hands. I just didn't want Gali to grow up and blame me for not giving him  opportunities. This whole move was for him. If it doesn't work out, at least I  know we tried. I would have knocked myself until I died if I didn't at least  give Gali the chance.  </P> <P> "Right now, the risks are all on his shoulders."  </P> <P> The Horevs discussed moving to the United States for a couple of years. Jacob,  his wife Shuly, and their three children lived in Boston in 1979-81 while he  was working on his master's degree in engineering at Boston University. Gali  Horev enjoyed his time there and perfected his English.  </P> <P> Although the Horevs liked Boston, Jacob decided this time they would move to  Southern California because he had traveled here frequently and liked the  weather.  </P> <P> "Boston was a bit cold with the snow and all," he said. "Los Angeles has  weather similar to that of Tel Aviv, except without all of the humidity."  </P> <P> Since Jacob and Gali weren't certain how long their stay in Southern California  would last, the rest of the Horev family stayed behind. Gali said first he  wanted to see if he would fit in on an American team before the move was made  permanent. Shortly after their arrival, several of Jacob's friends who lived in  the area suggested that they settle in Cerritos. After meeting with Cerritos  High's principal, athletic director and basketball coach, they felt comfortable  with what they saw and heard, and decided to stay.  </P> <P> Jacob Horev quickly secured visas and began working on getting his family  reunited. He took a job as a systems engineer with ZMD American in Paramount.  After an eight-month separation, Shuly and the Horevs' other son, Nimi, finally  moved to Cerritos earlier this month. Nirit, the eldest of the children, stayed  in Israel to fulfill her military obligation.  </P> <P> Everything did not go smoothly for Gali Horev in the beginning. His course load  included classes in English composition, Spanish and American history.  </P> <P> "I knew how to speak English pretty well," he said, "but trying to learn  Spanish at the same time was very difficult. My counselor told me I needed a  foreign language to get into college, and I asked if I could take Hebrew. They  didn't offer Hebrew at Cerritos, so I was stuck with Spanish.  </P> <P> "It was tough, but I made it."  </P> <P> Horev finished the spring semester with a 3.0 grade-point average.  </P> <P> The Cerritos basketball team, coached by Jim Chapel, welcomed the arrival of  Horev. Players went out of their way to help him with drills and to familiarize  him with plays. Chapel said he brought Horev along slowly to make the  transition easier.  </P> <P> "When Gali arrived, he was completely an international type of ballplayer,"  said Chapel, in his fourth year at the school. "He didn't have a whole lot of  structure to his game. I definitely saw potential with him, but he had to learn  our system. He had to adapt."  </P> <P> Cerritos finished second in the traditionally strong San Gabriel Valley League  at 21-6 and was eliminated by Mater Dei in the second round of the Southern  Section Division 5-A playoffs. Horev can recount every game he played and the  excitement of going to the playoffs.  </P> <P> When the season finished in March, Chapel told Horev about several recreational  leagues and camps. Horev opted to play for Slam-n-Jam and was placed on three  different teams. With the Bears of the Saddleback midweek league, Horev  averaged 23.4 points in seven games and was selected to the all-star team.  Horev also played 30 games with his high school team, which played in two  summer leagues.  </P> <P> "Gali is getting the playing time he so desperately needed," said Issy  Washington, director of Slam-n-Jam. "He has all the tools to be a good player,  so now it's just a matter of getting used to our style of basketball. He's very  eager and persistent, which will go a long way in helping him get a college  scholarship."  </P> <P> Horev, who has grown two inches and gained 25 pounds since December, has been a  regular starter in spring and summer league play. He routinely finished in  double figures in scoring and rebounding. His strength is his shooting, and he  is particularly accurate from three-point range.  </P> <P> Jacob Horev, who rarely misses a game, said: "Parents are coming up to me and  putting their arms around me and telling how well Gali is doing. It brings  tears to my eyes because I'm so proud of his achievements. He just has to keep  working and getting better."  </P> <P> Said Mark Flick, a 6-9 center at Cerritos: "When Gali first got here, everybody  wanted to take him around and make him feel welcome. I introduced him around,  but pretty soon he knew more people than me. He's always got a smile on his  face and he's very friendly. The whole school knows who he is now. He's very  popular."  </P> <P> Despite the popularity among his peers and improvement on the court, Horev  hasn't forgotten the reason he came to America. His goal remains a college  scholarship. Since he didn't arrive at Cerritos until the middle of his junior  year, Horev has gotten a late start in the recruiting game. Most Division I  recruits will sign a letter of intent in November, months before they even  finish their senior season.  </P> <P> Scouts were unaware of Horev until recently, which means if he is offered a  scholarship, it probably will be in the spring.  </P> <P> Chapel and Washington agree that Horev has the size and skills to play college  basketball, but they aren't sure at what level.  </P> <P> "He's probably a Division II prospect right now," Washington said. "But when a  kid is improving as rapidly as he is, anything can happen. He might blossom all  of a sudden and take everyone by storm. That kind of thing happens all of the  time."  </P> <P> Cerritos will have a strong contingent of players returning, headed by Flick,  who is considered a Division I prospect. Chapel said he expects Horev to be in  the starting lineup as the team's main shooting threat from outside.  </P> <P> "People keep telling me I'm getting better," Horev said. "I'm flattered by the  compliments, but for me, the proof of all that will be getting a scholarship. I  won't be satisfied until I achieve that. And I'll be disappointed if I don't."  </P></p>

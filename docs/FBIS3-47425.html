			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China  will have another round of working-level aviation talks here in  Beijing on Jan. 17-19 to discuss the issue of concluding a  bilateral aviation agreement, an informed source here said on  Wednesday [12 January].    "Through their diplomatic channel, the two countries have  substantially narrowed difference on the question of fixing an  air control transfer point between them, which had in the past  been a major obstacle to signing an aviation agreement," the  source said.    The upcoming meeting, therefore, is expected to register a  major progress, making it possible for the two countries to open  a direct Seoul-Beijing air route within the first half of this  year.    The source said that Seoul and Beijing have in effect agreed  to draw the air control transfer point along 124 degrees of east  longitude so far as the Seoul-Beijing route is concerned.    The 124-degree point was determined by the International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1960 and advocated by  South Korea. But, Beijing had rejected it in the past on the  ground that the transfer point was set by an ICAO participated  by Taiwan.    For the Seoul-Shanghai route, the two sides have tentatively  agreed to keep the control transfer point at 125.2 degrees of  east longitude as now.    They also decided to fly chartered planes only, instead of  regular flights, along the Seoul-Shanghai route, the source said.    An official close to Chinese civil aviation authorities said  prospects are not necessarily bright because China has set forth  various conditions in return for agreeing to these.    "But, since both Seoul and Beijing feel the need to open a  direct Seoul-Beijing route early, there is much possibility that  a major breakthrough will be made at the coming talks," the  official added.</p>

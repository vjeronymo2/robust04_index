Answering questions from his audience  at an ANC rally in Rustenburg on Sunday morning, Mr Mandela said  the TEC knew ANC supporters in the homeland were being harassed  and intimidated.    He said the TEC was addressing this problem and would take  appropriate action, saying he realised Bophuthatswana President  Lucas Mangope was persecuting the ANC. But he assured the crowd  President Mangope would be powerless after the April 27  elections.    "He is fighting a losing battle. The TEC is now the  authoritative power in Bophuthatswana, and we are not without  teeth," Mandela said.    The crowd when ecstatic when they thought the ANC leader  said  President Mangope did not have long to "live". Realising he had  been misheard, Mr Mandela quickly clarified he had meant  President Mangope did not have long to "lead" as president of  the homeland.    Answering Bophuthatswana residents' fears of being harassed  if found with a South African identity document, he pointed out  voters could use their Bop [Bophuthatswana] ID documents.    Amplifying his leader, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation  (MK); ANC military wing] chief Joe Modise said Bophuthatswana  was completely dependent on the South Africa for its survival.  However, if the situation did not improve, Mr Modise said they  might have to move troops into the homeland the elections to  allow political freedom.    Taking a dig at the National Party's campaigning tactics Mr  Mandela said it would cost tax payers nearly R[Rand]500,000 if  the NP had to pay people R10 each "for food and transport" to  get a crowd. "If the national party offers you stew, potatoes  and an orange to go to the rally, I say go. And then vote for  the ANC," he said, smiling broadly.    He said the NP's electioneering tricks created hostility.  Reacting to accusations from the NP that campaigners were being  harassed by ANC supporters in the townships, Mr Mandela said ANC  offices in five rightwing towns and the homes of two ANC  officials had been bombed recently. The NP had not complained or  taken any action to prevent more attacks, he said.    It was in the interest of all ANC supporters to allow the NP  to campaign freely in the townships. "I appeal to you all. I  don't want that party to say they lost the elections because  they were not allowed to put their views across to everyone."    His American style of campaigning to meet the people and  mingle with supporters nearly came to grief on Sunday. As crowds  surged forward to shake Mr Mandela's hand at his car, a trapped  reporter nearly had her legs crushed when the bodyguards in the  car behind surged forward to close the gap.    She was forced to leap onto the bonnet of the car and spend  a  terrifying few moments while the bodyguards sped forward to try  and get her off the car. Only cries from the crowd persuaded  them to stop and allow her to be carried away.    A peace monitor was overheard commenting: "There is no  proper  control here today. The marshals are ineffective and this  incident is a warning that someone could get seriously hurt soon  if security measures are not beefed up".    A minute's silence was observed at the rally for former  Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] president and  mineworker, Elijah Barayi, who was buried in Carletonville on  Sunday.</p>

Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in the Commons that the Finance Bill to be published on May 20 would include provisions to prevent the exploitation of a recent ruling by the special tax commissioners arising from a double taxation agreement. They decided certain payments under equity notes were interest for tax purposes. Mr Dorrell said the Inland Revenue was considering an appeal against the ruling. He also announced that new clauses to be introduced in the committee stage of the bill to confirm the existing basis for taxing life assurance companies. They had been made necessary by the claims made by some companies that the existing basis could not apply when a trading loss was incurred.</p>

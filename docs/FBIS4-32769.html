			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/06/1994 -- The censure  motion against the Vacaroiu Cabinet laid by the Democratic  Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR] is "a very big error," said  Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Party of  Social Democracy [PDSR], at a press conference on Tuesday [28  June].    The PSDR leader said that the PDAR Leader Victor Surdu was  attempting "to draw the electorate of his party onto a certain  zone in order to justify the PDAR shift to opposition." Anyway,  the ruling PSDR will treat the PDAR "as an opposition party with  all the consequences resulting thereof," said Adrian Nastase.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS TO GIVE VICTIMS TEDDY BEARS  </P> <P> The Ventura Fire Department next month will begin stocking its engines with an  unusual piece of equipment -- teddy bears.  </P> <P> City firefighters will hand out the 11-inch-tall stuffed animals to help soothe  children who are victims of accidents or fires, spokesman Barry Simmons said.  </P> <P> "It will give them some instant gratification and maybe help ease the pain," he  said.  </P> <P> The brown-and-white teddy bears, known as Buffy Bears, are donated by the  Assistance League of Ventura County, a community service organization that  helps children, Simmons said.  </P> <P> The cuddly toys are handed out by Ventura and Oxnard police, the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office, Assistance League  spokeswoman Peggy Purnell said.  </P> <P> More than 200 of the teddy bears have been given out since the program began  last year, she said.  </P> <P> "It really seems to fill a need children have to cuddle something," Purnell  said.

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada's Blind Date Granada's chief executive, Mr Gerry Robinson, gambled by not paying up to secure LWT's approval for his bid. It was a close call but he won the bet. Granada's shareholders will be grateful for his parsimony. But he will still have to work hard to prove that a two-and-a-half day London television franchise, controlling 12 per cent of the ITV advertising market, is worth much the same as BMW paid for Rover. That task may be complicated by the bid's hostility. There are bound to be ructions as LWT is embraced into the Granada fold. It would certainly be a shame if LWT's talented managers were dispersed. At least, they are well provided for. The inclusion of LWT means Granada will earn about a third of its profits from television with an additional 13.5 per cent stake in BSkyB. That suggests Granada's shares are more likely to track racier media stocks than leisure companies. But they may prove soggy while the market digests the newly-issued shares. LWT's managers, who own 10 per cent of their company, seem certain sellers - unless they fancy haunting Mr Robinson at shareholder meetings. Others, too, may want to bale out at this point. Assuming a small take-up of the cash alternative, Granada's gearing will only rise marginally to about 65 per cent by the year-end. All its businesses are highly cash-generative, however, and borrowings should be quickly reduced. It will not be long before the market starts second-guessing what Granada will buy next to offset its declining rental income. Its acquisitive growth may seem worryingly reminiscent of some 1980s glamour stock. Granada has to show it will not end the same way.</p>

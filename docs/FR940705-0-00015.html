			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation, which may require consultation with State and local officials. A Notice of Final rule titled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees, and RTB bank loans, to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage under this Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA issues publications titled ``Bulletin'' which serve to guide borrowers regarding already codified policy, procedures, and requirements needed to manage loans, loan guarantee programs, and the security instruments which provide for and secure REA financing. REA issues standards and specifications for the construction of telephone facilities financed with REA Loan Funds. REA is rescinding Bulletin 345&hyph;90, ``REA Specification for Totally Filled Fiber Optic Cable, PE&hyph;90,'' and codifying this specification at 7 CFR 1755.900, REA Specification for Filled Fiber Optic Cables. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Filled fiber optic cable is used in outside plant by REA telephone borrowers as a physical transport medium for voice and data. The current REA Specification PE&hyph;90 limits the type of single mode fiber to dispersion-unshifted. The limitation was established because REA borrowers' lightwave systems operate at the 1310 nanometer wavelength for which the dispersion-unshifted fiber is optimally designed. The dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber can also be used in lightwave systems operating at the 1550 nanometer wavelength window but with a degradation in signal transmission. To provide REA borrowers with a quality fiber optic cable to be used in lightwave systems operating at 1550 nanometers without signal degradation, the revised specification will include single mode dispersion-shifted fiber as an option to single mode dispersion-unshifted fiber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current REA Specification PE&hyph;90 limits multimode fiber to 50/125 micrometers because at the time the specification was written, it was the only diameter multimode fiber in existence. Since that time the fiber optic industry has developed several multimode fiber designs of which the 62.5/125 micrometer design has become the de facto standard. Now that 62.5/125 micrometer multimode fiber is an accepted industry standard, the revised specification will include the 62.5/125 multimode fiber as an option to the 50/125 multimode fiber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current REA Specification PE&hyph;90 does not include a self-supporting aerial fiber optic cable because when the specification was written, no such cable design existed. Since issuance of the current specification, fiber optic cable manufacturers have developed such cable designs. These designs have been installed in operating telephone systems and are providing satisfactory field performance. The installation cost of self-supporting aerial fiber optic cable is less than the installation cost of lashed aerial fiber optic cable. To provide REA borrowers with a less costly aerial fiber optic cable installation, the revised specification will include a section on self-supporting aerial fiber optic cable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current specification includes only end product requirements associated with filled fiber optic cable utilizing only dispersion-unshifted single mode fibers and 50/125 micrometers multimode fibers and lashed aerial fiber optic cables. Since the revised specification will allow dispersion-shifted single mode fibers, 62.5/125 micrometers multimode fibers, and self-supporting aerial fiber optic cables, end product requirements have been included to assure quality products for these applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action establishes REA requirements for a wider range of filled fiber optic cables without affecting current designs or manufacturing techniques. This widened selection of cables will afford REA telephone borrowers the opportunity to increase subscriber services in an economical and efficient manner through enhanced cable designs brought about by technological advancements made during the past seven years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Vehicle parts plant planned SOMMER, the French vehicle trim manufacturer, is setting up a second UK production plant, John Griffiths writes. The plant, at Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, will employ about 300 people with production expected to start in the summer. It will supply interior parts to Toyota's nearby plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire. Sommer already has a factory next to Nissan's car facility at Washington, Tyne and Wear, to which it supplies interior trim on a just-in-time basis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, Apr 15, BNS -- Yuri Matochkin,  head of the Kaliningrad region's administration, may soon be  given full-scale authorizations to hold talks with Lithuania on  Russia's behalf. At a press conference in Kaliningrad,  Matochkin said such authorizations were promised at his meeting  with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow this  week.    Commenting on relations with Lithuania, Matochkin said  Russia  introduces "strict requirements" for Lithuania this year. He  noted, however, that Russia's policy may be milder if Lithuania  treats Kaliningrad in a more favorable way. In his words, the  region already made its move with respect to Lithuania.  Matochkin said "further advancement" and a more favorable trade  status for Lithuania in the greater Russia will be possible only  then. Matochkin said this year the region will focus on the  development of its relations with Scandinavian and Baltic  countries.    Discussing a scheduled visit to Kaliningrad April 19 by the  German finance minister, Matochkin said the visit was arranged  on the initiative of the German side. "We will not ask anything  from Germans, we will only suggest," he said. "As regards  credits, we already have three foreign credit lines for 50, 8  and 10 million dollars," but he declined to specify any  potential creditors.</p>

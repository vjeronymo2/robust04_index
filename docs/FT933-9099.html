			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Buthelezi calls for East Rand peace with ANC CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday called on his supporters in the East Rand townships, where more than 400 people have died in political conflict over the past five weeks, to make peace with rivals in the African National Congress. Chief Buthelezi was addressing about 3,000 supporters at a rally in Thokoza, the township at the heart of much of the recent violence, which has seen Inkatha supporters pitted against the ANC. Echoing a similar call made by ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela when he visited the area last week, Chief Buthelezi said: 'I say to IFP members and . . . supporters that they must find common cause with ANC members and. . . supporters.' Chief Buthelezi made no mention of when Inkatha might return to constitutional talks which it walked out of on July 2. The Inkatha central committee is expected to make a decision on Saturday. Like Mr Mandela, Chief Buthelezi yesterday accepted that political leaders themselves had to do more to stop the violence. He said it was not good enough 'for us as black leaders when we fail to stop the violence and turn around to blame it only on the ineffectiveness of the security forces'. He stressed, though, that violence would not stop without the efforts of the people on the ground. 'When that will does not exist, no peace-keeping force and no dispute resolution committees will ever be able to function properly.' Although his tone was more emollient than recently, this did not stop Chief Buthelezi repeating his call for the disbandment of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. He said the absorption of MK into the Defence Force, or into the recently mooted multi-party peace-keeping force was a 'total prescription for disaster'.</p>

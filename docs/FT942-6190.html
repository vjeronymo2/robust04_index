			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Cheap imports crush the English grape: Stewart Dalby finds the wine industry facing a fresh set of difficulties The English wine industry has suffered from the boom in cross-channel imports of beer, wine and spirits, compounded by a higher rate of duty than faced by continental competitors. There are just over 450 vineyards in Britain, with approximately 60 wineries, covering 2,000 acres and producing, in a good year, 2.5m litres of wine - about 0.3 per cent of British wine consumption. The industry has always had its problems, not least fighting the perception that the climate is not quite right for quality wine growing. It receives no government assistance, unlike industries in other European countries, and the UK is the only European Union country which charges tax on wine bought at the vineyard. The fragmented nature of the industry and lack of mass production means overheads are high, marketing difficult and costs per bottle more than those for most imported wines. Since January last year taxes on imports from European producers were abolished. English wine attracts a levy of Pounds 12.30 a case, or another Pounds 1 a bottle. Mr David Carr Taylor runs a 37-acre vine near Hastings in East Sussex. He buys in a lot of grapes and produces about 100,000 bottles a year. He says farm-gate sales are down more than 40 per cent in the past year and sales to hotels and restaurants, which make up about 40 per cent of his custom, are down 50 per cent. 'Since January 1993, a hotelier or restaurateur can drive a Transit van across to Calais, buy a truck-load of wine at less than Pounds 2 a bottle and still see a profit even after the ferry fare. Under the law anyone can bring in enough for his or her own personal consumption, so if you are running a restaurant you can get away with it,' he says. He believes that the single market's easing of drink importation has much to do with those declines in sales. The situation is a little easier for quality wine makers. Mr Christopher Ann runs the English Wine Centre in East Sussex - a small vineyard and off-licence business. He says: 'A lot of our business is special events and we have some secure outlets. The quality end has held better than for table wines. Even so I would guess business is down by 20 per cent. This is not solely due to the cross-channel traffic. There are other factors, but certainly the imports and the duty we have to pay have not helped.' Ms Gay Biddlecombe, who runs the St George vineyard, also in East Sussex, says: 'We have not been particularly affected by the cross-channel trade so far, but this is because I specialise in niche marketing of quality wine.' Commander Geoffrey Bond, chief executive of the English Vineyards Association, says: 'We were already being hit by all kinds of regulation which don't affect other producers in the EU. This duty is one more heavy burden.' The association is preparing to lobby the government to lift the duty. He says: 'I am contacting all our members to find how business has been hit. But I can well imagine that some vineyards are 50 per cent down in business.'</p>

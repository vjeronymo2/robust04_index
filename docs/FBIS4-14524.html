			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Lieutenant General Mamedrafi </F> Mamedov, Azerbaijan defense minister, by Beshir Sherifov; place  and date not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Sherifov] We regularly broadcast the Defense  Ministry's reports every day. But under existing conditions, it  would be more interesting to hear about the situation from the  minister himself.    [Mamedov] The situation on our borders is favorable at the  present time. We steadfastly maintain our positions, regardless  of the agreement we have reached to implement a cease-fire.  Meanwhile, we have been taking several measures. A state of  mobilization has been declared in the country. Troops are being  instructed and trained at all training centers. We wish to  establish an army. An army has to be established, regardless of  whether or not there is a war. A strong country and state must  have a strong and proper army. We are concerning ourselves every  hour, every day, and everywhere in the Republic with  establishing our army, regardless of the continuing war.    [Sherifov] Is it not the state that is carrying out the  work?    [Mamedov] Yes, the work is being carried out by the state.  That is our sacred duty.    [Sherifov] Lengthy talks have been held on the  implementation  of a cease-fire agreement. You have participated in the talks  in Moscow in your capacity as defense minister. Furthermore,  the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have held talks on the  matter. However, a result has not yet been achieved. Can you  comment on this matter?    [Mamedov] The defense ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and  Russia signed an agreement on 18 February. Paragraph 3 of that  agreement said that the Armenians must withdraw their military  forces as soon as a cease-fire agreement came into effect.  Exchanges of fire were to be halted at 0000 on 1 March and the  Armenians were to begin withdrawing their military forces at  1000 in the morning. We acted accordingly and declared a  cease-fire at 0000. However, they failed to withdraw their  military forces at 1000 on 1 March. Russia's deputy defense  minister arrived in Azerbaijan several days later. He did so  after visiting Armenia. He informed us of the Armenian view that  we must also withdraw from the front line. However, Paragraph 3  says that the Armenians must withdraw and leave our territory.  They must go to Daghlyk Karabakh. They were not interested in  withdrawing from our territories. That was not what was  discussed and agreed upon.    [Sherifov] The territory belongs to us.    [Mamedov] Yes, the territory belongs to us. To where were we  expected to withdraw? They must withdraw from our occupied  territory. To where were we supposed to withdraw?  Consequently, the talks failed to yield a result.    [Sherifov] The Armenians violated the provisions of the  cease-fire agreement, as they have done in the past.    [Mamedov] Yes, that is right. They failed to comply with the  provisions of that agreement. The chairman of the Armenian  Supreme Soviet called his counterpart several days later. He  informed him that he wished to meet him. I was there too.  However, I did not attend the talks that were held between the  two officials. Later, I heard everything they said in their  disclosures. We held talks afterwards. The Armenian officials  said that they agreed to comply with the agreement. They also  said that they would move to withdraw from our territory within  20 days. I wish to reiterate that they said within 20 days.    However, the chairman of the Armenian Supreme Soviet  objected  several days later. Meanwhile, the representatives of the  Foreign and Defense Ministries of the two countries were working  in Moscow. They were trying to find a peaceful way to resolve  the problem. But that is another matter. The Azerbaijan Armed  Forces must always serve and defend the homeland, regardless of  whether a peaceful situation or a state of war exists. That is  our duty.    [Sherifov] Do you mean to say that the process of  establishing the Army is continuing.    [Mamedov] Yes, it is. Whether or not peace is established  makes no difference. The Republic's Army must be established,  and I am confident that it will be established. The Armenians  exploited the situation in the past. They reached cease-fire  agreements only to reassemble their military forces to launch  new attacks to occupy our territory. The current situation is  different. They recently tried to attack several times.  However, they met with strong resistance and were forced to  retreat after suffering casualties. [Sherifov] Cease-fire  agreements were violated many times in the past. An effort was  made to reach a new agreement each time. Do you have confidence  in cease-fire agreements?    [Mamedov] No, but a cease-fire agreement cannot be ruled out  completely. The effort made to find a peaceful solution to the  war cannot be abandoned. Therefore, an objection cannot be  made. The territories that have been occupied through the use  of armed force have to be liberated in a similar way. However,  that objective may also be achieved through a peaceful approach.  That would be appropriate. We do not wish to exploit the  opportunities, but that does not apply to the Armenians.    [Sherifov] Do you mean to say that they conclude cease-fire  agreements to gain time?    [Mamedov] That is right. That is what they did in the past.  They exploited every opportunity to gain time to reorganize  their military forces. However, we are aware of all Armenian  tactics and do not wish to give them any opportunity. Had all  the people concerned themselves with the war, we would have  evicted them from Azerbaijan's territory a long time ago.  [passage omitted]</p>

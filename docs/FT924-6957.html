			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Thames given Channel 5 deadline THAMES Television has been given two weeks to come up with evidence of firm funding for its attempt to launch a fifth television channel in the UK. The Independent Television Commission was expected to make a decision on Channel 5, which should reach 70 per cent of the UK population, at its meeting in Manchester yesterday. Instead a decision was deferred until its next meeting on December 17. It is believed that the postponement was at the request of Thames - which is the main driving force behind Channel Five Holdings, the only company to bid for the franchise. The company is in negotiations with a number of potential investors.</p>

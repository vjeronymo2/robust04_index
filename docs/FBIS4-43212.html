			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norbert Mayer: "Joy, Wiener Schnitzel, and Potato </F> Salad"]    [Excerpt] When the reports came in from Austria, there was  tangible relief among the European Union [EU] diplomats.    EU Commission President Jacques Delors told correspondents  that Austria is an "ideal link between East and West" and a  "great nation" that will contribute its share to Europe, while  maintaining its own identity. The EU motto "No more war" and  "Unity gives strength" has been confirmed by the Austrian  decision. The EU now needs both enlargement and a deepening of  its institutions, Delors said.    Dutch Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek has  called the result a very positive contribution. "In my opinion,  the Union has become more European today. EU membership does  not mean a loss of sovereignty and cultural identity but  assuming joint responsibility." Asked by DER STANDARD whether  he, an avid supporter of putting deepening before enlargement,  has now changed his mind, Van den Broek said: "I have been in  favor of enlargement not just for the past 15 months but since  the Lisbon summit in 1992. I just wanted to make sure it will  not water down the Union's substance and prevent a deepening."    Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, is also  pleased about Austria's yes vote: "The majority would not be  deceived by the anti-EU campaign. This is a good sign for the  progress of the ratifications in Scandinavia."    "If anything had gone wrong, we could only have conducted  crisis management during our presidency in the second half of  1994," a high-ranking representative of the German EU delegation  said. "The Austrians have clearly voted against national  selfish tendencies and have shown responsibility in deciding for  a common European future," a statement by [German] Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel was quoted.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sinan Onus] </F>   [Text] During the National Security Council meeting the  previous day President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller were given a report on Armenia, prepared over the last  year by MIT [National Intelligence Organization] and the  intelligence department of the Security Directorate. There were  indications that the "top secret" report produced documentary  evidence of Armenia-PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] ties.    Noting that Armenia directly supports the PKK, the report  showed that PKK militants are being trained in 13 Armenian  villages. Stating that members of the Kurdish minority in  Armenia are being encouraged and given money to join the PKK,  the report claimed that the Armenians are also acting as  mediators with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to secure arms and  ammunition for the PKK.    The report claimed that in improving PKK's ties with  Armenia,  ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] laid  the groundwork for the establishment of PKK bases in that  country.    Explaining that Armenia's aim in helping the PKK is to  oppress the Kurdish people living in eastern Anatolia, the  report said: "In the long term, this country aims to isolate  the PKK and, using the popular base in the region, to realize  the illusion of a greater Armenia."</p>

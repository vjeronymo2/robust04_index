			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: SFA expels oil futures broker HOPE COMMODITIES, an oil futures broker on London's International Petroleum Exchange, and its director Mr Ahmad Al-Rahmani were yesterday expelled from membership by the Securities and Futures Authority on the grounds that they had 'ceased to be fit and proper persons'. The SFA, the securities industry regulator, has been investigating Hope Commodities since it became aware of irregularities shortly before the company went into liquidation in January this year with debts of Pounds 1.2m. An SFA official confirmed yesterday that it had passed information on to the Metropolitan Police. Mr Al-Rahmani, Hope's sole director, is accused of having improperly used money deposited by a client with Hope for trading purposes. The authority says the broker admitted that the funds were used instead to meet margin calls and trading losses on other unnamed client accounts. Information in financial returns submitted by Hope during 1991 was false and misleading, the SFA says, showing an excess of funds when in fact there was a substantial deficit. Mr Al-Rahmani is said to have admitted to the SFA that he deliberately failed to disclose some debts, and that Hope was probably insolvent from the beginning of 1991.</p>

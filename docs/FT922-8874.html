			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / US Corporate Bonds: Treasuries rally may bring new wave of borrowing THE STRONG performance of the US Treasury market in the wake of last week's quarterly refunding has pushed the yield on the long - 30-year - bond back below the key level of 8 per cent. It could also open the door to a fresh round of corporate fund-raising. The domestic US corporate bond market got off to a busy start to the year, with more than Dollars 75bn of fresh debt in the first quarter. The pace of activity slowed subsequently, as yields in the US bond market climbed - but last week's rally in the market could bring companies back to the market. 'The 7.9 per cent long bond yield reached in Friday's rally will flush out some more borrowers,' forecast Mr Joe MacHale, managing director, capital markets, at JP Morgan Securities in New York. The calendar of potential issues has been building in recent weeks, according to underwriters. However, a cap on supply was created because US companies were no longer able to meet their funding targets when the Treasury market weakened. Although other factors, such as the shape of the yield curve and the performance of corporate spreads, are also important in determining borrowers' funding costs, the 8 per cent yield level on the long bond has proved an important psychological barrier for issuers. Most companies are looking at fixed-rate funds. 'If you look at rates as far back as 1979, corporate funding rates are currently at the low end of the range,' said Mr Bob Scott, head of fixed income at Morgan Stanley. However, borrowers are facing a difficult choice. They are keen to extend the maturity profile of their debt by securing longer-term funding through the bond markets, in order to refinance short-term debt. The difficulties experienced by some companies in rolling over commercial paper have made treasurers reluctant to become dependent on short-term debt. However, the steep shape of the yield curve means borrowers have to pay as much as four points more to raise long-term, rather than short-term, funds. Short-term rates have reached historically low levels, which many borrowers find hard to pass up. 'If the economy picks up further, more companies will be prepared to make that trade-off,' said one Wall Street capital markets analyst. In addition, many borrowers still believe that US interest rates have further to fall, and are willing to hold on. The same attitude is contributing to a lack of opportunities in the swap market: a lack of fixed-rate payers in the swap market has kept swap spreads very narrow, so post-swap floating-rate funding levels are not attractive. Meanwhile, investor demand remains robust. US institutions have substantial amounts of cash to invest, and, with expectations of 3 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent inflation, continue to take a reasonably positive view of the bond market. Demand is spread across the board, with pension funds, insurance companies, money market and mutual funds all opting for different areas of the yield curve. Yield spreads have reached historically tight levels, with weaker credits performing relatively better than stronger credits, reflecting strong appetite for higher-yielding paper. Investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with corporate debt as the US economy emerges from recession, while the process of de-leveraging since the end of the 1980s has improved the credit profile of corporate America. The fresh availability of equity funding has allowed companies to rebuild their capital bases. US institutions are also extremely sophisticated in their assessment of credit risk, often boasting their own credit research capacity. The nuances between different companies with the same credit rating have become increasingly pronounced. There has also been a growing distinction between cyclical and non-cyclical companies. Since the start of the year, bond yields of non-cyclical companies have tightened about 10 basis points, while those of companies in cyclical industries have performed even better, partly as a reversal of their underperformance last year. US companies rated Triple-B, which would not even be able to gain access to the public debt markets in many countries, can raise 10-year debt in the US corporate bond market at little more than 100 basis points (1 per cent) above the comparable US Treasury yield. This year, US companies have consistently been able to raise funds more cheaply in the US corporate bond market than in the Eurodollar bond market, even though underwriting fees in the Eurobond market are substantially lower. The fall-off in continental European investors willing to pay a premium for household company names, and shifting views on the dollar, have contributed to the Eurobond market's inability to compete with rates offered in the US domestic market. Rather than US companies borrowing in Europe, the trend is likely to be the reverse. As a result, some European companies may find funding opportunities in the US increasingly attractive. While top-rated European companies, such as British Telecom, still command a premium in the Eurodollar bond market, some lower-rated borrowers may find the US market more receptive. For example, a number of European banks are currently preparing to raise subordinated debt in the Yankee bond market (the US market for foreign borrowers). Subordinated debt is highly prized by banks, since it counts as capital under Basle guidelines. However, European banks have found subordinated debt hard, or prohibitively expensive, to raise in their own markets.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Observer: Rubbish man Helping out Halton Borough Council does not sound quite as romantic as buying up hundreds of square miles of African rainforests to save the gorillas. But it adds another green strand to the colourful career of Tim Midgeley, director of Biomass which has won a 20-year contract to recycle all the council's household rubbish The Staffordshire-based environmentalist and businessman hit the headlines in May when Biomass took over Oxford United Football Club, which was previously owned by the late Robert Maxwell. Like Cap'n Bob, Midgeley is a man with big ideas and he wants Oxford to have an 'ecologically benign stadium' partly powered by solar panels. It would demonstrate Biomass's ethics of sustainable use of energy to Oxford United's fans. Two years ago Midgeley, who once worked in the environment department, teamed up with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers' president Roy Lynk to mount a Pounds 1.5bn bid for Powergen, backed by the venture capital arm of the Legal &amp; General insurance group. It came to nothing. But Midgeley remains upbeat on the idea of investing in energy. 'Watch this space - coal could be very interesting', is all he'll say about Biomass's future plans.</p>

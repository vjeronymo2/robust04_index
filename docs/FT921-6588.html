			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why location counts  -Different ways in which retailers go in search of the right site for stores There is a saying in the retailing industry that only three things matter: location, location and location. Site your shop in the right area, the belief runs, and the world will beat a path to your door. But how do retailers know what the right site is and, more importantly, how do they go about finding it? Until recently, retailers have been happy to entrust their choice to chartered surveyors who advise about the availability and price of potential sites. Inevitably this can be a somewhat hit-and-miss affair, depending heavily on a surveyor's expertise. The costs of getting it wrong can be enormous. But many retailers are now adopting a more scientific approach to site selection and are using a growing mass of demographic information to determine the best location. This week, Pinpoint, a market research company, is launching a new service called Site Optimiser, which promises to extend the process further. Using a range of market research information, Pinpoint will aim to find the optimal location for a store leaving it up to the company and its surveyors to try to match the ideal with the reality. So, for example, Pinpoint would be able to search its computer database and rank a range of possible sites for an electrical retailer on being instructed that the company would ideally like a site in Manchester with a high concentration of young, affluent, upwardly-mobile families within a half an hour's drive. At present Pinpoint uses a range of information culled from the 1981 census, cross-referenced with data from CSO regional reports and family expenditure surveys, and trade association figures. But Paul Winters, managing director, predicts an 'explosion' of the range of analysis following the release of the 1991 census figures later this year. Publication of the census figures will provide a more detailed breakdown of household characteristics than ever before and will include about twice the information available in the 1981 census. The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys will start releasing the information in April, beginning with the Isle of Wight and concluding almost a year later with south Glamorgan. The data will include such details as the regional population break-down by age, sex, nature of household ownership and car ownership. For the first time, information on the ethnic origin of local populations and the prevalence of central heating will be measured. This information will allow retailers to develop more sophisticated models of local economies and their spending patterns. It could also help shops market themselves more effectively and even allow them to stock products more closely tailored to their customers' needs. Some consumer products companies are already experimenting with such micro-marketing. For example, Heinz, the food group is running a series of local radio commercials in Hindi in Yorkshire, the Midlands and London, to encourage Asian mothers to buy a new range of 11 vegetarian baby meals. Some retailers, particularly the grocery chains such as Tesco and J. Sainsbury, have also developed highly sophisticated models of local spending patterns and intensively research the demographic profile of any area in which they intend to invest. Tesco claims that its assessments of a store's potential turnover are usually accurate to within 5 per cent; when a modern superstore costs up to Pounds 35m to build and turns over upwards of Pounds 50m a year, it is clearly critical to make the right choice of site. Other retailers are also latching on to the benefits of rigorous site appraisal but some of them prove that old-fashioned instinct can still prove to be surprisingly effective. For example, Kevin Threlfall, chairman and managing director of T&amp;S Stores, which runs 583 convenience stores and tobacconists, swears by a very simple method of assessing a store's viability: he counts the passers-by during a five-minute period at the busiest time of the week, invariably between 11am and 1 pm on a Friday or Saturday. 'If we had a site where 100 people passed within five minutes, then that would equate to Pounds 10,000 turnover a week. Two hundred people would represent Pounds 20,000. As a rule of thumb it is pretty accurate,' he says. Other factors also come into play and T&amp;S prefers to site its stores next to shops which have a high customer flow such as bakers or greengrocers, rather than banks or building societies. 'It may not be very scientific but it certainly works for us,' says Threlfall.</p>

The first stage of the meeting is being held in  Azerbaijan's Kazakhskiy Rayon, near the border. The meeting  will subsequently be continued in Idzhevanskiy rayon in the  northeast of Armenia.    The talks are taking place in camera, but it is known that  the heads of the legislative bodies of Armenia and Azerbaijan  are discussing the problem of settling the conflict in  Nagorno-Karabakh -- specifically, ways of achieving a cease-fire  in the region affected by the conflict.</p>

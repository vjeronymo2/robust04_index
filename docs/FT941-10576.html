			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Lib Dems shift focus to capture Euro seats The Liberal Democrats have refocused their European strategy to maximise their chances of taking a number of Tory seats in the June European elections. The new policy, which was launched yesterday, emphasises decentralisation and diversity instead of what one senior Liberal Democrat called 'loose talk of a united states of Europe'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, denied that the party was watering down its commitment to a federal Europe but conceded that there had been 'a change of presentation'. The party has also gone back on its earlier pledge to reduce defence spending by 50 per cent - which if implemented could have led to the loss of jobs in the south-west - in light of the rise of nationalism and instability in eastern and central Europe. Mr Ashdown said: 'Anyone who looked around at the world in 1989 and said it was exactly the same in 1993 would be a fool. It's not true of the government and its not true of us.' The Liberal Democrats, which currently have no representation in the European Parliament, have earmarked between three and 10 of the UK's 81 seats which they believe are winnable. The party's campaign strategy is to use the European elections to expand throughout the south of England out of its stronghold in the south-west. To this end the forthcoming by-election at Eastleigh - caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan - could not have come at a better time for the Liberal Democrats. Mr Milligan held Eastleigh for the Conservatives with a majority of 17,702. The Liberal Democrats need a swing of just more than 11.6 per cent to take the seat, well below the 35.4 per cent achieved at nearby Christchurch. The Liberal Democrats' new policy document on Europe, Making Europe Work For Us, refers only to the concept of a federal Europe in terms of decentralising power to enhance its appeal to Conservative voters in the south of England. It says: 'This is the vision of decentralist federalism to which the Liberal Democrats are committed: a streamlined and effective European Union in which power is exercised at the lowest level.' It contrasts this with Conservative attempts 'to twist the word federal out of all recognition, to equate with their bogey of a centralised Brussels superstate'. In an attempt to embarrass the government, the Liberal Democrats tabled an early day motion noting the government's links with the European Peoples Party, which 'works towards the realisation of a united states of Europe'. Mr Ashdown said those who were passionate about Europe had to explain to people, concerned about jobs and prosperity, the practical advantages of having a pro-European policy. 'Our task is to show that Britain needs to take a lead in making Europe work for people,' he said.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Price cut for Tiphook disposal Tiphook, the debt-laden UK transport leasing group, has further reduced the estimate of the price it will receive for its container business from Transamerica, the US financial services group. Tiphook first announced the proposed sale of its largest asset for Pounds 830m in November, but last month reduced the figure to a maximum of Pounds 757m. Last night the group said it would now receive up to Pounds 734m. Of that, Pounds 44.25m will be placed in an escrow account and be subject to further claims by Transamerica, so the group may receive only Pounds 690m. The proceeds will be used to reduce Tiphook's debts, which ballooned to more than Pounds 1bn last year, breaking banking covenants and causing a collapse in the group's share price. The group continues to borrow money from its banks and said that without their support, and in the absence of other financing, 'the directors believe that the group would be forced into either administration or liquidation'. Accounts are being prepared on a 'going concern basis'. Mr Robert Montague, the controversial executive chairman of the group he founded, will be replaced by Mr Rupert Hambro as non-executive chairman, pending the appointment of a new permanent chairman. Mr Montague will become chief executive of Tiphook's remaining activities - its fleet of truck trailers, the biggest fleet in Europe, and a small rail rental business. Five other board members will also resign, including non-executive director Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Tiphook said it expected to record a profit on the sale of the container business. However, when this profit was booked, the company would be required to write off through the profit and loss account the goodwill associated with the container operations, resulting in a substantial net loss. This goodwill charge would not affect the reported net assets of the group. Excluding the effects of the sale, Tiphook is expected to report a second-half loss. Tiphook said its prospects would depend on revenue generated by the trailer and rail rental divisions, as well as on its ability to reduce costs. The group would have a lower level of borrowings and, therefore, lower interest charges. It said cash outflow had been reduced through the cancellation and deferral of trailer capital expenditure commitments. But the interim results for the six months to October 31, due today, would contain a related charge of Pounds 49.7m. Lex, Page 18</p>

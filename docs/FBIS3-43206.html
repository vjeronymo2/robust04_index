			<p>Arabic     Version of Al-Asad's Statement on "Normal Relations"      President Hafiz al-Asad's 16 January statement supporting "normal  peaceful relations among all" as a result of peace with Israel  went significantly further than previously in suggesting a  willingness to meet Israel's demand for full-fledged ties; but in  his statement, which did not elaborate on the meaning of "normal  relations," he evidently made a conscious effort to avoid using  the term in Arabic that most clearly connotes such ties.  Speaking at the joint press conference with President Clinton  following their summit in Geneva, al-Asad endorsed "'alaqat silm  'adiyah" (Damascus TV, 16 January) rather than "'alaqat silm  tabi'iyah."  Although the former term can also be translated as  "normal peaceful relations" ('adiyah means ordinary or regular),  Arab media generally use the word "tatbi'"--from which the latter  expression is derived--to connote "normalization," presumably  including full diplomatic ties, trade, and tourism.  In fact, the  term "tatbi'" was used by Syrian media's Arabic translation of  President Clinton's reference at the joint press conference to  eventual "normal and peaceful relations" between Syria and  Israel.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Warning on VAT plans for car leases Government plans to allow car leasing companies to reclaim value added tax on their car purchases for the first time will distort the car market and depress new car sales next summer, accountants Grant Thornton said yesterday. The draft legislation, which is open to further amendment until March, removes the disadvantages which car leasing companies - which account for about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars on the road - have suffered when leasing to private individuals and VAT-exempt companies, such as banks and building societies, which are unable to recover VAT they pay. If the leasing companies are allowed to recover the 17.5 per cent VAT, private individuals and financial sector customers will no longer be forced to pay 'VAT on VAT' when leasing - both on the vehicle purchase and the lease company's charges. Accountants and organisations involved with leasing say, however, that the legislation will give an advantage to the leasing sector compared with the outright purchase of vehicles by companies. The accountants said that if left intact, the legislation, which will allow the leasing industry to reclaim VAT from next August 1, would depress new car sales throughout next summer because businesses would extend leases on their existing cars until they could take advantage of the new tax regime. Mr Frank Hartley, an analyst with Grant Thornton, said: 'Now that the draft legislation has been published it makes clear that the government does not intend to allow user companies buying their cars to reclaim any VAT on directly purchased cars if there is any element of private use whatsoever. 'Yet if a fully taxable business leases its cars and allows private use of them, it will still be able to reclaim 50 per cent of the VAT on the lease charges.' This would far outweigh the slightly higher total of VAT payable to reflect the finance element of the leasing charges. New car registrations, Page 10</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Kellogg improves 11.4% to Dollars 675m KELLOGG, the US cereal group, yesterday registered an underlying profits improvement of 11.4 per cent, at Dollars 675.1m after tax, for 1992. Sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 6.19bn, or by 9 per cent if the effects of selling Fearn International, Kellogg's former food service subsidiary, are stripped out. Kellogg's final figures, however, were muddied by a gain on asset disposals and accounting changes. The net gain from asset sales was Dollars 25.8m, but this was offset by a Dollars 269.7m charge from the change in US accounting practice for non-pension post-retirement benefits. As a result, Kellogg posted after-tax profits of Dollars 431.2m for the year, down from Dollars 606m in 1991, and earnings per share fell to Dollars 1.81 from Dollars 2.51. During the fourth quarter, reported sales fell 1.7 per cent to Dollars 1.42bn, but Kellogg said this reflected the Fearn disposal. Without this, sales would have risen about 4 per cent. Fourth-quarter profits from operations rose from Dollars 118.2m to Dollars 132.5m. Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman, described the figures as encouraging, and said they reflected record cereal volumes. However, on Wall Street, Kellogg shares eased by Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 61 5/8.</p>

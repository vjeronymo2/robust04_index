			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by RIA: ``Sickly Children''] </F>   [Text]Lyubov Kazina, head of the Moscow Department of  Education, states that ``48 percent of the children in Moscow  cannot be called essentially healthy. A total of 260,000  children suffer from serious chronic pathology, which means that  about every sixth child is affected. Statistics show that the  physical condition of children worsens in school. Thus, less  than 1 percent of the children have postural disturbances in  nursery schools, and by the time they are in second grade, the  figure rises to 4 percent. In the lowest grades, visual  impairment is observed in almost 6 percent of the  schoolchildren, and by the eighth grade, this applies to 21  percent.''</p>

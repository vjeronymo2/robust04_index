			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY FOCUSES ATTENTION ON DETERIORATION OF ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> The article by Kennedy is an example of the pathetic Pollyanna attitude that  threatens to reduce the environmental movement to a media circus destined to  quickly fade in deference to big business-as-usual. Earth First! should be  applauded, not chided, for standing up to the vested interests and refusing to  compromise the integrity of our remaining wilderness areas.  </P> <P> It takes political and personal courage to chain oneself to a bulldozer or to  physically block huge logging trucks in an effort to prevent further  clear-cutting. The object of actions such as tree spiking is to protect  forests, not injure loggers. Spiked trees are painted with large "S" as a  warning.  </P> <P> I applaud the more diplomatic efforts of Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and other  mainstream environmental groups, but the question must be asked: "What have  they really accomplished in the 20 years since the last Earth Day?" A series of  politically palatable compromises and small victories designed by politicians  and industry to pacify the public are all we have to show. The global  environmental situation continues to worsen despite the well-intentioned  efforts of these groups. Enough talk, Mr. Kennedy. It's time we put the Earth  First!  </P> <P> BRAD BOWLIN  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

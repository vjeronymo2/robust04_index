			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- According to Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, Germany cannot at present promise  Bundeswehr participation in a permanent UN reaction force. He  holds the view that the wish of UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali for a reaction force of this kind is "right in  principle," Kinkel said today on Hessischer Rundfunk radio. At  the moment it is the case that the United Nations always has to  go begging when it is a question of getting troops for stemming  or eliminating crises in troublespots. "We have told  Butrus-Ghali that we support him on this matter in principle,  but cannot participate at the moment," Kinkel stressed. He said  he assumes that the Federal Constitutional Court will reach a  decision in May or June.    It is a question of the Bundestag's being able to decide on  each individual case for blue helmet or peacemaking measures,  Kinkel said. However, he added that he adheres to his view that  the culture of restraint shown by Germany in foreign and  security policy since the World War II must be "retained at all  costs." Thus Germany will "in the future say `no' far more  often than `yes'" even after a decision has been made by the  Federal Constitutional Court.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Mexican fiesta as forza deserts the Azzurri The forza was never really with Italy on a glorious summer's day in Washington, but the Azzurri mustered just enough of it to manage a 1-1 draw with Mexico in their final Group E game of the World Cup's first round and advance, edgily, into the second, Jurek Martin writes. There was no confining Mexican joy. As the final whistle blew, players, bench and the predominantly Hispanic crowd erupted in ecstasy, secure in the knowledge that, regardless of the outcome of Ireland-Norway, under way simultaneously, their team, with three goals against Italy's two and the same number of points, was certain to fight another day. Both goals arrived in an 11-minute span early in the second half. Three minutes after the break Albertini found Massaro running free down the middle with a simple, direct pass. Massaro, a half-time substitute for Casiraghi, had the legs on the defence and only Jorge Campos to beat. To describe the Mexican goalkeeper as flashy is the understatement of the century. His uniform yesterday, according to carefully observed fashion notes, was a fetching mixture of scarlet, canary yellow and lime green, with blue and black edgings and lightning flashes. Undazzled, Massaro buried the ball under his body. The Mexican response, in the 58th minute, was opportunistic. The Italian defence failed to clear the ball from its right corner. It broke free, on a deflection, across the penalty area, Signori gambled on an interception and missed, and Bernal placed a precise right-foot shot low beyond Marchegiani's diving right hand. And that was pretty much it for a match which never satisfied expectations. There was the odd flicker: a bicycle kick by Casiraghi after 25 minutes that went straight at Campos and a fine save by Marchegiani, who tipped over a long-range cracker from Garcia Aspe. If the second half was busier than the first, both defences maintained control and both attacks lacked imagination. Italy's Roberto Baggio, refreshed after sitting out the last three-quarters of the Norway game, worked ferociously hard, but the Mexicans put Ambris on him to the right, Bernal to the left and generally had someone spare when he ventured down the middle. Massaro ran hard after the break and there could be no complaints about the work-loads of Albertini and Maldini. But Berti seemed more interested in falling down and claiming fouls than in creating openings or threatening goals, while Signori's attacking flair was more deployed in defence, for reasons that appeared to lack logic. For their part, aside from some long-range speculation, the Mexicans' idea of attack was mostly to get the ball out to the tall and talented Alves on the left flank. But, in easily the best individual duel of the match, Benarrivo took care of him superbly and cleanly, only once - late in the game - letting Alves slip through, only for the opportunity to be wasted when no support was up for the cross. Luis Garcia, who scored twice against Ireland, was invisible and the venerable Hugo Sanchez never saw action. Mexico's strength was their well-organised mid-field: Garcia Aspe, Bernal and Ambris can knock it around a bit and do not get flustered. But, on the basis of their performances yesterday, neither Italy nor Mexico can have high hopes of surviving much further, their adoring supporters notwithstanding.</p>

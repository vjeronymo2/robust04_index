			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (6): Painful adjustments may be needed - Valuation and Performance Measures THE EUROPEAN venture capital industry is adjusting to the idea of performance measures with the dogged determination of the patient aware that a rather bitter medicine will do him good. While many venture capitalists remain cautious of the validity of interim valuations, pressure from investors is forcing them to be more open about their performance. Four years after the publication of the first comparative study of venture capital performance in the US, the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) has begun a pilot study of fund performance while the European Venture Capital Association is engaged in a similar project in continental Europe. The Dutch venture capital industry produced its first annual study of the performance of 'realised' investments last year while a small study of French venture funds has also been completed. Interest in valuation and performance measures has been fuelled by the resistance venture capitalists have encountered in raising new funds. Institutional investors have seen their hopes of high returns from venture capital dashed and have become reluctant to commit more money. If venture capital is to establish itself as a separate asset class in the minds of institutional fund managers it must be able to provide an objective measure of performance. At present, venture capital investments are often lumped together with 'cash' or 'other investments,' notes Mr Robert Drummond, BVCA chairman. A standardised performance measure will allow investors to compare the performance of their funds with other funds of the same vintage, says Mr John Hustler, a partner in accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. It will also allow the comparison of venture capital with other forms of investment such as equities and bonds and will strengthen the hand of the industry when lobbying government, he adds. 'It is incredibly important for the industry in Europe to focus on performance,' says Mr Rhoddy Swire, chairman of Pantheon Ventures (formerly GT Venture Management). 'We get much more open reports from the US.' The only true measure of performance comes when an investee company is sold or floated. But by putting the spotlight on performance the industry will help managers concentrate on the need to achieve 'exits' for their investments. In the past, UK venture managers have sometimes appeared reluctant to seek an exit, he says. In the US, the annual Investment Benchmarks Report, compiled by Venture Economics, a specialist consultancy, measures the implied internal rate of return (IRR) to the limited partners in venture funds by year of fund formation or 'vintage.' The first study in 1988 analysed 175 funds. The 1992 study compared 403 funds which had been established between 1969 and 1990. In the UK, the BVCA has begun a pilot study of six funds also aimed at comparing performance by vintage year. It hopes to have the first results by the middle of next year. Despite these efforts considerable suspicion remains that crude performance comparisons might work to the disadvantage of funds investing in early-stage companies which take longer to generate returns. 'What is difficult is ensuring that the different fund structures and types of performance are recognised,' says Mr Ian Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures. 'One good investment could distort a fund's performance. How a fund draws down its money can also affect performance.' This has not prevented the more confident UK funds from measuring their performance against other forms of investment. CINVen, the second largest UK venture fund, claims a return of more than 30 per cent on its investments between 1980 and 1990 compared with less than 20 per cent on UK equities and under 15 per cent from UK bonds. The Dutch Venture Capital Industry Association's performance study of realised investments between 1986 and 1990 records an average return on venture capital of 13 per cent compared with 4 per cent on equities, 2 per cent on bonds and 6 per cent on deposits. These percentages do not take into account the higher costs of managing a venture capital portfolio compared with the other forms of investment, the association notes. A performance measure, of course, can only be calculated on the basis of a standard method of valuing investee companies. The BVCA is currently reviewing the valuation guidelines it introduced in early 1991 to ensure greater consistency. There are still important areas of valuation which rely on opinion in, for example, judging when to make provisions for a permanent drop in value or in estimating prospective earnings. The BVCA expects any changes to its guidelines to be relatively minor but wants to ensure that judgments are based on realistic assumptions. Investors should be able to judge whether valuations are reached on a prudent basis if funds show how realisations compare with the last published interim valuation, according to Mr lain Tulloch of Murray Johnstone, who is carrying out the review. Some venture capitalists are becoming more open about these numbers. 3i, the largest UK venture capital company, reveals in its most recent annual report that realisations were twice net book value in 1988 but that the premium had fallen to 39 per cent by 1992. County NatWest Ventures says recent realisations have been 40 per cent above interim valuations while Phildrew Ventures reports internal valuations are less than half realisation values. Given the leeway in the BVCA's valuation guidelines, these percentages may not be directly comparable. But the effect of the publication of the guidelines has been to establish a framework and to focus the industry on a narrower range of valuations - 'one or two of the cowboys have been found out,' says Mr Hawkins of Phildrew Ventures. Many venture capitalists acknowledge that they had to make small changes in their valuation procedures to bring themselves into line with the BVCA guidelines though their impact on some of the quoted investment trusts was dramatic. Some of the trusts, which had long been regarded as taking a more generous view of valuations than the unquoted venture firms, were forced into making substantial write-downs of their portfolios. 3i, which is preparing itself for a public flotation, has also carried out a review of the way it values its investments. It has eased its criteria for valuing investments in two important areas. It has reduced the illiquidity discount it applies to very small companies, capitalised at less than Pounds 5m, from 40 to 30 per cent and it will no longer apply a 20 per cent discount to Unlisted Securities Market stocks. In the long-term, the valuation and performance information can only benefit the venture capital industry. In the short-term, it may require some painful adjustments.</p>

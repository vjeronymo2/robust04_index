			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Too many marks It is tempting to dismiss the 20.6 per cent growth in Germany's January M3 money supply as meaningless. The figure is a crude annualisation of only one month's worth of data. Some of the rise in private sector lending reflects changes in the tax rules on mortgages. The difficulty, though, lies in knowing how much. Since the outcome was so far in excess of market expectations, the risk is that underlying money supply growth is still higher than the Bundesbank intends. The public importance it attaches to this particular indicator puts the central bank in a dilemma. Even if money supply remains flat in February, annualised growth over the first two months of the year will still be 13 per cent. There may be quite a debate in Germany about the relevance of M3. But while it is growing so fast, the chances are that the Bundesbank will continue the glacial pace of interest rate cuts implicit in this week's 3 basis point fall in its money market repurchase rate. Although inflation is coming down and the economy is weak, it has to worry about losing credibility. The irony is that, by encouraging domestic investors to hold money on short term deposit, this may delay the slowdown of money supply growth. Until the yield curve steepens, there is limited incentive to buy bonds, especially in these nervous markets. Bond markets yesterday went down because they were afraid that the Bundesbank would not cut rates, not because they were worried it would unleash inflation by doing so. A yield of nearly 7 per cent on 30-year government issues is attractive with inflation already below 3 per cent in Bavaria. Investors might realise that sooner if the Bundesbank were not so short-sighted.</p>

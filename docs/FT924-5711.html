			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Finnish bank restructuring under way THE FIRST move in a widely-expected restructuring of the troubled Finnish banking system was made yesterday when Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, announced plans to take over STS-Bank, the country's sixth-largest bank. As part of the deal, KOP and the government guarantee fund are to set up a new company to shoulder STS's problem loan portfolio of some FM2.2bn (Dollars 430m). KOP is paying FM75m to take over 67 per cent of STS from the STS Foundation immediately, and will then make a public offer for the remaining shares. It will also invest a further FM50m for a 10 per cent stake in the company taking over STS's problem loans, with the government guarantee fund injecting FM450m for the balance. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said KOP would strengthen its presence in the household sector by acquiring STS. It will take over FM10bn in loans from STS and FM7.5bn in deposits. He added: 'The co-operation now agreed is a significant start to the elimination of excess capacity in the Finnish banking sector. It will not solve all the problems in this field, but it is a step in the right direction.' KOP expects to close all but 10 to 15 of STS's 100 branch network. Both banks have been badly hit by the severe Finnish recession and high credit losses. KOP reported a FM2.53bn loss for the first eight months and STS a FM281m loss. The government guarantee fund has already announced plans to merge Skopbank, which had to be rescued by the state last year, and the Savings Bank of Finland as part of a streamlining of the banking sector.</p>

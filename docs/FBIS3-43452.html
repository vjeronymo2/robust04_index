			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Blacks are twice as optimistic as whites about the  year ahead. This has emerged from a Markinor Gallup poll which  shows that 60 percent of blacks and only 31 percent of whites  think conditions will improve in 1994. Optimism has improved  markedly among blacks with 29 percent more than last year being  positive about prospects. This is in sharp contrast to last  year when blacks and whites were equally pessimistic about the  future. Coloreds and Indians are only slightly less optimistic  than blacks. Close on 60 percent of blacks and just over 40  percent of coloreds feel that there will be fewer strikes this  year. Forty percent of whites and 40 percent of Indians believe  industrial strife will increase.</p>

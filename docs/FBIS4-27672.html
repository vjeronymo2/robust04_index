			<p>BFN     [Text] Experts on plant quarantine from Korea and the  United States got together for a two-day meeting at the National  Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS) in Anyang city, Kyonggi  Province, yesterday.    The annual phytosanitary meeting, the fifth of its kind,  deals with technical issues like pest control and treatments for  agricultural and forestry products whose overseas shipments have  been banned because of pests or diseases.    At the meeting, the Korean side is expected to ask the  United  States to issue import permits for four kinds of Korean fruits  and seven sorts of vegetables.    Among the requested items are apples, unshu oranges  (tangerines), persimmons, including sweet ones, and kiwis along  with cucumbers, Oriental melons, watermelons and squashes,  according to an NPQS official.    Under the provision of the International Plant Protection  Convention, plants and plant products exported to foreign  countries are subject to inspection if there are harmful pests  and diseases and then the phytosanitary certificate is issued.    The U.S. side is expected to ask for Korea to import  American-produced pine lumber, apples and Hawaiian papayas,  according to the official.    In February this year, the Korean side presented to the  United States' Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) plans to control the three kinds of pests and diseases  affecting Korean apples that the U.S. side had raised as reasons  for banning imports of the fruit from Korea.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Romanian truck that was stopped at the Suben  superhighway checkpoint carried 2,300 (!) firearms.    "Wooden boxes" was tersely written on the declaration of  goods that the driver presented. However, the German customs  officers became suspicious and had a closer look at the 166  boxes. They contained carbines, guns, machine guns,  semiautomatic guns, ammunition, and parts of weapons.    The destination would have been a commercial firm in North  Rhine-Westphalia. The freight was confiscated and criminal  proceedings were instituted against the "receiver" and the truck  driver.</p>

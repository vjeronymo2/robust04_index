			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar edges ahead to Pounds 0.43m Fife Indmar, the Edinburgh-based engineer, edged ahead from Pounds 424,000 to Pounds 431,000 pre-tax in the half year to June 30. Mr Gavin Hepburn, the chairman, said that as anticipated, the slowdown in North Sea activity had been compensated by improved returns from the other businesses and lower interest costs. Turnover grew from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 16.5m, including Pounds 709,000 from acquisitions. Earnings per share slipped to 2.5p (2.7p) because of the March share issue and the interim dividend is held at 0.75p.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Bank lending UK banks are in danger of experiencing economic recovery with precious little growth in their loan books. Their problem was highlighted by yesterday's M4 money supply figures showing bank lending strangely subdued. If previous patterns had been repeated, corporate lending should have been much greater at this stage of the cycle. A partial explanation lies in the corporate sector's strong profits growth. In the second quarter, retained earnings jumped by 52 per cent year on year, allowing companies to pay down debt and fund capital projects through cash flow. On top of this, those requiring additional capital have turned increasingly to the equity and bond markets rather than banks. UK companies are still quite highly geared, supporting the view that most will continue to pay down debt. But if cash flow becomes insufficient to cover expected increases in capital spending, industry will have to turn elsewhere for funds. As interest rates rise, the increased cost of capital in the equity markets may make bank loans relatively more attractive.</p>

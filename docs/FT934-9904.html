			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / French Senate approves state aid for companies cutting workers' hours The French Senate yesterday approved a conditional form of state aid to reward companies which agree to cut the working hours of existing employees in order to reduce the country's lengthening dole queues, writes David Buchan in Paris. The Senate amendment to a new five-year employment bill must return to the national assembly, which rebuffed a not dissimilar plan last month. Since then, however, the government has swung behind the workshare scheme, making full parliamentary approval likely. Worksharing as a palliative to unemployment is increasingly in vogue, both in the EC Commission where it is expected to figure in the white paper on jobs, and in France, where unemployment reached 11.8 per cent in September and is forecast to hit 12 per cent by the year's end.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Early this morning, leader President Saddam Husayn,  may God protect him, inspected the al-Rashid fruit and vegetable  market in the al-Dawrah area in Baghdad. To examine the prices  of agricultural products and the reasons for their rise in  price, his excellency held detailed discussions with those in  charge of marketing offices. In an objective and candid  dialogue, those concerned reviewed their ideas and experiments  in this field.    The leader president listened to their observations, views,  and proposals for curbing the high prices of fruit and  vegetables and for easing their adverse effect on citizens'  lives. His excellency said that the extent of price hikes is  unjustified, and that marketing outlets can play a fair and  national role at this period in time when the children of our  proud people are suffering from the effects of the unjust  blockade. He said that marketing outlets should be satisfied  with a profit margin that pleases God and all parties, and  contributes to achieving contentment, psychological stability,  and reassurance on all levels. He said that profits should be  within reasonable limits, and not at the expense of others'  misery and suffering and [word indistinct] calculations. He  said when the citizen deals with others, he should take into  consideration the calculations of the society as an entity with  common sentiments and fate. This is because, he added, high  prices harm the citizen and expands to harm the entire society,  God forbid.    His excellency stressed that the blockade will founder, God  willing, against the Iraqis' firm patience and steadfastness  which has drawn worldwide admiration.    Meanwhile, leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect  him, greeted the children of our people, who shouted "long live  the president." They stressed absolute confidence in his  excellency's leadership of the march of jihad and construction  and defense of glorious and steadfast Iraq, the Iraq of beloved  leader Saddam Husayn.</p>

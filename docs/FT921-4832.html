			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls firm on dividend RELIEF greeted news of a maintained dividend by Rolls-Royce, as the company reported a 71 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 51m, the bottom end of expectations. The dividend was maintained at 4.7p, making a year's total of 7.25p. Release of the figures saw the shares race forward and at the day's best they were 12 up, as analysts pointed to a better cash position than had been feared. The slow recovery in the spares business attracted attention at an analysts' meeting with the board, however, and after this the shares relinquished earlier gains to close only 6 up at 146p. Turnover was heavy at 16m shares. Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'This is a good result in a difficult year with a sustained recovery in prospect over the next few years.' The range for current year forecasts is between Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m. Raine surprises Raine Industries, the housebuilding group, delivered two surprises to the market by its acquisition of Walter Lawrence, the Hertfordshire-based builder, and its proposed Pounds 33.5m rights issue to help fund the deal. Raine launched its agreed offer for Lawrence via a one-for-two share swap. Raine shares fell heavily after the news, closing 14 off at 110p on turnover of 567,000, but those of Lawrence more than doubled at one point to 50p prior to ending a busy session at 46p, up 23. Yesterday's developments accompanied Raine's interim results which showed profits struck after a Pounds 3.4m write-down of its near-3 per cent stake in YJ Lovell, the construction group. Raine built the stake last summer before Lovell announced a rights issue and before its share price plummeted in response to heavy losses, dividend omission and disclosure that it had breached its banking covenants. Power downgrades Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), the investment bank, appeared to have been largely responsible for hefty turnover and share price falls in National Power and PowerGen. The latter dropped 7 to 236p on 5.5m shares traded while the former was also 7 down at 223p on 2.6m shares. Mr Chris Rowland, electricity industry analyst at BZW, in a detailed and bearish review of the two generators, evaluated their prospects after 1993, when they will lose protection of the existing contracts with the regional electricity companies. 'We believe the inevitable consequences of a period of lower margins for the two companies in the mid-1990's will be much reduced levels of profitability with dividend security threatened,' said Mr Rowland. He considers both shares overvalued by one third relative to the market. He predicts that National Power profits will drop from an expected Pounds 560m for 1993 to Pounds 250m for 1994 and those of PowerGen from Pounds 370m in 1993 to Pounds 170m in 1994. Ladbroke steady Reporting trading figures from its interests ranging from hotels to betting-shops, Ladbroke turned in satisfactory results, the shares adding 5 to 229p in very heavy volume of 7.3m. Analysts declared themselves pleased with the disclosures from the normally somewhat reticent group, including the details on the property and hotel businesses. A dividend increase above expectations also helped sentiment. Improving hotel occupancy figures, particularly abroad, an improved outlook for the betting industry, and satisfaction that the group had gone some way towards addressing its property write-downs inspired most houses to upgrade profit forecasts for 1992. County NatWest is looking for a gross Pounds 245m, Hoare Govett Pounds 250m, Smith New Court Pounds 275m, with no capitalisation on property, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is on Pounds 230m, net of any hotel disposals. Prudential, removed from County NatWest's list of 30 best buys, fell 4 to 239p. Composites were given a mauling, as marketmakers chopped their prices to head off any attempted selling. Low levels of turnover in the stocks, proved they had been successful. Royal Insurance was the weakest performer, sliding a further 10 to 176p. Insurance broker Lloyd Thompson, due to report interim figures soon, drew strong support and closed 10 higher at 240p. Singer &amp; Friedlander were nudged up 3 to 44p after James Capel, the stockbroker moved into the market to buy up to 33.55m shares at 40p a share for cancellation. Volume in Singer shot up to 63m, indicating that most of the stock had been bought in. A large line of Singer stock, some 7.7m shares, changed hands late on Wednesday. Specialists said the rise in Singer's share price reflected the increase in assets per share after the stock buy in. The recent resilient performance of BP shares was reversed yesterday as US institutions reacted to claims of an uninspiring presentation in New York on Wednesday evening, by Mr John Browne, BP's head of exploration and production activities. News that BP Canada had passed its interim dividend was an added depressant. The BP Canada news was described by one oil specialist as 'immaterial in cash terms to BP but nevertheless a story that has ruffled feathers on Wall Street'. With the US buying spree at least temporarily at an end, BP shares retreated to 262p before steadying and ending the session a net 4 1/2 lower at 265p. Turnover of 9.3m shares, although ahead of average activity levels, was well down on recent sessions. The smaller oil stocks suffered from the effects of a programme trade made up entirely of second line exploration issues. These included Clyde, 2 off at 56p, Goal, 3 1/2 down at 55p, Premier, a penny easier at 23p and Monument Oil &amp; Gas,  3/4 off at 31 1/4 p. More speculation over the possibility of Thorn EMI wining the battle for Virgin's music division again undermined the shares which fell 12 to 785p. Good volume in Granada Group pushed the shares 7 higher at 255p as the market reflected on Wednesday's AGM and upcoming institutional presentation on BSkyB. Turnover reached 4.9m. A rally by Unilever was against the market trend, rising 8 to 942p in reaction to speculation that the company will sell off its animal feeds business. Results from United Biscuits are due next Thursday. The shares fell 7 to 412p despite a forecast from County NatWest that 1991 profits will rise 4 per cent to Pounds 206m. The recent decline by Bass continued, with the shares losing another 13 to 548p, declining from 579p at the end of last week. Analyst Mr Christopher Wickham, at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said it was hardly surprising that Bass has been hit by profit-taking after a good run. He fears that the company's major divisions, with the possible exception of soft drinks, are probably performing worse than last year. Recent bid rumours supported Boddington, with the shares rising 4 to 188p ahead of the results on March 25. BAA retreated 15 to 563p after James Capel weighed in with a profits down-grading. The broker reduced its profits forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 185m for the year to March 1992. Miss Yasmin Harrison, at James Capel, believes 'there will be further write-downs in BAA's Central London properties and slower-than-expected traffic recovery'. Simon Engineering powered ahead, jumping 19 to 271p after County NatWest included the stock on its list of 30 best buys. The leaked opinion poll pointing to a substantial Labour lead over the Conservatives in key marginal constituencies, triggered a minor shakeout in the utilities areas of the market. But dealers emphasised there were no signs of the big institutions hitting the panic button to sell the sectors ahead of the election; 'there was no shortage of sellers but much of it was straightforward profit-taking,' said one dealer. Turnover figures confirmed this, with Anglian Water slipping 11 to 358p on meagre activity of 813,000 shares. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (56).

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UN flies 350 injured out of Srebrenica: Bosnian Serbs refuse to extend deadline for disarming Moslem forces BRITISH and French helicopters of the United Nations forces yesterday flew more than 350 seriously wounded and sick people from the besieged town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. The local Moslem authorities were refusing to let more civilians be taken out by road although the UN was hopeful of doing so in a couple of days. As the second day of air evacuations got under way under a ceasefire plan agreed by the Bosnian Serb and Moslem commanders, UN peacekeepers in Srebrenica asked the Bosnian Serb army to allow the Wednesday deadline for disarming Moslem forces to be extended by 24 hours. The commander of the Canadian UN battalion deployed in Srebrenica as part of the ceasefire agreement argued that there was not enough time for the disarmament orders to be passed down. However, General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, said he would stick to the letter of the agreement he had signed with the Moslem commander. He also denied an assertion by General Philippe Morillon, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, that the besieging forces would withdraw as soon as Srebrenica was demilitarised. 'The agreement says that combat operations are frozen at current lines around Srebrenica,' he said. Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, suggested that a high-level meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the Yugoslav conflict could be convened in Srebrenica. Alternatively, the London conference which launched the Yugoslav peace process last August could be reconvened. In Washington, President Bill Clinton was said to be 'actively considering more options' to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the internationally brokered peace settlement in Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday reiterated his call for a complete economic blockade of Serbia , after cabinet ministers again rejected early military action. Following a special cabinet committee meeting, Mr Hurd said continuing Serb intransigence 'will bring Serbia to economic disaster'. But he did not rule out air strikes against Serb supply and communication lines or even supplying arms to the Bosnian Moslems. He had a smooth reception from Conservative MPs in the Commons, some of whom had previously expressed impatience with what they considered Britain's too timid stance. Hurd wins backing, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Honolulu, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's Air Self-Defense  Force (ASDF) made its debut in the U.S.-led five-nation Rim of  the Pacific Exercise (Rimpac) this year, sources familiar with  the military drills said Tuesday [21 June].    Two ASDF officers joined the exercise to train in sea-based  aerial warfare under U.S. Navy guidance, the sources said.    The large-scale joint military drills of the United States,  Japan, South Korea, Canada and Australia were conducted this  month in the Pacific Ocean between the Hawaiian and the Midway  Islands.    More than 200 aircraft and 50 naval ships, including, for  the  first time, the largest Japanese destroyer Kongo equipped with  the Aegis air defense system participated in the drills.    The sources said ASDF officers have never before undergone  training during a Rimpac maneuver. In the framework of  bilateral defense cooperation with the U.S., closer links are  needed between the armies, navies and air forces to realize "the  desired comprehensive joint strategy," they said.    The participation of ASDF personnel "This time was the first  strategic move to realize that goal," the sources said.    The officers were acting as "ambush control officers" aboard  the Kongo, guiding Japanese fighter aircraft by radar to  intercept "enemy" combat planes.    Under guidance of a U.S. Navy expert, the two officers  studied how to control and direct the dispatch of fighters from  aircraft carriers and the launching of ship-to-air missiles, the  sources said.    The Kongo, equipped with the latest radar technology, is the  MSDF's most advanced combat vessel.    In the past, the training of ASDF personnel aboard U.S.  aircraft equipped with the AWACS (airborne warning and control  system) during joint military exercises with the U.S. has  sparked protests from defenders of Japan's postwar Constitution,  which bans the use or threat of force to settle international  disputes.    They said such training conflicts with the widely accepted  view that the Constitution rules out collective defense.</p>

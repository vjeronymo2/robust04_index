			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR SEEKS LIKUD GOVERNMENT BUT WON'T RULE OUT A LABOR ROLE  </P> <P> Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he is trying to assemble a  narrowly based government controlled by his hard-line Likud Party, but he  declined Friday to rule out another coalition with the rival Labor Party.  </P> <P> Shamir, who was given the task of forming Israel's next government by President  Chaim Herzog on Friday, immediately ran into trouble.  </P> <P> Yigal Bibi, a legislator of the National Religious Party, said he will back  Likud only if the center-left Labor Party joins the coalition. The surprise  statement brought the two major parties back to a 60-60 deadlock in the  120-seat Knesset (Parliament).  </P> <P> Herzog had turned to Shamir after Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, announced  Thursday he had failed to assemble a coalition after 35 days of effort.  </P> <P> Shamir, 74, head of the interim government, said he hopes to obtain a majority  within the next three weeks, as required by the presidential mandate. Speaking  to reporters, Shamir said prospects for a new Likud-Labor coalition "at the  moment look unrealistic."  </P> <P> "I would never rule out the possibility" of a coalition with Labor, he said,  "but my efforts in this period won't be aimed at a national unity government."  </P> <P> Likud and Labor ruled for 15 months in an uneasy partnership before their  government was brought down March 15 by a Knesset vote of no confidence.  </P> <P> The crisis was prompted by Shamir's refusal to accept, as Labor demanded, a  U.S. formula for arranging Israeli-Palestinian talks.  </P> <P> Herzog urged Shamir to act quickly to form a government.  </P> <P> "These days, the country is in a state of political and public confusion such  as it has never known since its founding," the president said. "There is a  heavy and true sense of depression in the public."  </P> <P> Shamir hopes to lure three right-wing factions and three ultra-Orthodox parties  into a majority coalition in the Knesset.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Well done, Mr Clarke Yesterday was the second anniversary of sterling's summary eviction from the ERM. That Wednesday has indeed proved black for the government, whose credibility has never recovered. But it has been white for the UK economy, which has enjoyed an accelerating recovery. On Monday, the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, saw fit to celebrate the anniversary by imposing the first increase in short-term rates of interest since October 1989 (except for that on that Wednesday itself). Has he ruined the chances for enduring growth, or ensured that this recovery will run and run? Changes in interest rates take perhaps two years to affect the economy. The lag is uncertain and, in any case, variable. Whether base rate at 5.75 per cent, rather than 5.25 per cent, will make a decisive difference to performance two years hence is anybody's guess. But the new base rate is not intrinsically unreasonable for a country whose counter-inflationary credibility is weak. By historical standards, it is low: the last time base rate was at this level (apart from the months since the cut to 5.5 per cent in November 1993) was in November 1977. The yield curve is strongly upward-sloping, which shows the market's expectation that current short-term interest rates are low (and so expansionary), in relation to expected ones. The shape of the yield curve reflects the jump in yields on longer-term gilts since January to 8.8 per cent, a rise of 2.7 percentage points. This was a larger jump than in Germany, where corresponding bond yields are only 7.6 per cent, notwithstanding higher inflation. In addition, the gap between conventional and index-linked gilts, which offers an indication of expected inflation, increased from 3.3 percentage points at the turn of the year to close to 5 percentage points this month. Lacks credibility In short, the government lacks credibility in financial markets, not just over its aim of 1-2 1/2 per cent inflation indicated for the end of this parliament, but on its official target of 1-4 per cent. Such lack of credibility has costs. It means, for example, that real interest rates on conventional gilts are higher than they need be. It may also mean a premature re-awakening of inflation in the labour and goods markets. The counter-argument is that the markets are being hysterical. On this view, the economy remains burdened with large amounts of slack. Correspondingly, the inflation 'shocks' of this week - a 0.5 per cent increase in the retail price index in August and a 0.3 per cent increase in producer prices - are little more than blips. Excluding mortgage interest, the annual increase in retail prices was just 2.3 per cent, the same as for producer prices. Meanwhile, July's provisional underlying increase in average earnings remained at June's unworrying level of 3 3/4 per cent. This objection can be strengthened by looking at nominal gross domestic product and domestic demand, where increases in the year to the second quarter of 1994 were only 5.6 and 4.3 per cent respectively. If the inflation target were converted to this form, these would be the sorts of increases the government would want. Is there any chance of rapid acceleration? A measure that suggests the answer is no is broad money (M4), which grew only 4.8 per cent in the year to July, vastly below levels in previous eras of accelerating inflation. Fundamental issue The fundamental issue is the extent of excess capacity, on which evidence is ambiguous. The recovery started, tentatively, between the first and second quarters of 1992 (a few months before black-and-white Wednesday). But GDP is now only 5.4 per cent above its cyclical trough and a mere 1.6 per cent above where it was when the recession began. Manufacturing output in July was 1.5 per cent below its last cyclical peak. Logically, there must be substantial excess capacity, particularly when unemployment is 2.6m. There are two objections to this line of argument. The first is that if there were excess capacity (and the economy were, correspondingly, well above its 'natural' rate of unemployment), inflation should be falling. But it is not, which suggests that the excess capacity may be largely theoretical. The second objection is that, because of this uncertainty, any excess capacity should be brought into use slowly. It is depressing, but true, that resources rendered idle by deep recessions cannot be brought back into play with ease. Complementary investment is required, which takes time. The huge damage caused by deep recessions is the main reason for trying to avoid a repetition. This is more important than reaching the (unknown) point of full capacity as swiftly as possible. In erring on the side of caution, Mr Clarke showed common sense. If needed, he can always press the accelerator again. So Mr Clarke deserves praise. He may fail to get any from party colleagues. Will the British electorate prove more understanding?</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Rhone-Poulenc boss hints at sell-off RHONE-POULENC, France's largest chemical group, may be about to move more fully into the private sector, it was announced yesterday. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chief executive, said it was probable the French state would reduce its 56.9 per cent holding in the company. He raised the possibility of a full-scale privatisation. 'The decision is not in my hands, but it is probable the government's stake will be reduced within the next three years. 'The question now is whether the state holding should be a minority interest or nothing at all,' he said. 'Whatever the conclusion of the legislative elections next year the situation will change.' Mr Fourtou announced the company's full-year results, which included a 37.5 per cent rise in operating income from FFr4.56bn (Pounds 460m) to FFr6.27bn and profits before tax up 17.8 per cent from FFr3.75bn to FFr4.42bn. Turnover rose 6.9 per cent from FFr78.4bn to FFr83.8bn. The increase in operating income was highly dependent on Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceuticals operations, and particularly on the performance of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which was created in 1990 after the French company acquired a 68 per cent stake in Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group. The dire state of the chemicals industry was demonstrated by the performance of the non-healthcare divisions where operating income fell FFr400m. The specialty chemicals division had a turnover of FFr14.8bn but made an operating surplus of only FFr100m last year. The healthcare division's operating income more than doubled from FFr2bn to FFr4.2bn. However, without the Rorer acquisition the division's pre-tax profits would have grown by only 13 per cent, said Mr Fourtou. He added that it might take five years for the full benefits of the company's acquisition programme to work their way through. He said his priority remained reducing the company's debt following its substantial acquisition programme in 1989 and 1990. Net debt had fallen from FFr34bn in 1990 to FFr33.1bn at the end of 1991. The aim was to cut debt-to-equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to close to 0.5 in 1993, he said. Earnings per ordinary share rose 1.9 per cent from FFr20.15 to FFr20.53. The dividend was held at FFr15.75.</p>

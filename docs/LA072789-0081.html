			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTRO ASSAILS BUSH AS 'ARROGANT' ON COMMUNIST WOES  </P> <P> Stunned by a devastating government drug scandal at home and admittedly worried  about democratic ferment in the Communist world, Cuban leader Fidel Castro on  Wednesday excoriated President Bush for his "arrogance" in forecasting the  decline of world socialism.  </P> <P> Castro was especially scornful of Bush's recent visits to Poland and Hungary,  which he suggested were cynical attempts "to encourage capitalist trends that  have developed there and political problems that have come up there."  </P> <P> "Never has any (U.S.) Administration, not even (Ronald) Reagan's, been as  triumphant as this one regarding the difficulties in the socialist camp,"  Castro complained to a rain-soaked crowd of many thousands here to celebrate  the 36th anniversary of the start of the Cuban revolution.  </P> <P> As the Cuban president lashed out at the Bush Administration, America's ranking  diplomat in Cuba, John J. Taylor, pointedly arose from the diplomatic section  of the speakers platform and walked out. Taylor also walked out on a speech  last January when Castro hurled insults at then-President Reagan.  </P> <P> Castro appeared particularly incensed by what he called "the euphoria of  imperialism" over ferment in the Communist world.  </P> <P> "The Bush Administration in the last few months has made statements based on  the premise that the sun is setting on socialism or that socialism will end on  the dust heap of history that was reserved for capitalism," said the bearded  leader, seemingly impervious to the rainfall that soaked his familiar green  fatigue uniform.  </P> <P> "Even if tomorrow we wake up to the news of a civil war in the U.S.S.R., even  if tomorrow we wake up to the news that the U.S.S.R. has disintegrated -- a  thing we don't expect to happen -- even under those circumstances, the Cuban  people will continue fighting," he said, grimly citing the current ethnic  conflicts and labor unrest in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But in an unusually candid section of his nearly two-hour speech, Castro  acknowledged that he is worried about the Soviet Union's continued ability to  support Cuba, to which it currently gives between $5 billion and $7 billion in  economic aid each year.  </P> <P> "There are difficulties in the revolutionary world," he said in a grave tone.  "We cannot even say with certainty that the supplies that have been coming to  our country will continue to arrive with the clocklike punctuality and as  guaranteed as they have before."  </P> <P> Castro was particularly caustic toward the Solidarity opposition movement in  Poland and the Hungarian democratic opposition for the way they greeted Bush  with anti-Communist banners during his recent tour.  </P> <P> "It is truly bitter, but this increases Bush's euphoria and increases his  triumphalism," Castro said. "It increases imperialism's hostility against Cuba,  and it increases Mr. Bush's theory that socialism is going to its downfall.  </P> <P> "If Bush thinks socialism is in decline . . . why should he change his policies  toward Cuba?  </P> <P> "That's why he is more arrogant than ever before," Castro added.  </P> <P> Castro vowed that no matter what happens to the rest of the Communist world,  Cuba will never give up, even in the face of a blockade or war and occupation  by American troops. "Sooner or later, the price would be so high for the  aggressors they would have to get out," he vowed.  </P> <P> An American diplomat who heard the speech dismissed Castro's raising of such  threats as unimaginable.  </P> <P> "He's extremely worried about the democratization movement in Eastern Europe  and can only call up the specter of the Bay of Pigs invasion 28 years ago," the  diplomat said, referring to the failed assault on Cuba by U.S.-backed rightist  exiles. He said Castro appears to be seeking a diversion in order to avoid  talking about his own problems at home.  </P> <P> Castro failed even to mention the drug scandal that has absorbed all of Cuba  for the last month. Four top military and intelligence officers were executed  and 10 others received long prison sentences for trafficking cocaine across  Cuba to the United States. The accused officers and other government figures  also have been charged with a dolce vita life style involving sex parties and  financial corruption.  </P></p>

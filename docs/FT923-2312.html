			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Bupa chief calls for end to 'war' BRITAIN's private-health sector needs to develop a much better understanding with the medical profession, the chief executive of Bupa, the biggest private provider, said yesterday. Mr Peter Jacobs told a Bupa conference in London: 'In some quarters the perception is one of warfare - a struggle on the part of the consultants to keep their fees as high as possible and of insurers to keep costs down.' Fees charged by doctors for private medical treatment were last week referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. An explosion in treatment costs, Mr Jacobs said, was threatening both the public and private sectors. It arose from growing public expectations, the ageing of the population and technological developments. While Bupa did not seek to become involved in clinical judgments in individual cases, it was examining ways of establishing and monitoring best practice and avoiding wasteful use of resources. Mr Jacobs said: 'In doing so, we will take into account the legitimate interests of all the parties involved - the hospitals, insurers and medical profession.' He also appealed for closer working between the public and private health sectors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], April 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese  Premier Li Peng and President S. A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan  pledged in their formal talks today to expand the scope of  bilateral cooperation.    The two leaders, in two rounds of talks held at the  presidential palace, had an in-depth exchange of views on ways  of furthering bilateral relations as well as on regional and  international issues of common concern, in what a Chinese  spokesman called "a cordial and friendly atmosphere."    Li Peng and Niyazov were satisfied with the "steady and  smooth" expansion of bilateral ties since the two countries  forged diplomatic relations in early 1992, according to the  source.    Li Peng said President Niyazov's successful visit to China  in  1992 "opened a new chapter in the annals of friendship between  China and Turkmenistan."    The two countries enjoy a good political relationship, and  their economic ties are expanding, showing vast potentials for  development, Li noted.    He added that "with mutual understanding and trust, we have  reason to believe in further growth of such ties."    Niyazov said that Li's visit is long-awaited, "but this does  not mean we have any differences or urgent problems to be  addressed. Instead, it shows Turkmenistan's sincerity for  developing relations with China."    "We admire China's long history, brilliant culture and  industrious people, as well as its leadership's wisdom," the  spokesman quoted Niyazov as saying.    The president said he learned a lot during his visit to  China  in 1992, which he said is useful reference. However, he added,  as conditions in Turkmenistan are different, "we would not  simply copy China's experience."    Li agreed with that, saying that a country knows best its  own  history, tradition and characteristics, and instead of copying a  foreign mode, should go along a path of development compatible  with its own national conditions.    "The government of Turkmenistan is doing just that," he  said.  "China fully understands and respects Turkmenistan's domestic  and foreign policy."    Li, referring to bilateral economic cooperation, which is  only at its initial stage with a modest trade volume, noted that  both countries are sincere to expand trade and economic  cooperation.    Relevant departments of the two countries are discussing  ways  of expanding the scope and tapping the potentials of such  cooperation, he said.    With political stability and abundant reserves of oil and  gas, Turkmenistan is in a good position to revitalize the  economy, Li said, calling the country's on-going economic  readjustment "a wise move," which will serve to boost economic  development.    Touching on potential cooperation in building a gas  pipeline,  Li said that would be a project extending into the next century,  which requires a thorough feasibility study.    "If it is indeed feasible, such a project will benefit all  parties concerned," he said. "China is willing to explore the  possibilities in this regard, together with relevant countries,  including Turkmenistan."    China and Turkmenistan can cooperate in other fields as  well, he said, adding he expected the top Chinese entrepreneurs  traveling with him to have close contact with their local  counterparts and strive for "concrete results."    Niyazov briefed Li on Turkmenistan's relations with other  nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the  neighboring countries, saying his country maintains good, normal  nation-to- nation ties with them.    During the talks, Li gave an account of the minority  nationalities in China.    Owing to China's correct policy on nationalities, the  Xinjiang Autonomous Region and other areas inhabited by  minority ethnic groups, just like other parts of the country,  enjoy political stability, economic development and  considerable improvement in people's livelihood, he said.    Niyazov said Turkmenistan respects China's sovereignty and  territorial integrity, appreciates its policy on nationalities,  and opposes national splittism, according to the source.</p>

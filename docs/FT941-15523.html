			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Observer: Boardroom breeding Greg Hutchings's Tomkins, like most acquisitive conglomerates, wants to be taken seriously. It's realised that if this involves strengthening an in-bred board with a few non-execs, then so be it. After all, Lord Hanson, who taught Hutchings deal-making, has added a few trophy names to Hanson's letterhead. Yesterday Hutchings recruited Jim Butler, who looked after the Lonrho audit for KPMG Peat Marwick; David Crowe, a former senior partner of Gouldens, Hanson's lawyers; and Lionel Stammers, just retired after 29 years with BTR. All three in their various ways know what makes a conglomerate tick and will be listened to at Tomkins, which is more than can probably be said for some of Hanson's non-execs. When will BTR, always jostling with Hanson for the title of Britain's biggest conglomerate, follow suit? Now that Sir Owen Green has retired as chairman there shouldn't be any problem about bringing in a few outside faces.</p>

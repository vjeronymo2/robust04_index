			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan will further  liberalize import trade in July in preparation for its entry to  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Board of  Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Saturday [7 May].    Beginning July 1, more than 90 percent of all imports will  be  allowed to enter Taiwan freely, the board said.    The board has drafted a "negative list" which will go into  force July 1. Products on the list will either be prohibited  from entering Taiwan or need import permits.    With the exception of those on the list, all other products,  accounting for 92.4 percent of the 9,305 items covered in the  BOFT- compiled product catalog, can be imported into Taiwan  freely, BOFT officials said.    Products on the "negative list" make up only 7.6 percent of  the total number of items covered in the official catalog, the  officials noted, adding the list was designed mainly to protect  some local industries, national security, public health and the  environment.    The "negative list" comprises 227 items which are totally  banned from importation and 479 other items which can be  imported with BOFT permission.    Those items prohibited include intestines, rice, chickens,  mushrooms and sugar, while those which need government  permission before being imported include red beans, peanuts,  [words indistinct], fruits, compact cars and motorcycles.    At present, 2.4 percent of products are prohibited from  import, 6.3 percent need BOFT permission, 9.5 percent require  import licenses issued by banks authorized by the BOFT, and 81.6  percent can be imported freely.    After July 1, importers of 764 items which are not on the  negative list must still present certificates issued by relevant  government agencies, the officials said. Those products include  medicines, animal feed, pesticides, medical equipment and  publications.    Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 as a separate customs  territory and is expected to become a full member by the end of  this year.</p>

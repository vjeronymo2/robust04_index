			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Observer: Room service The Queens Moat House hotel in Bournemouth is making an offer which can hardly be refused; spend three days there at the New Year and get three nights for Pounds 5 apiece next summer. Given the hotel chain's pre-tax Pounds 1.04bn loss for its last year of trading and its Pounds 1.18bn debt, Bournemouth's seem a generous offer. But watch out for small print; such as 'while stocks last'.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: Pain in Spain falls mainly on the service sector ONE OF Spain's more enthusiastic newspapers carried the news yesterday that 44 per cent of the population believes the time is ripe for the trade unions to call a one-day general strike similar to one which stopped the country in its tracks on December 14, 1988. The poll, though, will be neither news nor frightening to the government. In the first place, it sailed through the 1988 strike without trouble and it was, in fact, the unions which stumbled afterwards. Second, if there is a general strike it will already have been discounted - perhaps even deliberately triggered  - by the Machiavellian minds that plot Spanish economic policy. Chief plotter is Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister. Readers may remember him making an elaborate attempt last summer to persuade the unions to sign a 'competitiveness pact' with the government. This involved a long-term wages agreement and pay rises linked to increases in productivity and there was no way the unions were ever going to sign it. Mr Solchaga knew that, just as he knew that his tight budget proposals for this year would be strongly rejected by the socialist party when they were presented last autumn. But in Spanish politics deception is everything. The unions and the left wing of the party were being set up for a terrible revenge and the minister was carefully preparing for the first few days of April 1992. This was when he would present his Convergence Plan, a document, presumably, which would map out how Spain planned to meet the economic targets set out at Maastricht in December for those EC members wishing to be among the first to join in economic and monetary union in 1997 or, in the worst case, 1999. These were: to have remained in the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism for two years without forcing a change in parities, an inflation rate of not more than 1.5 per cent over the three best performers and, among other criteria, a public sector deficit of not more than 3 per cent of GDP. Spaniards got a first taste of it at the end of March when the Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, made convergence the theme of his annual state of the nation speech to parliament. It was a foretaste of what was swiftly to follow. The following Friday, April 3, the finance ministry published the plan and its most startling section was a note called 'Reinforcing the job-seeking process'. This was basically an announcement that Madrid was cutting unemployment benefits across the board and, even more dramatic, that it was doubling the time in employment required to qualify for the benefits. If an unemployed worker refused just one job offer, the benefit would be withdrawn. In return, the plan mumbled something about creating 60,000 new college apprenticeships. The unions quickly labelled this the most severe attack ever by an elected government on organised labour. That was probably an understatement. Four days (including a weekend) after showing copies of his plan to the press, the minister spent six hours defending it in parliament. A day later, Wednesday, the welfare measures were decreed in the government gazette and they were law. Unless Mr Gonzalez loses his nerve and stops his apparently wholehearted support of the finance minister, there will almost certainly be a general strike in Spain within the next 12 months. The climate is already sour in Madrid, where pay strikes have caused serious sanitary problems in the metro and at the airport, which have not been cleaned for weeks. Mr Solchaga does make an oblique case for the benefit cuts in his plan. If Spain is to converge (or lower) its public sector deficits, inflation and interest rates and grow at the rate the plan predicts (3 per cent this year to 3.6 per cent in 1995) it has to grow 1 per cent faster than the rest of the Community. This may be feasible, given that it has five years to put its macroeconomic house in order, but it assumes that above average growth is possible because it has been achieved ever since Spain joined the Community in 1986. The 1986-1989 boom is, however, long gone. Last year the economy grew just 2.4 per cent. But the plan neatly separates out nominal convergence, which involves cutting industrial subsidies and budgets to meet Maastricht targets, and 'real' convergence, which Mr Solchaga has invented with a view to making Spain the kind of society he wants it to be. 'Real' convergence is where the workers are more mobile, where the doctors, lawyers, architects and chemists are not protected by Napoleonic rights giving their clubs or colleges total control over their professions, where it does not take three trades to fit a gas meter, where the health service patient is entitled to expect service and expected, in return, to pay for it and where banks service their customers and not the other way around. The oblique case for 'real' convergence is that the causes of Spanish inflation now are mostly to be found in the service sector. As import barriers have fallen, Spanish industry has been forced to cut prices to compete. Mr Solchaga wants to remould the service sector. The unemployed are in that sector, along with the doctors, plumbers and customers. At the moment Spain's new anti-trust authority is compiling data on the way the professions protect themselves. This will be passed on to the minister and the axe will fall. A sweeping, almost Thatcherite reform of the health service is also certain to happen, with hospitals managing their own budgets and patients probably paying a larger portion of their prescriptions. The political calculation in all of this marks a dramatic change from Mr Gonzalez' caution of the past decade. With exactly half the seats in parliament now and an election obligatory by October next year, he could probably improve his majority by doing nothing. By deciding to shake up the workers, the health service and the professions, he risks losing support. Clearly, though, he is convinced that does not matter.</p>

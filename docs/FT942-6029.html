			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Germans alter arms sale rules The export of German weapons systems made with foreign partners will no longer need special approval following measures intended to make German companies more competitive. The economics ministry said projects undertaken with companies in the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development could now go ahead without approval if German components made up less than 20 per cent of the product. Previously, all weapons exports had to be cleared by the Federal Security Council, which oversees defence policy. Such international projects would only be allowed if Nato saw a need for the weapons systems and companies involved would have to agree in advance where the finished product would be sold, a measure designed to prevent sales of arms to so-called 'crisis zones' like the Middle East. The new rules will not apply to nuclear, biological or chemical weapons or their delivery systems.</p>

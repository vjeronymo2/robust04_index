			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Polish Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak called for a meeting with Solidarity leader  Lech Walesa to discuss the stalemate in Kiszczak's efforts to name a Cabinet  and the concerns it has raised in the Soviet Union. In an interview published  by the official PAP news agency, Kiszczak said Poland "simply cannot afford a  protracted impasse." He also called on two Communist-aligned political parties  that have begun negotiations with the Solidarity movement to remain loyal to  the Communist Party. Walesa has been trying to forge alliances with the two  minor parties, who hold the parliamentary balance of power, in order to form a  Solidarity-led government.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Request <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PBGC has received a request from the San Francisco Baseball Associates, L.P. (the ``Buyer'') for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of the San Francisco Giants (the ``Seller'') on November 20, 1992. In the request, the Buyer represents among other things that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League Baseball Players Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Seller was a participating employer in the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating employer in satisfaction of the employer's pension liability under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio and television revenues, including revenues from foreign broadcasts, of regular and exhibition games. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. During the 1992 Plan year, approximately $34.1 million was paid into the Plan on behalf of all major league clubs. In that year revenues to the Central Fund exceeded expenses, including contributions to the Plan, by approximately $354 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The amount of the bond/escrow required under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA is $1,412,077, and the estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for section 4204 is $4,796,483. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The contract of sale between the Buyer and the Seller was effective November 20, 1992, and the final closing occurred on January 14, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The contract of sale provides that the Buyer agrees ``to contribute to the Plan substantially the same number of contribution base units which the Seller had an obligation to contribute to the Plan.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The contract of sale further provides that ``[i]f the Buyer thereafter, but prior to the end of the fifth plan year commencing after the closing, partially or completely withdraws from the Plan, the Seller will be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the Plan *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In support of the waiver request, the requestor asserts that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``[B]ecause the Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's] Trust without first passing through the hands of any of the Employers, the Plan enjoys adequate security *&blank;*&blank;*. A change in ownership of an Employer does not in any way affect the obligation to fund the Plan *&blank;*&blank;* nor create the possibility that there will be difficulty in collecting Plan contributions due from any new owner *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. A complete copy of the non-confidential portions of the request has been sent to the Plan and the Union by certified mail, return receipt requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the pending exemption request to the above address. All comments will be made a part of the record. Comments received, as well as the relevant non-confidential information submitted in support of the request, will be available for public inspection at the address set forth above. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued at Washington, DC, on this 7th day of April 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Martin Slate, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Director. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8994 Filed 4&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7708&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, </F> defector from the Liberal Democratic Party, by reporter Koichi  Obata; place and date not given; last paragraph is TOKYO  SHIMBUN conclusion]    [Text] [Obata] Now that some quarters of the ruling  coalition parties are moving toward formation of a new party,  you are becoming active as you are called "catalyst politician."  What is your goal?    [Yamaguchi] My life work as a politician is to create two  major political powers to run Japan's politics. My effort in  the Shyinjiyu [New Liberal] Club were not successful, but the  experience should be utilized now because we are undergoing a  period of confusion. I am often criticized as a puppet of Mr.  Ichiro Ozawa, but, actually, Mr. Ozawa and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa are working on my behalf. (laughter)    [Obata] Then, what is your tangible plan for the "new  party"?    [Yamaguchi] The coalition parties should work together  starting with a joint policy study group, and then the group may  discuss the "new party." Even if coalition parties unify their  floor groups in the process, cooperation in the Diet may not  immediately result in tie-ups in election campaigns. In this  sense, the formation of the joint floor group seems to be a  waste of time. The Democratic Socialist Party's action plan is  calling for a "unification of all coalition parties," and I  think this is the most favorable direction. Some newspapers  said lower house candidates cannot receive multiparty support  unless they join the policy study group. This is nonsense.    [Obata] Yet, some coalition parties are wary of the study  group since it is likely to be developed into the "new party."    [Yamaguchi] While the Sakigake [Harbinger] takes a prudent  stance toward the policy study group, I do not see any  difference in policies between the Sakigake and other  conservative parties. The Sakigake's attitude is really rigid,  and it seems to me that the party is trying to demonstrate its  presence. Yet, I will call for the Sakigake's participation  again and again.    [Obata] What would you do if they refuse the study group to  the end?    [Yamaguchi] We will keep sending a message calling for  cooperation and unity. However, if they really do not  understand that, the coalition would inevitably have a bipolar  structure of "united reformists" and "social-democratic  liberals." In that case, the two groups may jointly support the  coalition government without discussing unnatural unification.  The position of "social-democratic liberals" may be like that  of Germany's Free Democratic Party (FDP), which takes part in a  coalition government led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)  and the Christian Social Union (CSU). However, Japanese voters  are severer than Germans. Such a minor power would be certainly  weeded out.    [Obata] It appears you are really frustrated with Sakigake.  What is your comment on this point?    [Yamaguchi] The coalition won in the Ishikawa gubernatorial  election. While the victory was won by the unity of coalition  parties, only Mr. (Masayoshi) Takemura (chief cabinet secretary  and head of the Sakigake) does not acknowledge this. We cannot  fawn on him forever. While Mr. Takemura says "a merger between  the Sakigake and the Japan New Party should be discussed before  the study group," Mr. Hosoakwa made that promise before he was  inaugurated as the prime minister. Now that he has much heavier  responsibility to lead the nation, he cannot afford to stand by  old friends.    [Obata] How would you involve the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] in the second stage of political realignment?    [Yamaguchi] Members of the LDP Dietmen's League for  Promotion of Political Reform took cooperative attitudes toward  the coalition when the political reform bills were enacted. Now  we need an interparty mechanism for tax and economic reform.  Mr. (Michio) Watanabe is a man capable of leading the entire  political circles on economic policies. I have great  expectations for the meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and  Mr. Watanabe, which was reportedly held last month.    Of later Mr. Yamaguchi has been actively working to pave the  way for the political realignment. He calls himself a  "catalyst" for the realignment. In our interview, he stressed:  "I am not obsessed with any status or power. I can leave  Nagata-cho when I carry out this task."    Some politicians say "it is questionable if he really can  accomplish such a difficult task." He is facing a crucial  moment to demonstrate his real value as the "political catalyst."</p>

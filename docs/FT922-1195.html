			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cupid to raise Pounds 2.7m in rights CUPID, the USM-quoted wedding gown designer, is planning to raise a net Pounds 2.68m via a 1-for-2 rights issue at 82p. The money will be used to expand the company's nursery care division, fund working capital requirements and repay borrowings. Largely as a result of the acquisition of the Youngs formal wear business for Pounds 2.2m in cash, the group's borrowings have risen to Pounds 4.2m with gearing at 93 per cent. The issue will help reduce borrowings to a more 'prudent' level and enable the company to expand. The combination of the Pronuptia bridal wear business and Youngs retail chain has already given Cupid a network of 92 shops focusing on the wedding business. The emphasis will now be on expanding the Quilty nursery products side. The issue is underwritten by BZW and brokers are Zoete &amp; Bevan and Charlton Seal. Cupid's brokers have undertaken to place the existing shareholding of Societe Generale Merchant Bank - 652,741 ordinary, representing 9.1 per cent of the current issued share capital - with institutional and other investors at 85p per share provided they agreed to take up the rights attaching to the shares placed with them. Cupid's shares closed at 90p, down 5p on the day.</p>

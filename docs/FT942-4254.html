			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Drummond The recovery seen in the first half at Drummond Group, the wool-based fabrics manufacturer, continued in the second half resulting in pre-tax profits of Pounds 716,000 for the year to March 31, against losses of Pounds 3.38m. The result was helped by exceptional profits this time of Pounds 196,000, compared with a net charge of Pounds 2.5m mainly relating to reorganisation costs. Finance charges were lower at Pounds 473,000 (Pounds 894,000). Turnover was Pounds 43.6m, against Pounds 45.6m which included Pounds 5.27m from discontinued activities. Operating profits on continuing activities amounted to Pounds 993,000, against losses of Pounds 542,000. Earnings per share were 1.79p (losses 22.63p). The board believes a restoration of the dividend would be premature but expects to pay one for the present year.</p>

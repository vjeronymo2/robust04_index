			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rally cheers salmon farmers SCOTTISH SALMON farmers meeting in Glasgow yesterday for the start of their annual exhibition and conference were more cheerful than for several years. That was because the wholesale price of farmed salmon had recovered after being at crisis levels for two years. The happy farmers do not, however, include those from Shetland. The wrecking of the tanker Braer at the beginning of last month spread a film of oil up the west coast of the islands, affecting 16 salmon farms that account for about a quarter of the 10,000 tonnes of salmon produced annually in the islands. Moving to protect their industry's reputation, the Shetland farmers declared an exclusion zone over the affected area, from which no fish can be sold. It is likely that 2.5m salmon with a market value of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 10m will have to be slaughtered in the next few weeks and the farmers compensated from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. Salmon farmers in Norway, Scotland and Ireland have been through hell since the late 1980s. But even Norwegian farmers accept that their own industry, by far the largest in Europe, must take most of the blame for what went wrong. Norway hugely increased its salmon output from 1989, reaching a peak of 160,000 tonnes in 1991 and driving prices down sharply. Norway was selling fish at below production cost in the European Community market - in a word, dumping. In late 1991 Norway began putting its house in order. Nearly 40,000 tonnes of Norwegian salmon were bought up, frozen and disposed of outside the EC. The EC temporarily imposed a minimum price on Norwegian imports. These moves, plus a slight cut in Norway's output and a drop in salmon catches in the North Pacific, have reduced world supply and enabled prices to recover. But during the crisis many smaller Scottish salmon producers went bankrupt, their sites being bought up by other companies. Unilever last year pulled out of salmon farming, selling Marine Harvest, the biggest Scottish producer which also operates in Chile, to MariFarms, a US company in which Hanson has a large stake. With salmon produced on a three-year cycle, Scottish farmers reined back their growing production by reducing the number of smolts (small salmon) they transferred to cages at sea. Scottish Office figures show that output dropped last year to 36,000 tonnes from the 1992 record of 40,500 tonnes. Prices rose by 35 per cent between March and September last year, and farmers, already benefiting from low interest rates, hope UK demand will improve this year. Now the Scottish salmon farmers want to ensure that they never again have to go through the perilous boom and bust cycle of the past few years, and Norwegian, Irish and Faroese producers agree. They all propose setting up compulsory producer organisations to control the release of smolts and operate an intervention buying system to keep up prices. All the producer organisations would meet twice a year in a European Salmon Industry Forum which would review salmon breeding and try to co-ordinate production, though its recommendations would be voluntary. The producer organisation idea is backed by nearly 90 per cent of Scottish salmon farmers. It received public support yesterday from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body for the Highlands, and has strong backing in Norway. But the UK government is indicating that though it supports voluntary organisations it would not enact legislation necessary to make the producer organisations' rulings compulsory, which the salmon farmers say is essential. Mr Donald MacRae of TSB Bank Scotland says: 'It is most unlikely that the EC Commission would agree to an international producer cartel' and asks whether the system would be workable, arguing that farmers would produce for intervention. But Mr Paul Torgnes, secretary of the Norwegian Fish Farmers Association, warned in Glasgow yesterday that Norway was now on course to more than double its production to 310,000 tonnes in 1997. 'It is imperative that we introduce mechanisms to prevent this development,' he said.</p>

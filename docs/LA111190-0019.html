			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FANTASIA' AND CHANGE  </P> <P> This is in response to an Oct. 28 letter in which Dr. C. Fortenberry complains  of an evening being ruined because three seconds of "Fantasia" were seen as  racist.  </P> <P> Good God, first the old Dick Tracy cartoon, now this! Why are we comparing the  morals and values of old movies and television to current standards?  </P> <P> Should Jackie Gleason's "The Honeymooners" be censored because Ralph's sexist  attitude is not popular now? Is "Singin' in the Rain" offensive because it's  not drought-conscious?  </P> <P> If "Fantasia" were to be made today, I'm sure a racially offensive scene would  not even be considered. But 50 years ago even Walt Disney didn't have the  foresight to know that showing dark-skinned characters serving light-skinned  characters would be considered offensive.  </P> <P> Fortunately, society has matured to a point that such portrayals are no longer  appropriate. Let's celebrate that fact instead of letting something that  happened long ago ruin an evening.  </P> <P> PAUL SCHOWALTER  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

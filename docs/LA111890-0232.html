			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTEC NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> POSSIBLE BID BOWLS OVER SDSU  </P> <P> And suddenly, there was bowl talk.  </P> <P> It's still a longshot, but San Diego State Athletic Director Fred Miller said  Saturday that the Aztecs are among a handful of teams under consideration for  an Independence Bowl berth. Miller and SDSU Coach Al Luginbill talked to the  players about it after Saturday's 40-34 victory at New Mexico.  </P> <P> "If it's there, we're more than happy to take it," quarterback Dan McGwire  said. "We have an explosive offense and our defense is coming around. I think  this team deserves it."  </P> <P> Said receiver Dennis Arey: "(Luginbill) mentioned something about it. He says  we're getting looked at."  </P> <P> Arey brushed aside bowl talk, though, in favor of Saturday's game against Texas  El Paso.  </P> <P> "We won't get looked at if we don't win," he said.  </P> <P> After UTEP, the Aztecs finish the season against Miami, Fla., at home Dec. 1.  </P> <P> The Independence Bowl is Dec. 15 in Shreveport, La.  </P> <P> SDSU's top three receivers -- Arey, Patrick Rowe and Jimmy Raye -- all had big  games against New Mexico despite what most Aztecs thought was an all-around  inconsistent day.  </P> <P> Rowe, who had 131 yards receiving, broke the 100-yard barrier for the seventh  consecutive game, leaving him one short of tying the NCAA record.  </P> <P> He credits some of his success to Arey and Raye.  </P> <P> "It's hard to defense three great receivers," Rowe said. "If a receiver from  another team is great, with two average receivers, he might be average. With me  and Dennis and Jimmy, it's like three great receivers.  </P> <P> Arey had 150 yards and Raye 110 and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The general consensus was that the offense was inconsistent because New Mexico  changed its defense for the Aztecs.  </P> <P> "They didn't blitz," Luginbill said. "They came a few times, but not like  earlier in the year. They changed their thought process to make us earn it and  not give us any big plays."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Sophomore free safety Damon Pieri left the game in the fourth quarter with a  bruised hand. SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said he planned to have it X-rayed when  he returned to San Diego. . . . Marlon Andrews had two interceptions Saturday.  SDSU has now had five in its last three games after not getting any in its  first six games. . . . SDSU has scored 30 or more points in each of its past  eight games, and the Aztecs have scored 40 or more three times in a row and in  five of their past six games. . . . Luginbill on SDSU's unbalanced offense:  "It's insane to have (530) passing yards and (158) rushing. It doesn't make any  sense. But right now, we're playing in spurts. I want to get us to where,  toward the end of the year, we're at the same level of intensity for a whole  game." He better hurry -- there are only two games left. . . . For the second  time this year, SDSU lost the turnover battle. SDSU had three, New Mexico had  two.  </P></p>

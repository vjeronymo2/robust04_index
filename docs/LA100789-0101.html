			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WEIGHS LAWS TO BAN HUD-STYLE INFLUENCE-PEDDLING ABUSES  </P> <P> Justice Department lawyers are considering proposing legislation to outlaw some  of the kinds of influence peddling that have been revealed by investigations of  Housing and Urban Development programs, the head of the department's criminal  division said Friday.  </P> <P> Assistant Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis Jr. said that ethics and  conflict-of-interest laws that focus on conduct of government employees after  they leave federal employment do not appear to cover the actions disclosed by  congressional hearings into the HUD scandal.  </P> <P> Dennis would not outline what legislative possibilities are under  consideration. He indicated that measures would not be proposed soon.  </P> <P> The hearings by the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and  housing have developed evidence that political favoritism influenced HUD's  administration of some housing programs, with Republican consultants picking up  six-figure fees for representing developers before the department.  </P> <P> Dennis, in an interview, said he did not want his comments to signal that the  Justice Department has decided that the hearings have raised "no question of  criminality."  </P> <P> "We can't say they have," he said. "We can't say they haven't.  </P> <P> "We will be exploring areas we feel are appropriate to be explored," Dennis  said. But he repeatedly emphasized the difficulties of prosecuting individuals  who meet with federal officials in an attempt to obtain government grants.  </P> <P> "Listening is never a problem," Dennis said. "People should have access to  their government. The question of whether a decision (to award a grant) has  been influenced is difficult to judge. On a criminal basis, it's a very  difficult area to regulate."  </P> <P> Dennis added that lawmakers and lobbyists naturally represent their  constituents and clients before federal agencies. "It's the duty of senators  and lobbyists to weigh in on behalf of their area," he said. "That's good.  That's what you want."  </P> <P> At the same time, Dennis contended, HUD investigations "continue to be a  priority item in the criminal division and the attorney general's office."  </P> <P> In the wake of the HUD disclosures by the House subcommittee, Justice  Department officials have said they are investigating 700 cases of alleged HUD  fraud and related violations. However, these cases involve primarily low-level  HUD officials and contractors and not the political appointees who have been  the focus of the House subcommittee hearings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought Transcripts  </P> <P> Stuart E. Weisberg, staff director of the House subcommittee, said Justice  Department officials did not request transcripts of the panel's hearings until  Sept. 20.  </P> <P> In a related development, a HUD audit made public Friday showed that errors in  calculating rents for subsidized housing are costing the federal government  millions of dollars a year.  </P> <P> The rent study, obtained by the Associated Press under the Freedom of  Information Act, involved a review by HUD's inspector general of 142 of the  2,755 areas for which the department sets fair-market rents for subsidized  housing. He found that, in 116 of those areas, the government was paying as  much as $39.1 million a year in excessive subsidies.  </P></p>

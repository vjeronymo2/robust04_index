			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Shortest of honeymoons for Hosokawa: The Japanese prime minister's need to serve many political aces MR MORIHIRO Hosokawa is on holiday. A week can be a long time in politics, and the reformist patrician sworn in last Monday as Japan's prime minister has given himself a summer break at the end of it. Spending a few days north-west of Tokyo playing tennis and reading, he can bask in approval ratings put by opinion polls at around 75 per cent. But the evidence of the week is that holding together the seven parties in his coalition will be nothing other than hard work. The seven have failed to agree on the core issue of which electoral system should replace the current multi-seat constituencies. These are blamed for engendering corruption as candidates spend money competing with others with whom they have no party or ideological differences. The system being mooted mixes deputies elected by single-seat voting districts, and by a nationwide party tally under proportional representation. Seven party mathematicians have worked out the most favourable outcome for each, and no mechanism has yet been found which will avoid electoral hara-kiri for at least one of the partners. A decision has been put off until after Mr Hosokawa, founder of the year-old Japan New party who has staked his future on delivering political reform by the end of the year, gives a policy speech to the Diet a week today. In the meantime, other issues have been highlighting the fragility of the alliance grouping Socialists, Buddhists and those who defected from the Liberal Democratic party towards the end of its 38-year conservative rule. Mr Hosokawa put down his racquet yesterday to join Emperor Akihito at the government's annual ceremony marking the surrender of Japanese imperial forces at the end of the second world war. The premier offered his condolences to Asian victims of the country's aggression, the first holder of his office to do so in so formal a manner. Leaders of the left-wing Social Democratic party, largest member of the coalition, showed up for the first time. But down the road, four of his cabinet paid their respects at the Yasukuni shrine to the memory of Japan's own war dead, including those deemed war criminals. They were all from the Japan Renewal party formed by more recent - and, some believe, relatively unreconstructed - LDP departees. An admission by the LDP, on its final day in office, that the army dragooned so-called comfort women into providing sexual services in occupied countries has sparked debate about how much more Japan needs to atone for past wrongs. One report yesterday said Mr Hosokawa was contemplating setting aside as much as Y1,000bn (Pounds 6.7bn) as a war legacy for its Asian neighbours. Such a sum would be likely to cause palpitations among Finance Ministry bureaucrats trying to restrain government spending as the country's economic slowdown knocks tax revenues. Ministers will have to preside in the next few weeks over arguments about whether cuts in income tax and compensatory increases in VAT will better stimulate demand - an idea to which the SDP is deeply hostile - as well as whether to pass on to consumers the benefits of the stronger yen on energy prices. Income for the country's political parties themselves is under review. The government wants to abolish corporate donations, and apparently won a convert yesterday in Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, Japan's largest business grouping. He is proposing an end to contributions, put at Y13bn a year which went largely to the LDP. The Social Democrats are expected to protest if the debate extends to the trade union contributions with which it is largely funded. The SDP is anyway engaged in an awkward perioid of introspection following an announcement on Thursday by Mr Sadao Yamahana, its chairman, that he would submit to a leadership contest. Mr Yamahana, a moderate, is also minister in charge of political reform in the new government. If he is ousted by a challenger from the SDP left, which is less than comfortable with its coalition partners, Mr Hosokawa's arithmetic could be altered dramatically. The prime minister is on vacation until Thursday, but his political honeymoon may already be over.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION Political Editor, in </F> Nizhniy Novgorod]    [Text] The Prime Minister saw for himself today the fruits  of Britain's multi-million pound know-how fund designed to boost  the transformation of Russia's economy. But he can hardly have  been impressed with what he saw on a trip to Nizhniy Novgorod,  the place where President Boris Yeltsin's reforms are moving  fastest.    The point of the visit was to see a trucking factory -- but  it turned out to be little more than a collection of ramshackle  buildings. A large, burly man, speaking in Russian, described  the machinery to Mr Major, who tried to look interested. For  most of his visit he has been wearing a typically Russian black  fur hat, which seemed just a fraction too large, falling down  his forehead to just above his eyes. He wore it this morning as  he boarded the aircraft in Moscow but was bare-headed during his  walkabout in Nizhniy Novgorod when he was mobbed by some 400  people.    When someone asked him why he was not wearing it on such a  cold day, Mr Major retorted with a smile: "Not a bit of it. It  is a nice, pleasant spring day." In fact, the town was bleak  and the temperature several degrees below freezing.    During his walkabout, Mr Major entered a habadasher's shop  and later went into a restaurant for a buffet lunch. The news  that he planned to meet the people was broadcast frequently on  local radio and hundreds of people turned out to greet him. In  crowded Poprovka Street, he plunged into the crowds and one  woman told him with a smile: "It's good to see you here but you  can't see Nizhniy Novgorod in a single day."    A smiling Mr Major replied: "One day here is better than a  day sitting in my office back in London."    The Prime Minister is the first Western leader in office to  visit Nizhny Novgorod since it was founded in 1221.    When one local dignitary urged him to promise that he would  return, Mr Major told him: "It is 770 years since a Western  leader came here -- I promise you that I will be back before  another 770 years have elapsed."    Overall, however, his visit to Russia has been dominated by  the civil war in Bosnia. The Russians have had centuries of  affinity with the Serbs and would be reluctant to see air  strikes on them if they failed to comply with the Nato demand to  surrender control of their artillery on the outskirts of  Sarajevo or remove it altogether. The Prime Minister assured Mr  Yeltsin this would be a limited operation if an air strike had  to happen at all.    Mr Yeltsin, although warning that Russia would not allow  force to be used without her sanction, seemed to be moving  towards the idea that air strikes might be necessary as one  means of ending the war.    For his part, Mr Major said he believed they could now see  peace starting up in Sarajevo and hoped this could lead to a  settlement elsewhere in Bosnia. But he stressed -- and the view  was shared by Mr Yeltsin -- that there could never be a military  solution.    If the UN commanders on the ground appeal for more troops,  Britain's policy would be that those countries which have not  contributed troops so far should now be asked to do so.    But no details were available from the Prime Minister's  office on whether such a request had been made by Britain to the  UN headquarters in New York.    The visit included the signing of several economic and  cultural agreements between the two countries. One was a pledge  by both sides that nuclear missiles should be "de-targeted" from  pointing at each of the two countries. They also signed an  agreement that British and Russian troops, mostly Army  personnel, would take part for the first time for 50 years in  joint exercises, in Russia, and in the United Kingdom. It is  expected that the UK exercises would be held on Salisbury Plain,  although no firm decision has been taken.    Elsewhere, the Prime Minister met British and Russian  businessmen, Russian parliamentarians and other influential  figures.    He was accompanied in Moscow by Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, who this morning split off from the main party and flew  into Riga for talks with the leaders of the three Baltic states.    Mrs Norma Major, who accompanied her husband, visited a  children's hospital in Moscow and the Bolshoi Ballet School.    Mr Major virtually refused to answer questions during his  visit about Back to Basics and his domestic problems, including  the resignation as a parliamentary private secretary of Tory MP  Hartley Booth over his "kiss and cuddle" relationship with Emily  Barr, his 22-year-old former assistant. He makes it a policy,  other than in exceptional circumstances, to answer questions  when he is abroad only about immediate business in hand.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's reviews Dollars 8.7bn of BT long-term debt MOODY'S, the US-based credit rating agency, has placed the long-term debt of British Telecom, currently rated AAA, under review for possible downgrade. The move is in response to the announcement of its strategic alliance with MCI Communications. Around Dollars 8.7bn of long-term debt is affected. Moody's cited the increased business risk involved in taking a 20 per cent stake in MCI, which sets the stage for a struggle for domination of the world telecommunications market with AT&amp;T. However, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based rating agency, has confirmed the AAA rating of BT and its guaranteed units, British Telecom Finance BV and British Telecom Finance Inc. The rating affirmation reflects S&amp;P's expectation that the proceeds from BT's Dollars 1.8bn sale of its 20 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, expected to be realised in September, and excess cashflow 'will be used quickly to repay additional debt taken on for this investment'. The rating agency said: 'Over the longer term, the investment (in MCI) could further strengthen BT's position in the global telecommunications market, offsetting competitive pressures . . . . in its domestic market.' Moody's has lowered its ratings of two Japanese regional banks due to the deterioration in asset quality and the poor outlook for profitability. Such concerns have prompted frequent downgradings of Japanese banks since the boom years in the country's property market and economy waned at the start of this decade. Until recently, the country's regional banks have been thought to have had relatively low exposure to bad loans compared with the larger commercial banks. The long-term debt of Bank of Yokohama, which owns Guinness Mahon Holdings, the UK merchant bank, was lowered to A3 from A1. Moody's said Yokohama's lending to domestic and overseas property markets remained significant in relation to its capital. Restructuring costs of Guiness Mahon are also expected to affect Yokohama's asset quality. The long-term debt rating of Ashikaga Bank was lowered to A3 from A1 as Moody's expects unrealised losses in Ashikaga's underperforming assets and restructuring costs of its non-bank affiliates to drain the bank's financial resources. Two of Japan's shinkin banks - or credit associations - announced a merger yesterday, reflecting an increasingly severe environment for the country's small regional financial institutions. Maebashi Shinkin Bank and Kyujo Shinkin Bank, both based in Gunma district, north of Tokyo, said they would complete the one-for-one merger next February. More shinkin banks are expected to follow suit, as the institutions, similar to credit unions and traditionally reliant on small companies for business, are under increasing pressure as financial authorities deregulate the country's financial markets. Moody's is reviewing the Baa1 senior unsecured rating of Bridgestone, the Japanese tyre maker, and the Baa2 senior unsecured rating of its subsidiary, Bridgestone Finance Europe, for a possible upgrade, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Moody's said the action reflected the completion of Bridgestone's restructuring plans in the US and Europe. The rating review would focus on the resulting impact on the tyre maker's competitiveness in these two markets and its financial performance, the agency said. It said the review would consider Bridgestone's ability to improve its overall margins and to generate sufficient cashflow to reduce debt under the weak global auto sales outlook.</p>

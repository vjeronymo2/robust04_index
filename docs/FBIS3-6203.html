			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- Clear differences of  opinion on pending issues cropped up at Friday's meeting between  the leaders of the ruling and main opposition parties,  foreshadowing a tense political situation in the days ahead.    Although President Kim Yong-sam and Yi Ki-taek, chairman of  the Democratic Party [DP], agreed on the need for political  reform, they were sharply divided on such issues as the DP's  calls for abolition of the National Security Law and  renegotiation of the Uruguay Round trade accord.    Kim Yong-sam, also president of the ruling Democratic  Liberal  Party (DLP), rejected in no uncertain terms the opposition  demands at a two-hour meeting at Chongwadae [presidential  offices] Friday morning.    The talks' outcome brought a critical, if not angry,  reaction  from the ranks of the Democratic Party.    As a result, friction between the ruling and opposition  parties is expected to rise as the DP plans to work against  ratification of the Uruguay Round accord at the National  Assembly, continue to press the DLP and the government to  abolish the National Security Law, and highlight the sensitive  issue of rising prices.    DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won said Saturday that President Kim  raised many issues such as his views on North Korea, his  determination to realize clean politics and measures for the  Uruguay Round agreement.    "But there is such a wide gap between his views and those of  the Democratic Party, we could not help being disappointed by  them (Kim's views)," Pak said.    "We detected the will to reform in the president's remarks  but we could not also help worrying that (he) is heading toward  a civilian dictatorship under the pretext of political reform,"  Pak said.    Pak said the opposition party was particularly upset by an  "unscruplous and intentionally arrogant" statement issued by  Chongwadae on the Kim-Yi meeting.    "How could they wish to conduct politics with the kind of  attitude that demeans the (leader) of the other side," he said.    "We do not wish to worsen relations between the ruling and  opposition parties over such a matter and the Democratic Party  has no plans to resort to action (against the DLP and the  government)," Pak said.    "But it (Friday's meeting) could become a reference point  when we are formulating policies," he said, hinting that  depending on how the issues are addressed, the opposition party  will mount a strong offensive.    One senior DP official said the party plans to push strongly  for renegotiation of the Uruguay Round agreement and revision of  the National Security Law.    The government and the ruling party are also taking a lax  attitude toward the problems of rising consumer prices and  welfare of ordinary citizens, he said.    In contrast to the opposition reaction, the ruling party  gave  high marks to the two leaders' agreement to work together to  implement the newly adopted political reform legislation.    DLP Secretary-General Mun Chung-su said, "it was an epochal  event in the 50-year constitutional history that the president  and the representative of the opposition party have agreed to  realize political reform and a revolution in elections."    Commenting on opposition complaints that Yi failed to get "a  present (concession)" from the president, Mun said the past  practice of an opposition party leader receiving such a gift is  an anachronism.    "It (such thinking) has to change," Mun said.    Mun said, however, that the issues Yi Ki-taek raised at  Friday's meeting can be taken up at various meetings or  working-level negotiations.    Mun thus indicated that the ruling party plans to actively  negotiate with the opposition party on those issues in order to  avoid a tense situation.    DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong also said Friday's meeting was  held  not to give or take anything. "It was called to discuss how to  carry out the political reform laws which are unprecedented in  the political history of this country," ha said.    "If the ruling and opposition parties had a confrontational  relationship in the past, it is now time for them to forge a  partnership," he said.</p>

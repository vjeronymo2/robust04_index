			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar Pounds 0.4m back in black FIFE INDMAR, the Edinburgh-based engineer, yesterday reported a swing from losses of Pounds 236,000 to profits of Pounds 424,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30. The interim dividend is lifted by 0.25p to 0.75p from earnings of 2.7p (losses 1.53p). The shares responded with a 15p rise to 60p. Referring to the final dividend, which was passed last time, Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, said the company was expecting to pay a final but that this depended on the results for the second six months. He said the positive profit swing of Pounds 660,000 was achieved on turnover down 10 per cent at Pounds 15.1m. He added that prospects for the remainder of the year 'remained encouraging for all four divisions.' There was a continued good performance in the distribution division with profit 'considerably ahead of the previous year.' Sluggish demand, particularly from the Ministry of Defence, held back electro-mechanical products but the division returned to profit in the opening period. Engineering achieved break-even and losses in the catering equipment operations were substantially reduced.</p>

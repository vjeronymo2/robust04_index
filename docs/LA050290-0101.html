			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAXTER DENIES IT SOLD PLANT TO GET OFF ARAB BLACKLIST  </P> <P> Hospital supply giant Baxter International Inc. on Tuesday denied it sold a  plant in Israel to get off the Arab League's blacklist of companies doing  business with the Jewish state.  </P> <P> Baxter, the world's largest hospital supply company, has agreed to build a  similar plant in Syria.  </P> <P> Spokesman Les Jacobson said Baxter learned indirectly of its removal from the  list in January.  </P> <P> He denied Baxter officials sought to curry favor with the Arabs by selling the  plant in Israel, a move that would violate a U.S. law forbidding American  companies from participating in foreign boycotts.  </P> <P> Jewish leaders are demanding an explanation from Baxter, which is based in  Deerfield, Ill., north of Chicago.  </P> <P> The issue arose from a memorandum about Baxter's Middle East operations  purportedly on file in the Arab League's boycott office in the Syrian capital  Damascus. The memo suggests the 1988 sale of the Israeli plant and the  delisting were linked.  </P> <P> Jacobson questioned the authenticity of the memo, copies of which were sent to  Baxter directors and to the Wall Street Journal by Richard Fuisz, a  Washington-area businessman and former chief executive of Baxter's Middle  Eastern Medcom subsidiary.  </P> <P> Fuisz sued Baxter in 1985 on charges of wrongful termination and defamation  after he was ousted from his job and demoted, Jacobson said. The lawsuit was  settled.  </P> <P> Fuisz could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls to his home in Great  Falls, Va., went unanswered.  </P> <P> Jacobson said company officials probably discussed with Syrian government  officials their plans to sell the Israel plant, not as a condition of being  dropped from the blacklist but rather in the context of negotiations that  resulted in an agreement signed April 13 to jointly build a plant in Syria.  </P> <P> The plant is slated to open late next year. Like the Israel plant, which was  sold to the Israeli government, it will synthesize intravenous body fluids.  </P> <P> Neither the U.S. Commerce Department nor the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which are reviewing the company's Middle East activities, would  comment.  </P> <P> The memo says Baxter sought removal from the blacklist through its Swiss  subsidiary, Baxter AG. It also says another subsidiary, International Medical  Technologies, documented the sale of the Israel plant and promised not to do  any more business with Israel, Jacobson confirmed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: '80S DRUG SCENE TURNS 54 INTO AN UNLUCKY NUMBER  </P> <P> Studio 54, once Manhattan's trendiest nightspot among celebrities and  glitterati, was ordered closed for two years because of rampant drug use and  the sale of cocaine and other drugs inside the club. The club's cabaret license  was yanked and its owner, Shalom Weiss, barred from reopening the disco for at  least two years, according to New York Consumer Affairs Commissioner Angelo  Aponte. In its heyday in the 1970s, Studio 54 was second home to arbitrators of  hip such as Calvin Klein, Andy Warhol and Bianca Jagger. It fell out of the  limelight in recent years, however, as new clubs became more popular among  fickle New Yorkers. Consumer Affairs officials testified at administrative  hearings that overt sale and use of illegal substances, such as crack, cocaine  and marijuana, were commonplace inside the club and that club employees not  only allowed drug activity, but in some cases participated in it or alerted  patrons when police were coming.  </P> <P>  -- June Scobee, widow of Challenger space shuttle pilot Francis R. (Dick)  Scobee, is engaged to marry an Army general in June. Mrs. Scobee, 46, will  marry Lt. Gen. Don Rodgers, commander of the Global Army Information Systems  Command at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz. The two met last Easter at a sunrise service at  Arlington National Cemetery, where Mrs. Scobee had gone to visit the grave of  her husband, who died with the six other crew members in the Jan. 28, 1986,  shuttle explosion. Mrs. Scobee spearheaded efforts to create the Challenger  Center for Space Science Education, dedicated to continuing the mission of the  Challenger crew. Rodgers, 54, is a widower. Mrs. Scobee will be the first  Challenger widow or widower to remarry.  </P> <P>  -- In an expedition intended to melt the "ice curtain," the United States and  the Soviet Union have announced plans for a joint U.S.-Soviet dog sled and ski  trek from Siberia to Alaska across the Bering Strait. Six Americans and six  Soviets will depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on a two-month, 1,200-mile  journey visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route. They  will arrive at the Alaskan village of Kotzebue in late April. Sen. Frank H.  Murkowski (R-Alaska) said of the Bering Bridge Expedition: "We are opening up  the ice curtain that has divided us for so long. We're bringing together the  Alaskan and Soviet Eskimo." The last surface crossing was in 1948, the  expedition's sponsors said. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN  </P></p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Property: A special place to keep the world at bay - An Englishman's home is his castle - if he can find one at the right price - probably in Scotland ENGLAND has so few castles to live in that the benighted English have to make do with words: 'My home is my castle' - a mythical place where the world intrudes only by invitation, and the stout-hearted owner pulls up the drawbridge by switching on the burglar alarm. Or Englishmen build castellated follies as sentimental substitutes, and dream of kings and glory. Why are castles rare, when they are common in Scotland and Ireland, and in France? Defence and subjugation are the main purpose of these buildings. But the long era of domestic peace in England meant that there was hardly any need to build them after the Middle Ages, or to maintain the medieval castles. They are mostly ruins, while still-used medieval churches stay spick and span. Instead, the English started building grand country houses, which did not have fortifications, except by antiquarian whim, but did have the same economic power as the castles and monasteries. Across the Channel the French do not live in country houses or have a translation for the English term. They have chateaux. It is always a surprise travelling in France how many there are, and that most of them are basically military. But think of the invasions and evenements France has suffered - and remember the fate of the nobles in the French Revolution - and it makes sense to live in a castle or, in the 19th century, to follow tradition and build a house looking like one. In Scotland and Ireland the story is similar. Life was uncertain for centuries. Even when it improved, the tradition, and the memories of 1745 and the Young Pretender or the Irish uprising of 1798 - and the ensuing repressions by the English - were so alive that castles never disappeared. Many houses in Scotland began as fortified tower houses, with the main room on the first floor reached by a spiral staircase, and pepperpot turrets where the laird's sentry could shoot at the rival clan coming to attack, as happened often. In the 19th century Scottish castles became more spacious. The tower-core had wings added and an extra staircase or two, built in the Scottish Baronial style which had become a romantic way of showing that Scotland was separate from England. Mish-mash, enlarged castle houses are the result, pleasing for the romantic sense of danger they exude. The spiritual foundations for Scottish castles were tradition and Walter Scott's stories. With steep roofs and round turrets, these Scottish castles look like chateaux and reflect the anti-English Auld Alliance of Scotland and France. Gardyne Castle, in Angus, eastern Scotland, is a multi-period castle, for sale from Savills with a guide price of more than Pounds 390,000 (but needing a thorough redecoration). The Gardyne family built it as a tower in the 17th century, when they were battling the Guthrie clan. It has three fine pepperpots and a 'dungeon' connected to the drawing room by an access hidden in a cupboard. Later additions make it a sympathetic family fortress with plenty of room. The walled garden on a south-east facing slope running down to the burn is a golden opportunity for a serious gardener. It already has a laburnum walk. The Gulf Stream helps the gardens at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire on the west side of Scotland, also 16th century and acquired in the 17th century by the Boyd family, who rebuilt it in the 19th when their friend, Pre-Raphaelite artist William Bell Scott, painted murals up the staircase to illustrate The King's Quair, a poem written in 1420 by James I of Scotland when imprisoned in Windsor Castle. Scott included W A Swinburne as a courtier of Venus, and himself with Alice Boyd's pet duck. In this century Elton Eckstrand, an American devotee of the Pre-Raphaelites, bought it and restored it. He has instructed Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Edinburgh, to sell this chateau extraordinaire for more than Pounds 300,000. Kinnaird Castle is gloriously placed, overlooking the Firth of Tay between Perth and Dundee (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, offers over Pounds 500,000), with a king's room, prison, doo'cot (dovecot, still working) and a famous alpine garden. A lonely alternative, unscarred by 19th century Baronial additions, is Freswick on the Caithness coast in the north of Scotland, offered by Hamptons at more than Pounds 175,000 and needing work. It is another 16th century building, incorporating a mediaeval tower and a Viking hall. For the full 19th century romantic experience, consider Dunselma near Dunoon in Argyll, built in 1887 by the son of the Coats textile family, and on sale at more than Pounds 370,000 from Hamptons. In Edinburgh, Peffermill is a 1636 tower house, on sale for only the second time in its 356 years and sympathetically restored so that it keeps the simplicity - some would say austerity - that a castle should have. Warriors do not need fitted carpets. Offers over Pounds 390,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Sundrum Castle, in Ayrshire, dates back to the 14th century, with many alterations. Now Salopian Estates is converting it into separate houses. The owners will take a share in the estate company and pay for maintaining the gardens, woods, park and tennis court. Inquiries to West Highland Estates or Cluttons. In England, Clearwell Castle, in Gloucestershire, is an attractive-looking 18th century Gothic concoction with battlements, at present a country house hotel, which Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hereford offers at over Pounds 750,000. More remarkable is the castle that Sir John Vanbrugh, architect of Blenheim and Castle Howard, built for himself in Greenwich, south east London, at the top of Maze Hill. It has been divided into four houses, one of which is for sale from John D. Wood for around Pounds 400,000 - worth it for the view across Greenwich Palace to the City of London, let alone the pleasure of living in Vanbrugh's own house (listed Grade I). For the same price Humberts is selling the castellated Castle Lodge, at the foot of the castle mound, at Lewes, Sussex. The castle is now a ruin open to the public, and not available. A complete Victorian fort can be bought for Pounds 1m. Fort Corblets, on Alderney, in the Channel Islands, was built to keep the French in check, and converted in the 1970s into a family house. It brings the tax haven advantages of the Channel Islands and overlooks a sandy beach. Agents are Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Swoffers in Guernsey. If you need a castle in Ireland, Jackson Stops McCabe usually has one or two on its books.

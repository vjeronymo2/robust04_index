			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / FT Guide to the Future of Lloyd's Lloyd's seems to be heading for radical change? How radical is it really? By the 21st century, Lloyd's might in theory find itself transformed. Names  -the individuals whose assets have historically been invested on the basis of unlimited liability - may have switched to limited liability. Their investments may even be subsumed in a few large companies, many listed on stock exchanges, which might dominate the 300-year-old London insurance market. However, all this could prove to be a fantasy. In practice, changes are only being made gradually. This is partly because the volume of corporate capital in the market is growing slowly, accounting for only about 15 per cent of funds at Lloyd's this year. Traditional Names remain the dominant voice and are anxious to protect their interests. But the slow pace of change is also because Lloyd's has yet to shake off past problems. Losses between 1989 and 1991 totalled Pounds 7bn. Many possible asbestosis and pollution liabilities outstanding on old policies, some dating to the 1940s, have yet to be quantified. Lloyd's must settle its debts as well as try and make plans for the future. For these reasons, David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, and Peter Middleton, chief executive, have not attempted wholesale reform of Lloyd's. Their first aim has been to restore profitability, and that has left many anomalies untackled. For instance, the market still trades via syndicates which are reformed each year. Normal insurance companies, which smooth losses and profits over several years, regard such practices as bizarre and outdated. Is change the result of Lloyd's troubles? Yes. If the market had been making profits in the past few years - or even modest losses - the impetus for reform would not have been as strong. Lossmaking Names appear to be making progress in winning compensation in court for past losses. Won't that stymie Lloyd's reforms? Not directly. The disputes are between Names and the professional agencies which handled their money, rather than Lloyd's central organisation. Compensation will be paid out of the assets or insurance policies of those agencies, some of which are in liquidation. Inevitably, however, some of the bad feeling between Names and agents has wider repercussions, and will deter future investors. Lloyd's also faces a struggle in recouping money that should have come from Names but which it has paid out of its central fund, which protects policy-holders. Why should anyone want to invest again on the basis of 'unlimited liability'? Unlimited liability may seem a legal nonsense - after all, nobody has unlimited assets. But the fact that in the past Names have been prepared to risk all their assets meant that a higher level of gearing was possible. Some of the wealthiest Names, for instance, are allowed by Lloyd's rules to underwrite policies worth five times their investment. That increases the risks, but also the returns. Corporate capital generally cannot arrange such high gearing. Moreover, many Names who are able to continue trading might be advised to remain in the market. Lloyd's is expected to record profits in the 1993 and probably 1994 underwriting years. Under Lloyd's accounting rules, those profits should begin to flow into Names' bank accounts over the next few years. Who would want to invest via one of the new Lloyd's companies? Lloyd's image has not been helped by its past losses and the continuing publicity surrounding the Names' court battles. The market's structure is also byzantine, making it cumbersome and difficult for investors to understand. But Lloyd's is currently making money and has considerable underwriting expertise. That makes it attractive for some investors. The future success of corporate capital will depend on the ingenuity of corporate financiers in setting up vehicles which offer the prospect of decent returns - as well as whether Rowland and Middleton succeed in streamlining Lloyd's organisation and ensuring long-term profitability. Will the cost of insurance premiums be affected by reform at Lloyd's? Almost certainly not. In fact, the chain of causation might be the other way around. Lloyd's fortunes may well be determined by its ability to ride out the next downturn in a cyclical world insurance market. The danger is of premium rates softening in the good times, leaving the market prone to losses in future. That would not only speed the exit of the traditional Name but deter many corporate investors.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Observer: Economically speaking It may have lost a good number of general elections recently but no one can say the British left lacks tenacity. Today sees the launch of yet another attempt to get its economic message across. New Economy, a 62-page quarterly described as half journal, half magazine, sets out to reconquer the field of easily understandable economic writing ceded during the 1980s to such right-of-centre publications as Economic Affairs. Produced by a left-wing think-tank - the Institute for Public Policy Research - New Economy strikes a suitably populist note, banning the algebra and footnotes that sometimes pepper learned economic journals. The aim is 'to be lively and have meat', says editor Dan Corry, a former Treasury official and adviser to the Labour party front bench. He believes New Economy will appeal to non-economic specialists and A-level students. But it does not neglect academics. Thanks to Simon Wren-Lewis, professor of macroeconomic modelling at Strathclyde University, it will make a regular feature of a new slimline economic model with the unsexy name of Compact, which will offer a guide to UK economic policy. There is little doubt that the launch issue's 5,000 print-run will be eagerly snapped up; the publisher, Academic Press, is giving it away. But the big test will come - as ever - when punters have to vote with their cheque books. In early 1994, New Economy will go on sale by subscription at rates of up to Pounds 95 a year.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Union launches court challenge Unison, the public-services union, is challenging South West Water in the High Court this week over its refusal to consult the union about plans for 120 redundancies. The hearing is seen by Unison as an important test case in establishing the rights of former public-sector employees to be represented by their unions when faced with redundancies. South West Water withdrew recognition of the union, which has 1,200 members in the company, last October.</p>

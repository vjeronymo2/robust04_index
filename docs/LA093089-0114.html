			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT TO CONSIDER REVIEW OF STORE MERGER  </P> <P> Will Friday the 13th prove to be American Stores' Lucky day?  </P> <P> On that day in October, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to consider whether  to review the antitrust case that has so far prevented the Salt Lake City-based  company from merging its Alpha Beta and Lucky supermarket units. A review would  further delay, and possibly scuttle, American Stores' effort to unite the  chains under the Lucky banner.  </P> <P> California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp challenged the integration 13 months  ago on the grounds that it would diminish competition and result in higher  grocery prices. Since then, the case has meandered through the California court  system. In late August, the Attorney General's Office posted a $10,000 bond so  that it could pursue the case with the high court.  </P> <P> Word of the Supreme Court's decision probably will be issued Oct. 16, sources  close to the case said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Tao </F> (2621 3447) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of  the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee, Secretariat member, and Central Party School  president, pointed out today at the opening ceremony for a new  session of the Central Party School: China's reform, opening  up, and modernization drive have entered a new phase of  development. The new situation, the new tasks, and the new  practice require the whole party to attach greater importance  than anytime in the past to ideological education and  theoretical studies; they require the leadership at all levels  to study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and to constantly improve  their understanding and leadership skills.    Attending the opening ceremony were students of the 16th  class for leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level,  the 22d class for cadres at the prefectural and department  levels, classes for ethnic cadres from Xinjiang, classes for  young and middle-aged cadres, classes for backbone theoretical  and propaganda cadres, and personnel from branch schools at  organs directly under the central committee and at state organs  as well as from military units, 2,600 in all.    After analyzing the current situation at home and abroad, Hu  Jintao pointed out: The majority of comrades taking course here  are leading cadres in their respective fronts. Regardless of  his position or the sector in which he is exercising leadership,  every one of them needs to approach problems from a strategic  high plane and from an overall point of view. The fact that  Comrade Deng Xiaoping is good at using the Marxist stand, point  of view, and method to approach to deal with problems from an  overall strategic perspective is dominantly demonstrated in his  works. Leading cadres at all levels must study and master them.  Realistic analysis and understanding of the situation is a  precondition and a basis for correct decision-making, for  putting the interests of the party's work first, and for  executing well the various tasks. Only by keeping closely in  mind the current situation at home and abroad; by learning how  to approach problems from an overall strategic perspective will  we be able to be farsighted, to get a clear understanding of the  situation, to have a good grasp of the overall situation, and to  implement well the party's basic policy for this year in an  all-round manner.    In his speech, Hu Jintao elaborated on the importance and  urgency for leading cadres to take the lead in studying theory.  He pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of  contemporary China, and it serves as the spiritual pillar and  scientific guide for our triumphant march forward. The party is  leading people of all nationalities in the great practice of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In our march  forward, there will inevitably be some complicated problems and  difficulties which we have never encountered before. Especially  in the process of accelerating the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure, complex, deep-rooted problems will  become even more pronounced with each passing day. Only by  studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics will we be able to unify our understanding; have  a good grasp of the relationship between reform, development,  and stability; properly handle all sorts of contradictions in  society; approach problems from an overall point of view; make a  correct assessment of the situation; constantly improve our work  in terms of adherence to principles, systematic approach,  farsightedness, and creativity to ensure the smooth progress of  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive.    Hu Jintao stressed: While studying the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must study theory and  basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. We should,  first of all, study -- in a comprehensive and systematic manner  -- pertinent expositions contained in Deng Xiaoping's works and  grasp its essence. Anyone interested in the theory of socialist  market economy must read the report to the 14th CPC National  Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee. We must study the principles,  policies, and measures of reform formulated by the Central  Committee for the establishment of a socialist market economy.  We must also study basic knowledge of the socialist market  economy so as to raise our capabilities in work on the socialist  market economic sector.    Wang Jialiu, Central Party School vice executive president,  also spoke. Vice President Xing Bensi presided over the opening  ceremony. Also present at the opening ceremony were Hou  Zongbin, Wang Weicheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Xudong, Chen Fujin,  and Liu Shengyu.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Erik Derycke, state secretary for </F> development cooperation, by Jean-Pierre Stroobantson on 12  April; place not given: "On the Future of Cooperation With  Rwanda"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Stroobants] Does our  cooperation with Rwanda have any future?    [Derycke] During the parliamentary debate, it was only the  Flemish Bloc which shocked me, arguing for the abandoning of an  Africa which they see as on the road to ruin. If that is the  position of Belgian society, as the Flemish Bloc claims, then I  am almost ashamed to be Belgian. Europe has a tradition which  will not allow it to act in this way. I have also been  surprised by the extent to which certain deputies, and no doubt  public opinion, are ill-informed on the subject of Rwanda,  unaware that we have redirected 80 percent of our aid for this  country to basic activities, far removed from political  intrigues.    [Stroobants] Specifically?    [Derycke] In the field of education, health care, and  agriculture we have given the minimum necessary for these people  who, without us, would have nothing. In the future, we will  have to discuss cooperation within the government, with the  Parliament, and with the people. Like everyone else, I too am  pained by the death of our paratroopers and civilians. They  were all in Rwanda to help with the country's democratization.  But we must not forget that the drama experienced by the vast  majority of Rwandans is, at the very least, as awful as our own.    [Stroobants] Could democracy really be envisaged in Rwanda?    [Derycke] We created an elite which was ready for democracy,  in accordance with the policy defined by the European Union.  Africa is not entirely a disaster, even if seven or eight  countries are still lagging behind on the question of freedoms.  The other donor countries must understand this, together with  the IMF and the World Bank. The socio-economic problems, the  poverty, are also factors which partly explain what is happening.    [Stroobants] Belgian cooperation will continue?    [Derycke] We are already providing humanitarian aid, as of  today. For the rest, it is clear that we must now consider the  situation and it is not going to start up again overnight. But  I cannot stand those who say "It's all over, let them get on  with it." Africa can be our principal partner. Improving the  life of the people of Africa can also bring benefits for us. I  myself am proud that Belgium is maintaining a policy of  cooperation. In 80 percent of the countries we aid, the policy  is a genuine success. [passage omitted]</p>

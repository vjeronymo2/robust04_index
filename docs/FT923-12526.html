			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Ukraine opposition seeks referendum on new poll UKRAINE's leading opposition politicians yesterday called for a referendum to bring about new parliamentary elections and remove the communist-dominated government. Mr Vycheslav Chornovil, leader of Rukh, the democratic nationalist movement which led the struggle for Ukrainian independence, attacked the government of Mr Vitold Fokin. The recent appointment of Mr Valentin Simonenko as the government's economics supremo was a victory for 'the old communist mafia,' he said. For early elections to take place the law requires the collection of at least 3m votes in a referendum. Setting the referendum machinery in motion would put pressure on the government and force the opposition to become more effective even if it failed to win the required 3m votes, Mr Chornovil added. Mr Simonenko, a former construction manager, Communist party first secretary and mayor of Odessa, Ukraine's biggest port on the Black Sea, was appointed to replace Mr Vladimir Lanovoi, a young economist who has worked closely with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other foreign advisers. The change, made by President Leonid Kravchuk only hours after parliament adjourned for the summer holidays last week, has called into question the government's commitment to rapid privatisation and other market-oriented economic reforms. It reinforces the ranks of former communists surrounding Mr Kravchuk, himself a former party ideology secretary. Mr Simonenko said he would unify financial, economic and monetary policy under his control. 'I am completely against the idea of aid from the west but fully support mutually beneficial foreign investment and co-operation,' he said. Critics say the government, headed by Mr Vitold Fokin, another veteran communist, has hardly changed the old communist bureaucratic structures, but merely wrapped them in the Ukrainian national flag. However, an expected vote of no confidence has been postponed until parliament reassembles in the autumn.</p>

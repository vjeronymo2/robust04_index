			<p>BFN     [Text] A diplomatic source in Seoul said on 20 June that  the ROK Government would propose to the United States that  before the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks  takes place, dialogue between North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] resume and that negotiations for  special inspections of the two unreported nuclear facilities  start.    He also said that he knew that the United States informed  the  ROK that it plans to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korea  high-level talks at an early date if, at a U.S.-North Korea  working-level contact in New York, North Korea makes assurances  for ensuring the continuity of IAEA nuclear safeguards,  including a ban on refueling the five-megawatt nuclear reactor  in Yongbyon, a ban on reprocessing the discharged spent nuclear  fuel, and permission for the IAEA inspectors now staying in  North Korea to continue their work.    On the morning of 20 June, the Unification and Security  Policy Coordination Council reportedly held extensive discussion  on this issue. Also, the meeting reportedly pointed out that it  is necessary to hold North-South summit talks to hold in check  the "unilateral holding of U.S.-North Korea dialogue."</p>

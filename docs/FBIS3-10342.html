			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos, of the </F> Zapatist National Liberation Army, by Julio Moguel and Hermann  Bellinghausen in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State; date  not given]    [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- "Our expectation is  that war will be avoided because of the pressure civil society  from all over the country will exert to force compliance with  the agreements. I do not think it depends on results of the San  Cristobal policy. A problem will arise if civil society wears  down, wearies, or becomes discouraged. In that case, everything  would come undone, and then they would come down on us with  military means. What I am trying to explain is we are no  longer the problem, the country is. Our time is over, even if  the flashes and photos continue."    Subcommander Marcos held a uninhibited and informal  conversation following the last interviews he granted in San  Cristobal de las Casas. Visibly tired but with the lively talk  that distinguishes him, he reviewed the military experience of  the Zapatist uprising, talked of his first impressions following  the dialogue, and reflected on the consultation period the EZLN  [Zapatist National Liberation Army] must now hold in its  villages.    This is the end of an unexpected and surprising phase they  had not counted on. The insurgent subcommander assessed the  negotiation's deficiencies for the EZLN as well as the  government negotiators. He seemed skeptical about the  commitments and sketched events for the immediate future. Peace  or war? Increased repression and authoritarianism or effective  transition toward democracy? The man of a thousand words bade  farewell to the forum, but before returning to the mountain got  comfortable in a chair to hold one more talk on the way out.    [LA JORNADA] Do you feel more confident now that you are  returning to the jungle?    [Marcos] We were in our element there. When we enter the  city, that is when we begin to make mistakes. But as long as we  are in the mountains and villages, it is very unlikely someone  will pick a fight with us, even the regular forces of the  federal Army.    [LA JORNADA] Are you inviting newsmen to go with you to the  jungle? What does the invitation consist of? Does this mean  your camps will no longer be hidden?    [Marcos] The idea is not to take you to where the situation  is delicate. Today, the consultations will be held in the  civilian sector. We can arrange for some visits, which will  entail some risk, and these visits, like the previous ones, will  be made with great security precautions, blindfolding the  reporters who decide to go. Everyone knows now which zones are  Zapatist zones.    [LA JORNADA] Are you planning to continue the war or do you  think the negotiations were conducted well?    [Marcos] We thought war would follow. On 12 January, we  prevented the Army from entering and razing the villages by  drawing them into the jungle or mountains. That is what was  prevented. We were ready for that kind of combat. We had  prepared for it for 10 years, not the attacks on San Cristobal  or the capital cities of the municipalities. During the previous  nine years we prepared defensively, just defensively. Our  plans did not and do not call for defining everything through  armed means. What we thought and planned for was that it was  more costly to annihilate us in political terms that to tell us  they would meet all our demands. Only now are they telling us  what they will give us. This may be a strong investment meant  more to deprive the EZLN of its social support and justification  for the war than to solve the problem. The government will have  to fight its past to convince the villages it will now keep its  commitments. Why are people going to believe their promises now?    Our expectation is that war will be avoided because of the  pressure civil society from all over the country will exert to  force compliance with the agreements. I do not think it depends  on results from the San Cristobal policy. A problem will arise  if civil society wears down, wearies, or becomes discouraged.  In that case, everything would come undone, and then they would  come down on us with military means. What I am trying to  explain is we are no longer the problem, the country is. Our  time is over, even if the flashes and photos continue.    [LA JORNADA] But you were counting on a war, a long war.  Did you think there would be strong military clashes? Didn't  you count on that?    [Marcos] We did count on strong military clashes. We  thought the strongest military clash would take place in San  Cristobal. We thought military reaction would be immediate to  prevent further revolts. We knew they would not hesitate. That  is why we concentrated our strongest forces here with the idea  of holding back the Army. Our largest military concentration was  near Rancho Nuevo, on the road to Tuxtla.    We knew there would be strong clashes when we saw that  municipal capitals were not falling simultaneously. We occupied  San Cristobal and we realized that we were alone; we realized  that the other municipal capitals had not fallen. The attacks  on Altamirano and Ocosingo did not take place until 0700, and  the situation was not militarily resolved until 1600. In Las  Margaritas we began at 0300 and it fell in an hour. Here we  begin at 0100 and by 0200 we already had the city occupied. We,  therefore, decided to take our time in San Cristobal in order to  stop and bog down the Army. We wanted enough time for an  orderly retreat while we found out what was going on and carried  out actions of armed propaganda [accion de propaganda armada].  We later carried out the attack on Rancho Nuevo to recover  weapons and the park. That is where we failed unfortunately.  We lost men and we had to flee in disarray. That disorganized  an entire column, the one between San Cristobal and Rancho  Nuevo, and it also disorganized the one between Altamirano and  San Cristobal.    I repeat that we did not know very well what was going on.  The quick manner in which we went from the armed confrontation  to the table in San Cristobal took us by surprise. We had  already said that our delay in organizing ourselves to reach the  peace table was precisely because we did not expect it to be so  soon.    [LA JORNADA] If the way the events developed took you by  surprise and you had to improvise or discuss the change of  course along the way, are you now prepared to discuss the terms  for an agreement in the jungle in such a short period of time?    [Marcos] There is not and there will not be any  improvisation  in the discussion of the agreements because that is something we  know how to do. That is how we decided to wage the war. I am  going to tell you something. We first started to listen to some  voices who said they could not take it any longer. The groups  that announced they would go to war alone appeared later. The  General Command begin to detect this situation and analyze it  and they decide to consult. The analysis of the pros and cons  of initiating an uprising is then organized bearing in mind  circumstances such as NAFTA, the collapse of the socialist bloc,  and events in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. On the  other hand we took at look at the deaths and the poverty, the  increase in the infant mortality rate, the suspension of the  distribution of agricultural lands by the reforms to Article 27,  and the delegations that went to seek resources and only  returned with a bunch of papers.    The General Command explained it to the ethnic committees;  the ethnic committees explained it in turn to the regional  committees; the regional committees explained it to the local  committees -- which are located in each village -- and they in  turn explained it to the community. They discussed the pros and  cons until the community itself decided it was time to take a  vote. The number of yes and no votes were counted without  regard for age or sex. The reverse process then started: The  locals submitted their resolutions to the regional committees;  the regional committees submitted them to the zones; the zones  submitted them to the ethnic committees; and the ethnic  committees submitted them to the General Command. That was when  it appeared to us we were watching another television channel.  While we thought they would say no, just when we thought  everything at the international level was against us, just when  we thought the military action would be annulled as a result, it  turned out that the immense majority voted yes. Just a handful  of our fellow companeros said the time was not right.    [LA JORNADA] You said before that in order to reach  agreements at the table in San Cristobal something more than  willingness from the parties was needed. You stated that it  would only be possible to obtain the Zapatist demands with the  support -- or the contribution -- of civil society. Can you  explain this idea better?    [Marcos] The government will only fulfill its promises if it  is forced to do so, and this will be achieved through the force  of rifles or the pressure of society. Betting on that pressure  taking place is the appropriate path. The only possibility to  attain peace we see now is for other forces to commit themselves  to forcing the government to comply. The result of that bet is  this consultation process. It does not depend on what the  government does but what the rest of the country does.    We have received many letters recommending a process of  change. First we received some surprising letters from some  people who said everything looked pretty but they were going to  beat us up. Then came the letters saying that we should seek  the path of peace, the path of negotiation, so that we do not  let ourselves be killed. The third stage was when they told us  -- and they are still telling us -- that we should not surrender  our weapons, sell out, or yield to their demands. Solidarity  committees are being formed to support not only the Chiapas  people, but the EZLN. We receive support from many sectors,  particularly Indian groups. You must recall the letter sent to  us by the demonstrators in Guerrero State, but we have also  received letters from the Yaquis, Mayos, Tarahuamaras, the Mayas  of Yucatan and Campeche, from Colima, Puebla...    We did not place ourselves at the head of this movement,  rather, we placed ourselves at the back. Now any other movement  has more chances than we do, because they can say: They are the  radicals; I want the same that they have and if you do not  comply, I am going to go radical. Now the field for that is  opening up and we said: Go ahead, yes; go for it! But we do not  see ourselves as victims, because we are going to get something  for our dead -- not more deaths but benefits for Indians in  general and the state in particular. Now the danger is that the  movement may become satisfied with what it will get at the local  level and not aspire to contribute to a national movement.    [LA JORNADA] In the document that resulted from the  conversations between you and the peace commissioner in San  Cristobal, some of the demands made by the EZLN at the federal  level did not receive a satisfactory response, such as the  reforms to Article 27 or the constitutional quarter [cuarto  constitucional]. But from reading the document the first time,  it appears that you obtained some things that, although they  have not been formally accepted, may exert pressure to reform  significant portions of the Constitution or, if the comparison  is allowed, you got things too big for the current legal and  institutional framework.    [Marcos] There are answers that do not respond formally to  some of those national demands, but that opens the door for the  development of a national movement that could break or modify  the current constitutional framework. They did not answer, for  instance, the demand for the reform of Article 27, but the  concessions made make its reform possible with the support of  other sectors and movements with similar demands and using other  means. These groups may ultimately reform said article before  this six-year term expires or beginning with the new government.    According to what we have analyzed and the consultations we  have had with lawyers, San Cristobal begins to necessarily  establish the need for a national negotiating table, a national  dialogue, where forces other than us also take part.    In any case, if they are unable to meet our demands promptly  and clearly it is because they must maintain the principle of  authority, under the premise they have no reason to make  concessions. The neoliberal project can no longer be defended.    [LA JORNADA] Your group was very lucky because you were not  discovered. How was that possible?    [Marcos] The government initially thought we were not a  guerrilla group. It said we would have attacked if we were  guerrillas because no guerrilla group gets ready first, grows,  and only attacks much later. It later thought we were  Guatemalans, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]  support groups, or other things, such as a group attempting to  seize land. The information that they had at the time did not  correspond to that in Sedena's [National Defense Secretariat]  computer or at the Interior Secretariat, if the latter still  kept this information secret. [sentence as published]    Since 1985 we thought we were going to be discovered. We  maintained a defensive military program at the time because we  expected to be discovered. We had grown too much. Entire  communities knew about us, helped us carry the responsibility,  and fed us.    [LA JORNADA] What question would you like to hear? What has  nobody asked and you would like to hear?    [Marcos] I would ask: What are the Zapatists going to do if  one or the other alternative is chosen? What will they do if  people say no to peace and yes to war? What will they do if  people say yes to peace and no to war? What are they going to  do with their military units and their fighting experts in one  case or the other?    If the option were to be peace, we would not fight because  our army is made up of peasants. Entry to civilian life would  be almost natural. We, however, would not surrender our  weapons; we need to be able to defend ourselves if we are  threatened.    In any case, if peace wins we would have to remain as an  army  for a long time to make sure the agreements are kept. The  problem is: How will we relate to power during this period?  This is the power we confronted and, in one way or another, its  objective was to annihilate us, that is, to take away our social  base, invalidate our prestige, and annihilate us at the lowest  political cost.    [LA JORNADA] What will happen with the cattlemen if the  peace  proposal advances and the Zapatists' demands are met?    [Marcos] I believe they will have to be sacrificed. If the  government wants to reach an agreement, it will have to  sacrifice them. Maybe the cattlemen will decide to placate the  situation and sacrifice a few of their own, those in other  territories, so that others are not touched. This is what is  going to happen in Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas,  where the conflict took place.    The situation there is similar to the one in San Juan  Chamula. The San Juan Chamula political machine is promoted by  the state in exchange for votes. To secure votes they started  giving them more power and this has led to the situation we know  now. It has reached a point where the government cannot touch  the bosses now. Governors come and go at a very high social  cost and the government cannot touch them. Perhaps they are not  aware of the monster they have created. The case is similar to  the one of the cattlemen. They gave them weapons and training  in exchange for money and protected them when they committed  outrages.    The government knew this. Just as it discovered our training  camps in 1993, it knew about them at least since 1990. They  knew the cattlemen were armed and training. The government's  officers were the ones who gave them the training at the white  guard training camps, at the Castellanos ranches, and at the  Altamirano Municipal Auditorium.    Our military hypothesis is the following: A bullring called  Lancandona Jungle is established. The federal government and  the Army stay at the bullring's refuge section, civil society is  up on the tiers, we are the bullfighter, and the cattlemen are  the bull. The government says: Let them tear each other up and  I will pick up the remains. The Army, which is a human rights  transgressor, then becomes a pacifying army and implements  order. This is a likely situation which, in military terms,  depicts the blocking of the Ricardo Pozas caravan, the present  lynch mood, and the Army that did nothing.    The cattlemen are already out of control. We threatened  several times to break off the talks because of the events at  Altamirano and the government was unable to control them. The  cattlemen were attempting to break up the talks.    [LA JORNADA] What will happen in Altamirano? Will things  break off? What will happen if this confrontation scheme  spreads to other parts of the country?    [Marcos] It seems this will also an issue for the cattle  ranchers [ganaderas]. We will see what kind of support the  cattlemen have. If these guys have the cattle ranchers' support,  then it will all be worthless because they will go from being  murderers to martyrs of the small properties cause. If other  cattle ranchers start to make noise about this, they will create  opposition. It is the state's responsibility, however. The state  is also responsible for what happened on 1 January because they  were warned this would happen. There were demands for reform.  Now, they are being told this will happen, that doors should be  left open.    [LA JORNADA] If this was the government's response, what do  you think of Camacho's response or attitude?    [Marcos] Camacho discovered that the leadership of this  movement is actually Indian. It was a big surprise for them to  have to deal with the interlocutors and not the forces that were  supposedly behind it. That is when the world opened up to them,  when Camacho said there is a solution to this, even if they are  wearing ski caps, and foreign forces are not involved.    [LA JORNADA] One of your achievements at the San Cristobal  table is the creation of conditions for clean and democratic  elections in Chiapas. If this becomes a reality, would the EZLN  participate in any way, as a force with its own candidates in  the electoral process?    [Marcos] We will not do that. We lack the necessary  organizational structure. We would frown on any of our members  who did that. For example, all chiefs are banned from occupying  public office under the threat of expulsion. They must not own  property either. Moreover, the EZLN seeks to have its demands  met strictly through military means [militar reivindicativa].  We would also need experienced cadres in the open struggle, in  the struggle of the masses. We have the ability to organize  into communities to survive, to maintain ourselves, but not in  the public spotlight because we lack experience. This is where  they can confuse and mess us up.    [LA JORNADA] But the EZLN, with the sympathy you generated,  could the EZLN not influence the nomination of municipal  presidents? Is it not part of your goals, to influence the  appointment of democratic authorities?    [Marcos] That is undoubtedly one of our goals. That is  definitely close to the reality of the rural areas because all  the state's rural territory is ours. I, however, see this more  as supporting someone else's nomination or candidacy rather than  launching one of our own because otherwise we would loose  prestige, moral authority, and social base.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Observer: Going up Unlike most of Norman Lamont's inner team, one person to survive the Cabinet reshuffle with his reputation enhanced is William Hague, the chancellor's parliamentary bag carrier, who took over Sir Leon Brittan's parliamentary seat when the latter left for Brussels. Hague, 32, who was Lamont's parliamentary private secretary throughout his time at No 11, has taken his first tentative step up the ministerial ladder as parliamentary under-secretary of state at Social Security. He had been tipped for promotion before, but was obviously thought too valuable as Lamont's ambassador among the backbenchers to be moved until now. His new post means that he follows in the footsteps of both Major and Michael Portillo. Like them, he has survived glowing praise from Margaret Thatcher: his party conference speech back in 1977 urging the Tories to roll back the frontiers of the state, led her to hail him as 'possibly another young Pitt'. Indeed, young Hague is so keen to get down to work that Observer hears that he has had to interrupt his conquest of Britain's coast-to-coast walk this week. Shame on him.</p>

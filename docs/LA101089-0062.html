			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARD TIMES FOR STATUS PROPERTIES;  </P> <P> OVERSUPPLY OF COMMERCIAL SPACE MAKES SALES TOUGH  </P> <P> The Rockefellers want to sell the famed Rockefeller Center; Sears, Roebuck  &amp; Co. is having trouble selling its Sears Tower. Bloomingdale's, the  world-renowned retailer, is for sale, along with the real estate on which it  stands.  </P> <P> "The 'hidden values' in real estate have been unhidden, and they're not there,"  says Michael Metz, a market strategist for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The real estate market is suffering from oversupply, but experts say the  excesses vary widely between second-tier and "trophy" properties.  </P> <P> "We have a two-tiered market with a vengeance," said David Shulman, a Salomon  Bros. director in real estate research.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Office Building Glut  </P> <P> Concerned about oversupply, Shulman is cautious about the real estate market.  "There has been a decline in construction, but not anywhere near enough to  correct the oversupply," he said.  </P> <P> While construction will drop further, demand for office space continues to  fall, he said. Retail space is less in demand because consumers are spending  less vigorously than they did in the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> In the avalanche of takeovers and leveraged buyouts in the retail business,  conventional wisdom held that even if the sales operations were not worth the  price tag, the stores could always be shuttered and the real estate used for  more lucrative operations.  </P> <P> But with a glut of office buildings available in the most prestigious areas of  big cities, these "hidden" values are now looked at more skeptically.  </P> <P> Pension funds and international investors still want real estate. But experts  say only quality properties need apply. Even for prestige properties, the going  can get bumpy. Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., the huge Canadian property  developer, dropped out of talks in Chicago on buying the world's tallest  building, the Sears Tower, in a deal worth about $1 billion.  </P> <P> High vacancy rates among office buildings nationwide has made sales of the  buildings soft as well, since empty buildings are not attractive investments.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has 12% of its office buildings vacant while Miami faces a 21%  vacancy rate, according to a midyear report by New America Network, a real  estate group.  </P> <P> What everyone expects to be hit the hardest are the non-trophy, second-tier  properties. As rents stabilize, such properties lose their cache of low cost.  In addition, this class has a huge overhang because of the billions of dollars  in problem real estate assets that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will  sell under the savings and loan bailout law.  </P> <P> The supply provided by a minimum of $30 billion of these assets going on the  market will likely depress real estate values, affecting previously unscathed  real estate markets, analysts at Salomon Bros. concluded recently.  </P></p>

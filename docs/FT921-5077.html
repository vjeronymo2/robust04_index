			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Capitol files suit against Blockbuster A LEGAL rumpus broke out yesterday between Blockbuster Entertainment, the Florida-based video rental chain which recently acquired the Cityvision group in the UK, and one of its US franchisees, Capitol Entertainment. Capitol, which is largely owned by the Zale jewellery store family, filed a civil complaint in the Dallas courts, alleging Blockbuster deceived it when it purchased the Erol's Video Store chain last year. It is claiming Dollars 40m in actual damages and Dollars 100m in punitive damages. Blockbuster dismissed the suit as 'without merit,' although its shares eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 1/8 on the news. At the time of its purchase by Blockbuster, Erol had around 200 outlets. Some of these were based in the Capitol franchise areas of Northern Virginia and Maryland. Capitol, the seventh largest Blockbuster franchisee, alleges the larger group promised not to acquire Erol until it had deals to sell Capitol the Erol stores in its territories. It contends Blockbuster went ahead with the Erol purchase regardless of this and then offered to sell the relevant stores 'on only the most onerous and difficult terms'. Blockbuster then went to operate these stores, claims the suit, devoting a disproportionate share of advertising funds to Erol. Blockbuster said yesterday it currently operated around 100 of the former Erol stores, although it added some were sold on to franchisees other than Capitol. Blockbuster added that it believed the operation of the former Erol stores was within its rights under the agreement with Capitol, and the suits would be vigorously defended.</p>

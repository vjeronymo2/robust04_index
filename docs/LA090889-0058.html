			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDANT CONTENDS NARCOTICS DEPUTIES GRABBED THOUSANDS  </P> <P> A Mexican national who pleaded guilty to laundering drug money has claimed that  tens of thousands of dollars seized when he was arrested by three sheriff's  narcotics agents was never turned over as evidence, a federal source said  Thursday.  </P> <P> The three deputies -- James R. Bauder, Eufrasio G. Cortez and Terrell H. Amers  -- and six other members of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department narcotics  team were suspended last Friday pending completion of local and federal  inquiries into the alleged skimming of seized drug money.  </P> <P> "There is money missing from this case, the exact amount I can't tell you,"  said defense attorney Victor Sherman, who said he will file a motion to  withdraw client Carlos Luis Soto's guilty plea next week.  </P> <P> Soto, 20, was arrested last November when the three deputies seized large  amounts of cash from his pickup truck after it left a Pomona warehouse where  nearly 700 pounds of cocaine was found. A variety of drug charges against two  co-defendants were withdrawn by federal prosecutors Tuesday because the cases  relied on the testimony of suspended deputies.  </P> <P> Soto told Sherman that the $135,000 the deputies turned over as evidence was  far short of the amount Soto was carrying. The shortage is tens of thousands of  dollars, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> "This happens all the time in these (drug) cases," Sherman said. "You mention  it to the prosecutors and they just shrug. They're not interested."  </P> <P> Sherman would not say whether he filed a complaint in the Soto case. But a law  enforcement source said that Sherman complained several times to the U.S.  attorney's office in Los Angeles, which prosecuted Soto. The source did not  know what action, if any, was taken on the allegation.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Gary A. Feess declined comment on any case involving the suspended  deputies, spokeswoman Grace Denton said.  </P> <P> Richard Shinee, attorney for the union representing some of the named deputies,  said he would have no immediate comment on the Soto case, or any other  allegations against the suspended deputies. Deputy Bauder has denied any  misconduct, but the other deputies have declined comment or could not be  reached by The Times.  </P> <P> Law enforcement sources said they were not certain whether Soto's complaints  last fall had any impact on a sheriff's inquiry into the nine-member narcotics  team. But his allegations followed closely an internal audit last October that  Sheriff Sherman Block has said revealed drug money was missing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allegations Spurred Probes  </P> <P> Sources have said the Sheriff's Department inquiry and subsequent  investigations by the FBI and IRS were prompted, in part, by cases such as  Soto's.  </P> <P> One federal source, quoting FBI narcotics investigators, said the  money-skimming case was triggered by an anonymous letter that said there were  "dirty cops" in the Sheriff's Department, and the letter was traced to a  sheriff's copying machine.  </P> <P> The investigation was expanded, the source said, after dealers in two different  drug cases alleged that more money had been seized from them than was turned in  as evidence.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials and federal investigators who have taken over the probe  declined to comment on the matter.  </P> <P> Eight deputies and a sergeant, all with the department at least nine years,  were relieved of duty in what Block says is probably the biggest scandal during  his seven-year tenure as head of the nation's largest sheriff's department.  </P> <P> In addition to Amers, Bauder and Cortez, the suspended officers include Sgt.  Robert Sobel, Nancy A. Brown, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel M.  Garner and Michael J. Kaliterna.  </P> <P> A federal law enforcement source said the amount allegedly stolen by deputies  during the past year could exceed $200,000. There was no indication that  narcotics were also stolen, according to the department.  </P> <P> While Los Angeles County's top drug prosecutor has said repeatedly that there  is no indication that the scandal will jeopardize any cases, defense attorneys  contended Thursday that some cases will be affected by the suspensions.  </P> <P> Ronald S. Miller, an attorney in an ongoing San Fernando Valley drug case, said  that his client claims $150,000 in cash and about 200 gold coins are missing  after being seized in an April raid by six of the suspended deputies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contends $250,000 Taken  </P> <P> Miller said that 26-year-old Mitchell Podwal, who faces cocaine trafficking  charges, claims that about $250,000 in cash and some 1,000 gold coins were in  his Northridge home when it was raided. The investigative team, headed by  Bauder, reported seizing about $100,000 in cash and 730 gold coins of $5, $10  and $20 denominations. Also part of the raid were deputies Amers, Sobel,  Cortez, Daub and Kaliterna, he said.  </P> <P> Miller said he has filed no complaint with the district attorney's office,  because "nobody wants to listen to these claims" by accused drug dealers. They  are not taken seriously, he said.  </P> <P> The district attorney has filed suit in an attempt to keep the cash, claiming  the money came from drug sales. Podwal maintains the money came from his work  as a manager for rock bands and that the coins were gifts from relatives or  belong to friends, Miller said.  </P> <P> Allegations in the Soto and Podwal cases are similar those lodged in 1987, when  a defendant in a cocaine trafficking case contended that $140,000 was missing  after a drug raid in Glendale.  </P> <P> Cortez and Garner were among six officers who searched two residences on Sept.  5, 1986, as part of an investigation into a suspected Colombian cocaine  trafficking operation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amounts Differ  </P> <P> The deputies reported finding 264 pounds of cocaine plus $120,005 in cash and  more than $212,000 in negotiable checks. However, one of the defendants --  Jaime Ramos -- testified in Superior Court in February, 1987, that there was  actually $260,000 in drug money along with the checks at the two residences.  </P> <P> Ramos' attorney in the case, Mitchell W. Egers, said he reported the  discrepancy at the time to the district attorney's special investigations  division but never heard anything more about it.  </P> <P> Sandi Gibbons, a district attorney's spokeswoman, said Thursday that she could  find no record of any such complaint filed with her office.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow eventually ruled that the confiscated cocaine,  cash and checks could not be used as evidence on grounds that they were  obtained with an illegal search warrant.  </P> <P> Prosecutors appealed the ruling, but Ramos and the two other defendants pleaded  guilty and were sentenced to state prison.  </P></p>

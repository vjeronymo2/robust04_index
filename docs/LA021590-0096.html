			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTNERSHIP'S GOAL IS COLLEGE FOR EVERYONE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: BRENTWOOD, PALISADES SCHOOLS JOIN UCLA IN AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM TO  MAKE ALL STUDENTS UNIVERSITY-READY.  </P> <P> With the goal of sending every student to college, parents and public schools  in Brentwood and Pacific Palisades have formed an educational partnership with  UCLA.  </P> <P> Under the open-ended agreement, UCLA will try to fulfill a wish list school  officials and parents are drafting. Some of the items the group would like to  see included are high-tech instructional methods, role modeling, and advice on  teacher training and student affairs.  </P> <P> "We want to prepare kids to be college-ready," said Pam Bruns, co-chairwoman of  the Palisades Complex, a group of parents who approached UCLA with the idea.  </P> <P> The pilot partnership includes nine schools of the Los Angeles Unified School  District: Palisades High School, Temescal Canyon (Continuation) High School,  and the six neighborhood elementary schools and one junior high that feed into  them.  </P> <P> A committee of representatives from the Palisades Complex, UCLA and the schools  will first tackle the needs of the high schools, said Gayle Byock, director of  post-secondary programs at UCLA and a Palisades parent who helped set up the  relationship.  </P> <P> Palisades High School has its eye on a UCLA computer program that helps  students improve their writing, Principal Gerald Dodd said.  </P> <P> "We're hopeful we could initiate it with our own hardware and their software,"  he said.  </P> <P> Dodd said he is also interested in having the university open its libraries and  language laboratory to his students.  </P> <P> Byock said she hopes contact between students will develop. "Some kids might  benefit from tutoring or role modeling (by) college students -- especially  (kids) who are not thinking of college, or not (thinking of it) as their first  option," she said.  </P> <P> As yet there is no budget for the arrangement, Byock said. Instead, UCLA hopes  to encourage staff and students to donate time and expertise.  </P> <P> That, university officials said, should not be a problem. Professors who have  reared children, like other parents, are "prepared to be involved in the  schools on a limited basis. We're not asking the faculty to go in (to the  schools) every day," Byock said.  </P> <P> And because public service is one consideration for promotion in the University  of California system, many professors already volunteer at community colleges  or other outside organizations, said Edward A. Alpers, dean of honors and  undergraduate programs for the College of Letters and Science.  </P> <P> UCLA has tutors and student teachers working in the public schools, offers  seminars for teachers and has other ad-hoc ties with various schools. The  Palisades partnership, though, is more formal and structured, participants say.  </P> <P> When the Palisades Complex proposed the plan to UCLA last fall, the university  was attracted by the strong parental support and the chance to work with  students from kindergarten through high school, Byock said. "Children have to  start thinking of college in elementary grades. Junior high and high school is  too late," she said.  </P> <P> The partnership is not just helping wealthy parents get their kids into the Ivy  League, Alpers said. About 60% of the students in the Palisades schools do not  live on the Westside but are bused in from crowded areas of the city, he said;  many are minorities and are not from rich homes.  </P> <P> Palisades parents are concerned about "all the students" and think that UCLA's  experiences with its ethnically, racially and economically mixed student body  may be useful experiences to Palisades schools, he said. UCLA has changed  curricula, hired faculty and launched programs to help students get into  graduate school in response to its changing student population.  </P> <P> "It's not intended to serve just some of the students in the schools," Alpers  said of the partnership.  </P> <P> The partnership will be reviewed in November, Byock said. If it is working,  UCLA may forge similar arrangements with other groups of schools, Alpers said.  </P></p>

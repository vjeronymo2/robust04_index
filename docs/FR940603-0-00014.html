			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Submission of Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated September 14, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;567), Kansas submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Kansas submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying, in part, required program amendments at 30 CFR 916.16 (a), (b) and (c) that were placed on the Kansas program on October 7, 1988 (53 FR 39467, 39470), September 13, 1991 (56 FR 46548), and June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32847, 32855). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM published a notice in the September 27, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment (58 FR 50302). The public comment period ended October 27, 1993. The public hearing scheduled for October 22, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns related to the Kansas Administrative Regulations (K.A.R.) 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(c)(7), regarding intervention, K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a (d)(10)(D) and (d)(5)(B)(vi) regarding public hearings, K.A.R. 47&hyph;5&hyph;5a (a) and (b) regarding civil penalties, K.A.R. 47&hyph;5&hyph;5a(b)(14) regarding the definition of ``violation, failure or refusal,'' and K.A.R. 47&hyph;15&hyph;1a(b)(21) regarding inspection and enforcement, substitution of terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM notified Kansas of these concerns by letter dated January 26, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;574). Kansas responded in a letter dated March 9, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;575), by submitting further revisions to Articles 4, 5, 6, 9, and 15 of the Kansas Administrative Regulations. On March 10, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;581), Kansas requested further information from OSM regarding its proposed amendment. Subsequently, Kansas again, in a letter dated March 10, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;576), revised its proposed amendment. OSM reopened the public comment period on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14811). The public comment period closed on April 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Director's Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds, with two exceptions, that the proposed amendment as submitted by Kansas on September 14, 1993, meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR chapter VII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Provisions Not Discussed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kansas proposes certain revisions to its rules that involve minor typographical corrections and recodification. The Director finds that these proposed revisions, unless specifically discussed below, are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations and is approving them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Required Program Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kansas submitted proposed revisions in response to required program amendments that the Director placed on the Kansas program, codified in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 916.16 (a), (b) and (c). The Director finds that the following proposed State regulations satisfy the required program amendments, are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations indicated in each required program amendment, and is approving them (the codified required amendments at 30 CFR 916.16 are indicated in brackets): K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(c)(7) by requiring that a person petitioning for leave to intervene in a proceeding need only show why his interest is or may be adversely affected rather than why his interest would be adversely affected and by requiring the presiding officer to make a decision to grant intervention based on factors listed at K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(c)(7)(B)(i)&hyph;(iv) in the event subsection (7)(A)(i) or (7)(A)(ii) are not applicable [30 CFR 916.16(b)(8)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(c)(11) by providing that any person that fails to file a responsive pleading by the required time  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> may <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing [30 CFR 916.16(b)(10)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a (b), (d), and (d)(2)(F) by replacing the phrase ``this act'' with the phrase ``these rules and regulations,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(2)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;5&hyph;5a (a) and (b), (a)(8), (a)(10) and (b)(14)&hyph;(20) by replacing the identified Federal terms and citations with the appropriate State terms and citations and by providing the State address where an individual may file a petition for review [30 CFR 916.16(b)(24)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;5&hyph;5a(b)(14) by replacing Federal terms and citations with the appropriate State terms and citations [30 CFR 916.16(b)(24)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;5&hyph;5a(c)(7)(C) by imposing a 30-day time limit within which the Surface Mining Section must remit a refund [30 CFR 916.16(c)(3)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;7(h)(2) by correcting an improper reference from K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(14) to K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a(d)(14) [30 CFR 916.16(b)(30)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1 (c)(17) and (d)(17) by modifying the adoption by reference of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.61 by deleting from its adoption by reference of 30 CFR 816&hyph;817.61(c)(1) everything but the statement ``all blasting operations shall be conducted under the direction of a certified blaster,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(4)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1 (c)(46) and (d)(44) by deleting paragraph (d), concerning variances for steep slope mining, from its adoption by reference of 30 CFR 816&hyph;817.133 [30 CFR 916.16(a)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;15&hyph;1a by removing the incorrect reference to K.A.R. 47&hyph;15&hyph;5a from the section heading for K.A.R. 47&hyph;15&hyph;1a [30 CFR 916.16(c)(5)]; K.A.R. 47&hyph;15&hyph;1a(b) (6) and (9) by providing the correct counterpart State citations for the terms ``43 CFR Part 4'' and ``43 CFR 4.1281,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(7)]; and K.A.R. 47&hyph;47&hyph;15&hyph;1a(b)(21) by requiring that informal public hearings be conducted in accordance with K.A.R. 47&hyph;4&hyph;14a [30 CFR 916.16(c)(6)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendments as identified above from the Kansas program and as codified at 30 CFR 916.16. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. K.A.R. 47&hyph;2&hyph;75(e)(6), Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kansas proposes to revise K.A.R. 47&hyph;2&hyph;75(e)(6) to replace the reference in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 846.5 to section 703 of SMCRA which deals with employee protection, with a reference to Kansas Statute Annotated (K.S.A.) 75&hyph;2973 which also deals with employee protection. Kansas is submitting this revision in response to a required program amendment placed on the Kansas program at 30 CFR 916.16(c)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

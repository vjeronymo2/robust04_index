			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hit by big rights issue fears A WHISPER around the market of an imminent Pounds 500m-plus rights issue, and the prospect of a February loaded with cash calls, put the seal on a generally dismal trading session in the UK equity market, which posted its 10th fall in eleven trading sessions. Earlier, the market had weakened progressively after a succession of bearish news items, notably a gloomy survey from the Confederation of British Industry, news on December public sector borrowing, and stories that Germany might impose a tax on overseas investment. Continuing unease over the chance of an escalation of conflict in the Gulf, and a series of earnings downgrades of leading stocks also damaged confidence. Meanwhile, details of the Government Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction prompted a more relaxed attitude in that market. Technical analysts added to the mood of uneasiness in the market saying the FT-SE 100 had gone below its 30-day moving average. The market opened on an easier note, with marketmakers chopping opening levels after the disappointing CBI survey for December which questioned recent hopes of a recovery in consumer spending. A further pointer to the level of pre-Christmas spending will come this morning when official figures for retail sales are announced. Economists expect a year-on-year increase of 2 per cent in sales figures. A brief rally ensued, but proved short-lived. The pressure on the market increased, with the Footsie future, which traded at a discount to cash all day, leading the way lower. The 100 index, after rallying to show a fall of only 3.8 mid-morning gradually subsided and began to fall sharply as hints of a big rights issue swept the market. The most surprising among a host of names put forward as candidates to raise cash was Glaxo. The suggestion was that the group could be about to make an acquisition. Redland, the building materials group, was also mentioned as were the composite insurers where Royals was seen as the most likely to call on shareholders. At its worst, the FT-SE 100 showed a loss of 27.2 at 2,735.9, but later stabilised to end a volatile and uncomfortable session 25.5 lower at 2,737.6. The Footsie Mid 250 also lost ground but outperformed the 100 index, closing 9.8 off at 2,885.9. An additional factor for the market was the disappointing level of business this week. Yesterday's turnover of 557m shares, although well up on Monday's 488m, was viewed as unsatisfactory. The value of equity business on Monday was Pounds 899.5m, the first time it has dropped below Pounds 1bn since the start of the year. From today, earnings yields and price:earnings ratios are shown for the Life Insurance, Composite Insurance and Merchant Bank sectors of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. The effect is to lower slightly the earnings yield and P/E figures shown for the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250 and FT-SE Actuaries 350. Where heavy losses from some companies would distort the P/E ratio, a maximum published figure of 80 will be shown. For the Composite Insurance sector, both figures are at present negative. Earnings yields and P/E ratios for the Investment Trust sector and for the FT-A All-Share Index will be shown from next Tuesday, January 26.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Total - Other companies The French oil group is due to report on Wednesday first-half profits that it has said will be broadly in line with those in the first half of 1993, when it made an operating profit of FFr3.49bn and net group profit of FFr1.86bn. Total has seen its crude prices and refining margins come under the same downward pressure as other oil companies. These were among the factors that led Elf-Aquitaine, the other French oil major, to report a 10 per cent drop in first-half net profit last week. But Total is significantly better placed financially than Elf. With debt amounting to 23 per cent of equity at the end of last year, it has far fewer financial charges to carry.</p>

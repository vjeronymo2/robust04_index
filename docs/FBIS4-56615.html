			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] La Paz, 4 May (EFE) -- Five dead, eight wounded,  and several "missing" is the preliminary result of the last four  days of social conflict in the confrontation between the  government and the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) who, backed  by peasants, partially paralyzed the country with the blockade  of roads seven days ago.    The talks between the government and the COB made great  progress early this morning but later the rupture seemed  imminent as a result of the insults against President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada by peasant leader Evo Morales during the  negotiations.    "If Morales does not apologize" to the president "we will  break off the negotiations" said Government Minister German  Quiroga at Government House.    Meanwhile, the environment of violence in the rural area  between the peasants who blockade roads and the passengers who  want to get to their destination reached its highest peak when a  group of peasants apparently caused a bus to fall into a  500-meter cliff killing three people and wounding six.    Cochabamba Police Commander Mario Nunez said the bus  accident  that took place near Independencia is being investigated to find  out who is responsible for it. [passage omitted]    Peasant Hilarion Mamani was killed by a bullet on 30 April  in  a confusing incident during a blockade of the road from Potosi  to Sucre. The peasants asserted that an armed group of  civilians broke up the blockade with shots and tear gas but the  government denies any participation.    The peasant leaders of Potosi Department said that today  they  will march to Potosi to request the release of the peasants  under arrest and to enquire about those missing.    Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade Union  Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), said the  whereabouts of about 12 peasants of Potosi is unknown.    Another unidentified individual died during a clash between  peasants who closed the road from Sucre to Cochabamba and a  group of passengers desperate to get to their destination.    The Chuquisaca prefect (governor) admitted that some people  were wounded but noted that no one reported any death during  blockades in Chuquisaca Department, which is now isolated  because of the official closure of roads and highways.

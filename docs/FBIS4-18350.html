			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special  envoy on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] issue, has left Athens for the United States.  According to a statement by the U.S. Information Service, Mr.  Nimetz has drawn the conclusion that both sides desire a  relationship based on cooperation and mutual respect for each  other's independence and territorial integrity, and they also  admit the dangers to stability in the region if the dispute  continues. However, the statement points out that the  differences between the sides are complicated and not easy to  overcome. The statement further stresses: Mr. Nimetz will  submit a report to Washington, present his views to UN mediator  Cyrus Vance, and continue his efforts to support the  negotiations within the UN framework. Mr. Nimetz will return to  the region when this is deemed appropriate. [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed the hope that  there is progress on the Skopje issue before his visit to the  United States. He noted this in response to a correspondent's  question while he was going to the meeting of the PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Central Organizing Committee.  Mr. Papandreou described the initiative by President Clinton's  special envoy Matthew Nimetz as positive but pointed out that  [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov remains intransigent and  pressure should be exerted in this direction.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the U.S.  side's initiative toward resolving the Skopje issue as  successful and serious.</p>

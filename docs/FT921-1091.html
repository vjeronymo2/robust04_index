			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: KLM unveils plans to expand flights network KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday unveiled detailed plans to increase the number of its round trip flights in Europe by 25 per cent this summer and to expand its fleet of aircraft, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. KLM has previously outlined in general terms a three-year expansion plan that the Dutch air carrier hopes will eventually win it 15 to 20 per cent of the European market. KLM said that it will increase the number of its European round trip flights to 1,000 per week from the current level of 800. The Dutch flag carrier also said it would revamp its schedule at Amsterdam's Schipol airport to make its home base act increasingly as a hub airport. To accommodate the expanded European schedule, KLM said it would deploy three new Boeing 737-400s of which the airline has taken delivery since the summer of 1991. In addition, KLM will lease a total of six Fokker F-100s from Air Littoral of France by the end of the year. As part of the lease agreement, Air Littoral will also supply cockpit and cabin crews, and these aircraft will be used to serve French-speaking destinations.</p>

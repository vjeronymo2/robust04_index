			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Balladur tries to ease tension with Mitterrand MR EDOUARD BALLADUR, the senior Gaullist politician who is front-runner to become French prime minister next week, moved yesterday to ease tension between the rightwing winners of the general election and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the isolated Socialist president. The future coalition government of Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF, and the president, must allow each other to carry out their responsibilities, said Mr Balladur. The right is expected to confirm its sweeping victory in tomorrow's second round of voting, which could give the partners up to 480 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, more than 80 per cent of the total. Mr Balladur's remarks imply that, if Mr Mitterrand does choose him as prime minister, he will encourage the government not to interfere with the president's most cherished policies - European union and close links with Germany. It looked increasingly likely yesterday that Mr Mitterrand would find Mr Balladur an acceptable choice as prime minister, after Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR leader, toned down his earlier calls that the president should resign in the light of the Socialists' low score in the elections. Leading Socialists have warned that Mr Mitterrand is unlikely to choose a prime minister from a party that seeks his downfall. Mr Mitterrand, who is technically free to appoint whom he likes, has said he will only choose a prime minister who supports closer European union. Mr Chirac, prime minister in the previous cohabitation government from 1986 to 1988, does not want to repeat the uncomfortable experience of being prime minister under Mr Mitterrand, but neither does he want to let the job go to his more compliant coalition partner, the UDF. 'No one disputes the president's constitutional right to finish his term if he wishes,' said Mr Chirac yesterday. The staff of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the outgoing prime minister, were already packing their belongings to be ready to move out of the Matignon, his office and residence, on Monday, when he is expected to announce the government's resignation. Mr Mitterrand will consult the winning party leaders before naming the new prime minister, possibly by Monday night, say officials. New cabinet members will be selected soon afterwards.

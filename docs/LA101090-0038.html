			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> WATER USAGE FALLS 24% IN SEPTEMBER  </P> <P> Water use in the city of Ventura was down 24% last month compared with  September of last year, city officials announced.  </P> <P> Since inception of a mandatory conservation program, water use was down 26% in  June, 22.1% in July and 18.4% in August.  </P> <P> "I was not very pleased when we dipped below 20% in our conservation efforts,  but I am very pleased to see the public responding to what is a real crisis,"  Ventura Mayor Richard Francis said Monday night.  </P> <P> Water use in September fell after water bills contained penalties for excess  water use for the first time.  </P> <P> The goal of city officials is to reduce water use by 30% over last year, but  they relaxed the goal during the hot summer months. They are optimistic that  they can increase conservation during the fall and winter.  </P> <P> A four-year drought has depleted the city's water reserves, and officials  estimate a 20% overall water reduction will be needed to make up for the  shortfall.

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Oftel announces numbers move Phone users will be able to take their numbers with them when they change telephone companies, under plans announced yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said its studies showed there was 'a very strong and robust case for the introduction of phone number portability'. Competitors to British Telecommunications say that the inability of users - particularly businesses - to take their phone numbers with them when swapping operators is a significant barrier to competition.</p>

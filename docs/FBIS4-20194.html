			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ylva Nilsson report: "Charm Offensive Had the Desired </F> Effect"]    [Excerpt] The charm which Prime Ministers Carl Bildt and  Gro Harlem Brundtland turned on during Tuesday's [19 April]  visit to the European Parliament [EP] -- or perhaps the  intellectual strength of Jacques Delors -- seems to have done  the trick. According to a straw poll, there are now at least  280 -- perhaps as many as 310 -- certain "yes" votes (of the  necessary 260) in the European Parliament in favor of new EU  [European Union] members, and it is as good as certain that the  Parliament really will vote on the issue in May.    A major uncertainty factor in the tough timetable necessary  to bring Sweden into the EU in 1995 now seems to have been  removed. After the Tuesday and Wednesday meetings and debates at  the European Parliament, it is as good as certain that the  Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Austrian membership agreements  will be added to the agenda and voted on in May. The Christian  Democrats -- the Parliament's second biggest party -- decided  Tuesday evening that the issue should be raised for discussion  in May. The socialists did not hold their meeting until  Wednesday evening but earlier that day their group leader,  Jean-Pierre Cot, estimated that at least 130 of the almost 200  socialist deputies were in favor of raising the matter for  discussion in May.    It is true that there are no guarantees that there will be a  sufficient number of "yes" votes in support of enlargement (at  least 260 out of a total of 518) when the matter is voted on,  but the party groupings' latest straw poll says that there are  at least 280, perhaps 310, who intend to vote "yes."

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE: CONTRITE BOY IS A THREAT;  </P> <P> COURTS: HE REFUSES PARENTS' PLEA TO RELEASE 14-YEAR-OLD RICHARD HUBLER, CITING  EARLIER GUN OFFENSE. DEFENSE SAYS THE 'REMORSEFUL' BOY LOVED THE SISTER HE'S  ACCUSED OF KILLING.  </P> <P> Richard Hubler aimed a gun at his sister's head and pulled the trigger. Nothing  happened. Then he tried again and shot her in the head, the prosecutor alleged  Thursday as he argued that Hubler should not be released to his parents.  </P> <P> But at a hearing attended by Hubler's mother and father, Deputy Public Defender  Sharon Petrosino said the shooting was a tragic accident. She pleaded with the  judge to allow the boy to go home while he awaits trial on a charge of  murdering 12-year-old Gema Marie Hubler at the family home on June 14.  </P> <P> Judge C. Robert Jameson agreed with the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F.  Romney, and ordered that the 14-year-old eighth-grader remain in custody.  Jameson said that because of earlier offenses involving guns, he believed that  the youth could pose a danger to others.  </P> <P> Hubler, now under suicide watch at Orange County Juvenile Hall, pleaded not  guilty to one count of murder.  </P> <P> Romney told the judge there is evidence that the youth was not on good terms  with his sister and that, on the day of the killing, he feared that she was  going to tell their parents that he had a gun.  </P> <P> But Petrosino said outside the courtroom that Hubler "loved his sister. . . .  He's emotionally upset and very remorseful. My client had an interest in guns.  But he was not interested in killing his sister." She said the boy insists that  he did not know the sawed-off .22-caliber rifle was loaded when he pointed it  at his sister.  </P> <P> She argued that his parents are very distraught over what happened but that  they believe that the shooting was an accident and want their son home with  them.  </P> <P> But Romney argued that Hubler's background proves he is dangerous. He alleged  that just four days before the killing, Hubler's parents took a .38-caliber  revolver away from him and hid it in the garage.  </P> <P> At the time of the fatal shooting, Hubler was on probation for shooting a  neighbor in the back with a BB gun in 1988. After that incident, he was found  to have a stolen .357 magnum pistol.  </P> <P> Possessing guns was a violation of Hubler's probation.  </P> <P> His parents, James and Marie Hubler, two brothers, a grandmother and an aunt  from Spain and 12 of the youth's friends attended Thursday's hearing.  </P> <P> When the friends walked into the courtroom, a bailiff ordered them out, saying  he was concerned about maintaining security. James Hubler then got into an  angry exchange with the bailiff, asking if reporters also would be asked to  leave. Later, the judge allowed the young people back in the courtroom to watch  the proceedings.  </P> <P> "The family is very distraught," Petrosino said after the hearing. "They lost a  daughter, and now they feel they are losing a son to a system that doesn't  believe him."  </P> <P> "They know the sister and brother didn't have any problems," Petrosino added.  </P> <P> The defense attorney argued that there is no evidence to support a murder  charge and that the youth is being prosecuted only because of his record of  weapons violations.  </P> <P> She compared his case to another recent juvenile shooting in which no criminal  charges have been filed. On May 24, Christian Wiedepuhl, 17, was fatally shot  in the head in an Anaheim home by a teen-age classmate.  </P> <P> On June 19, Judge Jameson denied Hubler permission to attend his sister's  funeral. However, last week, Hubler and his family received permission to say a  rosary for his sister at Juvenile Hall, Petrosino said.  </P> <P> Gema Marie, who was described as a bright, friendly sixth-grader, was shot in  the upstairs bedroom of the family's Anaheim Shores home around 12:30 p.m. on  June 14. When authorities arrived, they found her covered with a blanket and  her head wrapped in bandages.  </P> <P> She underwent surgery at UCI Medical Center in Orange for the single gunshot  wound but remained in a coma until she died June 18.  </P> <P> While she was still comatose, Hubler wrote her a letter and asked family  members to read it to her in the hospital, Petrosino disclosed. He now carries  her photograph and funeral holy card with him at all times, the attorney said.  </P> <P> Initially, the boy told police that his sister was shot by three armed robbers  who broke into the house and fled.  </P> <P> But Anaheim police said that they found many inconsistencies in his story and  that their investigation led them to believe that Hubler concocted the story  and that he was responsible for the shooting.  </P> <P> Hubler is scheduled to appear again in Juvenile Court next Thursday for a  pretrial hearing.  </P></p>

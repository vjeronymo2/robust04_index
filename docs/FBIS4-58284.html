			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The False Propaganda of the Opposition Parties] </F>   [Text] The opposition political parties believe they have  been able to intensify the movement against India's signing of  the GATT agreement. This impression is correct, as their  movement is gradually gaining strength. This strength is not  based on logic, however; it is based on the power of the throat.  It is with the force of their voice that the opposition parties  have severely shaken all parts of India from Kashmir down to  Kanniyakumari [Tamil Nadu]. Their thundering sound was heard  mainly in West Bengal. Like the clouds that precede a rainstorm  if they encounter a depression, the thunder clouds of their  anti-Dunkel movement weakened once they crossed the coasts of  West Bengal and entered other parts of the country. Thus the  tiger was converted into a mouse.    There is nothing to be surprised about. Though the  opposition claims they have the people's support, they know very  well that public opinion is not in their favor. Neither the  number of people attending their rallies at the Calcutta Brigade  Ground nor the extent of the anarchy let loose by the people in  the streets of West Bengal proves this party has public support.  It only speaks to the organizational strength of the party;  that is, its capacity to gather people. It is not a great feat  for Jyoti Basu [West Bengal chief minister] or Subhas  Chakrabarty [West Bengal minister of sports and youth services],  who are in power in West Bengal, to display this strength.  These anti-GATT rallies in the state, under the patronage of  the state government, are just meetings intended to make noise,  similar to those held on other occasions. It is not a major  achievement to gather people for such meetings in a densely  populated country like ours, particularly when holidays are  declared in courts and offices and the required number of buses  and trucks are provided for participants. This advantage  available in West Bengal is not found in other parts of the  country. This hue and cry is being raised in the name of the  general masses, but they do follow the leftist line at all.    Why should they think so? The opposition parties have been  launching propaganda against the Dunkel proposals for a long  time. Despite this, the general public does not give any heed to  their propaganda. Why should they? The people have come to  realize that slogans are the only driving force behind this hue  and cry. Besides, they have come to learn that this is false  propaganda and that false statements are being presented to the  people in fancy language. What is happening in the fields and  in the parliament is not publicity; it is false propaganda.  These political parties claimed that if India signed the  Marrakech agreement, in a few moments the price of medicine  would increase several fold and people in the villages would not  be able to pluck the leaves of their neem trees, adding that  U.S. permission would be required to pluck these leaves. These  parties further claimed that representatives of international  agencies would grab paddy seedlings from the farmers as they  went to plant them. They issued many similar warnings. If we  listen to all this, it looks as if a grandmother is trying to  frighten a child by telling him about witches. The false  stories about witches are similar to those of the opposition  parties in their propaganda against the Dunkel proposals and the  Marrakech agreement.    The truth is that a total of 105 countries met and finalized  this agreement. In doing so, every country had to give up some  of the demands they had submitted. None of the states were able  to achieve everything they wanted from this agreement. If a  comparative study is made of the profits and losses, it will be  seen that India will not lose but will gain from this accord.  The valuable information provided by the commerce minister in  this regard is a clear yardstick for the gains India will  achieve from this accord. Those whose only intention is play  politics will not heed these valuable words. Since the Rajya  Sabha went into session, these political parties have started  jumping up and down in the house. They are raising a hue and  cry alleging that the country's independence is being sold out.  They are disrupting the proceedings of the assembly. This  clearly shows that their condemnation or criticism does not have  any healthy objective. It aims only to fulfill cheap political  goals.    The leftist political parties in the country and like-minded  intellectuals are solely responsible for this narrow-minded,  illogical, and damaging propaganda. These leftist political  parties have committed several mistakes in the past. During  World War II, they distanced themselves from the independence  struggle and directly obstructed this movement. They did not  accept Subash Chandra [independence leader also known as Netaji  Basu] as a patriot; they branded him a traitor. They have long  been bitter critics of private capital and foreign industrial  organizations. They have been forced to admit all of their  mistakes one by one. Now their spokesman is paying tribute to  Gandhi and Nehru, and they have become followers of Netaji Basu.  In recent speeches their leaders have appeared eager for  foreign technology and capital. The day will come when they will  also admit their mistakes regarding the Dunkel proposals and  GATT, but history will not pardon these sinners.    In the meantime, the Bharatiya Janata Party's [BJP]  condition  has become critical because of its involvement in this false  propaganda. On the issue of whether to support or oppose the  Dunkel proposals, the BJP has decided to oppose them. There is  nothing to be surprised about. Behind its cloak of championing  the cause of Hinduism, this party is also a leftist party.  Vishwanath Pratap Singh's [Janata Dal leader] stand on this  issue is different. He has stated that there is no alternative  to signing the GATT treaty. Will Jyoti Basu listen to his  "friend" today?</p>

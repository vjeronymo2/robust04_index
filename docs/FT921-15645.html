			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hollas falls 29% to Pounds 235,000 THE HOLLAS Group, the specialist textile company, reported a 29 per cent setback in the six months to September 30 with pre-tax profits falling from Pounds 332,000 to Pounds 235,000. Mr Tony Lawson, chairman, said that since the last annual report where he referred to the rapid and unprecedented deterioration in trading conditions, he could only say that, six months later, conditions were even worse with no sign of improvement. Turnover declined from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 18.5m. Earnings per share were 0.3p against 0.4p but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.6p. The sale of shares in an associated company gave rise to an extraordinary credit of Pounds 365,000.</p>

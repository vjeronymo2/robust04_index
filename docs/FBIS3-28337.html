			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Kan Kato, the head of the  government's Tax Commission, on Monday [7 February] reiterated  his opposition to the idea of reducing income tax without  securing funds to finance the lost revenues. Implementing tax  cuts in such a manner would pose "a great problem" to the  overall tax structure, Kato told a press conference after  attending the commission's general meeting.    He rejected the latest proposal by the Social Democratic  Party (SDP) to first of all implement a tax cut to turn around  the ailing economy, while a consultative body considers how to  cover the cuts.    The political wrangling over the tax issue turned serious  when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided to introduce the 7  percent "National Welfare Tax" last week. Faced with strong  opposition from the SDP, the largest force in the coalition  government, Hosokawa retracted the decision the day after  announcing it.    In a bid to break the impasse, SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama  proposed setting up a consultative body and allowing it two  years to decide how to cover the lost revenues. There is no  guarantee that the consultative body would come to a conclusion  within a fixed period of time, Kato said, terming the SDP's plan  "a hypothetical guarantee."    Kato then cited the possibility of tax cuts being slashed  from the original figure of 6 trillion yen, if funds to repay  them are not ensured.    The Tax Commission is still firmly in favor of linking the  tax cut and hike as proposed in its report to the prime minister  last November, Kato said.    Monday's general meeting by the commission is intended to  wrap up a tax reform plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April.  If the current political confusion continues, the release of a  reform proposal would be delayed from the scheduled date of  Wednesday.</p>

He said to reporters on Wednesday that Yegor Gaydar's  resignation as first deputy premier had not ended his political  career. "We'll see him working in the Russian government some  time in the future," Shumeyko said.    He rejected the suggestion that Gaydar's resignation meant  an  end to the economic reforms. "Only Gaydar, Fedorov and Shumeyko  have left the government," the rest of its members remaining in  office, Shumeyko said.    He said the recent reorganization had made the government  more compact and potentially more efficient. "I hope this  government stays in office until the new presidential election,  prior to which it has to resign under the Constitution," he  said.    He did not rule out that the Russia's Choice bloc, headed by  Gaydar, would come to be in opposition to the Chernomyrdin  government. But this would only be clear after the government  approved proposed amendments to its economic policy, he said.    Shumeyko said the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov would  not  affect Russia's relations with its Western partners. But Russia  is "a powerful sovereign state, which will not allow anyone to  lecture it," he said.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: Asian markets put on a bumper end-of-year show - At a glance Stock markets in most of Asia put on a spectacular performance during 1993. Hong Kong, the largest market in the region, was particularly dynamic, despite political worries in the run up to 1997. Markets in south-east Asia  -Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand - hit a series of all-time highs, with predictions of strong economic growth and heavy demand from both local and overseas investors. Taiwan this week reached its highest level for 29 months. Japan, however, staged a temporary recovery only to fall back towards the year-end.</p>

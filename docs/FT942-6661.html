			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Proxies that really mean nothing As I cannot attend the annual general meetings of companies in which I have an investment, I have always completed and returned the proxy voting forms authorising the 'chairman of the meeting' to vote according to the wishes I express. In view of the article by David Wighton, 'Power of the shareholder' (FT, April 9), it would appear that a proxy vote will be used only when those present at the meeting demand a poll. If this is correct, it would seem that such a vote would be of little use except where matters of contention arise. You are correct to say that proxy votes are used only when a show of hands proves indecisive or goes against the resolution. But you could always authorise a proxy, other than the chairman of the meeting, to vote according to your wishes. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

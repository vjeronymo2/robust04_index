			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (B) in the case of an insured branch, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that the activity would pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 12 U.S.C. 3105(h)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to implement this provision, the Board issued a proposed rule on January 6, 1993, with a request for public comment. (58 FR 513). In taking this action, the Board stated that it would consider revisions to the proposed rule as appropriate and on the basis of the comments received. The comment period ended on March 5, 1993. The Board indicated that it would accept and process applications under the statute during the pendency of the rulemaking. No applications have been received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule required a foreign bank operating a state-licensed branch or agency in the United States, which desires to engage in or continue to engage in an activity that is not permissible for a federal branch, pursuant to statute, regulation or order or interpretation issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), to file an application in letter form to the Board for permission to conduct or to continue to conduct such activity. The proposed regulation set forth the required contents of the application and a procedure for divestiture or cessation of impermissible activities not approved by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requested comment on several items, including the contents of the application, whether prior notice rather than an application might be appropriate for certain classes of activities, and whether the conduct of activities permitted by the OCC pursuant to informal rather than formal interpretation, opinion or advice should require the filing of an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Board requested comment on another provision of Regulation K which requires that a foreign bank wishing to convert from a federal branch or agency license to a state branch or agency license file for approval to do so with the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board received four public comments on the regulation. Comments were submitted by a state banking supervisor, an association of state banking supervisors, a trade association and a law firm. The commenters generally were supportive of the approach taken in the proposed rule. The comments focused on whether an activity-based approach rather than a bank-based approach would be preferable, whether the conduct of activities permitted by the OCC pursuant to informal rather than formal interpretation, opinion or advice should require an application and whether an application would be required to conduct an activity that the OCC permitted but only subject to quantitative restrictions. The commenters uniformly stated that no application should be required to convert from a federal branch or agency license to a state branch or agency license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

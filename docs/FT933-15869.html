			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Back to basics for healthcare: The World Bank says that child mortality rates remain 10 times as high as in the richest countries DEVELOPING countries could reduce the burden of disease by up to a third by spending less on high-tech medicine and more on basic public health and clinical services the World Bank says in its latest World Development Report. The report, published today, says the high incidence of disease and disability is caused as much by the poor allocation of existing resources as by a lack of funds. In some countries, one teaching hospital, catering mainly for the affluent, can absorb 20 per cent or more of the national healthcare budget. The report urges poor and middle income countries to invest in a minimum healthcare package comprising routine public health measures and a few essential clinical services. Such services could be provided by local clinics and district hospitals and would not need expensive equipment or highly-trained specialists. On public health, the most cost-effective measures include expanding immunisation services for children, school-based health services, campaigns to reduce levels of smoking and alcohol consumption, information about nutrition and family planning, and efforts to prevent the spread of Aids. Clinical services should include at least prenatal and delivery care, family planning, tuberculosis control, care for childhood diseases and simple treatments for sexually-transmitted diseases. Hospital- based emergency care should be provided depending on capacity and resources. In the poorest countries, the cost of this minimum package *something in here (HP) * would be about Dollars 12 per person a year, or just over 3 per cent of per capita income. Bank estimates indicate this modest investment could reduce the burden of disease by more than 30 per cent. In middle income countries, the minimum package would cost about Dollars 22 per person or roughly 1 per cent of per capita incomes. It could reduce the burden of disease by about 15 per cent. Adopting the package in all developing countries would require a quadrupling of expenditure on public health, from about Dollars 5bn to Dollars 20bn a year, and a doubling of spending on essential clinical services to Dollars 40bn. In middle income countries, where public healthcare expenditure is already about Dollars 60 per person a year, the package could be financed out of existing resources provided existing spending on less cost-effective discretionary services, such as heart surgery, was reduced. In the poorest countries public spending on healthcare is only about Dollars 6 per person a year. The bank's minimum package would thus require a substantial increase in spending by governments, donors and patients, as well as a redirection of the healthcare budget from specialised facilities for the affluent. Such measures would work best if accompanied by broader efforts to reduce household poverty and improve education, the report says. Studies show people with more schooling utilise health information more effectively than those without. 'Education of girls and women is particularly beneficial to household health because it is largely women who buy and prepare food, and initiate contacts with the health system.' The bank emphasises the importance of promoting diversity and competition in the supply of health services. In the short term, reforms in drug procurement offer the greatest efficiency gains. Governments that have introduced competition in drug procurement and switched from brand name to generic drugs have achieved savings of 40-60 per cent. The report says developing countries have made great strides in improving health conditions. In the past four decades, life expectancy has risen from 40 years to 63 years and the number of children dying before their fifth birthday has dropped from nearly three in 10 to one in 10. However, child mortality rates remain about 10 times as high as the richest countries while maternal mortality rates can be up to 30 times higher. In the past 6 years, the bank has quadrupled to Dollars 1.5bn a year its lending for healthcare services in poor countries. If diseases such as Aids and tuberculosis are to be controlled, other donors and institutions need to put greater emphasis on supporting cost-effective health services, it says. Investing in health.

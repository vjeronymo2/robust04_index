			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Lines open for BT link with GM - Martin Dickson and Paul Taylor examine suggestions that the UK company may be about to take a stake in Electronic Date Systems SHARES in Electronic Data Systems, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, rose sharply yesterday morning amid market speculation that British Telecom might be discussing buying a stake in the business. Both companies declined to comment on 'speculation and market rumours', which originated last Saturday with a report in the Dallas Morning News that British Telecom might take a 25 per cent stake in EDS. The American company, which is based in Dallas, has a market capitalisation of nearly Dollars 17bn. However, analysts detected signs that the two companies may have at least been discussing some form of co-operation and shares in General Motors' Class E stock, whose value is tied to EDS's performance, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 35 3/8 yesterday. On Friday it rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34. The class E stock was first issued by General Motors when it acquired EDS in 1984 from the company's founder, Mr Ross Perot, who severed his relations with both businesses in 1986 after repeated disputes with GM's management. GM still owns some 40 per cent of the stock. Class E shareholders have no direct, legal right to EDS's assets, which are controlled by GM, but dividends paid on the stock are based on EDS's performance. Some form of tie-up between BT and EDS could benefit both sides as telecommunications and computer services industries increasingly overlap, but it would also raise fresh questions about British Telecom's patchy record of business forays in North America. Since privatisation in 1984 BT has made a series of expensive investments in the North American market as part of its international strategy, but these have not proved particularly successful. In November, BT agreed to sell its three-year-old minority stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the US mobile phone group, to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The sale will be worth Dollars 49-a-share, or about Dollars 1.8bn, when it is completed later this year and has been widely perceived as saving shareholders from an expensive error. The same month BT recorded a sharp drop in its half-year pre-tax earnings, mainly because of exceptional charges to cover the sale of its interest in Mitel Corporation, the troubled Canadian telephone equipment manufacturer in which BT took a controlling 51 per cent stake in 1985. However, the central plank of BT's international strategy remains its ambitious plans to provide global telecommunications services to multinational companies. As part of this strategy BT established Syncordia, an Atlanta, Georgia-based network management company, which operates GNS, a data communications company, and has developed a plan dubbed Operation Cyclone to invest Dollars 1bn over the next decade in infrastructure outside the UK. A link with EDS might provide Syncordia with more credibility and access to business cus-tomers. For GM, an investment in EDS by an outside party would mean a useful injection of cash when the motor company has been financially stretched by two years of severe losses. However, GM has said in the past that EDS, one of its more profitable businesses, is not for sale outright. For EDS itself, an outside partner in the telecommunications field might help its penetration of international markets, though it already has a sophisticated international telecommunications network of its own. A new equity stakeholder could also give its management additional freedom from GM's embrace. Relations between GM and EDS were volatile in the early years, as the cultures of the two companies clashed, but analysts say they are now much better. EDS, estimated to be the world's largest provider of computer services, has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years which has sharply reduced its dependence on GM for revenues. It still handled most of GM's computer operations, but its non-GM revenues could reach 70 per cent of the total by 1995, compared to just 29 per cent in 1985. Its business involves systems integration - designing computer networks - and 'outsourcing' of data processing, which means managing clients' entire computer operations.</p>

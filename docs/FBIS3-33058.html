			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Worldwide experience tells us that the road to a  peace agreement is long and winding. This was the case in  Colombia between Virgilio Barco's government and the M-19 [19  April Movement], in El Salvador where the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] caused some 75,000 deaths, and even  in Europe and the Far East. Therefore, it is too soon to say  whether or not the efforts being made by the government to reach  a peace agreement with the Shining Path [SL] will be fruitful.  To hold talks by no means mean to negotiate.    Some weeks ago SL slogans, quite different to the usual  ones,  appeared on walls and even on posters. They read: "Let us  strive for a peace agreement;" "Let us stand and fight for a  great decision and a great definition;" and, "Let us support  President Gonzalo [SL leader Abimael Guzman] and the  leadership." In addition to this, last 25 January a local  newspaper published a long SL document, which is "secret"  according to the newspaper's editors, entitled: "The SL is using  the `peace agreement' to gain time."    These facts inevitably awakened more than one specialist on  Shining Path affairs, "experts" who study the violence  phenomenon in Peru, with some exceptions obviously, whose  apocalyptic predictions made before 12 September 1992 [when  Guzman was arrested] we had forgotten. [passage omitted]    Santiago Pedraglio, another expert on the subject, believes  it is a mistake to identify what is called a "peace agreement  with the overall pacification of the country."    He said: It is fair to request the ideological defeat of the  SL, but we should not "confuse apples and oranges." There is a  time and way to defeat the SL ideologically, but this not the  same as a political, and especially a military, defeat. The  ideological defeat does not fit in a negotiation, no matter how  different it may be. The Shining Path's ideological defeat not  only concerns the government and Fujimorism, but also and  especially the opposition... It is surprising, therefore, that  criticism of any negotiation with the SL is coming from some of  those who for many years fervently upheld the need for a  political outcome to the armed conflict. It seems that they are  blinded by their anti-Fujimori feelings. This is extremely  dangerous because it encourages a military outcome from the  opposition. [passage omitted]</p>

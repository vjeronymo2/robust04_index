			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: David Byrne - Ronnie Scott's A solo appearance before an invited audience armed only with acoustic guitar and a clutch of backing tracks brought David Byrne to London for the first time since Talking Heads were officially consigned to the annals of rock. His early-evening session at Ronnie Scott's on Tuesday was convened nominally to display the wares on his new solo album Uh-Oh (Sire), yet seemed just as much a declaration of Byrne's independence now as a performer as well as a song writer. There was the statutory scattering of new tracks, but also fond backward glances to Talking Heads and a clutch of cover versions. It was an absorbing, delightfully low-key affair. There is nothing contrived about Byrne's platform manner these days; the big suits and the stylised gestures of the Heads' concerts really have gone for ever. The presentation between the songs was minimal and almost apologetic, though in performance the vocal role-playing and vehement attack are still summoned at will. The new material harks back to the sounds and melodic shapes of late Talking Heads - to the multilayerings of Naked especially - though the synthesisers are now mixed with the brassy salsa rhythms of Byrne's Brazilian expeditions. The best of the songs seem as strong as anything he's written for a decade, and he has retained the knack of capping a routine one with a naggingly insidious chorus. Pared down for the concert, one could relish the words more vividly than on the album - in the ironic paean to transsexualism 'Now I'm your Mom', the distinctly menacing 'Walk in the Dark', or the most Heads-like of all, 'Tiny Town'. Byrne, one suspects, is a better guitarist than he or anyone gives him credit for, and one rarely missed the intricate arrangements that cocoon the recorded versions. Nostalgia aside, the Talking Heads numbers were the least successful part of the show, save for a robust 'Road to Nowhere'; perhaps Byrne has yet to rekindle his enthusiasm for all that history. The covers, though, were a delightful surprise - numbers borrowed from Wire and the Texas Tornados (their discomfitingly witty 'Who were you thinkin' of?') and, of all people, Neil Young: a really sharp version of 'Rocking in the Free World' wound things up. It certainly provided food for thought. Perhaps Young will now return the compliment and give his version of 'Psycho Killer', which really would keep us all awake at night.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: For the want of a nail I arrived home on Thursday evening, grey with exhaustion, to find Miss Lee, my executive assistant, serving Vera Lynns (lime, tonic, gin) to a trio of young lawyers encamped in my sitting room. I could tell they were lawyers - not from their suits and briefcases or red, buttony eyes but from the stench of money that swirled about them like the smell of rotting mangrove in a moon-less swamp. I did not interrupt. From what I could see they were in awe of Miss Lee, who was certainly looking a picture and who spoke to them throatily while dispensing the Vera Lynns. Miss Lee, a Thatcherite, is at present celebrating the return of the glam-rock influence to London haut couture, and was wearing something sequinny, in a new, miracle tulle - saffron, I suppose you'd say it was. I retreated to the lower floor of our Notting Hill duplex. Cooked dinner. Cleaned the kitchen floor. Spent some quality time with the cat. Watered the camellias on the patio. Laid the table with the laughing-kookaburra placemats that we use in mid-week. And waited for Miss Lee to finish her business with the mangrove-heads and join me for dinner. Which she did, eventually, with a magical rustle of tulle. We started our meal. Miss Lee poured herself a glass of house red, from a winery near Quillabamba, but could not touch her food. She was obviously excited. She said: 'I expect you are wondering, Michael, why my lawyers were here this evening, non?' It turned out that Miss Lee had been entranced by the news that a High Court judge in London had ruled that a man, Martyn Ginder, was two-thirds to blame for an accident in which his wife, most unfortunately, had broken her back while trying to rescue their young son from a car-port roof. The husband had been asked at least 10 times in three months to mend the window through which the child had climbed out. As a result, the wife, now wheelchair-bound, had claimed an estimated Pounds 500,000 against her husband's household insurance policy. Damages will be assessed at a later date. 'All deeply upsetting,' said Miss Lee, stroking her glass. 'But also educational. Hence the attendance here this evening of my lawyers, who are insisting, Michael, that your household insurance policy be raised to Pounds 2m tout de suite, plus half a million for various extensions.' 'Extensions?' 'I shall come to those. But let us deal first with basic household liability. As you know, Pounds 2m, these days, is neither here nor there. It is a very small sum, though large enough, just, to cover against damage to my person occasioned by your limpness on the DIY front.' 'DIY?' 'Do-it-yourself. Household maintenance. Running repairs. Toolbox. Men's work. I have asked you 20 times since Christmas to re-hang the John Bellany in the sitting room. It is a major work of art, no one can deny, but also immensely heavy. My lawyers dread to think what damage it might cause should it fall and strike me - and all for the want of a nail. 'There are other things about the flat that fill me with alarm. That ill-fitting drain-cover which allows all the rats hereabouts, bombed as they are on high-class dope, to cavort across our patio morning, noon and night. That bracket-thing over the cooker. The carpet by the stairs. You are the man around here, Michael. The place should be ship-shape. That is your role.' I said: 'You know I'll have no truck with this role-playing crap.' 'Exactly,' said Miss Lee. 'Which is why my lawyers are adamant that the time has come to raise your household policy to a nice Pounds 2m, so that my person is protected.' 'What are these extensions?' 'I was about to come to those. My lawyers maintain that your household policy should be extended so as to insure me against stress or psychological damage caused, or likely to be caused, by matters or situations other than mere maintenance.' 'Example?' 'Well . . . riding around in the Rover. My lawyers agree that a woman of my sensitivity is highly vulnerable to stress if she is obliged to travel around in a six-year-old Rover car driven by a person as eccentric as you. There are various other matters - bedroomy, nocturnal - to be covered by the extensions. Half a million should do it, just about.'</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): CAC-40 nears 2,000 in active trading BOURSES closed mostly firmer in the run-up to Easter, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS approached 2,000 on the CAC-40 index in active trading, buoyed up Wall Street's record close overnight. The index went as high as 1,995.39 before closing up 18.38 at 1,990.69. Volume was heavy at FFr4bn, but Perrier and Exor accounted for just over FFr1bn. Positive 1991 results pushed up several stocks. The builder GTM-Entrepose rose FFr22 to FFr402 after announcing a 50 per cent rise in net attributable profit last year, while L'Oreal added FFr20 to FFr865 after its pleasing 1991 figures. Dealers said that the shares in the beauty products company were starting to look expensive. Euro Disney continued to fall, closing down FFr3.20 or 2.3 per cent at FFr136.30 while Eurotunnel weakened for a second day in heavy trading on fears that it might announce a rights issue when it publishes its results on April 24. The stock went as low as FFr36 before closing down 55 centimes at FFr37.40 with 2.9m shares traded, its lowest close this year. FRANKFURT took comfort from some encouraging economic data. The DAX index rose 10.96 to 1,743.49 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 1.97 to 709.09. Turnover rose to DM5.6bn from DM4.4bn. Before the market opened the Bundesbank reported an improvement in the annual rate of inflation, down to 3.5 per cent from about 4 per cent. Further positive news came later in the day with a return to surplus in February of the west German trade balance, after a deficit the previous month. The market seems to have discounted the threat of a public sector pay dispute, with analysts noting that the difference between the two sides is small. However, Bonn has said that the increase sought by the unions could cost DM15bn. There was little corporate news to excite the market. Daimler and Siemens continued to advance on positive reports earlier in the week. Daimler rose DM6 to DM787.50, while Siemens advanced DM4.10 to DM688.30. Car stocks were generally positive after Tuesday's news of an improvement in first quarter sales. BMW was DM4 ahead at DM586.50 and Volkswagen up DM3.20 at DM373.90. In the construction sector Hochtief advanced DM7 to DM1,317. Analysts have put out some encouraging reports recently on the sector, with Kleinwort Benson forecasting that output in east Germany could grow by 17 per cent in 1992, after 5 per cent in 1991. Holzmann gained DM9 to DM1,193. MILAN closed slightly firmer in technical trading at the close of the April trading account. Dealers said the session started 10 minutes late as traders wanting to carry over their short positions into the new account had difficulty in borrowing stock for end-account purposes. The Comit index rose 0.38 to 499.54 in turnover estimated at L100bn after L87.7bn. The overhang of short positions in Sip prompted some traders to attempt a 'bear squeeze' by pushing up the share price. Sip ended L31.50 or 2.2 per cent higher at L1,489.5. Fiat gained L30 to L4,755 while Pirelli rose L44 or 3.6 per cent to L1,270 on London buying. Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's group, fell L19 or 1.2 per cent to L1,526. The court verdict on Mr De Benedetti for his alleged involvement in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 is expected today. ZURICH advanced strongly. The SMI index rose 20.3 or 1.10 per cent to 1,874.1, just off a 1992 intraday high of 1,874.3, lifted by today's expiry of share options and futures. Georg Fischer bearers advanced SFr45 to SFr1,010 following Tuesday's announcement on strong earnings growth this year. Roche certificates gained SFr30 to SFr3,180, and Ciba-Geigy registered shares, added SFr60 to SFr3,520. AMSTERDAM saw a good performance from publishers. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.9 at 126.4. Wolters Kluwer, which held its annual meeting, added Fl 1.40 to Fl 74 and Elsevier gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 116.80. Elsewhere, DSM rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 110 on better-than-expected first quarter earnings estimates. STOCKHOLM was lifted by Wall Street and a decline in domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 10.2 to 984.3 as turnover rose to SKr570m from SKr390m. The forestry sector index gained 2.2 per cent. MADRID gained ground. The general index rose 2.83 to 252 in turnover estimated at Pta12bn. Telefonica put on Pta15 to Pta1,100 in spite of a breakdown in pension fund negotiations with the unions. OSLO jumped 1.9 per cent, helped by rises on foreign stock markets. The all-share index rose 7.77 to 420.18 in turnover worth NKr180m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1165.59  1165.80  1165.63  1165.26  1166.24  1167.21  1167.50  1167.06  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1167.76    Day's Low  1165.26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Apr 14    Apr 13    Apr 10     Apr 9     Apr 8 1157.52   1153.23   1155.74   1140.98   1143.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

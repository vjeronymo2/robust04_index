			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water ahead 30% NORTHUMBRIAN Water, the smallest of the 10 water and sewage companies by market capitalisation, yesterday announced a 30 per cent increase in profits, the biggest rise so far in this year's reporting season. Mr David Cranston, chief executive, said increases in profits and turnover were mainly due to last year's 16.7 per cent average price rises, but the company also managed to improve its operating margins. Northumbrian lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.9m to Pounds 61.1m in the year to March 31. This followed a 35 per cent increase at the interim stage to Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 23.1m). Turnover increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 204m (Pounds 167m). Core, regulated water sales increased by some 16 per cent to Pounds 170m (Pounds 147m). Unlike water companies in the south of England where recession hit harder, turnover from industrial users held to forecast. Northumbrian said its 'enterprise', or unregulated, companies increased sales threefold. But operating results were 'insignificant', and Northumbrian Environmental Management, a large waste management subsidiary, remained loss-making. Interest receivable fell to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 13.3m) as net cash fell to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 74.7m). This was due to Northumbrian's mounting capital investment programme, and capital expenditure for the regulated business increased to Pounds 105m (Pounds 100m). Mr Cranston said he expected Northumbrian to have net borrowings by the end of this year, although gearing would remain under 20 per cent. Earnings per share increased 31 per cent to 85.5p (65.3p). The company is recommending a final dividend of 13.7p (12.4p) to make a total of 20.5p (18.6p), a 10 per cent increase. Dividend cover increased to 4.2 times (3.5). The company faced five prosecutions for sewage treatment failures, compared with three in the previous six-month period. Recent figures from Ofwat, the water regulator, showing Northumbrian to have a high level of customer complaints about water quality, were due to a mains scraping and re-lining programme, Mr Cranston said. COMMENT Profits towards the top end of expectations and a generous dividend, helped Northumbrian weather yesterday's price declines in the water sector, and the shares recovered to close down 1p at 467p. At first sight, the company's highlighted improvement in operating margins, up nearly 7 per cent to 27 per cent, should stem past criticism of its cost levels. Then again, perhaps Northumbrian could have done better considering the size of last year's price rises and the fact that margins were helped by a lower, and therefore curious, depreciation charge. Profits for this year of Pounds 70m (including Pounds 7m from a one-off stock market investment fund), put the shares on a p/e of less than 5, with a yield of 4.3. Those not yet convinced by the company's moves into unregulated businesses, and agressive financial management, may prefer to wait until the division produces 'significant' results.</p>

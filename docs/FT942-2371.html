			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Anyone for dinner? - Eating Out Every restaurant correspondent hopes that when he, or she, sits down to their word processor it will inspire readers to go out and enjoy the restaurants that have been described. So it is with a heavy heart as a tennis enthusiast (whose greatest claim to tennis fame is that he once had a most enjoyable lunch in Sydney with a man who, in his youth, played doubles with Rod Laver) that I sit down and list some of the restaurants in south London which may be useful over the forthcoming Wimbledon fortnight. A heavy heart because I hope, like so many others, that the weather is kind and that you are never forced indoors to use them. But just in case . . .

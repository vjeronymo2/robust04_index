Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas said over 60,000  crimes  were reported to law enforcement institutions last year and this  was the highest figure throughout Lithuanian history. The crime  rate went up by 6 percent last year, but increased by as much as  25 percent a year earlier, he said.    In Paulauskas' words, the preventive detention law allowed  to  strike a heavy blow on organized crime, to break up a number of  criminal gangs and to arrest underground bosses. But around 63  percent of crimes were not disclosed and sources that supply  weapons to criminals were not destroyed. The number of  premeditated murders, robberies, economic and financial crimes  continued to increased, he said.    The collegium's meeting was attended by President Algirdas  Brazauskas, who pointed out that the press "amuses" itself by  writing about corruption and abuse of authority among officials.  He urged law institutions to respond to such accusations "in a  legal way" and as soon as possible.    The president said law institutions should establish closer  cooperation among themselves and assured the meeting's  participants that the state "does not and will not grudge" money  to ensure law and order.    Bickauskas, who was present at the meeting, said an  outbursts  of crime was provoked by Gorbachev's perestroyka. In the  lawmaker's opinion, "an absolute denial of Soviet laws" at the  very start of Lithuania's national revival transformed into  "denial of order," while constant changes in the legislation  "stimulated legal nihilism."    The parliament vice chairman said law institutions "began to  waver politically under pressure from both the left and the  right, and gave up fearing they might be called the nation's  enemies."    Bickauskas said the struggle against organized crime must  continue, data bases about mafia must be created and agents must  be infiltrated into criminal structures.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: A fresh option for HK gamblers - Simon Holberton looks at the latest outlet for the colony's investors THE introduction of traded options on the Hong Kong Futures Exchange tomorrow completes the rehabilitation of an institution which has fought successfully to throw off the bad odour surrounding its closure and reform in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market collapse. Before the crash, Hong Kong's futures market vied with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the exchange which had the biggest volume of daily trade in index futures. That all came unstuck in October 1987 when Hong Kong got a salutary lesson in the meaning of open-ended risk. Mr Kevin Snowball, managing director of Morgan Grenfell Asia Futures (Hong Kong), says: 'We now have a more professional futures market, and the introduction of options is an extension of that.' The exchange will offer a range of traded options built around the Hang Seng Index - Hong Kong's bellwether stock market index - with 56 separate contracts for trading. Traded options have been two years in the making. According to Mr Gary Knight, the exchange's chief executive, the exchange has put more than 700 individuals through extensive training courses. It has also acquired and customised a version of the Chicago Options Clearing Corporation's clearing system. 'Options have proved themselves to be an essential tool for all kinds of investors,' says Mr Knight. 'How quick the options market grows depends basically on the education process of all investors. But we take a very long view on the market. We think the stock market will continue to expand on the back of internal growth and because of Hong Kong's proximity to China.' If the history of futures trading is a guide, then that process may not take much time at all. The index futures began trading in May 1986 with an average daily turnover of 1,600 contracts; by September 1987, average daily turnover had swollen to 27,318 contracts. Analysts believe options will appeal to local 'retail' investors and to institutional investors. Says Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities: 'There is quite a demand for geared plays in Hong Kong. In what other country do you get grannies who take out swap deposits?" Options on the Hang Seng Index will offer the gearing, but unlike futures, where risk can be unlimited, the buyer of an option knows his maximum exposure at the outset. For the institutional investor, the advent of Hang Seng Index options may also be a boon. Many international investors, especially US funds, have minimum dealing sizes that make trades difficult to execute in Hong Kong. The reason is much of Hong Kong's stock market listed equity belongs to family owners or large mainland Chinese investors. Tradeable equity in Hongkong Telecom is 21.6 per cent of issued capital: in Citic Pacific, 40 per cent: in Hutchison Whampoa, 59 per cent. If the traded option on the Hang Seng Index is successful, and most think it will be, then the next step is for individual stock options to be traded. Last week, both Chicago and New York began trading an option on Hongkong Telecom's ADRs. But the futures exchange is not likely to carry trading in stock options when they appear. That seems likely to be the province of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange which, as a prelude to trading, will have to repeal the existing prohibition on 'short selling'. Currently in Hong Kong, stock options exist in the form of warrants. These are almost always 'call' options and usually have maturities ranging from two to five years. The capitalisation of this market is in excess of HKDollars 25bn. Analysts believe the covered warrant market - making for nearly 40 per cent of the Hong Kong futures exchange - is most at risk from the introduction of stock options. Says Mr Justin Kennedy, of Warburg Securities: 'Retail investors . . . will like stock options because they are short-dated, highly geared and extremely volatile.'</p>

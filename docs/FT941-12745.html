			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Partco set to float in March Partco, the biggest inde-pendent distributor of automotive parts and equipment in the UK, is to be floated in March with an estimated market value of Pounds 50m. The company is raising Pounds 25m in a placing and intermediaries' offer in the second flotation recently announced in a rapidly consolidating sector. Finelist, a smaller competitor, will be floated next month with a capitalisation of about Pounds 25m. Partco distributes car and commercial vehicle components, automotive paint and refinishing materials, and equipment for vehicle workshops. It expects to report a doubling of pre-tax profits to about Pounds 4.3m for the year to December 31 on sales of Pounds 124m. It delivers branded and own-label products to business customers from a 210-branch network which stretches from Cornwall to north-east Scotland. Of those, 99 branches offer paints and bodyshop refinishing products, as well as other parts. The group has a central distribution warehouse in Northamptonshire. Mr Peter Redfern, managing director, sees ample scope for expansion, both by acquisition and opening greenfield operations. The group has only one branch in a city as big as Manchester and has identified 200 areas where it is not represented, yet have catchment populations of 25,000. Partco was the product of a management buy-out from Quinton Hazell in 1986. The team turned round the lossmaking business and in 1989 became the biggest independent distributor through the purchase of GKN Autoparts in 1989. The deal was completed just before the UK went into recession. By 1991 the group needed to swap equity for debt and close lossmaking outlets. Mr Redfern said this explained why the flotation 'would not create any paper millionaires', although the executive team would end up with about 5 per cent of the enlarged equity between them. Mr Gordon Yardley, a non-executive director of BTR, was appointed chairman of Partco in 1991. The group is being advised by Hambro Magan, with Cazenove acting as brokers to the issue.</p>

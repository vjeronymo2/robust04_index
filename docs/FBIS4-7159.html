			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Outstanding Military Strategist" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il is a great military strategist and iron-willed  brilliant commander possessed of rare military wisdom, matchless  grit and distinguished commanding art.    He has published many works including "Let Us Strengthen the  People's Army into Matchless Ranks" to give a comprehensive  answers to all the theoretical and practical questions arising  in building revolutionary Armed Forces, and has strengthened and  developed the Korean People's Army [KPA] into invincible Armed  Forces with energetic guidance.    It is the greatest feat performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in  the great work of Army building that he has trained the KPA into  loyal and filial Armed Forces defending the party and the  leader, the country and people with their lives.    He has attached particular importance to the singlehearted  unity of the whole Army based on the idea of the leader in  increasing its combat capabilities. He put forward a new policy  of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea to this end.    And he trained the whole Army into ranks with steel-like  discipline that act as one on the orders and instructions of the  party, ranks singleheartedly united in ideology and purpose and  in morality and sense of obligation, with his tireless energetic  guidance. The integral whole of complete unity in ideology and  purpose, the community of destiny, that shares the destiny and  bitters and sweets in the struggle for the country and people --  this is the looks of the KPA that has grown up under the loving  care of the great brilliant commander.    Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the work of building a  powerful self-reliant national defence industry to strengthen  and develop the KPA into an invincible Army.    He, with a deep insight into the features of modern warfare,  indicated the direction and ways of building the self-reliant  national defence industry and solved all problems with  never-ceasing trips of on-the-spot guidance.    Thus, the KPA has been strengthened into invincible ranks  equipped with modern offensive and defensive means.    Another great feat performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in the  great work of Army building is that he has made sure that the  beautiful traits of Army-civilian unity is fully displayed  throughout the country so that the Army and the people may help  each other, and that the arming of the entire people and the  fortification of the whole country have been completed.    In Korea, under his outstanding guidance and politics of  love, the Army and people are united by blood ties like one  family and the whole country has turned into an impregnable  fortress which no formidable enemy can provoke.    The iron will, grit and distinguished commanding art of  Comrade Kim Chong-il instill deep conviction of victory in the  revolution and fighting spirit into the Korean people.    In early March last year a touch-and-go crisis was created  on  the Korean peninsula owing to the adventurous aggressive war  rackets of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet  clique. Progressive mankind of the world was deeply concerned  over it. At that time, Comrade Kim Chong-il proclaimed a  semi-war state to the whole country, entire people and whole  Army and saw to it that a decisive statement on the withdrawal  of the DPRK from NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] was  issued in the wake of it.    And he turned the whole party, the entire people and the  whole Army into a powerful combat force and the Korean people  rose up like a mountain in hearty response to the call of the  illustrious leader. The enemies trembled with fear.    This was how peace on the Korean peninsula and the rest of  Asia was defended.    "We will win because General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed  brilliant commander, is leading us"--this is the unshakable will  and faith of the Korean people and the People's Army officers  and soldiers.</p>

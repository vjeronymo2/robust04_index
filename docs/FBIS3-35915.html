Aliyev stressed that the war is going on on the Azerbaijani  territory. "Nagorno-Karabakh which is an integral part of  Azerbaijan and seven other regions outside Karabakh are  currently under complete control of the Armenian troops", he  said.    The president resolutely rejected media reports on major  losses allegedly suffered by the Azeri army and said it is  Armenians who sustain most losses. "The Armenian units are on  the offensive and therefore suffer bigger losses. We are waging  a just war and defend our land from the occupants", Aliyev said.    The president used the opportunity to appeal to the Armenian  leadership and the nation to halt the senseless war. "As the  president of Azerbaijan, I guarantee safety to all Armenians who  reside in Nagorno-Karabakh and their equal rights with all other  citizens of Azerbaijan", he said.    The president noted that his country will never agree to be  dictated by force and will never "sign an agreement humiliating  for our people and state".</p>

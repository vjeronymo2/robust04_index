			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Union reform is test of Smith's leadership: The issue which will dominate next week's Labour party conference PASSION, intrigue and excitement will not be in short supply at next week's Labour party conference. The reason is summarised in an ugly little acronym, OMOV, which has big implications for the party and the unions that created it. The question of whether or not to exclude affiliated unions from the selection of parliamentary candidates at local level, in favour of one-member-one-vote, is a relatively minor constitutional matter - but one which has come to stand for much broader changes in the party/union connection. It is also the first big test of Mr John Smith's management of his party. If he loses the vote 'there is a serious problem for his leadership', as one union leader put it yesterday. The stakes, therefore, are high, and the votes may remain too close to call until they are cast on Wednesday morning. The union delegations, which account for 70 per cent of the votes compared with the constituency parties' 30 per cent, will by then have met for a second time and Mr Smith will have had a chance to sway them with his address on Tuesday. The least that Mr Smith must hope for now is that there is no clear majority for any of the three main motions opposing one-member-one-vote. That would make it easier for the leader to impose a solution if the reform itself fails to get a majority. The main obstacle is the alliance of the TGWU and the GMB - the two general unions - against the party leadership. Between them they account for nearly 30 per cent of conference votes. In the case of the left-led TGWU, this opposition is not surprising. In the case of the GMB, with its reputation for Labour loyalism and support for 'modernising' policies, it is much more surprising. According to fellow union leaders, the GMB's stance is down to one man - its general secretary Mr John Edmonds. A senior official in the GMB says: 'Mr Edmonds has never really found a secure niche in the union movement and he had a particularly uncomfortable time at this year's TUC congress, being shunned by the people who are normally his allies and feted by the leftwing dinosaurs.' Many reasons have been offered for Mr Edmonds' hostility to one-member-one-vote. Some say it stems from his union's belief that the proposal is the beginning of an attempt to push the unions out of the party. Others suggest it is a manoeuvre by Mr Edmonds to appeal to the dominant left of the TGWU with a view to winning the top job when the two unions merge in the next two years. Whatever the truth, the GMB's decision to oppose the reform caught the Smith camp by surprise earlier this year and threw their calculations into disarray. Mr Smith had made clear his support for one-member-one-vote when he was elected leader, with overwhelming union backing, last year. Mindful of trouble his predecessor Mr Neil Kinnock had on the issue, he handed the problem to a union/party committee. One insider says: 'It was then that the Smith office seemed to take its eye off the ball, heading back to Scotland for long weekends and there was a feeling that issues like one-member-one-vote would look after themselves.' By the time this year's union conferences came round the damage had been done. The union/party committee produced an inconclusive report. The unions were feeling under attack and started to see one-member-one-vote as the thin end of the wedge. Several key unions that normally would have supported the leader - the GMB'; Nupe, the former public services union; the UCW communication unions; the MSF manufacturing union; and Usdaw, the shop workers' union  - passed conference resolutions against the reform. Many constituency parties withdrew support under the influence of disgruntled union officials. In the past few weeks Mr Smith and Mr Murray Elder, his chief adviser, have come out fighting. One union leader who opposes the reforms says: 'I've been lent on more effectively by the supposedly hands-off Smith than I ever was by the hands-on Kinnock.' Mr Smith's powerful speech to the TUC on worker rights dispelled the idea that he was anti-union, and his acceptance that unions should retain a corporate presence in the election of the party leader has increased goodwill. It may be too little, too late. But with some subtle merging of motions, procedural manoeuvres, and a refusal by the TGWU delegation to back any motion but its own against one-member-one-vote, the leadership could scrape home.</p>

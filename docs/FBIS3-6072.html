"When do I stop? Later,  after I have accounted for my duties in five years. So, in  another five years I will stop," Suharto said in response to a  question at a national consultation meeting of the  government-sponsored Indonesian National Youth Committee. "I  have no ambition of becoming president for life," the  72-year-old head of state said.    Suharto urged qualified Indonesians to show the people their  accomplishments so that they could possibly be elected as  president by the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's  highest legislative assembly.    "Feel free to compete, who is the (nation's) best son and  has  the best performance, so as to be seen by the people," Suharto  said at the rare question and answer session at the presidential  office. He said that aspirants could come from officialdom, the  military or the civilian population.    Suharto laughed in response to a statement by one of the  youth committee members that the organisation wanted him to  serve another five-year term. "In that year (1998), how old  would I be?" he replied. "This should be taken into account. The  laws of nature prevail and should be taken into account.</p>

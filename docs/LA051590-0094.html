			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRANTLEY, LATTIMORE TO PLAY BASKETBALL FOR CSLA  </P> <P> Calling the offer a "great package deal," Granada Hills High point guard  Jermoine Brantley and forward Aaron Lattimore have signed letters of intent to  play basketball next season at Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Brantley, who led the Highlanders to a second-place finish in the City Section  4-A Division North Valley League, averaged 20.2 points, 9.0 assists and 3.8  steals.  </P> <P> A 5-foot-10 senior and a three-year letterman, Brantley set single-season and  career marks in assists and orchestrated a fast break that handed Cleveland its  only defeat in two years of league play. Brantley also considered walking on at  Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> "It's a great package deal for both of us," Brantley said.  </P> <P> Lattimore, who started at small forward, emerged as an inside and outside  threat last season, averaging 14.4 points and 10.2 rebounds. Lattimore (6-5) is  expected to play at off-guard at Cal State Los Angeles, a member of the  Division II California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> Lattimore said he received little interest from college recruiters until after  the season ended. Brantley said that Lattimore was spotted by the CSLA staff  during a recent postseason all-star game and that the staff asked Brantley to  forward film of his teammate.  </P> <P> "I was kind of wondering why nobody was looking (at me)," said Lattimore, who  plans to study engineering. "I knew I wasn't going to play inside, but I  thought I could play at two-guard."  </P> <P> So did CSLA -- which snared two guards at once.  </P></p>

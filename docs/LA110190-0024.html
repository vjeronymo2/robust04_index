			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Five rare birds were stolen from the San Diego Zoo in the third such animal  theft in 16 months.  </P> <P> Three golden conures and two hyacinth macaws, both parrot species, were taken  from the zoo's avian propagation center, said Jeff Jouett, a zoo spokesman.  </P> <P> The birds, native to the Amazon River rain forests in Brazil, all were hatched  at the zoo in the past year. They are worth more than $20,000, Jouett said.  </P> <P> A keeper arriving for work discovered the birds missing.  </P> <P> San Diego police investigators found parts of a lock that had been severed with  bolt cutters to gain access to a holding cage.  </P> <P> Jouett said zoo security patrols will be increased and locks will be changed at  animal enclosures throughout the zoo.  </P> <P> In June, 1989, two birds of prey were stolen in separate thefts. A rare African  milky owl and an African bateleur eagle were taken.  </P> <P> The birds lost in the earlier thefts have not been recovered.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, zoo officials said, they are concerned about the health of the  stolen birds, particularly one of the macaws that had not been fully weened.  That bird requires a special diet for the next several weeks.  </P></p>

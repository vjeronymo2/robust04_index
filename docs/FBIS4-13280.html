			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Shamgar Commission of Inquiry today heard  testimony from three Muslim worshipers, who were in the cave at  the time of the massacre. The first witness to appear told the  commission that he had heard shooting after Barukh Goldstein had  been beaten to the ground by Muslims in the cave. Steve Linde  has details:    [Begin Linde recording] The commission's hearings were  delayed by about an hour this morning, because the three Muslim  witnesses due to appear, arrived late. Soldiers apparently held  them up because they did not have the necessary permits to enter  Jerusalem from Hebron.    In nearly three hours of testimony, Hajj Ahmad Muhammad  complained about the behavior of Jewish worshipers in the Cave  of the Patriarchs, and gave a detailed account of the February  25 massacre. Muhammad said after the morning prayers began, he  heard two loud explosions, immediately followed by automatic  fire, at which point all the Muslims in the cave fell to the  floor. He saw the man with the case and earphones who had  fired, and saw Muslim worshipers who were standing behind him  attack him and throw him to the floor. [passage omitted]    Muhammad shocked the commission when he testified earlier  that on the night before the massacre, on the Purim holiday,  settlers had entered the cave drunk. He also said settlers had  urinated in the cave, but when pressed by the judges, said he  had only seen Muslim cleaners washing the floor afterwards.  Judge Eli'ezer Goldberg noted that the witness had not actually  seen what he was alleging, and he could not accept that Jews,  who regarded the cave as holy, would defecate inside.    The commission of inquiry has held 30 sessions and heard  testimony from some 100 witnesses. [end recording]    Two lawyers have petitioned the High Court of Justice to  suspend Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Zu'bi from the Shamgar  Commission. They say al-Zu'bi was quoted in the media as saying  settlers are the cruelest element in the territories.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (10): Downgradings can prove fatal - While ratings agencies are not as influential in assessing risk for trade deals as they are in the capital markets, there are times when they are able to influence a deal / Credit ratings / Market Studies, FT Exporter analyses credit issues, how the small UK exporter can penetrate foreign markets and profiles an Italian business Exporters who need to assess trade finance risks face similar problems to potential investors in emerging markets. Both are confronted with the need to know exactly how much should be paid for lending to countries where political and macroeconomic considerations have a strong influence over day-to-day commercial transactions. Both look to landmark deals to provide a benchmark for future lending rates. Both call on a variety of sources of information to help assess credit risk. The leading US ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's Investor Service, are an influential guide for investment bankers. They and other agencies are able to influence the pricing of trade deals - but not to the extent that their reputations in other sectors of the financial market would suggest. However, this could change as exporters, banks and credit insurers seek to further refine their risk assessment techniques. 'For trade financiers, ratings agencies are a factor, but only a minor one,' says the chief analyst of a leading London trade finance house. Generally 'bankers go by their own experience and that of other bankers in this market', he adds. For trade deals in eastern Europe and developing markets, many of the countries where trade financiers operate are not yet rated by the leading agencies. Some agencies, including IBCA, are trying to increase their ratings of sovereign risk in order to broaden the audience for ratings services. There are three ways that ratings can have an effect on trade deals: When trade-related lending is rated, through a deal being financed by a commercial syndication. This is not all that common, but when applicable it does set the price. J. P. Morgan Securities in New York has arranged a Dollars 110m export pre-financing facility to allow Altos Hornos de Mexico (AHMSA), a Mexican steel producer, to sell steel to a German buyer, Thyssen Handelsunion. The deal, in which Thyssen pays for its steel directly to an agent for the borrower, allows AHMSA to refinance part of its debt and modernise production. The loan has been syndicated in two tranches with pricing set in relation to the NAIC 2 and BBB- rating set by one of the smaller agencies, Duff &amp; Phelps. When a bond rating sets a benchmark. The appearance of newcomers, such as Slovenia, in the bond market can have an effect as trade financiers digest their ratings when pricing deals. This becomes most relevant when the bond is priced at a cheaper rate than that which the trade market has set. Among the established markets that are in line for new Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's ratings is Pakistan. The ratings will be incorporated in banks' wider perceptions of Pakistani risk, but they will not have a direct effect on trade deals, according to bankers. 'Pakistan is already an established trade finance market with most banks doing short-term - where the terms are tough,' the analyst says. 'A bond rating will only be part of a wider trend, especially as the ratings agencies do not affect a country's BIS weighting, which could change trade pricing,' he adds. When a country is downgraded. This is the time when ratings agencies can have the greatest effect on trade, as is well demonstrated by the problems facing Turkey, a major market. The Turkish experience of risk downgradings by Moody's and S&amp;P has been traumatic. The agencies first awarded investment grade ratings in 1992 as the Turkish treasury increasingly turned to bond issues to meet its sovereign borrowing requirements. As early as spring 1993, S&amp;P sent out warning signals of poor economic performance and Moody's followed in October by putting the country on 'credit-watch'. Downgradings from both agencies in mid-January then triggered a run on foreign exchange. Although the downgrades apply to bonds, they have contributed significantly to a decline in market confidence. The January 1994 crisis has spread to the rest of the economy, plunging industry into recession from boom conditions in 1993. The lira has, since the beginning of 1994, devalued by more than 50 per cent. Although by June stability was returning to domestic finances and an International Monetary Fund-led stabilisation programme is now in prospect, international confidence remains fragile. In early June, George Dallas, head of S&amp;P's sovereign ratings group, told a conference in Istanbul that it seemed unlikely that Turkey would be upgraded in the short-term - even though the country's fundamentally stong economy might restore ratings later. Deterred by successive downgrades, the international markets have closed to fresh lending to Turkey. This includes standard trade deals and especially the sort of pre-export financing so favoured by Turkish banks in recent years. Denied fresh inflows for refinancing or roll-overs, the banks have engaged in a race for lira liquidity in order to cover their foreign liabilities in one of the most open foreign exchange regimes in the world. There remains a huge demand for foreign exchange to finance trade deals. In spite of the domestic switch to lira, demand for foreign exchange liquidity from Turkish banks remains substantial, as one Istanbul banker puts it, availability of credit, not the price, is the issue for instruments such as letters of credit (l/cs). Obtaining these depends on relationships, rather than the market. From about 300-400 banks which participated in Turkish trade finance last year, only a core of about 40 are still active players. Forfaiting and factoring transactions have also dried up, as have leasing operations, notably when burdened by long-term fixed rates. Banks are wary about taking on new Turkish risk. In some cases they are still attracted to the country's longer term potential - as was signalled when in late June the treasury negotiated what was seen as a competitive rate in the circumstances for a six-year Euroloan, valued at DM 400-450m for the Cayhiran thermal power station. 'Turkey is a big economy and some deals may continue to go ahead,' says a European banker with a large portfolio of Turkish trade paper. 'But we have stopped: we pulled back when we saw what Standard &amp; Poors was saying.' The ratings agencies may be less influential in trade deals than in other markets. But when it comes to downgrades, their influence can be telling on the business environment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Forfaiting rates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Period            DM       USDollars                        years             %               %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AMERICAS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                   5       10 5/8         11 3/16 Brazil                      5            *               * Canada                      7       7 5/16               7 Chile                       5        8 5/8          9 3/16 Colombia                    3            *               * Mexico                      5       10 1/8              10 Uruguay                     1            *               * US                          7       7 5/16               7 Venezuela                   1            *               *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria                     7       7 5/16               7 Belgium                     7       7 5/16               7 Cyprus                      5        7 7/8          8 7/16 Czech Republic              5       10 5/8         11 3/16 Denmark                     5            7          7 9/16 Finland                     5            7          7 9/16 France                      7       7 5/16               7 Germany                     7       7 5/16               7 Greece                      3        8 1/4         8 13/16 Hungary                     5        9 5/8         10 3/16 Iceland                     3        8 1/4         8 13/16 Ireland                     5        7 1/8               7 Italy                       5        7 1/8               7 Malta                       5        8 3/8         8 15/16 Netherlands                 7       7 5/16               7 Norway                      5            7          7 9/16 Poland                      5       11 1/8              11 Portugal                    7       7 7/16         7 13/16 Romania                     1            *               * Slovakia                   -             -               - Slovenia                    5       10 1/8              10 Spain                       7       7 5/16               7 Sweden                      5            7          7 9/16 Switzerland                 7       7 5/16               7 Turkey                      -            -               - UK                          7       7 5/16               7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AFRICA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Morocco                     5       10 5/8         11 3/16 South Africa                3        9 1/4         9 13/16 Tunisia                     3        8 1/4         8 13/32 Zimbabwe                    1            *               *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA &amp;

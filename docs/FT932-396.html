			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Observer: Time for a new bruiser When the going gets tough, the messenger often gets used for target practice. President Bill Clinton was quick to replace his spin doctor when he ran into trouble and now there is talk that Gus O'Donnell, John Major's helpful press secretary and personal confidant, might be on the way out. A couple of weeks ago he was being blamed for everything that was going wrong. Now he is being accused of threatening to jump from the sinking ship of state. Yesterday he was trying to brush off the speculation about his future and said that he expected to remain in his post 'for some time'. However, one can understand why he might change jobs sooner rather than later. O'Donnell has long made it clear that he does not regard his current job as the apex of his career. Unlike his predecessor, Sir Bernard Ingham, O'Donnell has another career waiting. He is a successful economist, although his work on forecasting the balance of payments may have raised a few eyebrows. He could still be a contender for the top job at the Treasury. But given that he has turned 40 and has a young family, there is every reason to suggest he may return to the quiet Treasury life before the next general election, or even sooner if the right job arose. Who might replace him? Jean Caines and Adrian Moorey, chief flacks at the DTI and Home Office respectively, have been mentioned, as has Romola Christopherson at Health. All have good political antennae and a rapport with lobby journalists that would bring echoes of the professional abrasiveness of Sir Bernard. Indeed, there are plenty of Tory MPs who would like nothing better than to see the lobby correspondents roughed up a bit by an old pro like Sir Bernard.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Jobless 'unlikely to fall below 2.25m' UNEMPLOYMENT is unlikely to fall below 2.25m even when the recovery becomes established, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The employers' organisation is to present to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, with a list of proposals to help bring down the jobless total. These will include Skillfare, a project where young people out of work for more than a year are offered training.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan's economy appears to  have hit bottom, Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the  Economic Planning Agency (EPA), said Tuesday [7 Jun].    "It is too early to technically declare the economy has  reached bottom but my impression is that it has," Terasawa told  a press conference.    In view of recent economic indicators, the economy has  stopped deteriorating, the EPA chief said.    The comments came after the announcement earlier in the day  of the EPA's monthly economic report, which depicted a rosier  picture of Japan's economy by placing an emphasis on plus  factors although the term "sluggishness" is still used.    Terasawa said he has been encouraged by various economic  indicators recently showing a pickup in Japan's economy,  including April's industrial production.    But he said further evidence is needed for the EPA to  declare  officially that the recession is over.    As one dismal factor still shadowing the Japanese economy,  Terasawa cited the worsening employment situation, especially  companies' unwillingness to recruit college graduates.    The pessimism surrounding the labor market apparently has  served as a drag on the overall sentiment among corporate  managers, Terasawa said, voicing concern over its possible  effects on results of the Bank of Japan's quarterly business  confidence survey conducted in May and set for release Friday.    Terasawa said he expects massive public works projects and  6.2 trillion yen tax cuts to be implemented this year under the  latest pump-priming package.    He said he is confident that the economy will be put on "a  full-fledged recovery track" by the end of fiscal 1994.    The EPA's monthly economic report said, "the Japanese  economy  is showing bright signs in some sectors although it continues to  be generally sluggish."    Terasawa said this is an upward revision from last month's  description that "the economy continues to be generally sluggish  although it is showing some bright signs."</p>

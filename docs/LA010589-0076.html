			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday gave final approval to a program aimed at cleaning  up Azusa's rental housing stock, including annual inspections of all rental  units.  </P> <P> The program will require an $80,000 investment by the city, which will hire two  inspectors. There are about 6,500 rental units within Azusa, more than half of  the city's total housing stock.  </P> <P> Each landlord will pay a $30 annual registration fee for each rental complex,  and an additional $2 for each unit within the complex. Utility connections will  be withheld until the fees are paid, and landlords whose units are substandard  will pay fines, eventually making the program self-supporting, according to  city staff.  </P> <P> Another ordinance setting maintenance guidelines for property owners was sent  back to city staff for revision because of concerns that landscaping provisions  were too broad.  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Work resumes at privatised mine Miners who lost their jobs under British Coal's closure programme yesterday returned to work at their former pit in Nottinghamshire, reopened under private management. Clipstone Colliery near Mansfield is the first of 28 collieries offered by British Coal to the private sector to be formally handed over. The 140 miners who joined the first shift of the privatised regime yesterday promised to work 'harder than ever' to make the pit a success. Mr Richard Budge, chairman of RJB Mining, which has agreed an eight-year lease on the colliery from British Coal, said that the pay rates under which the miners had been re-engaged were comparable to those they achieved at British Coal. 'In some cases they are getting more working for us than at British Coal,' he said. Mr Budge said the company was introducing flexible working practices and multi-skilling, with fewer grades and less demarcation than existed under British Coal. RJB Mining operates three other mines in Cumbria and Scotland.</p>

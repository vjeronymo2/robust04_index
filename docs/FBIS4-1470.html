			<p>BFN     [Text] Tanzania has denied a media report that it is paying  little attention to Rwandan citizens being killed by government  soldiers. An officer of the Rwandan Patriotic Front reportedly  said that Tanzania has closed its borders with Rwanda, an act  which he said is unlawful against innocent Rwandan civilians who  are being killed. The story was carried by the Uganda DAILY  ROCKET on 25 April.    A statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation said the story on Tanzania closing its  border with Rwanda is baseless because large numbers Rwandan  citizens cross into Tanzania's Kagera Region almost daily. On  Tanzania's move to station troops alongside its border with  Rwanda, the statement said the action was taken to safeguard  Tanzanian citizens and their properties along the border. It is  not for any other purpose, the statement added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.1(2)&blank;Slope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (2) permits new public sidewalks to have the same slope as that established for adjacent roadways. It further limits cross slope along a new public sidewalk to 1:50. This maximum applies in both directions at intersecting public sidewalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The NPRM proposed that new public sidewalks have the least possible running slope. Commenters noted that this could be interpreted to require grading to a level plane. The NPRM also proposed an exception for slopes steeper than 1:12. Commenters favored excepting running slope limitations for public sidewalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This provision has been revised to clarify its intent to require the minimum feasible slope consistent with that of the adjacent roadway. Therefore, the proposed exception is no longer needed and has been eliminated. An appendix note discusses several design options for steeply sloping public sidewalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A number of commenters expressed concerns about pedestrian safety along steeply sloping public sidewalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Public sidewalks that meet the provisions of this section allow persons with disabilities to make the choice of whether to use them or not. This is consistent with other applications of the ADA, which clearly prohibit discrimination based upon assumptions about an individual's abilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Individuals with disabilities and commenters from organizations representing them strongly supported maintaining cross slope limitations at 1:50, emphasizing the difficulty of negotiating surfaces with cross and counter slopes. Travel along surfaces with a severe cross slope is difficult for persons using wheelchairs and mobility aids even when the running slope is imperceptible. However, many municipalities requested that exceptions be permitted, citing the infeasibility of achieving a maximum cross slope of 1:50 in alterations to existing construction in the public right-of-way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Limited exceptions from the requirement for a maximum cross slope of 1:50 have been included in the alterations section. The 1:50 maximum has been well-established in accessibility standards since 1961 and is also well-established in civil engineering standards as the minimum necessary for positive drainage for exterior improved surfaces. New development and adjacent public sidewalks should be planned with this limitation clearly in mind. Providing landings with a minimum cross slope at intersecting public sidewalks is standard design practice in new construction and will simplify the later placement of crossing controls and similar pedestrian elements that require a level area for a wheelchair approach. No substantive changes have been made in this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The NPRM asked whether level landings should be required along steeply sloping public sidewalks, citing a requirement in the California Accessibility Standards (title 24 part 2 section 712 (1989)) requiring landings at 400-foot intervals. Many persons with disabilities, organizations representing persons with disabilities, and even a few municipalities supported such a concept. Several noted that this could be accomplished without appreciably increasing the running slope of a public sidewalk. Others recommended level areas adjacent to and along public sidewalks of extreme grade. Such areas would allow persons with mobility impairments or low stamina to pause while ascending or descending. Most municipalities, however, responded negatively, citing excessive cost, custom construction, and limited utility. Several commenters recommended handrails as being more useful along steep slopes. Some commenters suggested that providing landings along steeply sloping sites would be less useful to persons using wheelchairs than would the development of alternative routes or operational solutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A requirement for a mid-block level landing where walkway slope is extreme would not be onerous in new construction. However, few commenters recommended specific public sidewalk slope limitations and interval criteria that would help establish provisions. Most new intersections will provide level landings at approximately 200-foot intervals. No provision for intermediate level landings along a public sidewalk has been included in the interim final rule. Operational considerations, such as the development of alternative routes, are not covered by these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The NPRM asked about local accommodation to extremes of terrain from jurisdictions where steeply sloping public sidewalks make accessibility difficult. Little specific information was received in response to this question, although almost every commenter was interested in possible solutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An appendix note has been added suggesting design and construction approaches for extremes of slope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Names promised new deal: Lloyd's reform package aims to strengthen rights of members Lloyd's of London yesterday paved the way for a further transformation of its capital base by providing for the possible operation of syndicates backed by a single corporate investor, effectively insurance companies, at the market. It has proposed a package of reforms which would strengthen the rights of individual Names, whose assets support the market. It has also suggested ways in which those Names continuing to trade may be able to obtain cash or shares in new corporate syndicates or other vehicles in exchange for their existing syndicate participations. 'The measures and proposals set out in this report maintain a programme of radical reform which we initiated a year ago,' said Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman. Lloyd's introduced Pounds 800m in new corporate capital last year. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said Lloyd's would consult on its proposals for 'transferring or realising value' for syndicate participations. 'The changes will have a profound and positive impact on the future of Lloyd's,' he said. The market does not intend to change rules limiting the amount of capital corporate investors can supply to syndicates. Single corporate Names can supply no more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity - the amount of premiums it can accept - while overall, syndicates can obtain no more than 50 per cent of their capacity from corporate Names. However, Mr Rowland said Lloyd's Council, the body that governs the market, could make exceptions and conceded that 'it is inevitable that at some point in the future we will revisit these regulations'. In its report Lloyd's said single corporate members, if introduced, would be able to adopt annual accounting - in contrast to the three-year system of existing syndicates. Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman and a keen supporter of the idea, said the new type of syndicate would allow managers 'complete stability of capital, and to retain earnings and plan long-term'. The establishment of single corporate members is one of three possible ways in which Names may be able to realise value from their participations. Lloyd's will also examine the feasibility of a market where participations can be traded, as well as the possibility that Names might sell a range of syndicate participations to an investor, in exchange for shares, other securities or cash. The plan makes no provision for Names unable to trade because of past losses, or for those who have already resigned or left the market. The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about 9,000 Names, welcomed the proposals and said that moves to introduce pre-emption rights and syndicate voting rights amounted to an 'important recognition of the inherent rights of Names'.</p>

Let's see what these powers are and what  political limits they have.    [Correspondent Cesare Pucci] The Ciampi government following  the dissolution of the chambers: Scalfaro rejected Ciampi's  resignation. Therefore, we have a government which juridically  retains all of its powers. Juridically means the government has  no constitutional limitations, only political ones. In other  words, Ciampi cannot make decisions behind closed doors that may  require a major discussion in parliament; and by the same  measure, he cannot make decisions that could interfere with the  electoral campaign. He can, on the other hand, draw up bills.  In this case, he is obliged to present them to parliament, which  in this case will remain in charge until a new one is sworn in,  within 10 days.    Therefore, we have a government which retains its full  powers, but which cannot influence the field of play when the  deciding match for the championship is being fought. It is in  fact this electoral match -- the first to be played under new  rules -- which the Italian people want to see played as quickly  as possible. They did this by approving the referendum issues  of 18 April [1993].    As Scalfaro wrote to the speakers of the chambers, this was  the main reason for the early dissolution of the parliament,  even if there was no government crisis.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / EC's era of openness strong on showbiz: Little substance emerges as foreign ministers' meeting is televised 'ALWAYS dispose of the difficult part in the title; it does less harm there than in the text.' Such was the advice of the ineffable Whitehall mandarin Sir Humphrey Appleby, from the BBC TV satire Yes, Minister, to a naive subordinate enthusiastic about open government. European Community foreign ministers were conceivably following his script yesterday when they inaugurated a new era of openness in Community decision-making, submitting to having the first part of their Council meeting televised for the first time. The televised proceedings were very much the 'titular' part. Ministers delivered speeches on the current Danish presidency's work programme. There was no debate and little substance, this being reserved very much for the 'textual' negotiations detailed mostly to ministerial subordinates who do most of the horse-trading on EC decision-making. Inside the chamber, it was the older troupers, familiar with showbiz, who performed most plausibly: Mr Douglas Hurd of the UK, patrician and authoritative; Mr Roland Dumas of France, feisty and combative; Mr Emilio Colombo from Italy, gesticulating elegantly and introducing the concept of 'original sin' to EC monetary policy; and Spain's Mr Javier Solana, who proved Spaniards will always get more of their oar in at such gatherings, because they can speak so much faster. They were able to memorise enough to face cameras, and proved masters of the 'There is no time here to discuss' ploy, both to evade substance and exceed their speaking time. Mr Hurd provided the high point of humour, brazenly bracketing the secretive British with the gapingly open Danes for 'arguing most forcibly for this experiment'. Newcomers scored on substance. Mr Piet Koijmans, Dutch foreign minister, called for a down-payment for the future' in democratising the EC by giving the European parliament equal decision rights now with the Council of Ministers, even before the Maastricht treaty enshrines these rights. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, made the one genuinely political contribution, highlighting the need for action on EC monetary policy after the weekend's devaluation of the Irish punt. Their interventions excited the fantasy that televised proceedings of the acrimonious September 1992 finance ministers' meeting in Bath, just prior to 'Black Wednesday', would have made compulsive viewing. For the future, however, viewers keen on openness should insist on a 'nuls points' score for those such as the Greek ministers, who spoke at length about Macedonia without once mentioning it, or for Mr Dumas who elegantly stuck the knife into Britain for 'poaching' a Hoover plant from Dijon to Scotland, but neglected to mention the UK. The haphazard system of leaks, briefings, corridor encounters and door-stepping will continue to be the basic mechanism for learning, haphazardly, about what ministers get up to in Brussels. Even if yesterday's performance were extended to all Council proceedings rather than 'work programmes' and yet-to-be-defined 'major issues', the corridor purveyors of information would still be in business, on yesterday's evidence.</p>

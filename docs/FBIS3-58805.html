Addressing the members of the American and Common Market  Club  (ACMC) in Brussels, European Commissioner Karel Van Miert  affirmed that apart from enlargement, ensuring the follow-up of  the Uruguay Round, and working in favor of the environment and  social dimension will be the three main challenges facing the  European Union in the near future. Moreover, he noted -- as  U.S. President Bill Clinton recently remarked -- that these  three objectives are now common to both Europe and the United  States.    The Belgian commissioner believes that the important thing  now is to convert the touchdown scored in GATT: "For instance,  the agreement does not guarantee any opening of the Japanese  market," he pointed out, highlighting that some obstacles  remain, which are not even of a regulatory or legislative  nature, but are rather of a "private," "psychological," or some  other nature. "The imbalance is flagrant and this is becoming  less and less acceptable," remarked Van Miert. "The Americans  have understood this clearly, and it is they who from time to  time turn on the heat vis-a-vis the Japanese partner."    On the other hand, the single market is far from being  completed, added the former chairman of the SP [Flemish  Socialist Party]. In the telecommunications sector: "A  substantial amount of time was lost on the Americans and the  Japanese." Even if there are only slight differences at the  technological level, the sector is characterized by considerable  tariff discrepancies, and both structural and organizational  divergence. Too many member states are still wrapped up in  their national monopolies, which constitutes a major  "comparative disadvantage." By the same token, in the air  transport sector -- where some are advocating a break -- there  can be no going back, and Van Miert stressed that "headway must  be made more rapidly," while at the same time asserting that "if  the single market had been in existence 10 or 15 years ago, then  it would have proven easier to emerge from the current crisis."  <H5>  Social Dumping </H5>   The single market is also hampered by competitive  devaluations and social dumping, to Van Miert's dismay: "If  certain member states begin to manipulate monetary or social  instruments, then we will find ourselves back in the situation  of a soccer match where some players only use their feet, and  others their hands, or head. That is the truth of the matter."  With respect to the dossier on the steel sector, some episodes  may only be described as "scandalous": "How can we negotiate,"  says Karel Van Miert rebelliously, "when each state has a right  of veto, and certain parties occasionally deny the reality  regarding the state subsidies which they are awarding?"    Nonetheless, the words of the former Commission vice  president (since the end of December, under the terms of the  Maastricht Treaty, there are now only two vice presidents in the  Community executive: Manuel Marin and Henning Christophersen --  L' ECHO editor's note) try to be optimistic. Whereas the  European Commission was in rather a bad way one year ago, Van  Miert maintains things have improved since then, especially by  virtue of the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the  adoption of a strategy for recovery, the conclusion of GATT, and  also thanks to the efforts of the Belgian presidency. In any  case, the European Commission has not been weakened by the  exercise involving the white paper. He observed: "It has been  proven that, when called upon to draw up certain texts or to  negotiate, the Commission can always be relied upon. Do you  think that the Germans would have accepted the British haggling  over GATT? Sometimes it is enough for a country merely to table  a particular document for it to be systematically rejected by  the others. That is why people turned to Delors for the white  paper." Furthermore, Mr. Delors will not hesitate to point  this out if there are attempts to "drown the fish," i.e., if the  document is not followed up.    "The Commission must seize the opportunities that present  themselves, without worrying about its popularity," concluded  Van Miert. "Do you know that during the negotiation of the Eko  Stahl dossier, the Germans from the eastern laender remarked to  us that before they were bound to follow the instructions issued  by Moscow, whereas now they are bound by those originating in  Brussels. Criticism was already being leveled at the Commission  at the time of General de Gaulle, and there are those who would  have liked to see it disappear back then. Which is rubbish,  because that would be tantamount to wiping out the entire  Community...."</p>

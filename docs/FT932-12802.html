			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Rise in start-ups reverses trend SMALL business start-ups increased in the first three months of this year, the first rise since the third quarter of 1991, says National Westminster Bank. A total of 95,000 new businesses began trading in the first quarter, an increase of 6 per cent on the final quarter of last year. This figure is still well below the quarterly number of start-ups in 1991 and early 1992 but it does mark the first signs of recovery within a significant sector of the economy and the labour market, the bank said. On average each new small business creates 1 1/2 jobs excluding the proprietor. The first quarter traditionally shows an improvement on the preceding final quarter. However, if forecasts for recovery in demand, output and consumer spending prove correct, the growth in business formation should be sustained, said Mrs Jane Bradford, head of NatWest small-business services. A total of 400,000 new businesses started last year, NatWest said. The bank, which claims 31 per cent of the small-business market, bases its figures on the new business accounts that are opened at its branches.</p>

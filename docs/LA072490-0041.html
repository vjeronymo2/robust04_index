			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: THE DAY THE STRAWBERRY BECAME KING  </P> <P> They came here last week, the strawberry moguls. They set up shop in an airless  banquet room, did their business quickly, and slipped out of town. No one  noticed except the manager of the hotel coffee shop, who spread some  strawberries around the tables to make the boys feel welcome.  </P> <P> Officially, it was the quarterly gathering of the California Strawberry  Advisory Board. What they did for two days was preside over a kingdom that they  have come to rule as surely as Carnegie once ruled steel. These men own the  world of strawberries. They represent a type of farmer/mogul that seems to  exist only in California -- there also being tomato moguls, lettuce moguls and  raisin moguls.  </P> <P> You might ask, doesn't Kansas have its wheat moguls and the answer is yes, of  course. But the Kansas wheat boys are forced to slug it out each year with  Nebraska and South Dakota. The kind of California mogul I'm talking about  doesn't slug it out with anyone. Anymore. All other competitors have been  reduced to a minor annoyance.  </P> <P> That's more true of strawberries than any other major crop, although it wasn't  always that way. Just how the strawberry farmers clawed their way to the top is  as much a California story as the discovery of gold.  </P> <P> We'll get to the story, but first some strawberry facts: Three out of every  four strawberries popped into someone's mouth in this country comes from  California. The runner-up state is Florida, and it produces about as many  strawberries over an entire season as California produces in one week.  </P> <P> At peak season, the strawberry numbers for California are almost beyond  comprehension. Growers here roll out 120 million pints every two weeks, or  roughly enough to put a pint on the table of every household in America.  </P> <P> We so often hear numbers like these in California that we become numb to them.  But 30 years ago, the numbers looked very different. California ranked 10th in  production, behind states like Tennessee and Arkansas. Strawberries were  regarded here as a hobby crop.  </P> <P> John Meichel rolled into Oxnard about that time, fresh off the boat from  Germany, and decided to grow strawberries because there was no competition. In  the entire state, about 350 acres were planted. "No one understood  strawberries," he says, "No one knew how to grow them right."  </P> <P> Back then, Meichel says, he botched it time and again. Bugs would get the  berries, plants would die from too much water or not enough. There was mildew  and root rot. Strawberries forgave no mistakes.  </P> <P> That was when farmers made the decision that would turn them into moguls. They  went to Sacramento and persuaded the state to establish the Strawberry Board.  The board was a quasi-government agency composed of farmers who had the  authority to tax every strawberry producer in the state.  </P> <P> In the beginning, the tax was a penny for every 12 pints of strawberries  produced. The board collected the money and poured it into the agriculture  departments at the University of California. Solve our problems, they said.  </P> <P> Soon, answers began coming back. Do this, don't do that. Try these new  varieties.  </P> <P> Most important, the researchers made full use of the enormous, natural  advantage of California. Back East, the peak season for strawberries was six  weeks. Here, it could be stretched to six months. So they developed strawberry  types that kept blooming again and again. Yields rose from 10 tons an acre to  15 tons and then 25 tons.  </P> <P> They also introduced the farmers to the world of chemistry. There were  treatments for every kind of bug, so many treatments that strawberries are now  regarded as the most chemically intensive crop in California.  </P> <P> So the success of the California strawberry has not been without its cost. The  strawberry moguls have become a target of the sponsors of Big Green, the  environmental initiative, and the moguls definitely feel the heat. They spent  half their time here looking at research proposals for new, benign bug killers.  </P> <P> And there are other problems. Success has attracted an abundance of first-time  farmers. So many new acres have been put into production that the old-timers  predict a coming shakeout.  </P> <P> But none of these men seriously thinks about quitting strawberries. They have  the swagger and confidence of farmers who believe they grow the trickiest, most  difficult crop on earth.  </P> <P> After the meeting ended, a vanload of moguls headed toward home. As the van  passed fields filled with new squash, one grower gazed at the fields and  remarked in wonder at their size.  </P> <P> His friend in the van never bothered to look. "Any bozo can grow squash," he  said.  </P></p>

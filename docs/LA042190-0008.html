			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BISHOPS' PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ABORTION  </P> <P> Novak simply misses the point regarding bishops and the abortion issue. What  the bishops are being criticized for is not their stand, which they are  entitled to, but their behavior.  </P> <P> Indeed, he carefully avoids mentioning issues like the denial of communion to  parishioners and the threatening of Catholic voters with divine retribution if  they don't vote the Vatican party line. How does Novak fit such behavior into  his model of "serious moral argument" conducted in a "rational and civil  manner?"  </P> <P> In the interest of civility, Novak might take a step away from his own style of  hyperbolic and specious argument. The Vatican and "rock videos, movies and  magazines" (whichever ones he means) are not the only available moral choices  -- tens of millions of non-Christian Americans reject both and yet live moral  lives. And if any comparison is to be drawn with slavery, it is that of women  as a class, on the basis of religious ideology, being denied the right of  reproductive choice.  </P> <P> Should Novak have his way, it will be the pro-choice side, not the Catholic  Church, running the underground railroads.  </P> <P> MICHAEL FARQUHAR  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

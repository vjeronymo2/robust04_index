			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland seeks urgency on trade talks MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday called on negotiators to redouble their efforts to conclude the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of global trade talks by the December 15 deadline. Addressing a stock-taking meeting of Gatt's overseer Trade Negotiations Committee, he said the overall picture was 'not a bad one' but much more needed to be done - urgently. He expressed particular concern about blockages in the negotiations on improving market access for imports of farm goods and textiles - both areas of critical interest for developing countries. Mr Sutherland said he had asked Mr Germain Denis, chairman of the market access negotiating group, to give these areas 'very special and urgent attention', and would intervene himself if necessary. 'A larger share of the responsibility for movement must lie with the major players,' he added. The director-general, who has been circling the globe to enlist support for the round from political leaders, said afterwards he would travel to Tokyo this month to meet Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and other senior ministers. Top of the agenda will be Japan's reluctance to liberalise its closed rice market, now emerging as an important obstacle in the negotiations on lowering trade barriers for farm goods. The trip will also include Singapore, where Mr Sutherland will meet ministers from the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Liberalisation of financial services markets in these countries is seen as critical to the success of negotiations in Geneva on market opening for foreign services. The timetable for the Uruguay Round talks, agreed last July, says the shape of the overall market access package for goods must be clear by mid-October, with a further month to complete detailed tariff schedules for each country. As of yesterday, 58 countries (the EC counting as one) had made comprehensive tariff offers. However, talks on lowering trade barriers for farm goods have been delayed by uncertainty over the future of the US/EC Blair House accord on agricultural subsidies. On industrial goods, Mr Sutherland said yesterday that the 'unfinished agenda', left over from last July's agreement on tariff cuts between the four leading traders, was holding up the negotiations.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Arts: A 'Giselle' of integrity - Dance Fighting the good dance fight, London City Ballet has embarked upon its autumn schedule of touring round the country. Denied the full subvention from the Arts Council that its work and its attainments should merit, LCB goes indomitably on. It is sustained for this season by ADT, which deserves the thanks of those many audiences - LCB gives about 200 shows each year, vastly more than certain other funded troupes - who would otherwise not see ballet. I admire LCB for its terrier-like persistence, but even more because its performances are so whole-hearted. The repertory is middle-brow, but then, so is much of its public. Its productions are not articles of grand luxe, but wild expenditure has little merit, as we know from some of the Royal Ballet's extravagant mishaps. (Remember Cyrano and Don Quixote). LCB strives to give its public the best that wit and necessary cheese-paring ('blessed poverty' said Karsavina of Rambert stagings in its earliest days) can provide. The result - as I saw in the Giselle, which is this autumn's touring fare - is pleasing. The staging is by Galina Samsova, made for the company nearly a decade ago. It is sound, un-pretending, telling the story and honouring the old choreography with decorum. Peter Farmer's setting is sensitive, and in the well-lit forest-scene, properly mysterious. Reduced for an ensemble of 35 dancers, the drama is honestly set out, and the supporting roles are played with an integrity that some larger companies might envy. (Beverly Jane Fry is a fine Bathilde, charming, but aware of her nobility; Gary Shuker is a Hilarion who wins our sympathy.) Standards of dancing are variable, but nothing is cheated. And in Kim Miller, whose interpretation I saw on Tuesday night, LCB has a remarkable Giselle. I reported on Miss Miller's debut in the role when this production was new. We now see a performer of beautiful and mature artistry. She has always been an expressive dance-actress, thrown to the wolves on occasion, as in the mad Traviata that LCB produced a few years ago, but true in whatever she has done. As Giselle, her every best gift is used. The first act peasant is trusting, gentle, her gaze ever turned to Loys (the sincere and credible Roger van Fleteren). Betrayal brings pain that is like his sword to her heart - this Giselle is piteous as she turns in accusation on Loys/Albrecht  -and then comes madness, shown by Miss Miller with absolute and absolutely touching clarity. Her performance is the motor force of the piece, and she makes the Romantic fervours of the second act very lovely. Physically, she has the melting arms, the softness of phrasing, that were so fascinating with Lynn Seymour in this role, and as with Seymour, everything she does has meaning. Her Wili-Giselle is a study in compassion set in long, creamy sequences of movement. The variation was exquisite in shape - the outline of the foot and the musical lift to the steps its especial distinction. The duet (van Fleteren a devoted partner) was emotionally and physically true. Miss Miller is a Giselle of real authority and real grace. I liked Roger van Fleteren's Albrecht, and I liked him most as he responded to his Giselle in the second act - the old story became urgent again. The attendant wilis were well-schooled. The performance, and here is the value of LCB's policies, stimulated and delighted its audience. Giselle is given with a neo-classic curtain-raiser, Vincent Redmon's Counterbalance. It involves two Vivaldi violin concerti, and steps as scratchily active. The cast look as if they are trapped in a spin-dryer. London City Ballet is in Bromley until the end of this week, then tours to High Wycombe, Croydon, Brighton until the end of November with Giselle. Sponsorship for the year is given by ADT.</p>

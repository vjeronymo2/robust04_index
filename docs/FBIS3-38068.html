According to his  colleagues he is one of the most successful intelligence  officers and has recruited at least four superspies, one of them  an agent who is mentioned in this commentary.    [TRUD] Aldrich Ames is not the first agent to be exposed but  he is the first whose exposure has merited comment at the very  highest level. Why is that?    [Solomatin] I was in intelligence work for 37 years, I was  the resident in India and Italy and twice in the United States  (1965-1968 and 1971-1975), and I could quote many examples.    The Soviet Union did not react officially to the exposure of  Penkovskiy, Tolmachev, Yuzhin, and others who worked  successfully for the Americans. FRG Chancellor Brandt left  office because a close aide of his turned out to be a GDR  intelligence officer. Even that well-known expert on Russian  folklore, President Reagan, did not presume to respond  officially in 1985 to the report that for 17 years the Russians  had a U.S. spy (it would be nobler to call him an agent) with  whose help we were able to fully monitor top-secret  communications traffic [perepiska] between nuclear submarines,  the main component of the U.S. atomic triad. As for the damage  caused to U.S. security by that agent, U.S. specialists have  noted that in the event of war -- which heaven forbid, of  course! -- the scales could have been tilted in our favor. It  is with good reason that they called him the agent of the  century. Furthermore, at the very top in our country there were  people who were seriously afraid of a sharp reaction from the  United States in the event of that agent's arrest. But there  was no official reaction. All that happened was that  journalists in the United States published four thick volumes  and a few movies were made.    [TRUD] Evidently something has changed in relations between  us if the arrest of an agent has become the grounds for  political statements.    [Solomatin] I believe that we have begun to assess ourselves  and each other differently. From being equal powers whose  intelligence services worked against each other we have been  transformed into a country which has to ask permission to do  this now.    I believe that this began when we started to surrender and  abandon our positions without a fight and with a certain degree  of enthusiasm. The blame for this rests largely on Gorbachev  and his unprofessional clones Bakatin in the KGB and Pankin at  the Foreign Ministry. After the Cold War ended something  occurred in our country which happens when you clean out the  sewers: At the top there were so-called state figures who  decided that the time had come to look after their own affairs  at the expense of the state's interests. These and other "great  guys" set about the destruction-cum-"reformation" of state  security and first and foremost the intelligence service. They  finally found a scapegoat, the cause of all our failures. But  it is already clear now that the real "goat" in the form of the  old party-administrative hierarchy is still alive and well and  sends us all a greeting. The reform of the state and of the  security system ended in failure. I recall how when they  completed the reform in our country they entered the  international arena and invited the gentlemen in the West to  reciprocate by abandoning intelligence work themselves. The  reply was an intensification of intelligence work in the  republics of the former USSR.    But when journalists, in the course of earning their daily  bread, tried to obtain information about this they invariably  heard the reply -- "we do not comment on intelligence and  counterintelligence operations." In the United States they have  progressed not just to commentaries but also to statements by  the president on this question, a routine question as far as  intelligence work goes and even more so when viewed in the  context of history.    Clinton has full access to a short 1975 study by the "Rand  Corporation," the think tank of the U.S. Air Force, which talked  about the possible impact of the successes and failures of the  intelligence services on interstate relations. The specialists'  conclusion was this: This cannot have a particularly  significant impact on relations between states.    Some people are trying to link the inappropriate U.S.  [neadekvatnyy] reaction to our so widely publicized diplomatic  action over Sarajevo in which Russia outdid the United States.  I do not believe that. In my view what we are dealing with  today is a typical recurrence of imperial thinking in the United  States, a criticism which those people, incidentally,  ceaselessly level at us. It is all quite simple: We can, you  cannot. We can because we have the money. Whereas you have an  outstretched hand. We can because our pockets are full, yours  are empty. You may be a power if you want to but it must be  within the confines of your own Russia. Beyond that it is us  and our interests.    I think that the Americans did not give it much thought when  they embarked on this scandal. They overlooked at least two  possible consequences.    First, in Europe, where I also worked and I know how  arrogantly U.S. intelligence agents behaved toward their  European colleagues (toward the Italians, for example), this  fuss will make many specialists smile: For decades, they will  say, you never tired of lecturing us or of criticizing us  because we are bad at keeping our secrets and because KGB agents  take them away by the sackload and now you yourselves have  allowed this embarrassment to occur.    Second, when Russia itself looks into the mirror of this  story it will suddenly see that the big bucks which are being  spent on intelligence are "working." And we will realize the  importance of intelligence work to the state and will begin to  organize it properly.</p>

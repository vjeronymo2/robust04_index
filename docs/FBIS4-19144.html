			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "La Malfa: `Joint Lists for European </F> Elections'"]    [Text] Joint lists for the upcoming European elections.  This is the proposal made by PRI [Italian Republican Party]  Secretary Giorgio La Malfa to AD [Democratic Alliance], PSI  [Italian Socialist Party], and Marco Segni's Pact for Italy  yesterday. In a letter addressed to Ferdinando Adornato (AD),  Ottaviano Del Turco (PSI), Guiliano Amato, Segni, and Vsalerio  Zanone (Pact), La Malfa maintains that these forces "already  have widely common program positions on foreign policy and  Europe in particular" and that in the economic area "there is a  similarity of positions that could be called the third road  between unrestrained free enterprise and the nostalgia of state  intervention in every part of national life." La Malfa is  requesting a decision by the end of the week, given the very  limited time available ("the symbols must be presented on 24  April and the lists the first week of May") and is therefore  proposing a committee of representatives from each group to  define the lists of candidates and to draw up a program.    Del Turco responded that, although he considers the issue  presented by La Malfa as being "of great political importance"  referring to "the role that the center intends to play," he  refuses any possibility of "electoral short cuts of a  third-force type." Del Turco affirms that the building of a  third "team" will not impede the new majority in the country.  The opposition, the PSI leader maintains, should be "formed  around a strong center-left alliance."</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALVESTON OIL SPILL WASHES ASHORE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: WILDLIFE OFFICIAL SAYS MARSHLANDS COULD BE DEVASTATED, BUT THE  COAST GUARD CALLS THE SITUATION 'MANAGEABLE.'  </P> <P> Oil from a huge spill in Galveston Bay began washing ashore Tuesday,  threatening an environmentally sensitive shoreline that is the nesting place  for thousands of birds and also one of the prime fisheries along the Texas  coast.  </P> <P> More than 500,000 gallons of oil have escaped into the bay since a tanker-barge  collision Saturday, and one state parks and wildlife official said the danger  was such that the marshlands could be devastated.  </P> <P> "It's heading toward worst case," said Larry McKinney, the director of the  resource protection division of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Division. "What is  happening is as bad as we could ever predict."  </P> <P> However, others took exception to that gloomy outlook, including U.S. Coast  Guard Rear Adm. James Loy, who flew over the bay Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Loy said the spill looked like a "very manageable situation."  </P> <P> "I think we have a pretty good handle on the environmentally sensitive areas,"  he said at a midafternoon press conference. "My aerial observation did not give  me that same sense of foreboding."  </P> <P> Cleanup crews were using five skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck to suck up oil  contained by thousands of feet of booms.  </P> <P> The oil spill is the second within the last two months to affect the Galveston  Bay area. The first was an explosion aboard the tanker Mega Borg on June 9. The  tanker burned out of control for days and almost 4 million gallons of oil were  spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. For a time, it appeared the Mega Borg might  eclipse the Valdez disaster because it carried three times more oil than the  Exxon tanker that ran aground off the coast of Alaska.  </P> <P> The accident Saturday occurred when two of three barges being pushed by a tug  boat collided with a tanker in the Houston Ship Channel, a deep trench that  cuts through Galveston Bay. First indications were that it was a relatively  minor spill. But late Monday afternoon, the Coast Guard revised its estimate to  500,000 gallons after divers discovered that damage to one of the barges was  much more severe that originally believed. No oil has spilled since Monday  evening, the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> What worried environmental experts about the bay spill was that it was already  so close to the shoreline. At midafternoon, the sheen from the spill was more  than eight miles long and four to five miles wide.  </P> <P> Adm. Loy said Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene, the federal on-site coordinator,  said the oil had washed ashore in some portions of the bay and that there had  been some reports of birds that were covered with oil.  </P> <P> At least 100 bird species, including the endangered brown pelican, and at least  75 kinds of fish inhabit the Galveston Bay area.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a spokesman for state Lands Commissioner Garry Mauro said that Texas  must improve its response time to these potentially disastrous spills. Mauro  has been urging such preparations since the Exxon Valdez disaster.  </P> <P> "Garry has been hollering about a preparedness plan all this time, but it's not  there," said spokesman Jeff Long. "No one has ever put it together. The  response has been slow and we're real unhappy."  </P> <P> David Hankla, the Houston-area field supervisor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Department, said one of the problems is the proximity of wildlife to the heavy  industry of the Houston Ship Channel.  </P> <P> "We're trying to make all of it mix and match together, to maintain a  productive system for the long term, but it's not easy," he said. "On this  spill, we're just holding our breath."  </P> <P> At his press conference, Loy also announced that the ship channel was to reopen  Tuesday afternoon. The channel's closure was costing shippers about $1.5  million a day.  </P></p>

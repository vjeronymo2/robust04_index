			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Can lessons be drawn from 'Carter Bonds'? The UK Treasury's foreign currency borrowing operation has an interesting precedent in the 1970s in the US, where foreign currency bonds designed to help defend the dollar were dubbed 'Carter bonds'. Between October 1978 and January 1980, the US issued Dollars 6.4bn of Carter bonds, of which Dollars 5.2bn were denominated in D-Marks and Dollars 1.2bn in Swiss francs, sold only to legal residents of Germany and Switzerland respectively. Can any lessons be drawn from the US experience? The dollar did rally, but only temporarily and not necessarily as a result of the Carter bond programme: during the summer of 1978, the discount rate was lifted several times in conjunction with the Carter package. Even then, most economists believe it was the imposition of tighter monetary policy which finally helped support the dollar. '(Carter Bonds) do not serve as a model because the US has never been in the position of the tail wagging the dog - where currency strength is the single most important factor, superceding the domestic economy,' said Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at SG Warburg.</p>

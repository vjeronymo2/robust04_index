			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE, BUT SOMEONE MUST MAKE IT;  </P> <P> ANGELS: RADER HAS TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE SCHOFIELD'S REPLACEMENT AT SHORTSTOP.  IT LOOKS AS IF ANDERSON HAS THE EDGE.  </P> <P> Choosing between Kent Anderson and Mark McLemore to replace the injured Dick  Schofield at shortstop is a tough call, one that Angel Manager Doug Rader is  considering carefully. And he's not about to narrow the field just yet.  </P> <P> "Those are our two options," Rader said. "The third is Mother Teresa."  </P> <P> Her good deeds may make her eligible for sainthood, but what kind of range does  she have?  </P> <P> "Not too good laterally ," Rader said, "but vertically, she's outstanding."  </P> <P> In that field of three, Anderson may have an edge because, as Rader has pointed  out, Anderson was the Angels' shortstop during much of the time they spent atop  the American League West last season. Anderson helped himself Friday when he  went three for four with a run batted in in a 15-7 rout of the Chicago Cubs at  HoHoKam Park.  </P> <P> To Rader, it's more than sheer coincidence that Anderson started at shortstop  when the Angels were in first.  </P> <P> "There were so many variables, it's impossible to determine why. The only thing  we need to concern ourselves with is fact," Rader said. "You think of a lot of  things -- whether we were getting enough hitting, was the pitching staff doing  well. But the bottom line is that we were in first place when he played there."  </P> <P> Anderson downplayed his part in the Angels' early success.  </P> <P> "I had an opportunity to do well, and as a fill-in type of player, winning is  the key," said Anderson, who also played three games at second base, three at  third base, one in right field and one as the designated hitter. "It's just too  bad we couldn't stay in first. We had a pretty good year all year long, but we  had some unfortunate injuries."  </P> <P> He would gladly play second if asked, but Anderson acknowledged that shortstop  is his preference. He might get time at both positions, one of the many  interchangeable pieces Rader has in the infield puzzle.  </P> <P> "I've always played mainly short and I'm more comfortable there," said the  26-year-old native of Florence, S.C. "I like playing anywhere. Wherever they  tell me to play, I'll go. . . . Any time you have players who can fill  different spots, the better it is for the team. The more variety, the better  off you'll be in the long run. A 162-game season is long."  </P> <P> Anderson has always been solid defensively, a trait that Rader, a five-time  Gold Glove winner at third base, weighs heavily. "He's an average, steady major  league shortstop, which should be appreciated," Rader said. "It takes talent to  do that."  </P> <P> Anderson knows his chances would be better if he can refine his offensive  talent. He hit .229 in 86 games last season, and his professional best was .279  at Class-A Palm Springs in 1986.  </P> <P> "I think I need to pick it up at the plate, and if I'm playing until Schoey  gets (sound), I think the year's experience I had will help me," he said. "As  far as team offense (goes), I think we've got some good pitching, and good  pitching will stop good hitting. We've got to go out and try to win a lot of  1-0 games."  </P> <P> Mark Langston was effective Friday in his second start, pitching four solid  innings and earning his first victory. He gave up five hits and two runs, both  on Rick Wrona's third-inning home run to left field.  </P> <P> "I was able to concentrate a little more on throwing strikes today," said  Langston, who gave up one run in two innings in his previous start last Monday.  "I threw 44 pitches today, which was the same I threw in two innings the other  day. I wanted to throw strikes and get ahead of guys. Then I just let the  unbelievable defense (do it)."  </P> <P> The Angels pounded Cub starter Rick Sutcliffe for eight hits and eight runs in  1 1/3 innings and had 19 hits overall. Their only home run was Ron Tingley's  three-run shot in the seventh, which sailed 350 feet down the line in left.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> In Friday's other split-squad game, Mike Witt pitched 3 2/3 innings -- and  singled in the third inning -- and Lee Stevens had a three-run home run as the  Angels defeated the San Francisco Giants, 10-4, at Scottsdale. The two  victories gave the Angels a 4-2 record.  </P> <P> Having seen all his starters in at least one outing, Manager Doug Rader said  the lockout may have affected Jim Abbott more adversely than any other starter.  He said Bert Blyleven had the most arm strength and noticed that Mark Langston  made a dramatic improvement in that area from his last start to Friday's. . . .  "(Today) down in Tucson is a very important game for Jim," Rader said. "The  gains Langston made in four days, hopefully Jim will, too. Of all our pitchers,  (Abbott) is the one who's suffering the most. His arm strength isn't good right  now. He needs to locate the ball much better against left-handed hitters and  develop an off-speed pitch, whether that's a slower curveball or a changeup."  </P> <P> Langston said he never thinks about his $16-million contract when he's on the  field, but fans haven't forgotten it. He took some ribbing about his new wealth  in Yuma, during the Angels' four-game series against the San Diego Padres.  "There weren't many people there," he said, "and I heard one person, when I  went to pick the ball up and it fell out of my glove, say, 'That's a $3-million  error.' I heard it when I wasn't making this kind of money, but I was just a  bum then, and now I'm a $3-million bum."  </P> <P> Abbott, Rich Monteleone, Cliff Young and Jeff Richardson are scheduled to pitch  today against the Cleveland Indians in Tucson. In the other split-squad game,  Kirk McCaskill, Greg Minton, Bob McClure and Bryan Harvey will pitch against  the Oakland Athletics in Phoenix. . . . The Angels set a team record for season  tickets, 18,517. They sold 18,513 in 1987.  </P></p>

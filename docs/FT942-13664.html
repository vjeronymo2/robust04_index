			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Mortgage lending Hard on the heels of Lloyds Bank's bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester comes another piece of bad news for the building societies. March statistics show a net outflow of retail funds nearly as high as the record of Pounds 673m posted for September 1986. Still, it would be wrong to exaggerate the squeeze facing the societies. The Lloyds/C&amp;G merger will not actually happen until mid-1995. Had it not been for withdrawals for early payment of fuel bills, the March figures would have looked very different. There is less incentive for savers to desert building societies now the equity market tone is uncertain. The prospect of a long list of early casualties from a mortgage price war thus looks remote. The societies have ample room to meet mortgage demand through a combination of wholesale funding, interest credited to sav-ings accounts and repayments of existing loans. This has allowed them to win back share from the banks this year, albeit from a low base in 1993. The stock market's reaction to the Lloyds deal in marking down Abbey National by a further 3 per cent yesterday also looks distinctly overdone. Competition for mortgage lending is undoubtedly strong, but the original attraction for many banks was the abnormally high margins on offer. Their enthusiasm could wane as quickly as it arose if these margins come under too much pressure.</p>

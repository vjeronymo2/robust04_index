			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER, MISSING GIRL REUNITED FOR CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles court interpreter was reunited for the holidays with her  13-year-old daughter, eight years after the girl was allegedly kidnaped by her  father from the woman's Burbank home.  </P> <P> "I have not celebrated Christmas since she left," Rosemary Levi said, breaking  into tears as she recounted the loss of her daughter, Monica Judith Bonilla. "I  have not celebrated Mother's Day since she left."  </P> <P> Monica was 5 when her father, Guillermo Bonilla, allegedly took her from Levi's  Burbank residence on Sept. 22, 1982.  </P> <P> They were reunited Monday after a television viewer alerted authorities that he  had seen a picture of a kidnaped girl on the program "America's Most Wanted"  whom he believed to be Monica.  </P> <P> He was mistaken. The report was about another girl resembling Monica. But the  tip led authorities to the girl and her father on Point Roberts, a small island  near the U.S.-Canadian border in Washington state, the Los Angeles district  attorney's office said.  </P> <P> Monica had been given another name and was told her mother was dead.  </P> <P> Bonilla, 43, was being held in Bellingham, Wash., awaiting extradition and  arraignment Wednesday in Los Angeles on a charge of parental child abduction,  the district attorney's office said.  </P> <P> Since the kidnaping, Levi remarried and had a son, now 6.  </P> <P> She said she has spent $20,000 hiring detectives to try to find her daughter.  </P> <P> "I'm the happiest mother in the world," Levi said Monday.  </P> <P> "God has sent back my daughter. She was found by accident, but I don't believe  in accidents," she added.  </P> <P> Levi has moved from Burbank to "somewhere in the Los Angeles area," the  district attorney's office said, declining to reveal a more specific location  for the sake of security.  </P> <P> "I love my family," Monica told a news conference, after meeting her half  brother.  </P> <P> "I've got a little brother. He's sweet. I was happy before, and I am still  happy."  </P> <P> Asked what she wanted for Christmas, Monica said, "I'd like an M.C. Hammer  tape." Then, hugging her mother and half brother, she said, "And I already got  these guys."  </P></p>

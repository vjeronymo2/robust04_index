			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Trade deal lifts dollar The US dollar briefly climbed above the Y100 level in London trading yesterday as the currency initially benefited from the weekend announcement of a partial US-Japan trade deal, writes Philip Coggan. However, the dollar's momentum was halted by the National Association of Purchasing Managers' report, which showed the prices component at a six-year high. This hit the US Treasury bond market, which has been one of the main driving forces behind the dollar's weakness in recent months. The dollar closed in London at Y99.82, almost Y1 higher than Friday's close of Y98.97. Against the D-Mark, the US currency improved to DM1.5573, from DM1.5515 on Friday. The weakness of the US Treasury bond market caused the dollar to give up some of its gain in New York trading, which it finished at Y99.55 and DM1.5540. The pound was stronger against the D-Mark, helped by continuing uncertainty about the electoral prospects of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition partners, the FDP. Sterling rose through DM2.4520, seen as a key resistance level by technical analysts, to close at DM2.4574 in London, up more than a pfennig from Friday's DM2.4468. But the pound only edged up against the dollar, ending at Dollars 1.5780 from Friday's Dollars 1.5770. The weekend announcement of a partial US-Japan trade deal relieved some of the worries that had hypnotised the foreign exchange markets throughout much of last week's trading. The deal only covered the issues of government procurement, insurance and glass, and not the much more important automobile sector. Accordingly, the deal may have little impact on the US's trade deficit with Japan. Furthermore, the US has said it will start to investigate Japan's replacement car parts market under Section 301 of its trade law. Some traders accordingly doubted whether the deal would be strengthened in the long term. The dollar did rise sharply in the morning, briefly passing the Y100 level, with the help of rumoured hedge fund buying. But signs that the dollar may not get any permanent benefit from the deal came in the afternoon when the US currency fell back on publication of the NAPM report. On top of the bad news on prices, a rise in the employment component of the NAPM report strengthened expectations that the non-farm payroll figure, due to be published on Friday, will be strong. That would increase pressure on the US Federal Reserve to raise rates. Although higher short-term rates are normally positive for a currency, that factor is far outweighed by the negative impact stronger economic growth has been having on the Treasury bond market. The key 30-year Treasury bond was down half a point, yielding 7.86 per cent, in London trading yesterday. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said: 'The dollar/Treasury relationship may have weakened, but we doubt that it has broken and we look for further bond market weakness to drag the dollar lower.' Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said that in spite of the uplift from the trade deal, 'investors have got to overcome some nervousness regarding the dollar's fundamentals'. However, Mr Mike Norman, publisher of the Economic Contrarian Update in Geneva, argues that 'we are in the process of seeing a major turn in the dollar'. He believes this could be very important for world bond markets since a dollar rise would quell inflationary fears in the US. Most European currencies were stronger against the D-Mark which, according to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, 'is going to remain soft until the election is out of the way; at the moment, the polls appear to suggest that Kohl could have some difficulty in forming a new government'. The lira managed a small gain against the D-Mark - finishing at L1,005 from Friday's L1,006 - in spite of renewed fears about the prospects of Italian Budget passage. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided cumulative help of Pounds 818m to relieve an Pounds 800m shortage. The Bank's earlier forecasts of the shortage had been Pounds 750m and Pounds 700m. Overnight rates moved within a range of 7 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent. Short sterling contracts fell in the wake of figures showing a sharp rise in the annual rate of growth of M0, the narrow measure of the money supply. Although some analysts argued that the figures were merely a statistical blip, markets evidently felt that the pace of M0 growth, one of the Bank of England's inflationary indicators, made a further rise in base rates more likely. At the close, the December short sterling contract was trading at 93.16, indicating that markets expect a full percentage point increase in base rates, from the current level of 5.75 per cent, before the end of the year.</p>

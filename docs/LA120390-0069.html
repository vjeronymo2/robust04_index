			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESCUERS FREE 5 HIKERS STUCK ON LOFTY LEDGE  </P> <P> What looked like a short cut down a mountainside in Placerita Canyon State Park  led to a 125-foot-high ledge where three women and two boys were trapped for an  hour Sunday before being rescued by firefighters, authorities said.  </P> <P> After frantic calls for help to park visitors below, the stranded hikers were  carried to safety.  </P> <P> No one was injured, said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Don Heflin.  </P> <P> "There was definitely the possibility that we could have fallen straight down,"  said a relieved Judy Bakenhus, 30, of El Sereno. "I was definitely frightened."  </P> <P> Rescued with Bakenhus from the area east of Newhall were her friends Margaret  Suarez of El Sereno and her son Alan Vasquez, 4, and Yvonne Duran of San  Gabriel and her son Javier Garcia, 4.  </P> <P> Bakenhus said the group was following a hiking trail about 1 p.m. when it  turned onto what authorities said was a narrow animal path that eventually led  to the ledge on the 45-degree slope.  </P> <P> The group was unable to backtrack because the soil was too slippery and loose,  she said.  </P> <P> The hikers yelled and waved their arms to attract attention.  </P> <P> A Fire Department helicopter crew found the hikers and landed about 300 yards  above the ledge.  </P> <P> Firefighters lowered themselves onto the ledge with ropes and carried the  hikers to safety.  </P> <P> Bakenhus said the adults were more frightened than the boys.  </P> <P> "They just kind of understood that we were stuck there and that we were just  going to have to wait," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] People can no longer tolerate the ups and downs of  economic stabilization plans. This rejection was emphasized in  last week's poll by InformEstado, which revealed that 82 percent  of those polled want the next government to continue with the  real plan. Only 6 percent want the plan discontinued, while 12  percent said they did not know what they want. Among those who  support continuation of the plan, irrespective of who wins the  presidential elections, the majority (65 percent) believe that  the next president should respect the plan in its entirety,  while only 17 percent said that the plan should be only  partially continued.    There is considerable support for the plan: 68 percent of  those polled back the real. Support for the real increases  among members of higher social classes, going from 50 percent  for class D to 82 percent for class A. By age, the plan  obtained its strongest support from people between 41 and 50.  The lower the educational level, the higher the indifference  and the higher the number of people claiming to be "neither  against nor in favor."    For 58 percent of those polled, the plan will succeed --  although partially -- as was noted by 32 percent of this group.  Pessimistic answers were given by 26 percent, who said the plan  will fail (16 percent do not know). Despite the optimism  concerning the plan, the people polled were entirely distrustful  when asked about price increases. The majority -- 72 percent --  believe that prices will continue to increase. Expectations  over government-set prices are not better: 58 percent believe  the government will also continue to increase prices.</p>

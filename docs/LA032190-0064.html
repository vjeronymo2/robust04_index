			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP TV ADS FOCUS ON DEATH ROW, WILL AIR TODAY  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp joins the battle of the advertising airwaves  tonight with a commercial that brashly credits him with keeping San Quentin's  Death Row full to the brim. The lagging Democratic contender is the last of the  big-three would-be governors to undertake an advertising campaign in this state  where media advertising is crucial.  </P> <P> The 30-second television commercial presents Van de Kamp as a champion of four  issues that have emerged as important elements of his campaign -- gun control,  the death penalty and his ballot initiatives on the environment and  governmental ethics.  </P> <P> Campaign manager Richard Ross described the elements of the commercial on the  eve of its airing in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Next, it is to  spread to San Diego and the state's lesser television markets.  </P> <P> Most eye-catching and eyebrow-raising is the commercial's reference to the  death penalty and its background footage of the gas chamber. The announcer  declares that as two-term district attorney of Los Angeles County and two-term  attorney general of California, Van de Kamp "put or kept 277 murderers on Death  Row," virtually its entire condemned population.  </P> <P> This presumably has two goals: To catch the rising wave of public attention on  the death penalty, now that California's first contemporary execution is  scheduled to occur in two weeks. Also, it is to show that Van de Kamp is  hard-line on the emotional subject even while critics seek to fault his  personal opposition to capital punishment.  </P> <P> One of Van de Kamp's most dramatic campaign moments so far was his appearance  last year before the state Assembly with an AK-47 rifle as he argued for a ban  on assault rifles. This event introduces the commercial, and the announcer  notes that Van de Kamp was sued by the National Rifle Assn. for his efforts.  </P> <P> The commercial says that Van de Kamp is sponsor of a major environmentalist  ballot proposal to crack down on "cancer-causing pesticides" and to protect the  coast. The on-screen image for viewers shifts to Time magazine, which uses the  nickname 'Big Green" for the measure.  </P> <P> Finally, the advertisement mentions Van de Kamp's sponsorship of an  ethics-in-government initiative, which would limit the terms of office for  state politicians.  </P> <P> The tag-line or slogan is: "Take a stand -- John Van de Kamp."  </P> <P> Commercials are being watched extra closely this year because of the early  success achieved by Van de Kamp's Democratic rival, Dianne Feinstein. She went  on the air first with a powerful biographical commercial just at a time when  Van de Kamp's campaign seemed to lose its focus. The result was dramatic -- she  surged ahead in the polls and he slipped badly. Feinstein still remains on the  air in smaller markets.  </P> <P> Republican Pete Wilson, the two-term U.S. senator who has no serious opposition  for the GOP nomination, nonetheless joined the advertising fray last week with  a 60-second biographical spot. It also remains on the air.  </P> <P> So far, all the candidates are following the conventional political advertising  path. That is, their opening ads seek to define their own campaigns. Next down  this path, the candidates can be expected to switch to the attack.  </P></p>

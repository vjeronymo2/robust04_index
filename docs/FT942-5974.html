			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Unions see Beckett as only challenger to Blair Union leaders believe Mr Tony Blair is virtually unstoppable in the election for the next leader of the Labour party - with Mrs Margaret Beckett as the only possible serious challenger if she decides to run. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU craft union, said last night that Mr Gordon Brown had been attracting a good deal of union support. But he added that the shadow chancellor's decision showed that he was a 'strong, courageous and confident man' who 'put the good of the party first'. Some union leaders fear that if Mr Blair wins a landslide victory as an uncompromising moderniser he may attempt to reduce the power of the unions in the Labour party. Others are confident that Mr Blair supports the party's commitment to full employment and the introduction of a national minimum wage. They also believe he would not wish to re-open the controversial issue of the role of the unions in the party this side of the next general election. Last night a spokesman for Mr Brown said that Mr Blair had agreed to back the employment agenda outlined by Mr Brown in his recent speeches. Union leaders on the centre-left are becoming reconciled to the prospect of Mr Blair as leader - but they remain determined to uphold their authority in the party and hold him to Labour's current economic policies. However, they are also concerned at the findings of the opinion surveys that suggest most political levy-payers in the unions are likely to back Mr Blair and not Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman who is a favourite among union activists.</p>

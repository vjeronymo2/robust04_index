This ends a several-week-old  confrontation happily: with party unity.    Under the auspices of the Central Executive Council [CCE],  by  delegation of President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina, the 71  deputies met yesterday in the Legislative Palace to decide if  Flores Facusse or Jorge Arturo Reina would be the president of  the next National Congress. The CCE president asked each deputy  who would he vote for.    At the end of the vote, Flores Facusse obtained 40 votes and  Jorge Arturo received 31. In the end, Reina -- brother of the  president-elect -- accepted the vote, praised the election  procedure, and warned he would not hamper Flores Facusse's  victory, thereby securing PLH unity.    Beginning early that morning elected deputies lobbied, but  they did not know what mechanism would be used for the election.    The Centenario Hotel -- which, according to a CCE provision,  would be the place where the 71 deputies would meet -- became a  gathering place only for the supporters of Jorge Arturo Reina.    At approximately 1100, 27 elected deputies had arrived at  the  Centenario and ratified their support for the president-elect's  brother.    During the morning at the Alameda Hotel, few supporters of  Flores Facusse entered the hotel and everything seemed to  indicate that some of them had changed their mind and would  support Reina.    By midday, CCE members met at the residence of Enrique Ortez  Colindrez in Los Castanos Sur to define the voting mechanism.  They concluded the voting would take place in two stages:  First, the deputies would vote secretly on whether the final  vote was to be secret or not. They finally chose the latter  alternative.    When they learned of the CCE resolution, the deputies who  supported Flores Facusse met at the residence of Nick Atala in  El Hatillo to travel together to the National Congress.    At approximately 1400 Jorge Arturo Reina was still  optimistic  and said he counted on votes of over 40 deputies, the same  number Flores Facusse had said supported him several weeks ago.    From that moment on, activists from both sides began to  arrive at the Legislative Palace shouting and at times there  were altercations. The first to arrive were the deputies who  supported the brother of the president-elect, followed by Flores  Facusse and finally Reina, who was received with an ovation. At  some point in time, it was considered Reina would pull out from  the vote because he thought he was losing.    At about 1800, the room's curtain opened and many members of  the public entered; then several deputies yelled: "Flores won."  A few minutes later, Flores Facusse left and the happiness seen  in his face confirmed his victory. His first words were to  praise "the dignity" of the parliamentarians who had supported  him, but he also recognized Reina's supporters.    Minutes later Reina appeared with an expression that clearly  reflected the face of defeat. However, his first words were  also a call for unity and respect for the majority's decision.    After giving statements separately and later together, the  two candidates embraced as a show of unity that appeared  sincere, not only as fellow party members but also as  parents-in-law [consuegros].</p>

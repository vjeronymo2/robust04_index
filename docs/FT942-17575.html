			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground in a volatile trading session - Market report The final trading session for the first quarter of 1994 saw UK stocks slip lower in volatile trading ahead of the Easter weekend. With most European financial markets closed until Tuesday, investors were waiting cautiously to see how Tokyo and Wall Street would react to the US jobless data expected on Friday. Plunging sharply at the opening, after Wall Street had suffered its largest daily fall for the year, London stocks steadied in the Footsie 3,061 area, with the help of firmer bond markets across Europe. Recovery was very uncertain, however, when the pound came under pressure again on nervousness regarding the political outlook for Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. The market turned better when gilts responded favourably to comments on the UK economy from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. Encouraged also by good company results in the building sector, the FT-SE Index moved into positive territory, and was within seven points of the 3,100 mark in early afternoon. A cut in the Bank of France intervention rate steadied nervousness on the interest rate front. However, the mood changed very quickly when both the Dow Average and US Federal bonds turned off after a firm start to the new trading session in New York. The Footsie slipped back to show a fall of nearly 10 points before rallying yet again. The closing reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,086.4 for a net loss on the day of 6 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 14.2 to 3,752.9. Seaq volume of 725.6m shares compared with 773m in the previous session, when retail business jumped sharply to return a worth of Pounds 1.76bn. Hopes that UK markets can disengage from the US were dented by the readiness with which the Footsie reacted to bearish movements in the Dow Average. Some analysts warned that selling was inhibited by the the end of the trading quarter and that the London market was much more nervous than it might appear. '1987 re-visited,' was the title of the week's strategy note from Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, once the bull but now the bear of the London stock market. He sees the Dow Average at 3,200 and the Footsie at 2,800 in the near term. He believes that a further cut in UK base rates is almost inevitable on political grounds but should be taken as the final signal to sell equities. Volatility has become the keynote of both equities and gilts at present. The FT-SE Index travelled through a range of more than 30 points again yesterday to show a loss on the week of around 1.4 per cent on the week. Government bonds, although  1/2 point better at the longer end yesterday, have suffered similar changeability which has prompted hints of large losses by some trading firms. The closing picture on the stock market was somewhat mixed, with special situations providing most of the highlights. Firmness among the store and retail issues was somewhat deceptive, with both Kingfisher and GUS moving higher against the market trend. The blue chip multinational stocks were unsettled by uncertainty over the US dollar and the prospect of an extended weekend break in the London market.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu revisited - Theatre John Osborne's Dejavu could turn out to be a bit of a test case for the future of the West End theatre. The thrust of my review last week was that anyone who enjoys the stage should book tickets at once. Since several of my fellow critics have been less enthusiastic, however, some further comments may be allowed. There is a tendency among critics - not only of the theatre - to try to raise their intellectual standards whenever something out of the ordinary is up for judgement. I do it myself and have probably been harsher than strictly justified to some of the later works of Alan Bennett mainly because I do not think that they are as good as his earlier ones. The same may go (just about) for what I have written about Harold Pinter. Yet, in the case of Dejavu, I think my praise was understated. In the West End nowadays there is little left of what used to be called 'serious theatre'. By 'serious' I mean a play by an educated playwright for an educated audience. Certain levels of knowledge have to be taken for granted. Of course, the play has to be good: above all, it has to be actable. No one wants to go to the theatre to hear a sermon. When I read the text of Dejavu published by Faber and Faber, I was full of foreboding. It was excessively long and preacher-esque, with a terrible tendency to rant. That is not how it turns out on stage at the Comedy Theatre. Tony Palmer's production passes all the tests. You want to watch and you want to listen. I do not think, to adapt a phrase from Kenneth Tynan on Osborne's earlier Look Back in Anger, that I have any friends who would not enjoy at least 80 per cent of Dejavu. By my standards, 80 per cent is a pretty high strike rate for a performance of anything. To be sure, you have to be steeped in theatre fully to appreciate it, and not only in Osborne's earlier work. The influence of Shakespeare in general, and Hamlet in particular, is pervasive. The opening line from Jimmy Porter to Cliff is 'What Ho, Bernardo]' There are also some pleasing pick-ups from Noel Coward: 'I went round the world you know.' 'How was it?' 'Far too long.' Yet it is an essential part of theatre for one playwright to draw on another on the assumption that an audience will recognise the references. You also need to be steeped in current affairs. There is a remarkably sharp line in Dejavu that goes back to Arthur Scargill and the miners' strike: 'Couldn't he drop concrete blocks on a few intransigent cancer patients en route for the chemotherapy department?' On the first night, it dropped unnoticed. Even the title Dejavu, written as one word, is a kind of Osborne joke. Jimmy Porter senior is full of French phrases. The element of self-parody is never far away. Plays like this in the West End are rare. They depend on a regular theatre-going audience which may no longer exist. If Dejavu flops - and I am not saying that it will - it will be harder to try again. The outlying theatres in Greenwich, Richmond and Islington all have their place, but it used to be good to have a mecca.</p>

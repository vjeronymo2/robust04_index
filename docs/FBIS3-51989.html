It is not known whether there were any  casualties.    The blackout affected areas near the Presidency of the  Republic, the National Congress, the Archdiocese Palace, the  Army Information Office, the headquarters of unions and popular  organizations, the shopping center, and several foreign press  agencies.    Guatemalan firemen told ACAN-EFE they are investigating the  cause of the blackout and the reason behind the explosion. There  is little traffic on the streets.    Guatemala has lived through a wave of terrorist attacks in  the past few weeks, which the Army blames on the guerrillas who  are trying to discourage the population from participating in  the referendum next Sunday to approve or reject constitutional  reforms that would move back elections for deputies and change  the Supreme Court. The attacks have resulted in the death of one  person.</p>

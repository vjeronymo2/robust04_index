			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Economic Diary: No quiet on unemployment front THIS will be a tense week for the UK government with Thursday's unemployment figures set to take the jobless total over three million. The consensus forecast is for a seasonally adjusted rise of 40,000, but an increase of 26,000 is all that is needed to reach three million, last surpassed in the mid-1980s.

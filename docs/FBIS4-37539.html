			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 19 Jun (INA)--Yusuf Khudayyir al-Juburi,  director general of the State Enterprise for Civil Aviation, has  asserted that all Iraqi civilian airports will be ready to  receive planes of all types and sizes once the unfair air  embargo clamped on Iraq is lifted.    In a statement to INA, the director general of the State  Enterprise said that Iraqi engineers and technicians have  managed to rebuild all the installations and systems related to  the reception of planes. The control equipment used to direct  planes once they enter Iraqi airspace and until they land at  Saddam International Airport, al-Basrah International Airport,  Mosul Airport, or al-Muthanna Airport has also been rebuilt.    Al-Juburi went on to say that the reconstruction of Iraqi  civilian airports has been completed with national expertise.  Right now, Iraqi civilian airports match other airports in the  world in terms of specifications and services.</p>

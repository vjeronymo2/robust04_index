			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (2): It is nice to feel really wanted - Why Mercedes came to Alabama ALABAMA'S slogan is the 'state of surprises'. It certainly lived up to it in late September when Mercedes-Benz, the German vehicle manufacturer, announced it had chosen Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as the site of its first car manufacturing plant outside Germany. Although Alabama was known to be on Mercedes' shortlist of US states, it was not thought to be among the front-runners. So how was Alabama selected? When Mercedes announced last April that it planned to build a Dollars 300m plant in the US to produce a new four-wheel drive sports utility vehicle, it set up a site selection team - advised by Fluor Daniels, a California-based engineering and construction firm - and was inundated with offers from more than 30 states. Members of the team first made incognito investigations of the various states and their offerings. 'We wanted to begin the process with a more factual evaluation, leaving out all emotional or political aspects,' says Mr Dieter Zetsche, a senior Mercedes official. Criteria such as transport costs, quality of the workforce and proposals from government agencies narrowed the field down to 150 sites in 30 states. Further criteria, such as distance to nearby residential areas or existing automotive operations, reduced the tally to 64 sites in 21 states. That was followed by studies on infrastructure, education and availability of the workforce, as well as productivity, which brought the number down to 11 states and 20 sites. Further analysis of such factors as distance to suppliers, training programmes and quality to life left Mercedes with six sites in six states: Tennessee, Nebraska, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. 'At this point,' says Mr Zetsche, 'we visited the remaining sites repeatedly, toured the universities and colleges, visited companies, evaluated the business climate, intensified our investigation of the workforce, elaborated differences in operating costs and investment costs, and ended up with three final sites.' These were in North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. It is not surprising that all three short-listed sites, and five of the final six, should be in the south-eastern US. It has become a Mecca for foreign companies over the past two decades, thanks to its relatively cheap but skilled and abundant labour force, anti-union tradition, affordable housing, attractive life-style, good transport links with Europe - and governments willing to throw money at companies to locate in their states. The Carolinas, in particular, have become a haven for German companies, and BMW, the luxury carmaker, is in the process of building its first US plant in South Carolina. Alabama has in the past lagged other south-east rivals in attracting high-profile capital investments like this, partly because the state showed less entrepreneurial drive and partly because of its old, lingering image as a haven for boorish 'rednecks' and its history of racism and police brutality in the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s. It was disappointed when two of the biggest new vehicle industry projects of the 1980s - Nissan's US plant and General Motors' new Saturn works - were won by its northern neighbour, Tennessee. The state was lucky in that Mercedes' search for a plant, which began in April, coincided with the appointment of a new governor, Mr Jim Folsom, who replaced Mr Guy Hunt after he was forced from office in a theft scandal. Mr Folsom, anxious to prove himself, poured immense energy into the Mercedes project, and made a key appointment in putting Mr Billy Joe Camp, a state government veteran, at the head of the state development office and in charge of negotiations with Mercedes. Mercedes restricted the state teams it was negotiating with to two people, which threw a lot of pressure on Mr Camp and a colleague. The two spent long hours refining the state's offer of incentives - right down to details of how many four-wheel drive vehicles were in the Alabama government fleet, and how many it could therefore be expected to buy from the Mercedes plant. The states did not know precisely what the others were offering. Mercedes was anxious not to conduct a bidding war between them. Mr Andreas Renschler, who heads the sports utility project, says the company wanted to see what each state believed it could bring to the partnership. Alabama ended up offering a very generous package of incentives, totalling Dollars 253m, including Dollars 17.4m to buy the plant site for Mercedes and develop it, Dollars 42.6m for building construction and Dollars 30m for a training centre. It will also pay Dollars 60m to train Mercedes workers and Dollars 77m to develop the related infrastructure, such as roads and water lines. On top of all that, Mercedes qualifies for tax breaks related to its profits and head count. These could total up to Dollars 9.2m a year for up to 25 years. Unsuccessful states have grumbled that Alabama paid over the odds, but Mercedes insists that the offerings from rival states were essentially the same and these were not the most important factor in its decision. Mr Renschler says that its US plant commitment is so important for Mercedes that 'it is not a question of incentives. They are always a short-term thing. We want to build cars here for the next 20 years.' So what tipped the deal Alabama's way? The University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, which will play a big role in worker training, could have been significant. The vehicle industry in neighbouring Tennessee was also a factor. The quality of the local infrastructure played a role, though Mercedes has yet to decide whether it will export through the ports of Mobile (Alabama), Jacksonville (Florida) or Charleston (South Carolina). The local quality of life is also pleasant. Tuscaloosa is a small, rather sleepy city, while Birmingham, 50 miles away, offers big city attractions and shopping malls. Still, the other sites on the Mercedes shortlist had all these attractions as well, and arguably better infrastructure links. In the end, what may have swung it for Alabama was a 'gut feeling' on the part of Mercedes team that this was the right location. That, in turn, seems to have stemmed in part from the sheer zeal with which Alabama pursued Mercedes. It is nice to feel really wanted, in a state so desperate for a big project that you will be treated like royalty - as befits the Mercedes image.</p>

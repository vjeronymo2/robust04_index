			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: INJURED LEUZINGER ACE WILL TRY TO PITCH  </P> <P> Leuzinger pitcher Tyrone Scott, considered one of the South Bay's top major  league baseball prospects and the key to the Olympians' hopes for a Bay League  title, has a sore arm.  </P> <P> Coach Derrel Thomas said Scott's injury, which he described as "tenderness of  the elbow," may prevent the left-hander from pitching indefinitely. Scott has  not pitched since April 11 when he first complained of soreness in a poor  outing against Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Scott missed his scheduled start Tuesday in Leuzinger's 6-3 Bay League loss to  Palos Verdes but will try to pitch in today's rematch with the Sea Kings at  Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> "He's going to warm up," Thomas said. "If his elbow is still tender, I won't  let him pitch. Then we'll take it from there. If it's that bad, he has to go to  the doctor and get it checked out.  </P> <P> "Tyrone wants to play major league baseball someday, and I feel he has a chance  to do that. I don't want anything to happen that could endanger his future."  </P> <P> The erratic Scott, who has continued to play center field and bat third, is 4-2  with a 1.59 ERA and leads the South Bay with 72 strikeouts and 54 walks in 44  innings.  </P> <P> Leuzinger was regarded as a contender for the Bay League title before the  season but is struggling in a fifth-place tie at 3-4.  </P> <P> Morningside forward Eddie Scott, whose cousin Byron played basketball at  Arizona State before finding fame and fortune with the Lakers, also will play  collegiately in the Grand Canyon state.  </P> <P> The 6-7 Scott signed a letter of intent with Northern Arizona on Tuesday, the  day before his 19th birthday.  </P> <P> "Most people want to go to a big-name college with big-time players, but they  don't get any playing time," Scott said. "Northern Arizona is giving me a  chance to come in and start."  </P> <P> Although it is considered a small college in basketball circles, Northern  Arizona competes on the Division I level. The school's recruiting efforts in  the South Bay also netted Harbor College guard Keith Billingslea.  </P> <P> Scott needs to score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to be eligible as a  freshman, but he said Northern Arizona will accept him even if he has to sit  out next year. He has two more chances to take the SAT.  </P> <P> Scott averaged a team-high 14.7 points a game and led Morningside (25-6) to the  Ocean League championship, the semifinals of Southern Section 3-A playoffs and  the finals of the Southern California Division III regionals. He was named  Ocean League MVP.  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills made it two-for-two in recruiting Carson High's top  basketball players by signing 6-5 forward Vincent Washington to a letter of  intent.  </P> <P> Last week the Toros landed Carson guard Ray Bennett. Washington and Bennett  were members of The Times South Bay All-Star Team.  </P> <P> "We are very excited about each of our signees," said Dominguez Hills Coach  Dave Yanai, who also signed 6-7 center Cesar Uballe of Bell and 6-5 forward  Norm Francis of Fairfax. "They are well-rounded players who will contribute  immediately while making an impact in our program over the next four years."  </P> <P> Washington averaged 17 points and 8.3 rebounds to help Carson win the Pacific  League title and reach the semifinals of the L.A. City 4-A playoffs. He was  named the Pacific League MVP.  </P> <P> Mira Costa took a commanding two-game lead in the Ocean League volleyball race  Tuesday with a 15-5, 15-8, 15-4 victory over visiting North Torrance.  </P> <P> The Mustangs, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, improved to  11-0 overall and 9-0 in league behind the play of middle blocker Pat Ivie.  Second-place North fell to 7-2 in the league.  </P> <P> Mira Costa will venture north for a pair of non-league matches against  10th-ranked Santa Barbara and Dos Pueblos on Friday and Saturday nights.  </P> <P> Coach Mike Cook's Mustangs are gearing up for the competitive Redondo  Tournament on April 29. The 25-team field includes Corona del Mar, ranked  fourth in 4-A; University of Irvine, ranked sixth; Palisades, defending L.A.  City 4-A champion, and three of the top-ranked teams in the Southern Section  3-A Division: Harvard of North Hollywood, Arcadia and Long Beach Wilson.  </P> <P> North Torrance and West Torrance will play an alumni football game, the  schools' third in the last five years, at 7 p.m. May 20 at North.  </P> <P> North alumni interested in playing are asked to meet April 27 at the school  football stadium or call the school at 533-4416. The team will be coached by  Kelsey Baughfman, a former North player and an assistant coach for the Saxons.  </P> <P> North has won the last two meetings with West.  </P> <P> PREP NOTES -- Bishop Montgomery junior Kelly Wood was chosen to the  All-Southern Section 3-A Division girls soccer team by a panel of coaches. Wood  was also selected team MVP on an otherwise all-senior Bishop Montgomery squad.  . . .

The Titans improved to 10-6 overall and 6-1  in league play.

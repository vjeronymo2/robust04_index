Also included are certain Account No. 165 costs incurred for what would have been recappable take-or-pay had Panhandle continued its merchant function and the unrecovered balance of a take-or-pay buyout and buydown agreement which had been subject to a three year amortization. These latter gas supply transition costs also became stranded upon the termination of Panhandle's merchant function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that the amounts included for recovery as GSR Reservation Surcharges under Rate Schedules FT, EFT and SCT and the amounts included for recovery under Rate Schedules IT and EIT have been calculated using the methods set forth in Section 18.7 of the General Terms and Conditions of its Tariff and are consistent with the Commission's orders and pronouncements regarding the recovery of GSR Costs. Carrying charges have been calculated in accordance with Section 154.67(c) of the Commission's Regulations and Section 18.7 of Panhandle's Tariff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panhandle states that a copy of this filing has been served on all customers affected by this filing and the respective state commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.

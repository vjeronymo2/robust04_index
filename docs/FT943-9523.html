			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Home wanted for dolphins: The US Navy is seeking to retire its auxiliaries The US Navy needs retirement homes for some special veterans forced overboard in the latest round of post-Cold War fleet reductions. The requirements: a caring staff, companionship and a swimming pool of at least 625 square feet. The Navy says about 30 bottlenose dolphins - trained to patrol harbours, find underwater explosives and help research - are no longer needed. It is hoping to unload the decommissioned marine mammals - free of charge - on to aquatic parks in the US. Each of the 101 dolphins stationed at San Diego, California, with the navy's marine mammal fleet, costs Dollars 15,000 to Dollars 20,000 a year in food and vitamins. That is money the Navy does not want to spend in the tight budgetary environment, said Mr Thomas Lakusa, a Navy spokesman. So far, only a few marine parks have taken an interest. The Navy has received requests from five marine parks for a total of 17 dolphins and is inspecting facilities. Mr Lakusa said that, if the Navy cannot find a home for some of the dolphins, it will continue to look after them for the rest of their lives, as it is doing for seven dolphins classified as 'retired' and another group with chronic health problems. But some animal rights activists, calling the dolphins 'prisoners of war', have asked the navy to send the excess animals to a centre in the Florida Keys, where they would be retrained to live in the wild and then released into the sea. 'We do not believe in the militarisation of animals,' said Mr Craig VanNote, executive vice-president of Monitor, an umbrella organisation for 25 conservation groups. 'This an unethical use of these remarkable wild animals and we applaud the Navy ending this programme - or most of it.' The Navy - which studied the idea of releasing the dolphins at the request of Congress - had baulked at the rehabilitation and release, saying that, once back in civilian life, the dolphins might introduce new diseases into the wild population or be susceptible to diseases themselves. However, after some prodding from Mr Charles Wilson, a Democratic Congressman from Texas on the House defence appropriations committee, the navy negotiated with several animal welfare groups and last month agreed to ship six dolphins to the Florida retraining centre.</p>

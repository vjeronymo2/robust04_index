			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A MOST UNLIKELY DEVOTEE IS '100% SALSERA'  </P> <P> Mention salsa in Orange County, and the name Rae Arroyo often enters the  conversation.  </P> <P> She is the Tuesday night host of the Latin Connection, which has been bringing  the salsa sound to Orange County for 10 years on station KSBR-FM (88.5), which  broadcasts from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. from Saddleback College.  </P> <P> During the day, she and her husband, Damian, operate their record shop, the  Salsa Connection, in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> At 51, she is a walking library on such salsa greats as Eddie Palmieri, Celia  Cruz, Willie Colon, Ray Bareto and her favorite, Tito Puente.  </P> <P> Not bad for a Jewish woman from New Jersey.  </P> <P> What's even more interesting is that Arroyo can roll her Rs and has learned to  pronounce the names of different salsa bands, or bandas, like a pro.  </P> <P> "People laugh when I tell them I'm not Latina," she said in a recent interview.  "I laugh at myself sometimes because I'm such an advocate for Latinos. But you  know what? I'm a salsera. One hundred percent salsera. I just love the music.  In fact, my husband, who is Puerto Rican, taught me the language, and he had to  be taught the music from me!"  </P> <P> Arroyo is pleased that some Los Angeles Spanish-language radio stations that  used to stick to Latin pop-rock are acknowledging Southern California's  increasingly diversified Latino audience by playing more salsa.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, not too many of these radio stations touched the stuff, until  the movie 'Salsa' came out. Now, they're jumping on the bandwagon," she said.  </P> <P> Salsa has become so popular in Orange County that she has opened her own small  club in Santa Ana. She plans to have live salsa bands every Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> Since July, she has been working as a weekend disc jockey at Ruckus Restaurant  in Orange. Each Friday and Saturday night, Arroyo closes her record shop at 7  p.m. and then rushes to the restaurant in Orange, where she sits and waits  while the waiters push aside the salad bar and stack the tables and chairs,  revealing a dance floor.  </P> <P> For four solid hours, she mixes her music from mellow to hot, just to keep the  audience dancing.  </P> <P> As customers enter Ruckus Restaurant, they often recognize Arroyo and give  friendly waves in her direction as she points to vacant chairs.  </P> <P> "That's a listener of mine," she said. "She and I go way back. Hey, hi, Linda.  Look, there's an extra seat over there. Sit there. I'll talk to you in a  minute."  </P> <P> She added: "I like to kick off with something hot, then move into something  mellow. Perhaps a merengue, and then open the night up with a salsa. You got to  keep the dancers on their feet and play a variety of music to keep them happy."  </P> <P> For Arroyo, her love of salsa began when she was young. At age 13, she  remembers that her father, a jazz devotee and Sephardic Jew who was born in  Turkey, introduced her to the Puerto Rican- and Cuban-flavored urban sound.  </P> <P> "He was a sewing machine operator in New Jersey who really enjoyed his music on  the weekends," she said. "He gave me this love for the music."  </P> <P> In November, Arroyo recently got on stage at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano and introduced Puente, a salsa master.  </P> <P> For Arroyo, it was her moment in the sun.  </P> <P> "That was really one of my greatest pleasures," she said.  </P> <P> "When I was 14, I saw Tito for the first time at the New York Palladium. I kind  of snuck in, ordered a Coke, and when the music started, I got swept away by  his playing, and tears started rolling down my cheeks.  </P> <P> "This man's music, his salsa, still makes me get emotional."  </P></p>

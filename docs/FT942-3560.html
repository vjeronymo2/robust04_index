			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Inflatables side sold by Avon Rubber for Pounds 7.8m Avon Rubber is selling its lossmaking inflatable boats business for a total of Pounds 7.8m to a former director of GEC. This is almost the last of the troublesome businesses to be dealt with in the restructuring which has carried the tyres and automotive components group through four years of recession. It is estimated to have incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.5m over the last three years and is expected to incur a loss of about Pounds 700,000 for the nine months it will have been included this year. Avon has had to provide a secured guarantee to the new company's banking facilities of up to Pounds 3m until September 1995. Avon Marine, a company set up by Mr David Powell, a former GEC director, is buying the business. Avon Rubber is taking a 10 per cent stake worth Pounds 420,000 as part of the purchase price, as well as a cash payment of Pounds 2.9m, and will have a seat on the board. Marine will also take on Pounds 3.7m in debt, and pay a further Pounds 780,000 to Avon Rubber following the sale of certain stocks. CINVen, the venture capital company, is backing the transaction and will also have a seat on the board. The division's net assets are estimated at Pounds 4.6m, resulting in a goodwill write-off of Pounds 3.1m. Avon Rubber's gearing is expected to fall from 33 per cent to 28 per cent as a result of the transaction.</p>

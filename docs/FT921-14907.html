			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Fox Milton trial to start today THE TRIAL of two directors of Fox Milton &amp; Co, a licensed share dealing firm that went into liquidation in 1989, is due to start today at the Old Bailey. Mr Stephen Wright and Mr Philip Raisey face a single charge that they conspired 'to cheat Her Majesty the Queen and the Public Revenue' between February 1 1985 and January 23 1989. The allegations cited in the indictment, which are denied by both the men, include: Representing to tax inspectors that charitable donations made to religious organisations were deductible against corporation tax. Evading tax assessments by failing to notify inspectors that four Jersey-based companies were liable to corporation tax. Entering backdated share bargains in clients' accounts to create capital gains and evade income tax assessments. Knowingly submitting incomplete or incorrect tax returns relating to both the firm's income and their personal income. Approving company accounts that did not disclose the full extent of directors' benefits. The trial is expected to last between eight and 12 weeks. The prosecution, which is led by Mr Douglas Day QC, is being brought by the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Richard Ager, the Fox Milton office manager, has also been charged with conspiracy and is due to appear, along with Mr Wright and Mr Raisey, in a second trial scheduled to start in April this year. The SFO investigated Fox Milton after its liquidation in March 1989. The three men were arrested by police officers from the City of London fraud squad in August 1990.</p>

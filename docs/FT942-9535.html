			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: Wired in to words THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT: THE NEW SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE AND MIND by Steven Pinker Allen Lane Pounds 20, 494 pages With the challenge 'Let us do away with the folklore that parents teach their children language', Professor Pinker sets out to prove that language is instinctive, and that its structure is 'wired' into the human brain. A psychology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he opens with some of the questions that have long troubled his profession. 'Why is it that a nation that can put a man on the moon cannot build a computer that can take dictation?' he asks. Instead of worrying that computers might eventually outsmart them, people should puzzle more about why the human brain is so good at understanding language, he says. Engagingly written, his book is packed with the kind of anecdotes and references to rock stars now standard among academics keen on popularising science. He amusingly - though uncontroversially - demonstrates that people do not always hear words correctly. I will never again hear the phrase 'A girl with kaleidoscope eyes', from the Beatles' song 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds' without hearing Pinker chanting: 'A girl with colitis goes by'. But the three main planks of Pinker's argument prove unequal to the weight he puts on them. For a start, he does not convincingly show that children 'know things they could not have been taught'. He says that children's mistakes such as 'we holded the baby rabbits' cannot be 'an act of imitation'; but he does not allow that it could simply be unsuccessful imitation. His second claim that 'there are common elements between all languages', also arouses doubts. According to Pinker, 'if the basic order of a language is subject-object-verb it will usually have question words at the ends of the sentence.' Usually? That hardly sounds universal. His claim that 'if a language has a word for 'leg' it will have a word for 'arm' also raises questions: why not suggest that language is shaped by people's need to refer to their bodies rather than by neurological 'wiring'? Above all, it is the 'ubiquity of complex language among human beings' that, to him, offers 'compelling proof that language is innate'. The climax of his argument is the claim that there is a 'language' of images inside the brain, which he calls 'mentalese'. 'People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache; they think in a language of thought (with) . . . symbols for concepts' he speculates. 'Knowing a language is knowing how to translate mentalese into strings of words and vice versa'. Despite developing this hypothesis at length, he does not acknowledge the famous arguments of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the philosopher, that the theory of a 'private language' such as 'mentalese' is incoherent. Wittgenstein argued that a person would have no criteria for correctly matching these inner symbols to words as he would be the only arbiter of the symbols' use. Pinker has fallen into the trap which has caught many working in his field. He has been tempted to claim more about the structure of the brain than science has yet established, and to bridge the gap with over-enthusiastic philosophy. As he would probably concede, people do not have a universal tendency to agree wired into their brains.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Venezuela economic reforms on way VENEZUELA'S congress has granted President Ramon Velasquez powers until the end of this year to introduce economic measures by decree. His government, a transitional administration due to step down in February, asked for special powers to tackle a series of problems, including the growing fiscal deficit. The powers will allow the president to introduce: a sales tax and a tax on the assets of private companies; reform of the financial system, including opening up banking to foreign investment; initiatives to help farmers; reforms of tax legislation aimed at raising revenues and applying corporate taxes to private investors in the oil and gas sectors; a change in the law for selling off the Aeropostal airline. A joint session of congress also approved a long-awaited privatisation law reform, aimed at speeding the process. President Velasquez, who took office on June 5, has said his interim government will pave the way for a new president, scheduled to be elected in early December. The new sales and asset taxes will benefit the current administration only a little but should provide the next government with a stronger fiscal base. The administration is facing several economic problems. Revenues from oil exports, which provide most government income, have fallen because of weak international oil prices; the government is projecting a fiscal gap of around Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) for 1993. Inflation stands at around 36 per cent a year, and economic growth has dropped sharply from last year's 7.3 per cent.</p>

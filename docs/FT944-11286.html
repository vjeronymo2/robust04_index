			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ordinary holders may get small part of Queens Moat Ordinary investors in Queens Moat Houses, the heavily-indebted hotels group, may find their shares are not completely worthless when the protracted Pounds 1.3bn debt restructuring is agreed later this month. Initial indications are that ordinary shareholders will be left with a slice, albeit small, of the company which is expected to seek a relisting in the new year. The battle to keep ordinary shareholders in the picture has not been an easy one. There had been strong demand from banks to leave ordinary shareholders with little more than option paper. However, a Queens Moat adviser said this weekend that 'shareholders may be pleasantly surprised' when they read the details of the refinancing. These are likely to be published at the end of this month or early next and will include a substantial debt-for-equity swap and extended maturity dates on certain tranches of debt. Before that can happen, however, Queens Moat's 74 lenders will all have to sign on the dotted line. Reaching agreement in principle - a stage which Queens Moat is expected to complete almost any day now - is only the first step. After that, it is likely to take between two and three weeks for the banks to return the official documentation, which will allow Queens Moat to present its hard-won refinancing to shareholders. Investors will then have three weeks in which to peruse the details before being asked to vote on the issue at an extraordinary general meeting. If approved, the refinancing can start and the company will then approach the Stock Exchange for a relisting. All this means that shareholders are not likely to see a refinancing circular before the end of this month, or possibly early next. A relisting will certainly not be possible before next year. Such delays should be familiar to the thousands of investors who have been largely left in the dark for the past year. In spite of almost immediate support from most of the group's 74 lenders when proposals were first sent out in April this year, the process has been held up by a number of behind-the-scenes setbacks. These have included disputes with lessors of certain hotels over concessions to be made as part of the package and objections from secondary-debt traders. Most of the objections have now been resolved. Only Trust Company of the US  -which bought Queens Moat debt in the secondary market - and a continental European bank are still holding out. Nevertheless, Queens Moat is confident it will be able to complete the refinancing before Christmas.</p>

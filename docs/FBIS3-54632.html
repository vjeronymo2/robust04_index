			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed feature: "Leaders of the CIS Countries Answer </F> IZVESTIYA's Question"]    [Text] On the eve of the New Year, IZVESTIYA put a single  question to the heads of the CIS countries:    Which was the happiest day for you in the outgoing year, and  which was the most difficult?  <H5>  Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia </H5>   Your question goes straight to the point. I will not forget  1993. You can guess why.    3-4 October, the storming of the White House... I admit that  for me this decision was not only forced on me, it was the most  agonizing and difficult decision. On that tragic night, hour  after hour I watched real signs of civil war developing in  Russia, with consequences far in excess of the Russian people's  national tragedy at the beginning of the century. The decision  had to be made quickly. I took that step for the sake of a  single goal -- to avoid war within the country. I am not likely  to forget all I felt during those days and hours.    Now, for an emotionally positive event in the past year. It  was, of course, the adoption of the new Constitution.    My compatriots, the people of Russia, once again  demonstrated  the people's wisdom. That event, that day, can, for me, be seen  as the goal of my political career. I was working toward it for  three years, and I am happy that Russia has at last acquired an  intelligent, worthy Constitution.  <H5>  Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan </H5>   Almaty -- This year was extremely tense both for Kazakhstan  and for the Commonwealth, and probably for the entire world  community. Amid the kaleidoscope of complex and dramatic events  of this year, it is not easy to identify the most important.    Fratricidal conflicts in various regions of the Commonwealth  brought pain and suffering. But in the main we were able to  prevent them from developing into global interstate clashes.  Wisdom and farsightedness doubtless lie not in driving conflicts  underground, but averting them by political means.    In our countries there is a growing awareness of the  futility  of confrontation between peoples. And nobody but ourselves can  stop that confrontation.    The most important thing that should exist in relations  among  our countries is equality, friendship, and consideration for  mutual interests. That will undoubtedly help us to reach a new  level of integration. I hope the language of cooperation and  mutual understanding will become the basis of our partnership.    Let me take this opportunity to congratulate IZVESTIYA's  collective and all its readers on the new year, 1994, and to  express the wish that everyone may have as many peaceful and  joyous days as possible. I would wish us to cherish our main  asset -- good-neighborliness and the indissoluble bonds of  friendship.  <H5>  Leonid Kravchuk, President of Ukraine </H5>   Kiev -- I realize these are metaphorical questions: It is  not easy to single out one or two days from the whole torrent of  days. Let me say, I am pleased when some question that is  important to Ukraine is resolved, when a step is taken toward  boosting our prestige in the international arena or when, say,  we have been able to reach agreement with our neighbors or  within the state on some economic, political, or diplomatic  question. Or when a sick grandson or granddaughter gets better  -- then I am happy. And I am pleased when people smile at our  meetings -- I know how hard things are for them, they think it  is partly my fault, and that is true, but it is a sign that they  believe in Ukraine's future.    The most important, crucial act this year, from the  viewpoint of the state's future, was parliament's adoption of  the decision on early elections. I am convinced that the  present parliament, whatever you may think of it, is not capable  of doing more than it has done. And that is not simply the  deputies' fault -- the parliament was elected in a different  time, it bears the stamp of that time, and it is not  professional. Therefore I was pleased that it was not necessary  to use any strong-arm measures to persuade the deputies of what  they ought to do.    As for major unpleasantnesses, I have had two this year.    The first was the miners' summer strike. I saw disaster was  not far off. After that, there was the meeting with the Russian  delegation in Massandra. Russia then saw how hard the strikes  were hitting Ukraine, and it was brought to its knees by  internal problems. On top of that there was external pressure,  and people were taking advantage of our weakness.    And the second difficult day, and difficult night, for me --  3 October in Moscow. I knew that if the Khasbulatov and Rutskoy  crew was victorious in the White House, similar processes would  begin, as usual, in Ukraine. That evening I had information  that in some regions people were already preparing practical  steps to overthrow the presidential structures and restore  Soviet power under the slogan: "All power to the soviets." It  could have meant extremely difficult times, even bloodshed. I  cannot ever remember feeling such agitation in recent years or  having such an outlook.  <H3>  Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  Belarus </H3>   Minsk -- I cannot distinguish one day from another in the  past year, and therefore I cannot name the most difficult.  There was a lot of work on the Supreme Soviet -- intensive  work, highly necessary to the republic and the people.  Unfortunately, it was necessary to "chase" certain dishonest  people. They sometimes raised problems of what I would call  back-street significance. All this diverted attention and cost  time and effort. The behavior and actions of certain leaders,  even some of very high rank, who say they care about the people  is annoying.    The most gratifying days in the past year were when the  Belarus Supreme Soviet adopted the laws on public privatization.  The republic government's task is to fulfill these laws, so  that instead of a handful of millionaires getting rich, the  entire people have something, to make life a little bit easier  for them. The fate of the Belarusian people is all too hard,  they have borne too much in their history, and things are very  difficult for them at present. They have a right to a better  life.    I would like to take this opportunity sincerely to  congratulate all IZVESTIYA's readers on the coming New Year and  to wish them good health, happiness, prosperity, and calm.  <H5>  Mircea Snegur, President of Moldova </H5>   Chisinau -- It is perhaps better to speak about features  rather than days, because I almost never have a day that is  absolutely happy. So, now for what is sad, or rather vexatious.  I am talking about the Tiraspol leaders' incredible lack of  understanding of the changed situation. Despite the efforts and  initiative of the republic leadership, we have not succeeded in  moving toward the elimination of the consequences of the  conflict. God and the people will be their judge.    Now for what is happy. We have had a year of peace.  Privatization has begun. We have introduced a national  currency. Certain other steps were also taken along the path of  consolidating the republic and its statehood and independence.    At the personal level, for me, of course, the big event was  my grandson's first birthday.    Happy New Year to all IZVESTIYA's readers!  <H5>  Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan </H5>   Tashkent -- I cannot name a specific day: Every day in the  past year was both difficult and happy in its way.    There are many people who do not like peace and accord,  political stability in the republic, and the consistent, phased  implementation of economic reforms. To be frank, our opponents  cannot tolerate two factors which determine our true wealth:  One is the interethnic and civic accord, the cohesion of all  the inhabitants of Uzbekistan, and the other is Uzbekistan's  gold, our high-carat gold, which is becoming famous throughout  the world and is winning prestige in the international market.    Incidentally, as of today, Uzbek gold worth $500 million is  invested in West European banks as a guarantee. We intend to  bring the account up to $1 billion, in order to widen the influx  of foreign investments into Uzbekistan's economy.    Imamali Rakhmonov, Chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme  Council    It is hard to single out my happiest day in the past year.  But nonetheless, I think the January days were the happiest.  In that period, in a short space of time, Dushanbe, which was  devoid of people, came to life following the advent of  constitutional power. I was happy to see smiles appearing on the  citizens' faces. People straightened their shoulders -- the  fear had gone, and real hope had sprung up for the establishment  of peace, stabilization, and the attainment of national accord.  That was when I was happy, in purely human terms.    The most difficult time for me, as for all the people and  the  republic as a whole, was, unfortunately, the whole of 1993. It  was the most difficult year in my entire life. During this  period very many socioeconomic difficulties and problems have  arisen, which we have worked and are now working to resolve.    I hope 1994 will be the year of the normalization of the  highly complex situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, a year of  mutual understanding and accord between forces of different  political orientations in our country, for the sake of achieving  peace and security not only in Tajikistan, but throughout the  Central Asian region.  <H5>  Saparmurad Niyazov, President of Turkmenistan </H5>   Ashgabat -- I will not try to isolate the single most  difficult day; there were many such days. But I associate the  happy day with that sunny day in December when Turkmenistan and  Russia found one another in a new capacity. The appearance on  the eve of the session of CIS heads of state of the agreement on  the settlement of dual citizenship questions, the process of  resettlement, and the defense of the rights of migrants, and  also the treaty on the joint security of the Turkmenistan's  border, in many ways determined the success of the summit  meeting in Ashgabat also. I confess, the decision connected  with these documents was arrived at with difficulty. Both  sides' groups of experts worked long and painstakingly on the  agreements. We were perfectly aware what role these documents  are designed to play in establishing democratic ideals and  defending the individual's right to choose. I was happy that we  reached agreement...  <H5>  Askar Akayev, President of Kyrgyzstan </H5>   Bishkek -- The happiest day was 5 May 1993, when  Kyrgyzstan's Constitution was adopted, opening the way for the  progressive development of the republic, for the construction of  a democratic state, and the formation of a civil, rule-of-law  society. I am convinced that not only members of the  constitutional commission who formulated this Constitution, and  not only the deputies who adopted it, will be proud of it, but  also the future generations of Kyrgyzstan.    The most difficult day was 20 December, when a crisis of  state power arose at a session of the republic Supreme Council,  and the opposition of the two branches -- the legislative and  the executive -- reached its very apogee.    The difficult and only possible solution in this situation  was a decision by the whole government to resign. I am glad  that this difficult step, this difficult day, and this difficult  decision enabled us to resolve several problems at once. This  made it possible for us to avoid conflict or confrontation both  in parliament itself and within the republic. After this  decision, everyone felt some kind of relief, and I am glad that  we found the path of harmony and consensus in forming the new  government. This new government can be called a coalition  government.  <H5>  Geydar Aliyev, President of the Azerbaijan Republic </H5>   Baku -- It is hard for me to speak about a happy day.  Indeed, how is it ossible to be happy, when Azerbaijan is being  subjected to aggression, when 20 percent of its territory is  occupied, and the republic has 1.2 million hungry refugees?  There can be no happy day, happy hour, or happy moment for any  president in the world in a similar situation, I am convinced.  This, I am convinced, is out of the question.    As for a complex or, as you remarked, difficult day, perhaps  it was the day I assumed the heavy responsibility for the fate  of the Azerbaijani state and its people.  <H5>  Levon Ter-Petrosyan, President of Armenia </H5>   Yerevan -- The happiest day for me will be the day peace is  restored in Nagorno-Karabakh. Until that day, all days have  been and will be difficult.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle Australian bid battle intensifies BANKERS TRUST Australia, the fund manager, has emerged with a 7.9 per cent stake in Bundaberg Sugar which could block Tate &amp; Lyle's bid for the Queensland sugar miller and refiner, or force the UK sweetener group to increase its hostile ADollars 325m (Pounds 150m) offer. Tate &amp; Lyle's bid for Bundaberg is conditional upon 90 per cent acceptance and approval by the foreign investment authorities in Australia. BTA has been the dominant buyer of Bundaberg's stock since Tate &amp; Lyle launched its offer on March 19 at an initial ADollars 3.70 per share. Tate &amp; Lyle revised its bid to Dollars 4.10 per share when it mailed its formal documents last week. The fund manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bankers Trust of the US, has bought 2.1m shares, lifting its stake from the 5.2 per cent held before the Tate &amp; Lyle offer. BTA is understood to have valued Bundaberg at ADollars 4.40 per share. It lodged a substantial shareholder notice with the Australian stock exchange yesterday, revealing its increased holding in Bundaberg. Macquarie Bank, Bundaberg's adviser, has valued the stock at between ADollars 4.54 and ADollars 5.16 per share, supporting a recommendation from directors for shareholders to reject the Tate &amp; Lyle offer. Mr Bill Beerworth, Tate &amp; Lyle's Australian adviser, described the Macquarie valuation as 'disappointing, incomplete and rose-coloured.' BTA is Australia's third largest fund manager with more than ADollars 10bn under management. It has developed a reputation for astute investments and high returns. Mr Ross Finley, a BTA director, declined to reveal the strategy behind his bank's heavy buying. Logically, BTA's aim is to force Tate &amp; Lyle to pay more for Bundaberg. Bundaberg's share price has consistently traded below the offer price, however, because investors generally fear that the UK group might withdraw its offer. Bundaberg shares closed at ADollars 3.83, 27 cents below the bid price.</p>

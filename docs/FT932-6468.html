			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Grimsby evening paper scuppers chancellor's efforts to keep mum THE WORLD exclusive on Norman Lamont's resignation went not to the BBC or ITN or any of the heavyweight political editors but to Ms Clare Henderson, a reporter on the Grimsby Evening Telegraph. Ms Henderson had just finished interviewing a local college headmaster when she heard about the Cabinet reshuffle. The 26-year-old went immediately to the Grimsby retirement home of a lady she had written several articles about  -Norman's mum, 82-year-old Mrs Irene Lamont. On the steps of Downing Street Mr Lamont was saying nothing. But in Grimsby Mrs Lamont was happy to tell how her son had just called to say he had resigned and decided to go to the back benches. The story broke just as the first edition of the Evening Telegraph was about to go to press with a strong front page story on the opening of a new theme park at Cleethorpes. By 11.55am the first edition was out with a new front page devoted to Mr Norman Lamont. Cleethorpes was relegated to an inside page. Mr Peter Moore, editor, said: 'The first edition was an Evening Telegraph exclusive. The second edition was a world exclusive.' The paper is part of Northcliffe Newspapers. The story was sent immediately to the press agency UK News and from there to Reuters, the international news agency, and around the world. 'It's a victory for local journalism, for doing your homework, for doing the basics every day,' added Mr Moore proudly. After her scoop Ms Henderson returned to help Mrs Lamont field the large number of calls from other news organisations. But Mrs Lamont was making it clear she was only interested in talking to the Grimsby Evening Telegraph.</p>

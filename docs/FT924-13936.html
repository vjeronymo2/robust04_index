			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Bush cues the St Louis blues: Clinton has survived the first presidential debate and remains on course for the White House Ross Perot may well have won the battle of St Louis on Sunday night but it will take a hatful of miracles for him to win the war for the White House. Bill Clinton does not need divine intervention to become the next president of the United States, but George Bush probably now does. This is the safe conclusion from the first of the televised presidential debates, a process which has in the past proved influential in the selection of the president. In part they are watched for the knock-out blow or the killer mistake, but they also constitute an opportunity for candidates to parade themselves and their policies. Within the constraints of having to answer every question in no more than two minutes, they served that purpose on Sunday night. Absent the grand faux pas, what came across the nation's TV screens was a sitting Republican president who really does not think there is much chronically wrong with the country, an earnest Democratic challenger who believes government can help put right what is economically amiss and an independent stuffed with pithy aphorisms about impending catastrophe but whose solutions, beyond the summoning of innumerable task forces and town meetings, are a little threadbare. Mr Perot's performance has the potential once again to disturb the waters of what had increasingly seemed a still electoral pond, with Mr Clinton sailing serenely to victory and Mr Bush slowly sinking. On Sunday, it sometimes seemed the little billionaire was intent on encouraging this progression, for most of his best one-liners were at the president's expense. Responding to Mr Bush's assertion of experience as a prime qualification for the White House, he tartly observed: 'I don't have the experience of running up a four trillion dollar debt.' Again, intervening in the only truly acrimonious exchange of the evening between Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, over the latter's role in organising protests against the Vietnam war in London 23 years ago, Mr Perot commented: 'When you're a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars of taxpayers' money and you're a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time passes.' But with lines like 'we practise 19th century capitalism, the rest of the world practises 21st century capitalism', Mr Perot also succeeded in making both his opponents seem precisely what they are - professional politicians shaped by the status quo. To the extent that the public is fed up with politics as usual, as it clearly demonstrated by its early summer flirtation with Mr Perot, the blunt Texan again offered himself as a rallying point to the disaffected. The probability is that his stock is again on the rise. As confirmed by the overnight polls, the critical difference between now and June, when he briefly led some national public opinion polls, is that most people have stopped believing that he can actually win. Moreover, the core of his support - among the military, its veterans and the elderly, the majority white - constitutes a bloc that mostly votes Republican or does not vote at all. This last month of the campaign may dispel the notion that he is a 'quitter', but it remains hard to see that it will amount to much more than that, beyond the confines of particular states like his native Texas. Still, it was Mr Bush who insisted that Mr Perot be a part of the debates, in the hope that he would shake up the political impasse. It was a gamble and it might be backfiring. It is possible that Mr Perot and Mr Clinton may end up splitting the movement for 'change', but it is probably more likely that having to defend his economic management from attacks from two quarters will only put the president further on the defensive. This is exactly where he cannot afford to be now. Just about the only offensive manoeuvre Mr Bush managed to spring on Sunday night was his sudden announcement that, if re-elected, he would ask James Baker to fix domestic affairs as he had succeeded in fixing foreign affairs. Later, White House officials started hinting that the current economic management troika - Nicholas Brady at the Treasury, Richard Darman at the budget office and Michael Boskin, the economic adviser - was definitely on its way out. None of this is new. Neither Mr Brady nor Mr Boskin expects to be in office in January even if Mr Bush wins, while Mr Darman's pitch has been thoroughly queered by a recent series of Washington Post articles, for which he was a prime source, detailing the bitter administration infighting over taxation policy. Even the 'economic tsar' notion was kicked around prior to the Republican convention in August, but was reportedly rejected by Mr Baker as too gimmicky. Even now, it is not clear how firm the proposal is. After the debates, one Republican spokesman said the president was only thinking of putting Mr Baker in charge of domestic matters during the transition period between the election and inauguration in January, after which he would return to his old haunts in the State Department. Mr Bush himself said 10 days ago that that is what he wanted his old friend to do. Critics also had an instant field day with the resurrection of Mr Baker. One TV commentator openly wondered if it meant that he, not Mr Bush, would appear in the second or third debate, since it was apparent that he was the real president. Mr Baker may tell all later this week when, after weeks of invisibility in the White House, he is emerging to give a formal speech. He was even interviewed on television after the debate. More important was Mr Bush's inability to crack Mr Clinton's defences. Thoroughly prepared for the predictable, the Democrat scored one of the more palpable hits of the night by recalling the record of Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut. 'Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy; you were wrong to attack my patriotism. I was opposed to the war, but I love my country. And we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.' Mr Bush never really got another opportunity to impugn his opponent's character or otherwise to rattle him. He was left with his stock campaign lines of optimism ('this country is not coming apart at the seams' and 'we are still the envy of the world'), foreign policy achievement (most effective in defending his policies towards China) and the conviction that less government, not more, is what the country needs. But it was all the familiar stuff that simply has not been working so far and, as the debate unfolded, Mr Bush, initially quite relaxed, became more petulant and repetitive. For the record, it should be noted that no questions about Iran or Iraq were asked. As the favourite for the White House, Mr Clinton had, in a sense, most to lose on Sunday night, though his campaign consistently argues that by merely holding his own with the president he enhances his credibility. Certainly, by committing no serious mistake, factual or otherwise, he avoided the worst imaginable pitfall. He also treated Mr Perot rather gently, joining in his attacks on Mr Bush but saying nothing that might be construed as critical of the independent candidate beyond the suggestion that he was putting too much emphasis on attacking the deficit and not enough on stimulating economic growth. In truth, Mr Clinton often looked tense, until he warmed up in the final half hour, over-programmed and sometimes falsely folksy. But his purpose, successfully prosecuted, was to hammer away about the economy and the structural problems of the country, such as healthcare and education, to the exclusion of most else. When pressed on his credentials for the White House, he commented that 'experience counts, but it's not everything' and that his experience 'was rooted in the real lives of real people', not in the out-dated precepts of the cold war and trickle-down economics. His message was of 'change', not revolution. He declined an invitation to criticise the Federal Reserve, saying its monetary policies 'seem to me pretty sound'. He doubted the US needed to maintain 150,000 troops in Europe, but said 'we certainly must maintain an engagement there' of, say, 100,000 or slightly less. He thought 'economic security is a whole lot of national security'. US ground troops should not be sent to Bosnia or Somalia, but 'it is important to recognise that there are things which can be done', including a greater effort on refugees and consideration to ending the arms embargo on Bosnia. His best moments - and Mr Bush's worst - were on social policy issues like health, race and drugs. He cited facts and figures on the unsustainable costs of healthcare, whereas the president devoted most of his answer to an attack on malpractice lawyers. He asserted his campaign had reached out across all racial divides, while Mr Bush merely complained that Arkansas had no civil rights act. Mr Clinton said his brother's addiction to cocaine had given him a unique perspective and convinced him that legalisation was not the answer, while Mr Bush gave the impression that the war on drugs was making real progress. This left him wide open to one of Mr Perot's better ripostes. 'There are guys, who couldn't get a job third shift in a Dairy Queen (a fast food chain), driving BMWs and Mercedes selling drugs and these old boys are not going to quit easy.' There are two more presidential debates to go, on Thursday and next Monday, broken up tonight when Vice-President Dan Quayle, Senator Al Gore and retired admiral James Stockdale, the running mates, have at each other. If Sunday was reasonably civil, the suspicion must be that the next confrontations will be much less so, for the very obvious reason that Mr Bush still has not found the key to rescuing his presidency. Since the start of September, his campaign has oscillated wildly between attempts at constructive criticism of Mr Clinton and, as this made no inroads, increasingly negative onslaughts on his character. Mr David Gergen, senior editor at US News and World Report and formerly in the Republican White House, commented recently that Mr Bush and Mr Baker seemed to have concluded that 'if the mud doesn't stick, start throwing the sewage'. The fact that this is not sticking either does not seem to be a deterrent to hauling up another bucketful.</p>

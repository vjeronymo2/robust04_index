			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Heron acts to cut advisers' fees in restructuring HERON, the property and trading company negotiating a Pounds 1.4bn debt restructuring deal with its banks and bond holders, has acted to limit the 'cost spiral' involved in the process. Heron's decision has implications for other companies in similar talks also facing huge fees for professional advice. Since talks started in March last year fees have totalled nearly Pounds 40m. Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's private company, said it would no longer pay fees it did not regard as essential to the refinancing. Heron also said it planned to present final proposals to creditors by the end of this month. The group said it could not comment on rumours that a revaluation of its properties, being prepared as part of the documentation for the deal, showed a further fall of Pounds 100m since March last year. But its first public mention of an end-February deadline appeared designed to quash speculation that the talks were being held up by creditors' concern about property values. In order to preserve cash resources, Heron said, it would 'no longer be responsible for fees of advisers other than those which in (Heron's) view are essential to the restructuring process'. It had had to devote 'disproportionate resources' to verifying data already prepared under due diligence procedures. Heron stressed that its Heron Corporation subsidiary in the UK, which includes the housebuilding and automotive divisions as well as property companies in the UK, France and Switzerland, had substantial cash resources and positive net assets. As well as paying its own advisers, such as lawyers, merchant bankers and accountants, Heron was obliged to 'fund and deal with the queries of more than 17 other firms of advisers representing creditor groups'. It said that the time and money being devoted to this was 'not in the interest of the company's creditors and could potentially threaten the successful completion of the restructuring'. Without the refinancing the group would be forced into receivership. Heron said this decision, taken at the weekend, would 'protect the interests of creditors by bringing the cost spiral of the debt restructuring process to an end'.</p>

Tsibulskiy (Nuclear Reactors Institute), RNTs [Republican  Science Center] ``Kurchatovskiy Institut''; received July  9,1993; UDC 621.039.58]    [Abstract] The problem of assessing the safety of AESs  during severe accidents determines to a large degree future  development of nuclear power industry. The most severe AES  accidents that can lead to extensive radioactive contamination  of the environment are the so called heat removal and reactivity  type accidents. Currently there are two prevailing trends in  solving the safety problem development of more reliable systems  with multiple redundancy and additional safety barriers to  propagation of fission products, or development of new in  principle reactors wherein the possibility of accident creating  processes is eliminated. The best way is an optimum combination  of the two directions. With this in mind the authors discuss the  possibility of using in water-cooled reactors fuel compositions  based on fuel microelements used in high-temperature gas-cooled  reactors (HTGR). The article examines an arrangement that gives  a reactor unit a conceptually new quality. Preliminary analysis  demonstrated that the proposed concept makes it possible to  solve the AES radiation safety problem during an accident  accompanied by complete loss of the heat-transfer medium and  thus come substantially closer to solving the problem of  reactivity accidents. The article describes a fuel module with  fuel microelements, the reactor, neutron-physical and thermal  physical features of the reactor core, and reactor behavior  during a severe accident accompanied by complete loss of the  heat-transfer medium. The use of such reactors will increase the  cost of electrical power by 10-15%. Figures 5.</p>

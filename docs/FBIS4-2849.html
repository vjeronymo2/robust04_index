			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP) -- Five years after the  launch of a massive pro-democracy movement that made China's  communist regime tremble with fear, the country's leadership is  again on guard although most dissidents think the time is not  ripe for another "Beijing Spring."    "It's true that social tensions are high and that there are  similarities with the situation five years ago, but don't expect  a popular uprising in the near future," said Wang Dan, who  became one of the student leaders of the 1989 movement.    The first demonstrations in 1989 began not in June, but on  April 15 on the death of former communist party general  secretary Hu Yaobang. Thousands marched to Tiananmen Square to  mourn the man who had been sacked two years before for his  reformist views, and the movement swelled until being bloodily  crushed on June 4 in the Tiananmen Square massacre.    Wang's opinion is shared by most other dissidents, many of  whom emerged from the shadows at the end of last year when they  began forming groups again and publicly demanding more democracy  in China.    China's economic and political stability are threatened on  several fronts: Raging inflation, rampant corruption, rising  unemployment, increasing rural poverty in certain areas, and the  government's loss of economic control.    "The older problems were never resolved, and now new ones  have emerged," says Ding Zilin, a Beijing University philosophy  professor and a signatory of one of several letters addressed to  the government recently demanding more democracy.    "If the peasants and workers rise up together, general chaos  would be the result. We are worried and that is why we wrote to  the authorities," said Ding, who lost a son in the Tiananmen  Square massacre.    This year's repeated calls by the government for "public  order" as well as the repeated arrests of dissidents betrays a  genuine worry on its part. The declining health of Chinese  leader Deng Xiaoping, nearly 90, leaves open all sorts of  questions about the political future of the world's last big  communist country.    Knowing that corruption was one of the sparks that set off  the 1989 movement, the authorities devoted much publicity to  Monday's death sentence imposed on a businessman, as well as a  20-year sentence handed down to a vice-minister, both of whom  had been involved in a huge financial scandal.    Intellectuals here are also aware of the risks they may run  of mounting sustained protests.    "Today, many Chinese and especially the students are afraid  of instability, because they want to take part in and benefit  from the market economy, which was not the case five years ago,"  said Yang Zhou, a veteran dissident and spokesman for the  Shanghai-based Chinese Association of Human Rights.    "The mindset has changed in recent years, because people now  are looking out first and foremost for their own interest,"  added Wang Dan.    The shift in Chinese attitudes has moved dissidents to  reconsider matters. Without abandoning their democratic ideals,  they are trying to redirect their campaign to deal with problems  faced in the day-to-day lives of most Chinese such as tenants'  rights and job layoffs.    "We absolutely must be closer to the people," says Bao Ge, a  human rights campaigner in Shanghai who wants to form a new  organization dedicated to solving concrete social problems.    "One of the things the leadership fears is that dissidents  manage to integrate themselves into society," said a European  diplomat in Beijing. "And that is why the campaign of  repression has not let up."</p>

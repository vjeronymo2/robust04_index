			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jab": "Who Is Who and Who Was What?; Political </F> Officers of the Previous Regime Are Being Heaved Into Top Army  Positions"]    [Excerpts] General Vacek, former minister of defense, has  remained loyal to the army even as a pensioner. To this day, he  is moving without any restrictions in the highest military  circles, and his former subordinates receive him loyally and  cordially, with all honors. Whenever he visits an Army unit, he  is met by the commander's adjutant and must sign the visitors'  book, as though he were an officer in uniform. (This official  duty and regulation does not apply to the civilian Vacek.)    Of course, the minister of defense cannot be everywhere. He  should, however, make sure that key posts are held by people who  recognize the basic military virtue--discipline--and who  understand their service as one to their country and not to the  former minister. Will it be the prime minister again who will  himself have to set right all the potential Milovice and Ralsko  affairs [sites of former Soviet military bases, the  privatization of which had been sought by high-ranking officers  of the former communist-controlled Czechoslovak Army]?    Although 82 financial desks (offices) have been established  in the armed forces at a cost of some 200 million korunas, the  financial officers of individual units have self-evidently  retained their previous positions. The situation is reminiscent  of that of the Culture Ministry's Theater Department, which,  although it in practice no longer takes care of any theaters,  employs the same (and, according to some reports, an even  greater) number of people as it did in November 1989.  <H5>  "We Do Not Have Other Experts" </H5>   Minister Baudys (we would like to take his side, were it not  that so many results of the Army's transformation testify  against him) keeps saying that "we do not have any other  experts." Leaving aside the experts who have built for Baudys a  laser firing range directly in his office, the chief occupation  of the "Ministry of Defense and General Staff experts" is how to  create jobs for their fellow warriors from the era of struggle  against the imperialist threat, who would otherwise face  redundancy. Whereas in the Armies of the United States, Great  Britain, and even Sweden staff numbers in logistics are being  cut as a result of computerization, in our country they are  growing. Is the minister too busy?    And what about the much-touted operation against the number  of drones who worked as political officers and against the  maladies of our military past in general?  <H5>  What Kind of Experts Do We Have? </H5>   Colonel Josef Bagin, former chief of Military  Counterintelligence, today works at the head office of the  Military Police.    Colonel Frantisek Dvorak, former chief of the Military  Counterintelligence Inspection Office in Prague, is today chief  of the Ministry of Defense Inspection Authority, which is also  in charge of Military Defense Intelligence. He has built his  military career on his friendship with Gen. Vacek, which  constitutes, at the very least, the potential risk of  information leaks.    Colonel Josef Dvorak, former chief of Military  Counterintelligence in Tabor, can be found serving in Mlada  Boleslav today.    General Klima, a participant in the Second Nationwide  Congress of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (so much  for nonparty members), is commander of the 2d Combined Aviation  Corps in Hradec Kralove.    Colonel Burda (today commander of the Combined Transport  Regiment in Pardubice) acquired fame when he declared, as late  as 1990, that "the lessons from the crisis-ridden development [a  hardline communist document on lessons to be learned from the  "Prague Spring" of 1968] are and will always remain valid" for  him.    Colonel Pavel Vesely, former chairman of the Communist Party  of Czechoslovakia Committee at the Brno Military Academy, who is  a friend of [chief of General Staff] General Nekvasil, is today  commander of the Prerov air base. Lieutenant Colonel Reznak,  formerly political officer of military unit 1,562, has found a  safe haven in military unit 1,999 in Pardubice.  <H5>  Experts With a Title Before and After the Name </H5>   Colonel Docent Engineer Frantisek Korinek, candidate of  sciences, involved as a functionary in "Operation Wave" [planned  by the communist regime to crack down on its critics], serves  with a high rank at the Higher Military School of Ground Forces  in Vyskov, where he is educating future experts.    Colonel Docent Engineer Frantisek Blaha, another functionary  involved in "Operation Wave," heads the Department for  Pedagogical Science at the Brno Military Academy. From other  officers involved in "Operation Wave," we will also find there  Lieutenant Docent F. Vizdal, Ph.D. and candidate of sciences.    Colonel Docent Zdenek Rozum, Ph.D., candidate of sciences,  formerly a staffer at the Evening University of  Marxism-Leninism, is now deputy departmental head at the Brno  Military Academy. [passage omitted]    On the other hand, officers who refused to sign a  resolution in support of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  in November 1989, who were never members of the Communist Party  of Czechoslovakia, who did not abet former political officers,  and who have helped shed light on the Army's involvement in  Operations "Wave" and "Intervention" [another operation against  critics of the regime planned during the latter stages of the  communist regime], are being harassed and liquidated "in the  spirit" of the minister's Order 023 about interviews and ways of  dealing with personnel issues. For example, Captain Kjucukov,  from the Third Communications Battalion in Breclav, who helped a  Ministry of Defense commission of inquiry decode General Petr's  coded message number 4A, became victim to permanent harassment  in service and, under psychological pressure from the commander  of the engineering battalion, left for civilian life on 31  January 1994.  <H5>  What Did Gen. Nekvasil Have To Say? </H5>   All the names cited above are from a letter that a group of  officers from Olomouc addressed to the Defense and Security  Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this January.    How did Gen. Nekvasil, chief of the General Staff of the  Czech Army, react?    On 1 March 1994 (speaking apparently on behalf of all  officers who, like himself, underwent their military training  and education toward subservience in the USSR), he declared: It  is necessary to put an end to the inflammatory voices from  Olomouc, which disrupt the working climate and lecture the  General Staff on what to do in the Army.    What can one add to this? A group of officers from Olomouc  had turned to their constitutional officials, which is, and  should be, their right, guaranteed by the Constitution.  <H5>  No One Takes Any Interest in the Contents of the Complaint </H5>   The solution resembles those that the Ministry of the  Interior used to apply [in the 1950's], when some prisoner  managed to smuggle out from a forced labor camp a letter with a  complaint. The investigation, and, of course, the subsequent  punishment concerned as a matter of principle the "illegal  sending," while the contents of the complaint went unheeded.    The senders of the Olomouc letter are in for similar  treatment today. The gray pigeons raised their eyebrows and  told themselves that the buoyant heads who had written to the  Defense and Security Affairs Committee must be cut down to size  [sentence as published, apparently a literary allusion].    We do not have anything against members of the Defense and  Security Affairs Committee, and we believe that its members are  decent, educated people. Nonetheless, similar practices disrupt  the trust of the citizens (and not only those who are  conscripted) in their freely elected representatives. If a  citizen is made to feel again and again that there is no right  and no justice, the result is a devastating percentage of people  who have no confidence in parliament. Naturally, this also  means no confidence in the parliamentary system as such. Free  criticism and control represent the foundations of democracy, as  those who read [philosopher and first Czechoslovak President]  T.G. Masaryk know. In U.S. Army barracks, you will find posters  with the text: Blow the Whistle! [last three words published in  English] What it means is: Blow the whistle and let it be  known when you witness something in your service that you  genuinely dislike. The text is usually followed by a list of  all the things that give you the right to blow the whistle.    If some blowing of the whistle (for example, a letter to a  congressman) were to be followed by harassment, those guilty of  it would get into very serious trouble.    It may be possible that even competent and decent people  could be found among the experts who graduated from Soviet  military schools and who were members of the Communist Party of  Czechoslovakia. But how realistic is it to expect competence  and decency from them, after the experience of the past 50 years?</p>

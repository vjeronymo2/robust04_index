			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Indicate money spent per pupil Sir, Your inclusion of an indicator of social deprivation in the league table of school results ('Schools' league tables', November 22) is one step to providing more information about the achievement of the schools involved. However, if the additional educational needs index, from which your indicator was taken, is also an indicator of the amount of taxpayers' money spent per pupil, then it is misleading not to include this figure as well.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 16 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation intends to race ahead with its Partnership  for Peace plan to forge military links with East Europe and  Russia, a NATO source said here at the weekend.    "There is mega-pressure on everyone to get it up and  running," he said. NATO leaders signed the Partnership  initiative at a summit here last week. It has not yet been  formally accepted by the countries of the former Soviet bloc.    However, East Europe plus Russia and other countries of the  former Soviet Union said during U.S. President Bill Clinton's  swing through the region after the summit last week that they  intended to sign up to the initiative.    Senior NATO military officials are scheduled to tour East  European countries and possibly Russia in coming weeks to  explain exactly what options for cooperation with NATO are on  offer.    The NATO source, speaking on condition that he not be  identified, said the team could be headed by U.S. General  George Joulwan, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe.    The options range from joint military manoeuvres,  peacekeeping, search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations  to military communications, defence planning, training and the  clean-up of old Soviet military bases.    Each country will be allowed to choose from the options and  decide the level of participation in Partnership for Peace, the  source said, adding that the choice would depend partly on what  each country could afford.    Military officers from East Bloc countries are expected to  establish themselves before mid-year at NATO headquarters here  and at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE)  near the Belgian city of Mons.    The first joint task force exercises are expected to start  later this year on a small scale in disaster relief or  peacekeeping.    "But they will have a high symbolic value to show that  things  are moving," the source said. He added that quick  implementation of the initiative was critical to its  credibility. [passage omitted]    Asked whether Russia might object to NATO exercises with  countries of the former Soviet bloc, the NATO source said  initial projects would involve "things that the Russians in  their wildest dreams could not consider provocative."    He said Russia had so far expressed no objections to  German-Danish-Polish military manoevres scheduled in the  European autumn, involving naval exercises in the Baltic Sea and  land exercises in Denmark.

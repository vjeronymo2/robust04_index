			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Collor calls Congress session on pensions BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor de Mello has called an emergency session of the Brazilian Congress to discuss how to fund a 147 per cent increase in pensions granted by the Supreme Court on Monday. The ruling followed a two-month legal battle and came as a blow to the government which had argued that the state pension fund was bankrupt and that the Treasury did not have the necessary funds for the increase. An economy ministry official said yesterday that the extra Dollars 6bn that the government had now to pay out this year would wipe out the increases in revenue it was expecting as a result of its recent tax reform and thus jeopardise its planned fiscal adjustment currently under the scrutiny of the International Monetary Fund. Brazil is hoping for the approval of a Dollars 2bn loan from the IMF later this month. Mr Collor went on national television last night to announce his decision to hold an emergency session of congress after spending the day locked in meetings with senior economy ministry officials. He warned that the pension increases threatened the government's battle against inflation, currently running at 24 per cent a month. 'Any householder knows he cannot spend more than he earns,' he said. 'The 147 per cent rise means a brutal increase in our expenses for which we do not have the money at a time when we are trying to cut costs to balance our budget. We will not meet demands by printing more money.'</p>

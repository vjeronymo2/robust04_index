			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exports help lift Chemring 9.5% to Pounds 5.7m Pre-tax profits at Chemring Group, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof clothes, rose 9.5 per cent from Pounds 5.21m to Pounds 5.71m in the year to September 30. With turnover up by only 4 per cent to Pounds 39.4m (Pounds 37.9m), margins were improved, said Mr Philip Billington, chairman, because of the monitoring of group costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Exports accounted for 61 per cent of turnover. The defence side still accounted for 60 per cent of turnover, in spite of efforts to lift the civil side. 'Defence keeps rising,' Mr Billington said, 'and there's still a significant number of little wars.' He added that while Budgets might cut the numbers of big-ticket items like aircraft, countermeasures remained strong sellers to armed services. Middle East markets continued to expand, while the growing economies of east Asia wanted independent defence forces, Mr Billington said. Chemring commands some 65 per cent of the global market in its commercial marine business, though recession shrank the leisure side. Fully diluted earnings were 18.8p (17.2p) per share and the final dividend is lifted to 6p for a 9p (8.15p adjusted ) total.</p>

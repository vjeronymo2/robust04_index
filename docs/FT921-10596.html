			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Number of estate agency branches shows steep drop THE ESTATE agency industry in Britain has contracted sharply because of the housing market recession, a survey has found. The total number of estate agency branches has fallen from a peak of 6,500 in 1988 to just over 5,000 at the end of last year, according to the February edition of Estate Agency News, a trade magazine. Only two agency chains, Royal Life and Halifax, now have more than 500 branches each, compared with seven chains in 1988. At that time, Royal Life and Halifax had more than 800 branches each and were trying to reach a target of 1,000 branches. Most of the large chains are continuing to make heavy losses, and the magazine describes the estate agency business as an industry in decline. Prudential Property Services, then the largest agency in the market, has since withdrawn altogether, shutting down 250 branches and selling more than 600. However, some chains are still growing, usually by buying the branches of the longer-established loss-making chains such as Prudential Property Services. One of the most impressive new entrants to the market is Woolwich Building Society, which bought 210 offices from Prudential and re-established the Chesterton brand name in central London. Woolwich, which had no chain at the height of the housing boom, now has 400 offices - putting it ahead of Nationwide, the second-largest building society, which has fallen back to 378 agencies from 400. Connell, owned by Scottish Widows, the life assurance company, has added 68 branches, also bought from Prudential Property Services. A further 30 branches purchased from Prudential by Connell were closed. A new chain, Arun Estates, has been set up to take over 108 branches from Prudential. It is now the largest privately owned chain in the UK. Altogether the top 20 agencies closed one in 10 of their branches last year, and the contraction of the industry looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>

It was Portland's biggest margin in any period this season.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers (32-32), took the lead with a 13-5 run, six by Drexler, to  start the third quarter. Consecutive layups by Drexler gave the Blazers a 54-51  lead with 8:48 left in the period.  </P> <P> Portland added a 12-0 run later in the quarter, with Drexler scoring eight. The  Trail Blazers made 16 of 27 shots in the period.  </P> <P> Phoenix 115, Miami 97 -- Tom Chambers scored 26 points and Kevin Johnson had 12  of his 21 points in the decisive third quarter as the Suns won their 11th  straight at home.  </P> <P> Jeff Hornacek and Eddie Johnson added 20 points each for Phoenix, which is 30-4  in Veterans Memorial Coliseum this season, including 26 of the last 28 there.  </P> <P> New York 129, Philadelphia 109 -- Patrick Ewing had 31 points and 14 rebounds  and Rod Strickland added 22 points and 10 assists at Philadelphia as the Knicks  won for the seventh time in nine games and broke a four-game road losing  streak.  </P> <P> Leading, 83-70, with 6:53 left in the third quarter, the Knicks outscored  Philadelphia, 17-2, and took their biggest lead of the game, 100-72, on a layup  by Kiki Vandeweghe with 2:13 left in the quarter. Philadelphia never got closer  than 20 points thereafter.  </P> <P> Cleveland 103, Washington 97 -- John Williams scored six points during a key  12-3 run early in the fourth quarter and the Cavaliers tied a team record with  seven three-point baskets at Richfield, Ohio.  </P> <P> Ron Harper scored 23 points and Craig Ehlo 21 for Cleveland, whose 48-17 record  is the best in the National Basketball Assn., 1 1/2 games better than idle  Detroit (45-17) in the Central Division. The Cavaliers, who missed only one of  their eight attempts from the three-point line, have won 24 of their last 25 at  home.  </P> <P> Washington led, 55-51, at halftime and maintained a narrow margin for most of  the third quarter. But Darnell Valentine's three-pointer with one second left  in the period -- only his third of the season -- gave the Cavaliers a 79-77  lead.  </P> <P> Boston 119, San Antonio 108 -- Ed Pinckney scored nine of his 22 points in a  15-4 third-quarter run at Boston that carried the Celtics to their 20th  consecutive victory over the Spurs.  </P> <P> Led by Reggie Lewis' 24 points, Boston won for the fifth time in six games.

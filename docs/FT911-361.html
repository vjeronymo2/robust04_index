			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / East German wage rises criticised DISRUPTIVE migration of east Germans into west Germany is likely to be spurred rather than lessened by high wage rises east of the Elbe, according to a study conducted by US economists. The report, from the University of California at Berkeley, is critical of the sharp rise in wages in east Germany since unification got under way last year. By accentuating the cost squeeze on already uncompetitive east German companies, the rise of 42 per cent in nominal wages in the first 10 months of last year has contributed to mass unemployment and short-time working. After extensive analysis and field work in east Germany, the study calls the economic collapse there 'one of the worst and sharpest depressions in European history'. Opinion surveys carried out for the team in east Germany challenge the conventional German wisdom on the reasons for east-west migration. Both the government and trade unions maintain that wage differentials between east and west need to be reduced to ease the danger of a further influx westwards of east Germans. Nominal east German wages are only about 50 per cent of west German levels. A number of recent pay deals envisage equalising pay rates by 1994. 'We found that few workers will migrate for higher western wages. Most prefer to work in the east in spite of the wage differential, and are prepared to wait there for new jobs to appear if they become unemployed,' says the report, which will appear in the spring issue of Brookings Papers on Economic Activity. It concludes: 'Higher wages (in east Germany) will cause more migration by increasing unemployment than they will deter by closing the wage gap.' The report recommends that the Bonn government pay a wage subsidy or 'employment bonuses' to all private sector companies hiring in the east. Last year's wage rises were in contrast to a 50 per cent reduction in industrial output and in the prices of manufactured goods in east Germany after the introduction of the D-Mark on July 1 1990. The report says the suggested wage subsidy could be as high as 75 per cent of a worker's wage. The scheme would more or less pay for itself as it would foster economic activity by increasing profitability and investments. Expenditure on the subsidy would be offset by additional state income from tax and social security contributions, reductions in unemployment benefit payments, and by enhancing the value of privatised companies. Although criticism of high wage levels has also been made by German economists and, increasingly, the government, the US economists are the first to offer a detailed solution to the problem. They say their proposed wage subsidy would make a crucial difference to the survival prospects of most east German companies. After currency union last year, they estimate, only 8 per cent of the east German labour force worked in companies which earned sufficient revenue to cover short-term costs. The fundamental problem hindering privatisation of east German companies is that most of them have negative value, since their costs exceed revenue in the absence of great productivity improvements.

The rapid population growth and the expansion of urban  services, combined with fundamental investments, indicate a  bright future for this port.    Chabahar Port, on the shores of the Sea of Oman, with a  favorable location and connected to the mainland, is considered  the third free port of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and in  terms of space and resources is the best transit center for  goods from the sea to Central Asia and Afghanistan.    High-quality roads have made it possible for goods coming in  on ships to be transported over land in the shortest possible  time to their destiny of the republic to the north of our  country.    For this reason, on the invitation of the public relations  office of the Ports and Shipping Organization of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, a number of media representatives visited the  ports in this region, the results of which you will read below.    According to the correspondent of the Economic Division of  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, Mr. Habibollah Ra'ufi, the director general  of the office of Ports and Shipping of the Province of Sistan Va  Baluchestan, at a gathering of media reporters who had traveled  to Chabahar, announced that 98 percent of the activities of  Chabahar Port have been given to the private sector and are only  supervised by the Central Office of Ports and Shipping of this  province. He said: In connection with the policy of reducing  imports, in the nine months of this year, the amount of  unloading of goods in Chabahar Port has decreased by 40 percent  compared to a similar period last year.    He said: Before the revolution the Chabahar region was a  deprived village with a population of 5,000 and lacked asphalted  roads and urban services. After the start of the port building,  fishing, and multipurpose dock projects, facilities such as  desalination and naval communications systems were created, and  at the preset this port has a population of 50,000 people.    Mr. Ra'ufi pointed out: In the province of Sistan Va  Baluchestan, there are about 300 km of sea borders. The first  port created in Chabahar was the "Martyr Beheshti Port," which  is southwest of the city, and its dock was rapidly installed in  nine months in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] and put into  operation.    The above-mentioned dock is 1 km from the shore with docking  stations each 150 meters long for ships up to a capacity of  25,000 tons and is the central dock in this region.    He added: The area and the coastal facilities of Martyr  Beheshti Dock take up a total of 2,000 hectares[ha], of which 36  ha are open warehouses and 18,000 ha covered warehouses.    Ra'ufi mentioned the total cost of the building of the  Martyr  Beheshti Port dock at $27 million in foreign currency and 1  billion in rials and said: In this port, five desalination  machines have been built, the capacity of each of which is 500  cubic meters, a total of 2,500 cubic meters per day. If more are  needed in the future, it can be expanded by up to 10 machines.    Also, because of these facilities (desalination) in the  port,  we are able to provide water needed by the transit ships.    The cost of the desalination machines is 30 million DM in  foreign currency and 18 million tomans in rials, which has all  been done by the private sector.    Concerning the operation of the nine months of this year of  the ports and shipping of the province of Sistan Va Baluchestan,  Mr. Ra'ufi said: From Farvardin [21 March-20 April] to the end  of Azar this year [21 December 1993], 32 ships have entered  Chabahar Port and about 650,000 tons of goods unloaded. Of this  amount, 400,000 tons were dry goods, and the remaining 250,000  tons were oil products.    The director-general of ports and shipping of Sistan Va  Baluchestan said concerning the future programs of Martyr  Beheshti Port: We have a large program planned for this port.  For example, the wave-breaker project of this port, at 3 km in  length with 12 dock stations, the installation of which will  start in one month by Iranian experts and engineers and is  projected to take five years.    He mentioned its weather as one of the advantages of this  port, which is the warmest in the country in winter and the  coolest in summer.    The director-general of ports and shipping of the province  of  Sistan Va Baluchestan announced that if the problem of goods  transit is resolved in this region, this port will grow and  said: If more facilities, such as customs exemptions, etc., are  provided in this port for ships, the ships will be more willing  to come to this region. Also, given the low cost of labor in  this region, investors can invest in native industries, such as  fishing, which in addition to creating jobs will also affect  exports.    It is noteworthy that during the stay of the representatives  of the media, one ship with a Cypriot flag and Cuban crew, which  carried 14,000 tons of sugar purchased by the Islamic Republic  from Brazil, docked at the Martyr Beheshti dock to unload and  was immediately unloaded by the personnel of the port and sent  in trailers to various centers of the country, including sugar  factories.    This report also indicates: The representatives of the media  visited the nonprofit girls school complex of Martyr Beheshti  (Hadaf), which has been built by the Central Office of Ports and  Shipping of the province of Sistan and Baluchestan, at the  levels of preschool, elementary school, middle school, and high  school.    This school has a staff of 20, and at the levels of  preschool, elementary school, and middle school, 65, 120, and 45  students, respectively, are studying. Students in this school  take part in such extracurricular activities as sewing,  computers, typing, reading and recitation of the Koran, and  calligraphy.    The principal of the Martyr Beheshti Girls Schools (Hadaf),  referring to the long distance and lack of housing and resources  of the teachers and personnel of this educational center,  expressed hope that next year teacher training school graduates  of the province will be used in teaching.</p>

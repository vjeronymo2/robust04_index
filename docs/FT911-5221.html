			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Uganda pins its hope on an economic revival to help it fight Aids: The twin problems of a country burdened by a deadly epidemic and an economy struggling with debt and inflation DAVID, a thin young man with an emaciated frame, drawn face and bulging eyes, walked falteringly towards the car waiting to drive him to a funeral. David, 23, a former guerrilla who helped bring the present government to power, is a victim of Aids, or 'Slim' as it is known in Uganda. Thousands have already died from the disease. In David's home town of Masaka, south-west of the capital Kampala, and in nearby villages, more than half the young adults are HIV positive, infected with the virus that causes Aids. Nationally, the Uganda Aids Control Programme estimates that more than 1m people are HIV positive out of a population of about 17m. The government forecasts that by 2010 more than half the projected population of some 37m will have died of Aids. The epidemic is now threatening to undermine the measure of political and economic stability achieved since President Yoweri Museveni came to power five years ago. Mr Museveni assumed the presidency in January 1986 after waging a five-year guerrilla campaign which brought down the military government which had itself overthrown the five-year rule of Milton Obote six months previously. His administration has since been marked by a broad-based appeal for reconciliation and political stability. But in the past three years, the main aim has been to rehabilitate the economy. The hope is that an economic cure may alleviate some of the social problems of poverty and malnutrition which make parts of Uganda susceptible to diseases such as Aids. To that end the government has: Published an investment code aimed at attracting foreign investment; Reduced inflation from 240 per cent in 1988 to 29 per cent in 1990; Rebuilt a large part of the once-crumbling trunk road network and infrastructure; Improved the provision of essentials, such as sugar and soap; Enhanced medical services; Reduced the currency black market by devaluing the Ugandan shilling and authorised the establishment of bureaux de change. The World Bank will this year lend around Dollars 200m for reconstruction projects, having loaned similar amounts in each of the past three years as part of a structural adjustment programme. The price of that programme has been tough: it has included frequent devaluations, increased producer prices to the peasant growers of Uganda's main export, coffee; the abolition of inefficient state-owned marketing monopolies (except in cotton); and a concerted effort to cut the budget deficit. Having finally published an investment code last November after months of debate, plans are now afoot to sell off loss-making state-owned companies, particularly those in better shape, to foreign investors. Cutting inflation has been one of the government's big successes. The end-of-year target for 1991 is 15 per cent. With an impressive 6-7 per cent increase in gross domestic product in each of the past three years, the World Bank has pronounced the country's economic prospects as 'good to excellent'. The economy has suffered, however, from poor world prices for coffee - the country's main crop and leading foreign exchange earner. Since the 1989 collapse of the International Coffee Agreement, which aimed to support prices through an export quota system, earnings from coffee exports have fallen to about Dollars 220m last year, from around Dollars 285m in 1989. According to the World Bank, Uganda suffered both a 30 per cent shortfall in foreign exchange earnings last year as a direct result of the ICA collapse, and the loss of local revenue levied as export tax on coffee exports. This further weakened the balance of payments, already under pressure because of the Gulf war-induced higher oil prices. Lower foreign exchange earnings have also caused difficulties in servicing the country's Dollars 1.5bn debt. The reforms have nevertheless begun to attract foreign business interests. Mr John Dorrell, of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who led a delegation of British businessmen to Uganda last November said: 'When we came here in 1987 the country was on its knees; now it is showing signs of life. It is a market worth Pounds 39.2m (Dollars 69m) to British exporters, up by 18 per cent on 1989.' Britain is one of Uganda's main trading partners. Foreign investor interest has also come from a number of Ugandan Asians, who formed the backbone of the business community before their mass expulsion by Idi Amin in 1972. Two once-powerful Ugandan Asian industrial groups, run by the Madhvani and Mehta families, have already returned to Uganda and between them now produce some 60,000 tonnes of sugar - enough to meet local needs. Ugandan-born Mr Nazimu Virani, chairman of UK property-to-pubs group Control Securities, whose family were among the 60,000-strong Asian community expelled by Amin, is leading a high-powered delegation of British businessmen and industrialists to Uganda with the aim of identifying potential areas of investment. But Asians' confidence is unlikely to be wholly restored so long as the government fails to offer compensation for an estimated Pounds 2bn of property expropriated by Idi Amin following his purge of Asians. Yet potential foreign investors will need to be convinced that other problems which threaten stability are being overcome. The army has been accused by Amnesty International, the human rights body, of killing civilians, and corruption remains widespread. For one former soldier, however, the future is bleak. David, the aids sufferer, stared into the ground and said: 'We fought in the war to stop us being killed by the army. Now we are all dying of Aids anyway.'</p>

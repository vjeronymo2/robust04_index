After  many other war declarations by a number of Futungo de Belas'  radical wing leaders, now it is the turn of Joao de Matos,  Eduardo dos Santos' war chief, who has come out to say no to  peace. Speaking to JORNAL DE ANGOLA, which serves the regime,  the head of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola tried to deceive the world, accusing UNITA of preparing  for an extremely violent war regardless of the outcome of Lusaka  talks.    However, sources from the General Staff of the Armed Forces  for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] reacted violently to such  statements, describing them as a hallucination. The same  sources said the main aim of the interview granted by Joao de  Matos yesterday was to prepare the ground to camouflage military  offensives being launched by his troops in various parts of  Angola, as well as to justify other possible military operations  against areas controlled by UNITA. The truth is that the main  intention of the regime's radical wing is to continue fighting,  although without success, until the hoped for possibility of  eliminating UNITA, as by Lucio Lara stated in his recent remarks  in France. The sources from the FALA General Staff call on the  international community, particularly the United Nations, who  are mediating the Angolan conflict, to condemn all these  Machiavellian actions from the Futungo de Belas since they  considerably endanger the current peace process.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Clarke says public liked Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday said the Budget had provided the government with a 'firm grip' on public spending and it had set Britain back on the road to recovery. Winding up the five-day Commons debate on the Budget Mr Clarke told MPs that future generations would have paid a heavy price in increased taxes if he had not tackled Britain's public-sector deficit. 'What has been clear is that the public outside . . . have responded favourably to a Budget setting out frankly and candidly how we are going to tackle the country's problems. 'We are making progress towards getting on top of the PSBR, which if it was not tackled would lead to increased taxation for later generations as the interest piled up, and short term pressure on interest rates.' At the end of the debate a government motion to implement the Budget was approved by 326 votes to 291, a majority of 35. Earlier in the day Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, praised the principal aim of the Budget to reduce the deficit. 'Nothing would have been more calculated to throw away the competitive edge we now enjoy than a failure to take the difficult decisions about the deficit, and to take them now,' he said. He also used his speech in the debate to announced initiatives to help industry and small businesses. These included an increase from Pounds 14m to Pounds 17m in start-up funding for Business Link outlets. The outlets are designed to bring together most of the services provided by training and enterprise councils, chambers of commerce, local authorities, enterprise agencies and other private-sector organisations. The first outlets have opened in Birmingham, Leicester and in Congleton in Cheshire. Mr Heseltine said Tecs - which deliver government training schemes in England and Wales - 'have a key strategic role in organising the provision of business support services'. Tecs' budgets for services to small businesses - most of which will be taken into Business Link outlets - are to increase slightly to Pounds 33m. Mr Heseltine also announced an environmental technology best-practice programme, worth Pounds 16m. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said spending by Mr Heseltine's department would fall about 12 per cent in real terms in the next three years. 'Out of 18 spending departments, the DTI is 17th,' said Mr Cook.</p>

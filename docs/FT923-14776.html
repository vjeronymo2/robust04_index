			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Munich finds G7 summit a heady brew MR Horst Kohler, state secretary in Germany's finance ministry, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's seemingly indefatigable sherpa for the world economic summit, is adamant it is not all pre-cooked. It is certainly not for want of trying. He has spent months frantically shuttling around the capitals of the G7 states, and Moscow, to ensure nothing goes wrong on the day. His other great aim, on the chancellor's instructions, has been to try to restore the summit's old style of a cosy fireside chat. He has succeeded in cancelling a whole plenary session - when all the accompanying retinue of foreign, finance and trade ministers try to get in on the act - in favour of four hours' more debate among the great men. But tell the good citizens of Munich that the whole exercise is about an intimate and unpredictable conversation, and you get nothing but a hollow laugh. For the capital of the proud Free State of Bavaria has been thrown into turmoil for weeks because of the pre-planned razzamatazz, and the citizens are feeling sore. There is no sign of slackening in the circus - half security overkill, half media madness - which traditionally surrounds the event. Only here it has been compounded by the absolute determination of the Bavarian government to ensure everyone enjoys it in style. For a start some 8,600 policemen and women have been drafted in to ensure security. Don't try to ask them the way. 'I'm sorry, I've just come from Thuringia,' said a confused young man from the former East Germany. It's a good sign of the times. If he was a policeman under the old regime, he probably would not have apologised first. They've cordoned off most of the city centre for the three-day event, threatening traffic chaos when shop workers return. And people who live in apartments overlooking the Residenz palace and Hofgarten where the summit takes place have been forced to buy passes for DM18 (Pounds 6.20) apiece to get in and out of their own homes - at least according to Bavarian TV. There's no doubt the media provide most of the madness. Around the famous Wittelsbach palace everything is festooned with the electronic wiring and gadgetry which demonstrates that communication is what it's all about. The corridors of the palace are filled with assault teams of bright-pink-blazered ladies from Deutsche Telekom, advertising every intricacy of Germany's idiosyncratic telephone system, which seems scarcely compatible with most of the imported US and Japanese equipment. Cursing correspondents tear their hair. As for the world leaders' ladies, they get their own programme, which makes no concessions to equal rights: lunch with Frau Hannelore Kohl in the appropriately named Englischer Garten, sightseeing, Bizet's Carmen at the Opera, more sightseeing (the fairy-tale castles of Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein), a fashion show and a porcelain factory. All very feminine.</p>

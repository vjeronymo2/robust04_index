			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (9): The aim is to come top - Higher education has come of age HIGHER education in Devon has finally come of age. Forty years ago, the county could boast only an Exeter-based outpost of the University of London, not allowed to award degrees in its own right until 1955. A decade later came a polytechnic at Plymouth. This summer, Polytechnic South-West was transformed into the University of Plymouth under the government's policy of ending the formal segmentation of higher education. 'We were top of the poly league; now we are aiming for the top of the university league,' says Mr John Bull, vice-chancellor of the new university. But he stresses that he has 'zero intention' of abandoning the old polytechnic mission of promoting vocationally-oriented study and part-time and mature student courses. 'We remain committed to ensuring that teaching and research are directed to the needs of communities we serve.' A few figures graphically. spell out those needs. About a fifth of the university's 15,000 students are aged 25 or over; nearly half (excluding those on short courses) come from the south-west; almost half are women; agriculture, food, land use, business, education, science and technology account for almost all its courses; and around a third of its students study for the Higher National Diploma (HND), the top branch of the vocational tree. For Plymouth University, widening access is not simply a matter of encouraging a broader range of applications: it means moving out - physically - into the local community. A series of mergers in the late-1980s brought it a college of education in Exmouth, the Art and Design College of Exeter, and the Seale-Hayne Agricultural College at Newton Abbot. That gives it four campuses in all, to which should be added a dozen or more institutions - mostly further education colleges  - in Devon and the surrounding counties with which it has partnership or franchise arrangements. The university's growth has been extraordinarily rapid: it has almost doubled its student numbers since gaining independence from Devon County Council in 1989. With an income target of Pounds 60m this year, it has taken on a Pounds 12m capital spending programme financed entirely from its own resources and borrowing. 'Independence has been a remarkable stimulus to growth - particularly the funding council's encouragement to us to take students funded by fees only,' says Mr Bull. The former polytechnics emphasise teaching, not research. Plymouth University, though, exploits its science focus through a research and consultancy subsidiary called PEP Ltd. 'Most of our Pounds 1m turnover comes from close-to-market or government-funded projects,' says Mr Peter Webber, its principal consultant. Current projects include the design of software tools for flexible manufacturing, for which partners include Du Pont, a Belgian subsidiary of the US company; Jaguar, the British motor company, and Harland Simon (formerly John Brown Automation). Exeter University, too, emphasises its business and industrial links. Exeter Enterprises Limited, its consultancy arm, recently won a Pounds 100,000 Department of Trade grant to help it expand over the next three years, which it intends to use to open offices in Plymouth and to create a trading arm for its Biotechnology Research Group. Exeter University is unashamedly a national university - less than 10 per cent of its students come from Devon - and competition for places is strong. Its expansion has been glacial by Plymouth standards: full-time student numbers are at 7,000 rising by about 150 a year, with the number of academic staff up 100 on a decade ago. Education is its biggest department, under the direction of the ebullient Professor Ted Wragg. The university has just finished a multi-million pound project to provide accommodation for an extra 600 students. It is determined not to expand faster than its capacity to provide residential accommodation for almost all its intake. Dr David Harrison, Exeter's vice-chancellor, is keen to deepen the university's regional roots, but not at the expense of its national stature. 'We are concerned to recruit effectively north of the Trent, something we have not been particularly good at hitherto,' he says. Unsurprisingly, he is not enthusiastic about two year degrees or a re-structured academic year, and wants to keep small seminar groups of less than 10 as the norm for undergraduate teaching. 'Students, you know, are even more conservative on these kind of issues than we are,' he adds with a smile. Endowed with an impressive central site and 240 acres, Exeter university combines the virtues of the campus and the city-centre university. First year students mostly live in halls of residence, with self-catering accommodation available for most students in subsequent years. The university has a strong research focus. Dr Harrison has been resolute in concentrating its 'loose' research funding on departments highly rated by the Universities Funding Council, and he sees next February - when new research-quality ratings and a revised funding formula for teaching take effect - as 'a crunch date for us.' 'It may be that a few departments will be in for a shock,' he says. Since departments are also cost centres, the lower-rated could be obliged to pack in more students to maintain their income. Besides its main campus in Devon, Exeter University has an Institute of Cornish Studies in Camborne, Cornwall, carrying out research on Cornwall's economy and society as well as its cultural heritage. The university is also taking over the Camborne School of Mines, which will become part of its school of engineering. Exeter also boasts the first professorship of Complementary Medicine in Europe. Established this summer with a Pounds 1.5m donation from the Maurice Laing Foundation, the chair will strengthen its pioneering Centre for Complementary Health Studies.</p>

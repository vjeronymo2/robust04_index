			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF: ;  </P> <P> ** 1/2 JANE WIEDLIN, "TANGLED," EMI. ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR  (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> You wouldn't think the comely, unclad figure on the cover needs a diet, but  Wiedlin has to get off the sugar.  </P> <P> Half of "Tangled" is slick and over-sweet. The former Go-Go does much better  when setting her fragile, Cyndi Lauper sound-alike voice in more intimate  ballad surroundings. Wiedlin also excels in two anthems that engage broad  themes of war and freedom with emotional acuity. Why not make every song  matter? MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

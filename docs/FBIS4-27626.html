			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] An official of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] said that approximately 5,000 of the 8,000 nuclear  fuel rods at a five-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon have  already been replaced.    The official said: In the past 25 days, North Korea has  already changed approximately 5,000 -- over 60 percent -- of the  8,000 nuclear feul rods at the nuclear reactor. It continued  changing the feul rods even yesterday, when the IAEA called upon  North Korea not to do so.    He added: In the initial stages of replacing the fuel rods,  at least 300 fuel rods must be analyzed to verify the amount of  nuclear materials that may have been transformed. However, with  less than 3,000 nuclear fuel rods remaining, the results are  unreliable.    Also, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that because IAEA  inspectors could not confirm the location of approximately 40  fuel rods -- which North Korea says it has separately preserved  -- and because the location of the removed fuel rods has not  been disclosed, taking samples from them would not be worthwhile.</p>

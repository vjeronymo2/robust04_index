"Several tanks were withdrawn out of the northern part of  the  (NATO-declared) 20 kilometres (12-mile) exclusion zone," UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill  Aikman told reporters.    He said the tanks were spotted moving at about the 10  kilometres (six-mile) portion of the zone by UN military  observers.    The observers "did not have the capability to stop the  tanks," Aikman said.    But he said the movement of the 6 or 7 tanks was a clear  violation of the NATO ultimatum that expired a week ago for all  heavy artillery to be withdrawn from Sarajevo, where Serbs  besiege a mainly Moslem population.    As of the expiration date, all heavy guns, including tanks,  were to be withdrawn or placed under UNPROFOR control. If not,  NATO warplanes were to strike the weapons.    Aikman said the Serb tanks "appear to have been hidden  somewhere and then moved out."    They went through a point north of Vogosca, in hills north  of  Sarajevo.    Aikman said UNPROFOR would be "increasing patrols in the  area  to determine if there are any more" heavy weapons there.    UNPROFOR has admitted the Serbs have not handed over all  their weapons and the Bosnian Government charges that the Serbs  have kept up to 70 percent of the weapons they had targeted on  Sarajevo in the exclusion zone.</p>

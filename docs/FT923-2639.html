			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil and PTT to trade jointly in south east Asia STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, and PTT of Thailand, Thailand's state oil company, have agreed to trade crude oil products jointly in south east Asia from October, initially for one year. Mrs Berit Oeyen, a spokeswoman for Statoil, said the agreement to trade crude oil products on an inter-regional and regional basis strengthened its foothold in the South East Asian markets and provided a good basis for the expansion of trading activities established in Singapore earlier this year. Statoil will provide on-the-job training in crude oil products trading for PTT employees. The deal also includes a sales agreement in which Statoil will supply 'large volumes' of refined crude oil products to PTT. PTT is the largest importer in South East Asia of refined products and has a 25 per cent share of Thailand's downstream market. About 70 per cent of the country's oil consumption is met by imports. Last year, consumption was estimated at about 500,000 barrels a day, although Statoil believes it may be higher. Statoil has crude oil access of about 1.2m barrels a day from the North Sea, European refining capacity of 200,000 barrels of oil a day and is the largest net exporter of North Sea quality crude oil. Norway is the world's fourth biggest net exporter of crude oil. In addition, Statoil has hired refining capacity elsewhere in the world to meet the demand of refined products contracts. Under the terms of the agreement, Statoil will be required to maintain storage capacity in Singapore to guarantee supply to PTT. To this end, Statoil has agreed to hire storage capacity from Oil Tanking, a subsidiary of UK-based Mabanaft. The company is also negotiating refinery arrangements and expects to buy crude oil from the Middle East and South East Asia for refining. Mrs Oeyen said another purpose of the agreement was to expand co-operation further with PTT. Statoil has a 10 per cent stake in the Bongkot gas field in the Thai gulf. The field, operated by Total-CFP, is scheduled to come on-stream in June 1993.</p>

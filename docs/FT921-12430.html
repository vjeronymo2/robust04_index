			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: HK speeds legislation on paperless trading HONG KONG took a further step towards paperless share trading with the government's decision to bring forward legislation to enable the creation of a central stock clearing and settlements system. Mr David Nendick, secretary for monetary affairs, said the legislation would be introduced next month. Legislation is needed to insulate the new system from Hong Kong's existing insolvency laws - thereby guaranteeing the integrity of the netting and settlement operations of the system. The share trading and settlements system, which the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company (HKSCC) will operate, works on the basis of continuous netting of transactions. Under current law, if a broker were declared insolvent the receiver could unwind transactions up to six months previous to the insolvency. The change will prevent this and give the HKSCC a first charge over securities to be settled. Hong Kong's new trading system was due to be operational by late 1991 but, as with London's attempt to introduce Taurus, Hong Kong has faced technological and institutional problems. Mr Nendick said the system should be operational by the end of this year. Questions, however, still dog the HKSCC - 50 per cent owned by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and 10 per cent each by five banks - concerning risk management and the governance of the company. It is planned that a fund of HKDollars 200m will be established to guarantee settlement of share trades in the event of broker default. Some brokers feel this is insufficient to protect against possible default. Before the system becomes operational the company has to satisfy the Securities and Futures Exchange, Hong Kong's financial watchdog, that there is adequate representation on its board to safeguard the public interest.</p>

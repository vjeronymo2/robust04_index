			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Boom time for smugglers' paradise - The contraband business on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan Mr Mohammad Shafi leans across his shop counter and points towards a small 'Peacock' brand Chinese television lying in a corner. 'You won't ever get it as cheap as here' claims the sturdy, tall tribesman, whose shop is lined with a large variety of electronic goods such as air conditioners, refrigerators, stereo equipment and fancy electronic telephones. Mr Haji Mohammad, another shopkeeper nearby shouts at two of his assistants, who are off-loading a fresh consignment of electrical goods which arrived in a truck before sunrise, using a mountainous track to conveniently evade police check-posts along the road leading to the border. Mr Mohammad wants the consignment of refrigerators to be placed neatly outside his shop before customers arrive. Both shopkeepers are among hundreds of businesses at Hayatabad market outside Peshawar, Pakistan's northern frontier town, whose fortunes have risen as smuggling has flourished in this country in the past 12 to 15 years. The market has much more to offer for all clients such as expensive crockery, unstitched cloth, Italian shoes, perfumes from Paris and even aphrodisiacs neatly packed in tiny square boxes with instructions in Chinese and Russian, hidden under labels in English. The market and other similar sites across the country are catching the eye of a growing number of businesses who are opposing the government's plans to introduce a VAT-style general sales tax. At a time when markets such as Hayatabad freely sell goods without charging any addition taxes, other businesses say the sales tax would break their back because it would further encourage their clients to buy smuggled goods. 'Whichever government has come, the menace of smuggling has only grown,' laments Mr Tahir Khaliq, a top businessman in Karachi, Pakistan's southern most city and the country's business capital. In over a year, one of Mr Khaliq's company has produced just over 1,000 'Peacock' televisions, although he had initially planned to assemble and sell twice that many. Mr Khaliq traces his troubles back to a place such as Hayatabad, over 1,600 km away, where shopkeepers can easily beat his prices. 'Our customers are being offered the same goods at up to 60 per cent of our price, and the goods are even delivered at their doorsteps,' claims Mr Khaliq, referring to the well-organised smuggling trade, reputed to have an annual turnover of Rupees 100bn (Pounds 2.18bn). The smuggling business flourishes in part due to widespread corruption in the police and taxation departments. Moreover, Pakistan's agreement to provide transit facilities for imports by businesses based in neighbouring Afghanistan is widely abused. Yet, companies in remote places there place orders for a large number of refrigerators, freezers and so on. 'Why is that so,' asks a senior government official. He says Pakistani smugglers in collusion with Afghan businesses take the imported items to cross the Afghan border using the transit facility, and then bring them back using remote mountain tracks. Privately, senior officials say the government is considering ways to curb the traffic in items for which there is little or no demand in Afghanistan. But it has to act fast and finalise its proposals before next summer, when a 30-year-old bilateral trade agreement comes up for renewal. But the same officials also acknowledge that a solution is difficult, especially as Islamabad does not want to erode its diplomatic influence over Afghanistan, which it has gained since it began backing the Islamic mujahideen resistance to the Soviet occupation in 1979.</p>

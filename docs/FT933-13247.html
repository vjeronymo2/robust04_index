			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Heavy buying by retail investors lifts Primerica PRIMERICA, the financial services group built by Mr Sanford Weill into the second-biggest stockbroker in the US, yesterday reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 186.4m, up from Dollars 149.6m a year earlier. This was achieved on the back of continuing heavy stock market investment by retail investors across the US. The figures were also bolstered by the inclusion of a Dollars 25.3m contribution from its 27 per cent stake in Travelers, the insurance group, acquired last September. The group's Smith Barney broking subsidiary, which is due to complete the takeover of stockbroker Shearson from American Express at the end of this month, turned in record earnings of Dollars 57.7m. This was up from Dollars 42.4m in the same period in 1992 and just ahead of the Dollars 57.5m of the first quarter. Commission income from trading was up by a quarter on a year earlier, at Dollars 145m, though it had fallen slightly from the peak of the first three months of this year. The takeover of Shearson had been delayed for operational reasons until the end of this month, and the absorption of the broker was continuing without problems, Primerica said. Stripping out the contribution from Travelers and other interest, net income from continuing operations was Dollars 161.1m, up from Dollars 144.9m the year before. A marked fall in loan-losses helped the group's consumer financial services division to turn in net income of Dollars 51.3m, up from Dollars 47.5m. The rate of write-offs fell to 2.34 per cent, from 2.86 per cent a year before. Income from insurance services was down at Dollars 60m from Dollars 64.7m, due to a charge of Dollars 4m to reflect a minority interest and flat sales of life insurance products at Primerica FInancial Services. 'We couldn't be more pleased with our company's performance,' said Mr Weill. The group had extended its debt profile, taking to 70 per cent the proportion of debts which are long-term and giving it greater flexibility to finance further growth, he added. Earnings per share advanced to Dollars 1.02, from 90 cents in the same quarter in 1992, but down from the first quarter's Dollars 1.03 a share.</p>

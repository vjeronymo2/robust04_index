			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY CONCERNS;  </P> <P> MONSANTO GETS OK TO SELL SILICON UNIT TO GERMANS  </P> <P> A high-level U.S. review board recommended Monday that the Bush Administration  not try to block plans by Monsanto to sell a silicon manufacturing subsidiary  in Palo Alto to a West German company, despite earlier concerns that it could  pose some national security risks.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the recommendation came after the would-be buyer provided  written assurances that it would keep the factories and research and  development facilities inside the United States.  </P> <P> The firm, known as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Co., is the nation's last  remaining major producer of silicon wafers, the materials from which the  semiconductors used in computers and other vital electronic products are made.  </P> <P> Monsanto has said it plans to sell the company to a West German firm, Huels AG,  a unit of West Germany's huge Veba AG conglomerate. Three potential U.S.  bidders, including one representing some employees in Palo Alto, also had  expressed interest in buying the plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case Goes to Bush  </P> <P> Although most of the agencies on the high-level panel had favored allowing the  sale to go through unimpeded, the Defense Department had raised concerns that  the United States might lose control over the plant -- particularly its  manufacturing and research and development facilities.  </P> <P> But Defense Department officials withdrew their objections Monday, and the  recommendation that the United States not block the sale now is unanimous. The  case goes to President Bush, who is considered certain to go along with the  recommendation. Bush has 15 days to decide.  </P> <P> The move to review the proposed sale of the Monsanto firm came under a  provision of the recently enacted Omnibus Trade Act, which made it easier for  outsiders -- including the affected firm's competitors -- to challenge the sale  of a domestic corporation to foreign buyers.  </P> <P> The government has been under increasing pressure from Congress to become  "tougher" about foreign acquisition of U.S. companies, particularly in the face  of the sharply lower dollar, which makes U.S. firms attractive to overseas  investors.  </P> <P> Rep. James J. Florio (D-N.J.), author of the trade act provision and chairman  of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, has vowed to conduct hearings on  the foreign acquisition issue.  </P> <P> Administration officials say they see nothing wrong per se with most foreign  investment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Production Fears Cited  </P> <P> The high-level government panel that conducted the review is known as the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and is made up of  sub-Cabinet-level officials from about half a dozen agencies and departments,  including Treasury, Defense, Commerce and State.  </P> <P> The review came after competing bidders had suggested that if Huels bought the  firm it would close a Monsanto plant in Missouri and only operate a  Spartanburg, S.C., facility, reducing America's ability to produce silicon.  Monsanto officials denied that charge.  </P> <P> The committee met informally to discuss the case a week ago but delayed any  decision until Monday, after Monsanto and Huels had had time to respond to the  Defense Department's objections. Had the United States sought to block the  move, another bidder would have stepped in. A purchase price on the acquisition  has not been disclosed.  </P></p>

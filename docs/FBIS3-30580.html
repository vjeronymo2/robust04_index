			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Moczulski, chairman of the </F> Confederation for an Independent Poland, by correspondent Jerzy  Palosz; place and date not given]    [Text] [Palosz] You are the author of the concept of the  "Intersea bloc"--that is, an alliance of East European states  that could constitute a counterbalance to Russia. Is that  project still in the cards today, after the Russian election?    [Moczulski] Of course it is. I would not overestimate the  outcome of the recent Russian election. We will probably react  to the results of the forthcoming March elections in Ukraine  with similarly mixed feelings. Another election is scheduled to  take place in Hungary, and its outcome could also be worrying.  Nevertheless, I would not overestimate the significance of these  phenomena because they only represent peculiar paroxysms of the  historical process. In our part of Europe, historical  developments do not occur in a linear progression. To use an  expression from the realm of meteorological science, you could  say that they develop in a turbulent manner. In addition,  accidental factors are often instrumental in bringing about  significant effects.    However, all of that does not alter the fact that Russia is  currently undergoing giant transformations. Immediately after  Yeltsin's unfortunate solution of his quarrel with parliament, I  voiced the opinion that that was the beginning of the end for  Yeltsin. The results of the election seem to confirm this. The  latest developments should not be seen as a solution but as an  even graver complication of the existing problem. Together with  the deteriorating economic situation and the increasingly  difficult living conditions of the population, the election  results suggest that the revolutionary processes in Russia will  continue to intensify....    [Palosz] But that does not apply to Russia alone....    [Moczulski] The entire area of postcommunist East Europe and  North Asia is currently the scene of great revolutionary  ransformations which, fortunately, have not yet assumed  particularly brutal forms, except in former Yugoslavia and parts  of Transcaucasia. I trust that the brutalization of the  revolution will not spread to the remaining postcommunist  countries, but we must be prepared, also in Poland, for the  possibility of a spread of popular mass movements that will be  largely spontaneous and can lead to a brutalization of the  chosen methods of action. Unfortunately, such are is the law of  history.    There was a chance to carry out the inevitable changes in  those countries in a calm and controlled manner. However, the  elites that have seized power there are on the whole not mature  enough to handle the tasks that face them, and they were unable  to muster enough imagination to cope with the intricacies of the  situation. Even Hungarians, who were arguably best at managing  their situation, could still develop problems as a result of the  unforeseen development provided by the death of Premier Antall.  In Poland, four successive Solidarity governments lost the  nation's support. Regardless of its intentions, the present  left-wing government is not likely to be equal to the task,  either, if only as a result of the disproportion between  election promises and the realities of the situation.    [Palosz] From the very moment of the establishment of the  Third Republic, our diplomats have consistently endeavored to  tie Poland to NATO, have they not?    [Moczulski] That goal is set purely as a propaganda move,  not as a realistic target. Poland's accession to NATO, if  effected in a way guaranteeing us genuine security, would mean  that our country would be included in the NATO military system.  To date, NATO has not even managed to embrace the former GDR  within that system. Even if the West was ultimately to prefer  the concept that Russia must be opposed by the application of  the strategy of shifting NATO eastward, we would have to wait at  least 10 years before such a decision could be put into  practice, and its realization would cost at least $100 billion,  if not more. On the other hand, if NATO's military structure is  not shifted to the east but Poland nevertheless receives  political guarantees of security, we could face a truly macabre  prospect. If we were indeed to encounter an aggressive attack  from the east, we would then find ourselves in the foreground of  NATO operations. These would entail the use of missiles and air  force units because NATO would then probably apply the tactic of  the notorious "200 small thermonuclear strikes." For us, such  defense would be a worse calamity than an outright defeat.  Today the question of NATO's political guarantees has only  political and psychological significance. It can be seen as a  test for the West and a test for Russia. On the other hand,  viewed as a policy that should actually be capable of ensuring  our genuine security, it is entirely devoid of any rationale and  has been so from the beginning.    [Palosz] So is the threat from the east greater now, after  the Russian election?    [Moczulski] I do not think so. That threat arises from the  constant principle present in the Russian political thought:  The interest of the Empire is more important than any domestic  problems. Of course, Russia is not doomed to subscribe to that  principle forever. However, its ruling elites must come to  realize that the goal of creating a better life for the Russian  people is more important than the ambition to expand Russia's  borders to reach the warm seas. The whole problem is that  Russia refuses to understand this, and that is why revolutions  have been erupting there roughly every 60-70 years--sometimes  initiated at the top of the social scale (Aleksandr II) and  sometimes at the bottom (the Bolsheviks). Will Russia  eventually move in the direction of resolving its internal  problems? There are no reasons whatsoever to believe that it  will. Let us remember the illusory hopes that arose after 1918,  envisaging an end to Russia's imperial policies with the  collapse of the system of czardom. All of that does not mean,  however, that we are right now in danger of being invaded. It  is true that there is a certain tendency to favor direct  invasion, which can be observed in Russia's policy toward  Estonia, in the Transcaucasia, and in the Crimea. Nevertheless,  it still does not mean that we can expect the Kremlin to issue a  decision for the Red Army to march westward. Instead, we should  rather expect a tendency to "export" unrest. For example, the  military formations in the region of Krolewiec [Kaliningrad],  which today are still a regular, orderly army, tomorrow could  well disintegrate into disorderly but still superbly armed gangs  of brigands. However, there is an even graver danger facing us  in the long run: that Russia will rebuild its military power  and Russians will still harbor a sense of having been wronged.  The sense of having been wronged is subjective; the Russian  people will recall that, even in their own living memory, the  frontiers of their empire extended as far as the Elbe, whereas  now they stop somewhere near Smolensk. Thus, we will have the  ground ready for the emergence of a phenomenon similar to the  "Hitler syndrome," which could have disastrous consequences also  for Russia itself.    [Palosz] So what course of action would you suggest?    [Moczulski] I suggest the idea of integrating the countries  of the proposed "Intersea bloc" along the Warsaw-Kiev axis.  This will provide the desirable geopolitical potential situated  west of Russia, large enough to be capable of effective  self-defense in economic, cultural, and military terms. The  best protection against invasion is a defense wall or, to be  precise, the awareness of the existence of such a wall. Having  built their own Great Wall, the Chinese concluded: The wall is  not there to protect us physically against invasion. It is  there to remind the potential aggressors that invasion is out of  the question.</p>

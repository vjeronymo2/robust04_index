Sterling's fall also makes imports more expensive, so companies which are competing with imports - for example, textiles produced in cheap labour areas - will have some of the pressure removed. Coats Viyella shares jumped because of its high foreign exposure and improved competitiveness at home. Losers were companies without overseas exposure, like stores and food retailers, water and electricity companies, life insurance and banks. Some were losers on other grounds. Throughout the recession, investors have concentrated their portfolios on defensive shares: those which would fare better in hard economic times. These include food retailers, utilities like water and electricity, and drug companies. Now, the situation is reversed. The market is looking for a resumption of economic growth and is pushing up the shares of cyclical stocks which would do best from recovery.

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / People: Quin quits Seeboard John Quin, the finance director of Seeboard, is to take early retirement in the autumn at the age of 54. An announcement yesterday said this was 'by mutual agreement'. Quin joined Seeboard five years ago from Emap, where he was group finance director. In that time he helped usher the electricity company through privatisation and the big shake-out that followed. Seeboard has been one of the most aggressive of the regional electricity companies in tackling costs and this is now paying off in rising profits. Headhunters have been called into find a successor for Quin, who will retain his current responsibilities until then.</p>

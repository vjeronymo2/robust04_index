			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quintessentially British Sir, Joe Rogaly talks ('Major's deadly mantra', January 11) of 'wholly legal Italian practices', such as the 'sale of honours', the transfer of 'redundant officials . . . to the lucrative private sector, the boardroom chairs for ex-ministers', and so on. I'm sure the list would have many of my compatriots puzzled; such practices would seem most peculiar in my country and some would indeed be illegal. But then we in Italy used to believe that they were a quintessential - and wholly legal - part of the British scene. Then again, was Joe Rogaly perhaps implying that corruption and impropriety are by definition connected to the idea of Italy and things Italian? I wonder, since I feel it would be somewhat presumptuous exclusively to endow my country with traits which seem to be so universal and so widely shared, albeit each in our own different ways.

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Record fall in costs of labour Manufacturers recorded their sharpest fall in unit labour costs in October since records began in 1970, figures released yesterday by the Department of Employment showed. The improvement in competitiveness has flowed from productivity gains outstripping the pace of earnings increases. Manufacturing output per head was 6.5 per cent higher in the three months to October than in the same period of 1993. Output has been growing rapidly while employment has been largely flat. Meanwhile, average earnings in manufacturing rose by an underlying 4.75 per cent in the year to October. This followed an upward revision in the September figure from 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent. The net effect was that manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 1.7 per cent lower in the three months to October than in the same period of 1993. In September, the fall was 1.5 per cent. The increase in manufacturing earnings bumped up the whole economy earnings annual growth rate to 4 per cent in October from 3.75 per cent in September. The Department of Employment said that overtime and bonus payments, rather than a general rise in the level of pay settlements, prompted the pick-up in the October figures.</p>

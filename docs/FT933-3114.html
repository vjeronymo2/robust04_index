			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Spain prepares to merge gas groups THE Spanish government is preparing to create one of the largest natural gas companies in Europe. Gas Natural, the national domestic gas distributor 45 per cent owned by Repsol, the state controlled energy group, is to buy Enegas, Spain's monopoly industrial gas supplier, which is fully owned by the state. The deal, it is understood, could raise between Pta80bn and Pta120bn (Dollars 939m) for the government and help control its billowing public deficit. The move will transfer control of all of Spain's gas purchasing and distribution to the private sector, reconfiguring the power currently invested in Mr Oscar Fanjul, the president of Repsol. The purchase, which Gas Natural will probably finance through a capital increase, could be finalised by the end of the year. Mr Fanjul, who has led a series of partial privatisations at Repsol to the point where the state's stake has dropped well below half, is also chairman of the Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos, which controls Enegas. He has been a firm supporter of faster privatisations than the country's nominally socialist government has been prepared so far to undertake. Government officials believe that by merging Enegas and Gas Natural, Spain will be able to create a gas company capable of competing at an international level with larger rivals such as Gaz de France and British Gas. Similar reasoning lay behind Madrid's support in the late 1980s for mergers among the country's banks. Gas Natural was created in 1991 through a merger of Catalana de Gas in Barcelona and Gas Madrid. The group, controlled by Repsol and La Caixa, the big Catalan savings bank, has since been absorbing domestic gas distributers throughout Spain. It now accounts for about 40 per cent of the gas sold in Spain and has begun to compete, with other state-backed Spanish corporations, to buy privatised assets in Latin America. Last year, it took control of the natural gas distributor to northern Buenos Aires. The group made net profits last year of Pta12.3bn and analysts are forecasting profits of nearly twice that in 1995 as gas consumption grows in Spain. According to the state's national energy plan for 1991 to 2000, non-electric gas consumption will grow by 7 per cent a year for the next seven years, doubling its contribution to national energy consumption from 6 per cent to 12 per cent. Enegas, Spain's only importer of natural gas, is also the only supplier to the urban distributors, now dominated by Gas Natural. It also supplies gas directly to large industrial users outside the Basque Country and Catalonia. It is building a pipeline to carry gas into Spain from North Africa and account for half the gas sold in the country. But its commercial fortunes are sometimes hampered by the Gas Protocal of 1985, through which it is required to supply gas to Spanish distributors at a fixed price, whatever it is able to buy at on international markets. In 1991 Enegas reported losses of Pta3.6bn. This formula is due to be revised in 1995 and it is possible that instead of throwing itself into an exhausting round of regulatory and pricing negotiations with distributors, the government has thought it easier and more profitable to slide Enegas across the table to Mr Fanjul and La Caixa and let them control both supplier and distributor. In a further move designed to shore up the government's shaky finances, Argentaria, the pool of state-controlled banks which privatised a part of its stock earlier this year, said yesterday it was in touch with more than 40 national and international institutions in an effort to gauge enthusiasm for a further flotation soon. Argentaria was given cabinet permission earlier this month to float more of its shares.</p>

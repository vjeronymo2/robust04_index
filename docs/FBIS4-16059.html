			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Gorelov] </F>   [Text] Birobidzhan April 13 TASS -- A five-kilometre border  zone has been imposed along the Russian-Chinese frontier in  Russia's far eastern Jewish Autonomous Region.    Access to the zone is available to local residents and  people  with a special permit. Foreign citizens also need to register  in local departments of the Interior Ministry.    The new order of entry to the zone was set up by the  regional  administration in accordance with the law on the state frontier  of the Russian Federation.    The border zone has turned recently into a place with high  criminal activities. A lot of people rushed to the area to  collect wild hemp used for drug production, to steal  agricultural products, vehicles and so on. Frontier guards have  stopped quite a few attempt to smuggle goods by Chinese citizens  across the Amur River.</p>

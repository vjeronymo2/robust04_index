			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> JAILED WOMAN DIES; SUICIDE TRY BLAMED  </P> <P> A Newport Beach woman has died from injuries related to an attempted suicide in  her jail cell, authorities said. Pamela Pauline Ayers, 45, had been held since  Aug. 12 in the Santa Ana women's jail in the fatal shooting of prominent Los  Angeles attorney Gerald Goldfarb, 49.  </P> <P> Deputies discovered the woman hanging from a bedsheet tied to a shower rod.  Goldfarb died of multiple wounds to the head and body, and Ayers underwent  surgery for a self-inflicted wound to the abdomen shortly after the shooting  incident outside her Newport Beach condominium. Police alleged that Ayers, a  former interior decorator, fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun that she had  bought just hours before the slaying. Ayers' attorney said his client mistook  Goldfarb's friendship and legal counsel for a love relationship.  </P></p>

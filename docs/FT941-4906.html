			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prominent criticism Sir, Mr Savic (Letters: 'A lesson for the self-righteous', March 5) suggests that Malaysia 'is reacting to the proposition that the British and other western governments . . . generally know better'. Dr Mahathir said nothing like that. The Malaysian prime minister's grievance, as the FT editorial comment (February 28) stated, is with the UK press, and as the wealthy libel lawyers would perhaps testify, he is not alone. If Mr Savic thinks the Murdoch press is in hock to the government, then many hapless members of this administration can draw comfort from avoiding the mauling they might have received from a less sympathetic organisation. As far as the government is concerned, you quote the essential charge as being one of hypocrisy. If that is all, then we can all sleep easily, as nothing fundamental has changed. Linking money to services provided is not new. I understand it has even been known to happen in journalism. However, Mr Savic may wish to ponder the premise that, if the situation had been reversed, would a similarly critical letter have received as much prominence in Malaysia's New Straits Times?

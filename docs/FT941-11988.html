			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Reebok flat as US shoe sales tumble by 23% Reebok International, the US sports shoemaker, yesterday reported net income of Dollars 50.7m from continuing operations, little changed from Dollars 49.8m last time. Poor sales of its athletic shoes were largely to blame: Reebok footwear sales in the US were nearly 23 per cent lower than in the previous year's fourth quarter. For the full year, Reebok appeared to show a sharp improvement from net income of Dollars 114.4m, to Dollars 223.4m. However, it said profits from continuing operations were virtually flat at Dollars 230.4m compared with Dollars 232.3m last time. Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the company was disappointed by the decline in US footwear sales in the second half, but the year had ended with orders up 14.4 per cent on last time. There had been good performances from the US apparel business, Reebok's international business, and Rockport's international, outdoor and women's footwear businesses.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: QMH faces action over property valuations Mr Dennis Woodhams, one of the leaders of the Queens Moat Houses shareholders action group, yesterday went to the High Court with a petition under S459 of the Companies Act. He asserted that the company's affairs had been or were being conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to shareholders' interests. The court set a hearing date of January 11. Mr Woodhams' criticisms have centred on the substantial difference between two valuations of the group's properties. He said he had asked the company for details of the valuations but had been denied the information requested. The action group has called for the valuations to be made available to shareholders at the company's head office. Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive of QMH, said 'when proposals are put to shareholders in connection with the financial restructuring, which is essential for the group's viability, full disclosure will be made in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange so that all shareholders can vote on the merits of the proposals.' The company used the lower figure, of Pounds 861m from valuers Jones Lang Wootton, in its 1992 accounts. Advisers to QMH pointed out that the group's auditors had not qualified the accounts in respect of the 1992 valuation, only in respect of the 1991 valuation. Another valuation is to be carried out, as at December 31 this year, probably by Jones Lang Wootton again. Property experts think this could show a rise in UK hotel values, but a further fall in those of the continental European hotels. Mr Woodhams' move comes ahead of the group's annual meeting on Monday, at which some shareholders are expected to vote against adopting the annual report. Mr Woodhams claimed the shareholders action group now represented 28m shares, 3 per cent of the total equity. Mr John Bairstow, former chairman of QMH, who holds less than 1 per cent of the equity, is also expected to vote against. The company is said to be 'quietly confident' about winning the vote. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Coppel and Mr Andrew Le Poidevin, whose remuneration packages have drawn criticism, had both been offered higher salaries when originally appointed by the previous directors. The total remuneration package of the new board is less than half that received by the previous board.</p>

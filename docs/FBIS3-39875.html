[Italian Popular Party ,PPI, Secretary]  Mino Martinazzoli, in an editorial appearing in today's IL  POPOLO, takes issue chiefly with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi, albeit without naming him.    "We are in a political desert," he writes, "which encourages  the emergence of improbable demagogues and the resistible rise  (or, rather, the resistible decline, as we say) of dubious  saviors." To those "who want some order and certainty and who  are scandalized by political corruption" and want "to entrust  politics to those who have shown that they can manage their own  affairs properly," Martinazzoli points out that "political  responsibility isn't limited to the individual, but includes  others, and requires a mature awareness of the common good."  "The people," he writes, "are not merely an audience and do not  deserve misleading messages" and "magic words."    Next Martinazzoli expands his criticism and attacks "the  supposed new faces which are often no more than masks." He also  addresses the voters of the progressive alignment to "appeal for  a return to common sense on the part of those who are rightly  aware of the disingeniousness and dangers of a left which,  without being able to say what it now stands for, presumes to  occupy a stronger position only because it swears that it is no  longer the same as before."    The PPI leader asks whether current Italian politics "is  moving in the opposite direction from what the country's  interests require" and whether it is possible that "the `chaotic  innovation' that has emerged, nurtured by decadence, is not the  solution, but its final decline." "It is not only possible," the  PPI secretary says, "but highly likely, unless the Italian  people are helped to find a capacity for critical judgment and  reflection."    Martinazzoli speaks in terms of a "decline of a political  vision" and of the "invasiveness of a disastrous mystification,  incapable even of realistically representing the difficulties  affecting our national community." "The formulas that we hear,"  he explained, "are only magic words, rashly used." His final  wish is this: "What we do not want the Italian people to be  reduced to measuring their political time on a clock with no  hands."</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Italy gropes through bribes maze THE mother of all bribes paid out in Italy's corruption scandals is now known to be L135bn (Pounds 56m). Breaking the wall of silence surrounding this payment to political parties, individual politicians, businessmen and middlemen has been a central objective of Milan magistrates since the beginning of the year. The payments relate to the 'Enimont affair' - the abortive attempt in 1989-90 to reorganise the chemicals industry by merging public sector interests of Eni, the state oil concern, with private sector assets of Montedison, the Ferruzzi group's chemicals arm, in a joint venture, Enimont. Milan magistrates were convinced the murky background to the Enimont affair would expose the extent to which the government, controlled by Christian Democrats and Socialists, subverted Italy's business life to their own illicit ends. If the allegations, leaked by magistrates over the past 24 hours, are proved correct, discrediting of the political establishment will be complete. The magistrates appear satisfied they have got what they want. Two key witnesses in the Enimont affair - Mr Giuseppe Garafano, former Montedison chief executive, and Mr Carlo Sama, his successor, who is married to a daughter of the founder of the Ferruzzi emp-ire - have been secretly released from jail. This emerged yesterday, though they were released to house arrest on Thursday. Milan magistrates have adopted a policy of keeping people in jail on corruption charges until they confess. Mr Garofano was arrested in Switzerland on July 13 and extradited with unprecedented speed two days later. Mr Sama was arrested on Friday last week, the day when Mr Raul Gardini, his brother-in-law and former head of Montedison, committed suicide  -the fourth in the Enimont affair. Mr Gardini is alleged to have arranged a first bribe of L15bn, paid to the Christian Democrats and Socialists in 1989 to ensure Montedison got tax breaks when it merged its chemical interests with those of Eni to form Enimont. The big bribe came when Mr Gardini broke his pact with Eni over joint control of Enimont. Unknown to Eni, then run by Mr Giuseppe Cagliari, who also committed suicide last week, Mr Gardini acquired 11 per cent of the outstanding 20 per cent of Enimont through three associates. Eni found out and persuaded a Milan court to freeze Enimont's shares. These were then placed in the custody of Mr Vincenzo Palladino, currently deputy chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana. To extricate himself, Mr Gardini offered to sell Montedison's 40 per cent stake to Eni. For this Eni paid L2,805bn - now believed to be at least L600bn above the real value. Eni paid a further L1,360bn for minority shareholders, including Mr Gardini's associates. In return there was a political pay-off of L100bn plus Dollars 20m. This amount is believed to relate to 5 per cent of Montedison's real profits on the Enimont stake sale to Eni. Montedison was able to pay over the funds through off-balance-sheet operations, phoney property deals and transactions between foreign subsidiaries. Milan magistrates are understood to have warned eight senior politicians they are under investigation for being involved in this alleged payment. Mr Arnaldo Forlani, Christian Democrat leader at the time, has already got such a warning, in which he is alleged to have received L35bn. Mr Bettino Craxi, then leader of the Socialist party which regarded the oil and chemicals industry as its fiefdom, is alleged to have got a staggering L75bn. He, too, denies involvement, but yesterday admitted the party had received political contributions from both Montedison and the Ferruzzi group as a whole. The rest of the funds were allegedly handed to Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a senior Christian Democrat minister and close ally of the then premier, Mr Giulio Andreotti; and Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist deputy prime minister. To smooth the deal, it is alleged Mr Pallidino, who was supervising the frozen Enimont shares, was bribed L2.5bn. He was arrested on Thursday, but his laywer yesterday denied this sum was a bribe and said it was a professional fee from Montedison. It is further alleged share dealings during the Enimont affair were smoothed by the help of Mr Bruno Pazzi, head of Consob, the Milan stock exchange watchdog body. Mr Pazzi, an appointee of Mr Andreotti, was arrested in connection with Enimont on Wednesday. Even after Montedison pulled out of Enimont, Ferruzzi-Montedison went on paying the politicians - allegedly handing out up to L7bn for the April 1992 elections to the five parties that formed the government coalition during the Enimont affair. The Republican Party yesterday admitted to receiving L300m to this effect. Eni is still in arbitration with Montedison over what it claims to be over-valued chemical plant brought by the latter into the Enimont joint venture.</p>

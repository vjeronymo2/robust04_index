			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC SHAKES UP RUNNING GAME  </P> <P> USC football Coach Larry Smith, unhappy with his offense in last week's season  opener against Illinois, has made some changes in his starting lineup for  Saturday night's game at the Coliseum against Utah State.  </P> <P> Out are tailback Aaron Emanuel and offensive linemen Dan Barnes and Michael  Moody. In are Ricky Ervins at tailback, Brent Parkinson at guard and Bill  Schultz at tackle.  </P> <P> The Trojan running game struggled against Illinois, gaining 70 yards in 39  carries. Emanuel had 32 yards in 15 attempts, Ervins 31 in 10.  </P> <P> Another possible change looms in the secondary, where sophomore Marcus Hopkins  is now listed as equal on the depth chart with All-American Cleveland Colter.

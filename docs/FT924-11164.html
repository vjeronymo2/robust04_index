			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil halts propylene production at Antwerp STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, said yesterday that it will close its Antwerp propylene plant until the end of the year, but warned of a future closure unless market conditions improved. Statoil owns the plant jointly with Himont of Italy in a venture called North Sea Petrochemicals. Statoil's share of investment in the facility was NKr1.1bn (Pounds 110m), of which 60 per cent covered the propylene plant. The petrochemicals complex, which came on stream last year, also comprises a polypropylene plant, which will remain in operation. Difficult market conditions prompted the temporary closure. 'Recession and surplus capacity are pushing prices for plastic raw materials like propylene down to the lowest levels ever seen. At the same time feedstock prices for propane are rising,' Statoil explained. The propylene facility has annual production capacity of 400,000 tonnes and the polypropylene facility has an 180,000-tonne capacity. The two-month closure will result in a loss of 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes of propylene. After overcoming a number of technical problems, the facility resumed normal production in August at 60 to 70 per cent of capacity. Statoil said propylene prices had fallen to between DM400 and DM450 (Pounds 162 and Pounds 182) a tonne in the fourth quarter from DM600-DM650 last year while in recent weeks feedstock prices have risen rose to Dollars 195-Dollars 205 a tonne from Dollars 180. In the first half of this year Statoil's petrochemicals division plunged into a loss of NKr172m from a profit of NKr100m in the same period last year. The company, due to report third-quarter figures in the next couple of days, warned of a deepening in losses by the division.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (2): Home to roost, with a vengeance - The Economy AFTER years of fiscal profligacy, mismanagement of the large state-controlled economic sectors and market distortions caused by over-regulation and protection, Greece has finally had to face up to the dire economic problems which it has so long feigned to ignore. It is ironic that it is the very European Community which Greece joined in 1981 - and which it has always regarded as a generous provider of funds rather than as a law-maker whose rules must be obeyed - that should now be one of the main instruments forcing Greece to put its economic house in order. The goose that laid the golden eggs has come home to roost with a vengeance. The results of the austerity measures introduced by the conservative New Democracy government led by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, since it came to power in April 1990, have been described as 'inadequate' and 'seriously out of line with targets' by the European Commission in a remarkably damning report issued last March. It is widely recognised that the prime minister faced an extremely difficult task. After nearly a decade of socialist government under Mr Andreas Papandreou, he inherited a disastrous economic situation marked by a soaring public deficit, a public debt-GDP ratio much higher than that of any of the Latin American states at the height of their worst crises and a rate of inflation at least 2.5 times the average in the EC. A paper-thin majority of only two parliamentary seats has not made the prime minister's task any easier. However, Mr Mitsotakis's critics - some of whom can be found inside his own party - complain that too much valuable time was lost by the New Democracy government before it started implementing a three-year stabilisation programme at the beginning of last year. The publicity-shy Mr Stefanos Manos, the new economics minister, is reputed to share this view and wants to press ahead with more radical stabilisation measures. However, Mr Mitsotakis is fast running out of time. The next general election is due in 1994 and political expediency dictates that no really unpopular measures are taken by the government in the last year of its term. That means, failing a political death-wish entirely uncharacteristic of Greek politicians, that the administration of any really effective economic medicine can be virtually ruled out from 1993 onwards. Even the European Commission, frustrated as it undoubtedly is after years of preaching in the wilderness, recognises that some useful steps have been taken by the government to prepare the Greek economy for the EC's Single Market. Significant progress has been made, particularly in liberalising international capital movements and the domestic financial system. Long-term capital movements have been liberalised and controls have been lifted on current international transactions. Credit controls have been abolished, staged cuts in the special reserve requirements of banks are being made, and the state's right to borrow directly from the central bank through the obligatory purchase by banks of Treasury Bills is being phased out. Price controls on a broad range of goods and services have been lifted, wage indexation has been abolished and replaced by a strict incomes policy for the public sector, a freeze in the hiring of public sector employees has been in effect since last year and the oil market is in the process of being deregulated. The privatisation programme is also, at last, being implemented at a more reasonable pace. In 1991, some 14 of the so-called 'problematic enterprises' had been sold and 11 liquidated, followed in March this year by the sale of 70 per cent of the Heracles cement company A long-awaited tax reform package - aimed at boosting inadequate national revenues, at least in the longer run, broadening the tax base and curbing Greeks' favourite pastime of tax evasion by the imposition of stricter penalties and the confiscation of professional licences - was finally tabled in parliament in May, although its eventual shape remains problematical. On the external front, too, the news has been much better. The current account deficit fell by as much as 60 per cent last year to Dollars 1.46bn, scarcely more than 2 per cent of GDP. This was thanks mainly to large net inflows of invisibles, particularly from the EC, which account for as much as 25 per cent of Greece's invisible earnings. A marked decline in imports, as the result of the domestic recession, also contributed substantially to the much-improved balance of payments performance. All these positive developments, however, cannot compensate for the economy's fundamental failings. Until the large public deficit is brought under control and the huge debt overhang begins to be reduced, a sustainable economic recovery is not achievable. The net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of 14.1 per cent of GDP in 1991, although lower than the previous year and a great improvement on the 20 per cent figure when the government took office, was still 3.7 percentage points higher than the objective set by the government. The target is to reduce the deficit to 9.1 per cent of GDP in 1992, but given what are considered by independent experts as the over-optimistic budget forecasts for tax and privatisation revenues, the out-turn is likely to be at least 2 points higher. The high fiscal deficit has undoubtedly contributed to the persistence of inflation at an unacceptably high level by EC standards of about 18 per cent since the summer of last year. Prospects that the annual rate for 1992 as a whole will fall any lower than about 16 per cent, in spite of the maintenance of tight monetary conditions, restrictive incomes policies and weak demand, are considered to be dim. However, as the EC Commission report said: 'the magnitude of the problem is not to be seen simply in the scale of the deficits, but in the underlying financial fragility.' Public sector debt is now equivalent to as much as 135 to 140 per cent of GDP. Significant debt-servicing problems arose in 1991, leading the government to reschedule its own debt in addition to already existing capitalisation of debt interest. The resulting postponement of debt servicing has stored financial problems for Greek governments in future years. The remedies are clear. If Greece is to fulfil the tough terms for the second tranche of the Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.54bn) loan granted to it conditionally by the EC last year, the government will have to make another huge adjustment effort. That will require substantial public spending cuts and further structural reforms, involving sharp reductions in both the wage bill and staffing levels of state-owned enterprises and the early implementation of proposals for reforming the social security system. The problem is not so much what to do as how to make it palatable to a political class and society chronically affected by the disease of 'short-termism.' The government's almost impossible task is to persuade the Greek people that any further delay in the implementation of radical solutions will inevitably lead to the permanent marginalisation of Greece in the European Community.</p>

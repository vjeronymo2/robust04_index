About 100 Natfhe members who disobeyed union orders and held unofficial strikes yesterday face possible damages and disciplinary action. The Court of Appeal last week ruled that Natfhe's strike, called for yesterday, was unlawful because principals had not been given the names of members balloted.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of the monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Trustees of the Trust, and such Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees of the Trust, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The Trustee, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Manager and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Manager and the Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will be used to support any distribution or servicing fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to support any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that payments made under the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or Shareholder Servicing Plan relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class and except that any Class Expenses will be borne by the applicable class of shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent Examiner'') who has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Trust that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following request by the Trust which the Trust agrees to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``report on the policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner in the initial report referred to in condition (8) above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (8) above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Independent Examiner does not so concur in the ongoing reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The prospectus of the Trust that implements each revised Alternative Purchase Plan will include a statement to the effect that any person entitled to receive compensation for selling shares of a Fund of the Trust may receive different levels of compensation for selling or servicing one particular class of shares over another of such Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

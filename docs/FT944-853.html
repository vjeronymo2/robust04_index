			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Alliance &amp; Leicester Fred Crawley is to step down as chairman of Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society at the end of next week, after three years in the post. A resignation at the top in a building society - particularly given current levels of interest in mergers and takeovers - often acts to spur speculation about possible deals, since it removes one of the possible difficulties about filling senior posts. But A&amp;L has appointed a successor to Crawley - Simon Everard, 66, who has been deputy chairman since 1990, and has had more than 25 years on building society boards since becoming a director of the Leicester Temperance Building Society in 1967. Crawley, 68, joined A&amp;L - now the fourth largest society - from a background in banking. This proved particularly relevant to the integration of Girobank into the society's activities. He had joined Lloyds Bank in 1942, and was deputy chief executive when he left in 1987. Within a few months of his becoming A&amp;L chairman, the society's chief executive, Scott Durward, resigned amid claims - which were denied - that he had been ousted in a boardroom coup. Peter White, deputy chief executive and finance director, succeeded him. Crawley will remain on the board of Girobank, the society's subsidiary, as a non-executive director.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Afghan factions resort to arms: Tribal warlords may disregard external attempts to achieve lasting peace PROSPECTS for lasting peace in Afghanistan have been considerably damaged by three weeks of violence in which hundreds have been killed in rocket attacks on Kabul, the capital. Mujahideen guerrillas led by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar yesterday launched the heaviest bombardment of the recent fighting, killing and injuring dozens of Kabul residents. Last week four United Nations workers were killed in an ambush in eastern Afghanistan. The escalation began after the interim president, Mr Burhannuddin Rabbani, extended his term of office for two years through a vote of confidence from a controversial shoora, or council of elders. Only four of the nine main mujahideen factions attended the shoora and confirmed its decision. Rivals of Mr Rabbani who are trying to remove him include Mr Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami party, and the Iranian-backed Hezb-i-Wahdat group. The country's most powerful army general, Uzbek commander Rashid Dostum, is also expected to join Mr Rabbani's opponents if they win sufficient ground to form a government. Yesterday, as Mr Hekmatyar stepped up his attacks, government jets circled overhead on bombing raids against his headquarters to the south of Kabul. Tanks patrolled the streets, according to a Reuters newsagency report from Kabul. Mr Hekmatyar has refused to stop fighting unless Mr Rabbani agrees to elections within a year and formation of an interim government acceptable to all mujahideen parties. Regional powers are anxiously seeking an end to the fighting. Iran and Pakistan want to see a stable government in Kabul so that more than 4.5m Afghan refugees can return home. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has invited all Afghan groups to the kingdom for discussions on a peaceful solution and Pakistan has backed this proposal. However, groups opposed to Mr Rabbani have said they will accept his presence there only if he attends as head of his Jamiat-i-Islami party rather than as president. He is not expected to agree. Western diplomats and Pakistani officials say Mr Rabbani's continuation in office is the biggest obstacle to negotiations. A government spokesman in Islamabad says: 'We have conveyed to President Rabbani our deep anguish that fighting has broken out and that it has not been possible to evolve a consensus on political arrangements in Kabul.' The crisis has dampened prospects for badly needed international assistance in relief and reconstruction work. The UN has launched an international appeal seeking Dollars 138m (Pounds 91.3m) in assistance. But Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the secretary general's representative for Afghanistan, says: 'What I am worried about is that if this situation continues for very long, the donors may be discouraged from going along. If a country is put on the shelf, then it is with great difficulty it comes out of the shelf again, given the other demands on donors' attention.' The UN says that it will continue with its efforts for rehabilitation. Mr Mousouris says: 'We will not abandon Afghanistan in spite of acts of violence, in spite of obstacles erected by followers of leaders who have chosen violence as part of instruments of political antagonism.' The prospects appear bleak. Western defence experts estimate that the opposing sides can continue a sustained effort for six to 12 months, even if no military supplies reach them. Afghanistan is a leading exporter of narcotics and attempts to introduce crop substitution programmes have little chance of success under present circumstances. Despite external attempts to bring about peace, Afghanistan may be set on a course where tribal warlords call the shots until one side emerges with clear control.</p>

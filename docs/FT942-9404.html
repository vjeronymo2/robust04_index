			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: JCB firing on all cylinders - How Bamford faced up to the recession JC Bamford, the UK's biggest construction equipment group, has a justifiable reputation for its product range, design innovation and marketing flair, but its profits have always been more of an unknown quantity. That is because the Staffordshire-based company, owned by the Bamford family, has long preferred to keep its key figures to itself. But now Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman, has opened the books - at least partially. Cynics might suggest the timing of the announcement is no accident. After the worst recession in the industry's history, JCB has recovered strongly from the downturn, as the table shows, and Sir Anthony believes pre-tax profits will rise to Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m this year. In fact, the company has recently introduced a tax-free profit-related pay scheme, which obliges it to give employees more details of its financial performance. And, says Sir Anthony, people outside the company may also be interested in hearing about the financial side of a British engineering success story. He stresses, however, that there is no other motive. JCB has no outside shareholders and no debt, and Sir Anthony says: 'We are not about to issue a bond or float the company.' The figures revealed by JCB reflect a creditable performance coming through the recession without dropping into the red, but also suggest there is plenty of room for improvement. The effects of the downturn are shown in the sharp reduction of units sold, to 10,642 in 1991, and in the low point for turnover of Pounds 312.3m the same year - when UK sales were little more than half the level of 1989. Margins have also been severely squeezed by the competition for sales in what has been a buyers' market. JCB's pre-tax return on sales averaged 11 per cent during the 1980s but plunged to just 2.3 per cent in 1992. Last year's recovery was due partly to a big upturn in UK sales, now virtually the same as in 1989, while a strong surge in US sales helped trim the overall downturn overseas. However, the recovery - and the fact that JCB avoided a loss even in the dark days of 1991 and 1992 - also reflected internal measures. 'We have faced up to reality, have looked at some pretty bleak scenarios, and have decided what we need to do,' says Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive. By last year the group had reduced its break-even volume to 72 per cent of the 1990 level, through looking hard at its overheads and distribution costs and by obtaining better prices for its products. There has also been a significant turnround from a modest cash outflow in 1990 to a very positive cash inflow of Pounds 52m last year, due to better control of working capital. Machine stocks held by overseas subsidiaries were reduced by Pounds 16m last year, says Mr Tim Leadbeater, commercial and planning director. Nonetheless, the return on sales last year was still only 6.7 per cent and Mr Coyne says anything less than 10 per cent is 'not acceptable.' The target is 12 per cent, which Mr Coyne says could be achieved next year. The immediate challenge for JCB is to stem losses at its wheeled loader division and at JCB-SCM, its excavator joint venture with Japan's Sumitomo Construction Machinery. The venture had been expected to get into the black this year, but the downturn in the European excavator market and the strength of the yen have put it about two years behind schedule. The wheeled loader division, meanwhile, has long been in need of a main product development programme, which has just culminated in the launch of new products. Sir Anthony says he is not sure when it will return to profit. A further rise in group profits this year would still put JCB short of its record Pounds 47m in 1988, when the construction equipment industry was at the peak of an artificially high boom. However, Sir Anthony believes sales will hit a record Pounds 455m this year, up 15 per cent on 1993, and JCB looks on course to achieve that.</p>

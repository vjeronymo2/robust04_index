			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Onenko: "A Great Ministerial Secret: Many </F> Oblasts Lack Corn Seeds"]    [Text] In the Sumy region a very large area--155,000  hectares--has been set aside for corn; but the sowing is  threatened with disruption.    "Never before have our farms been hit by such a crisis-type  situation," laments V. Miroshnyk, duty chief of the oblast-level  Agricultural and Food Administration. "In former years corn  seeds were already in the storehouses of our farms as early as  March. But this year such seeds have not even been brought to  the grain-product combines. Moreover, they are skinning us alive  for these seeds--ranging from 23 to 33 million karbovantsy per  tonne, which is almost double what was recently promised in your  newspaper by the responsible staffers of the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food. Although the former State Committee on  Grain Products was absorbed by the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food, we have not yet sensed any improvement in the operation of  its structures. All through the winter the department kept  referring to the lack of money for the purpose of buying seeds.  Now that credits have been allotted, the banks are playing  tricks. But we still need to have more than 5,000 tonnes of  seeds delivered from the southern region to our farms. If such a  pace of solving this problem continues, we will not be able to  start sowing corn until it is already harvest time...."    The supply of corn seeds is also quite small on the farms of  Lvov, Chernigov, Ivano-Frankovsk, Rovno, Zhitomir, Khmelnitskiy,  and other oblasts.    I tried to obtain an explanation of this situation from the  chief of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food's Grain-Elevator  Administration, B. Slyvchak, but he merely made the following  statement: "I will not talk to you without orders from my  superiors. That's the way we do things here...."    After some time I came to understand the reason for such  strict secrecy with regard to the holdup in the delivery of corn  seeds to our country's farms. This important work has collapsed  with a resounding crash, even though on paper everything would  seem to be just fine. Back on 27 January the Cabinet of  Ministers issued an order with regard to delivering corn seeds  to farms. It is written therein who are to obtain such sowing  material, as well as how much, and from which oblasts;  appropriate tasks were also assigned to Ukrainian railroads.  However, by the beginning of April none of the kind persons  responsible for this matter had so much as lifted a finger to  help. The leading officials of the Main Administration for Grain  Products under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food cite the  fact that there was no money for mutually agreeable settlements  among the grain-receiving enterprises. But they are all within  the system of a single department. Is is really possible that  they could not find a compromise-type, variant--as was  frequently done in previous years--for conveying corn seeds from  the southern oblats to the western and northern regions?    Just a few days ago the government resolved the matter of  allotting credits to the grain-receiving enterprises. Some 1.3  trillion karbovantsy were granted. But this is a mere drop in  the bucket because this money was earmarked not only for  purchasing seeds, but also to pay for grain, flour, and groats.    Unfortunately, even these crumbs cannot positively bring  about a solution to the task at hand; the banks in the various  oblasts are holding up monetary payments from the accounts  because of miscalculations therein.    But even if this obstacle--one artificially created by the  bankers--is overcome, there is another obstacle lurking around  the bend--that of the railroads. The latter are demanding  payment up front before they will provide the necessary freight  cars.    An impasse-type situation has evolved here: The  grain-receiving enterprises do not have the right to take a  single karbovanets from the allotted credits, whereas there is  nothing but wind blowing through their own accounts. For  example, a few days ago the leading officials of the Nikolayev  Elevatorzernoprom Associationsent a telegram to the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food, informing the latter that all the  enterprises of this association had gone bankrupt. Now the  grain-receiving oblasts of most oblasts are also in the same  financial jam. What will happen? One cannot carry tens of  thousands of tonnes of grain on one's own back.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Behind the Veil - New York Music America has yet to fall under the spell of 'The Protecting Veil'. The recording has only just been released in the US, and Steven Isserlis's performance at Carnegie Hall last week was the first in New York, coming nearly four years after the Prom premiere that launched the current British wave of interest in John Tavener's music. The mood in the hall was expectant, but also sceptical, which may be why the performance missed incandescence. However, there could have been other reasons. For one thing, to hear Tavener abroad, and played by non-British musicians (the strings of the New England Conservatory Symphony, under Michael Tilson Thomas, were accompanying Mr Isserlis's long cello song), is to be reminded how English his music is - how much its wide-spanning harmonies, say, belong in the tradition of Vaughan Williams, not Copland. The playing was remarkably assured, but too much fizz and thrust and energy was going into the music, and the imitation bell sounds, which reappear to celebrate arrivals at different points in the life of the Mother of God, had an unwanted bodily enthusiasm to them. It could also be that the piece simply works better on record. Everything visual at a concert performance is alien to it: the movements of the soloist (the unbroken line of cello sound asks to be heard as disembodied, as if the instrument were uttering by itself - or, better, as if there were no instrument at all but only the sound), the gestures of the conductor, the uniform obediences of the orchestra, the tiered audience. The inevitable noise of public performance, too, is out of place: even applause seems mistimed, except as an acknowledgement of the heroic feat of stamina, intensity and musicianship achieved by the soloist. Mr Isserlis in his recording sets himself a high challenge; here his maintenance of full, pure tone, up to the highest register and down to the tiniest pianissimo, was extraordinary. It was showpiece playing from one about to receive the triennial Piatigorsky Award. But possibly the not-quite-satisfactory effect of the performance as a whole was entirely a subjective phenomenon: the result of over-exposure, or of worrying about what continuing admirers of the work may regard as incidental details, such as the travelogue picturesqueness of the Levantine microtonal ululations and wild dances, or the wearying repetitions of the same music to open each new chapter, or the limited melodic invention. All is well if nothing happens to make one start asking questions. As soon as one does, the first has to be that of how to interpret Tavener's simplicity as ascetic and not merely cosy.</p>

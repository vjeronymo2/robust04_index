			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: As the markets buzz in anticipation of a UK base rate rise and the publication of the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, UK figures will be watched with particular interest this week. Today's data on M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, is expected to show a slight slowdown in its annual growth rate. But with the market forecasting a 6.3 per cent annual increase, the rate is still well outside the government's monitoring band of 0-4 per cent. Tuesday: With Germany's economic recovery proceeding faster than many had dared hope, June's industrial production and manufacturing output data, which are due out today or tomorrow, will be watched with interest. A strong increase in output is expected, following a slight fall last month. Friday: UK manufacturing and output data due today will provide further indications of the strength of the UK recovery, with a small pick-up in the rate of monthly growth expected. In the US, a spate of industrial production and employment data is expected to point to continued strong recovery.</p>

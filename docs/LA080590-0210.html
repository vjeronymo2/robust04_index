			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMBLETONIAN TO HARMONIOUS  </P> <P> Harmonious took the lead midway through the stretch and then held off Embassy  Lobell by 1 1/2 lengths Saturday to win the $1,346,000 Hambletonian at the  Meadowlands in straight heats.  </P> <P> The Hambletonian victory was the third in four years for driver John Campbell  and it also gave owner Frank Antonacci and his Lindy Racing Stable a record  fourth victory.  </P> <P> Harmonious and Embassy Lobell were both impressive in winning their divisions  of the opening heat. Harmonious was by far the better horse in the second heat,  trotting the mile 1:54 1/5, the third fastest heat in the 65-year history of  the Hambletonian, the foremost trotting event.  </P></p>

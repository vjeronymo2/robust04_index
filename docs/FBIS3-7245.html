			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has decided to  establish a "Joint Council on Northeast Asian Affairs" within  the party to discuss ways to deal with the tense situation in  the Korean peninsula resulting from North Korea's alleged  nuclear development. This council will be composed of concerned  divisions, such as national defense and foreign affairs. At its  first meeting scheduled to be held on 30 March, officials from  various ministries and agencies--including the Foreign Ministry,  the Defense Agency, and the Finance Ministry--will report on the  current situation and other matters. The LDP also intends to  work out measures for Japan to take in case the UN Security  Council decides to initiate economic sanctions against North  Korea, and to propose these measures to the government.    Discussions will be mainly held on such issues as: 1)  whether  it is proper to prohibit North Koreans residing in Japan from  sending money to North Korea, and 2) what the government should  do if U.S. forces stationed in Japan ask for the Self Defense  Force's [SDF] assistance in the transportation and supply of  fuel.    Regarding sanctions against North Korea, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa said: "If sanctions should be applied, Japan  will cooperate with the United Nations as much as possible  within the boundary of its constitution." However, according to  a senior official of the LDP national defense division, there is  a skeptical view within the LDP that "it is questionable whether  the coalition government can provide enough cooperation because  it contains the Social Democratic Party of Japan which considers  the SDF unconstitutional."</p>

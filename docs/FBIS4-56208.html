			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancourt in Havana] </F>   [Text] More than 30 deputies participated today in the  debate on the measures that the Cuban state must implement to  put its internal finances on a sound basis, the only topic  included on the agenda for the first special period of sessions  at the National Assembly of the People's Government.    Armed with an arsenal of ideas contributed by the  parliaments  in the workplace and the report presented by Jose Luis  Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, Cuban deputies had  enough arguments to propose solutions to reduce the deficit and  the amount of excess money in circulation, which jeopardize the  island's economic efforts.    In the midst of this heated debate, Cuban President Fidel  Castro spoke in his role as deputy. Fidel said the policy of  justice and social solidarity, maintained by the revolution even  during times of crisis, is basically responsible for the  imbalance that now afflicts our internal finances, adding that  the time has come to solve the situation once and for all.    [Begin Castro recording] Above all, we must be courageous.  We must be not only intelligent but courageous. If we are  afraid, we are lost. If we implement half measures we are lost.  History has given us the responsibility of solving this  problem. We have to solve it, and in the end we must assume the  responsibility with political sense, with revolutionary sense,  and with an (?technological) sense. [end recording]    Referring to this, he said we must adopt the necessary  measures, even those that are unpopular.    [Begin Castro recording] This is not a matter of simply  putting our finances on a sound basis; it is also a matter of  revaluing money. It is necessary to revalue workers' salaries;  to revalue the peso. They are equally important issues. They  are (?decisive) things, and I believe we should be willing to  adopt whatever measures are necessary [applause] even if no one  wants to speak to us the next day. [applause] Even if they do  not want to greet us the next day or even in the coming months.    None of the measures will be welcome, nor will they be  understood in only one day. Only the sum of these measures will  be understood. Only the sum of these measures will yield results  and increase the people's understanding. These measures must  have an order. It is not a matter of adopting any measure today  and any other measure tomorrow. The measures must have a [word  indistinct] order, because the order of the steps has an impact  on the results in this case. [end recording]    To conclude, Fidel Castro emphasized that every effort has  been made to carry out the most democratic process of  discussions, to hear various criteria, and to take the people's  opinion into consideration. In other words, the strategy is  well-known, but discretion must prevail at all times, he said.    The special session will continue tomorrow with the  discussion of a draft agreement on the issue, which will be  undoubtedly improved by the contributions from Sunday's debate.</p>

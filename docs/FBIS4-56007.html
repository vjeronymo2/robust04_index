It  discussed the course to be taken by the Slovak Republic in the  drafting of documents on the security initiative named as the  pact of stability and other topical issues. Regarding  Slovakia's participation in meetings of the stability pact, the  Coalition Council agreed that Slovakia would be represented by a  governmental delegation. This also applies to the opening  meeting of the stability pact planned to take place next  Thursday and Friday. The Coalition Council regard the solution  of the problem of minorities as an internal matter of the state,  although representatives of the Hungarian political parties  voiced their demand to be allowed to participate in the meetings  of the stability pact. However, it will be up to the government  to decide who should form Slovakia's Government delegation.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> NOTES ON WEAVING, AND GARDEN AND ANIMAL EVENTS;  </P> <P> ON WEAVING  </P> <P> WOVEN CLOTH IS everywhere -- on bodies, beds, tables, walls and floors. And all  the different kinds and textures of cloth, from twill to tapestry, start with a  loom and fiber put together in one basic arrangement: The vertical threads,  attached to the loom, are the warp, and the horizontal threads, or weft, are  laced in and out, over and under the warp.  </P> <P> That's only the beginning. Of the three basic weaves, the simplest is the  plain, or tabby, pattern, with the weft threads going over one warp thread and  under the next -- as in gingham, percale and muslin. Pass the weft over two or  more threads at a time, and it's the basket weave variation. Twill, a sturdy  and distinctive cloth, is acheived by weaving the weft over two, three or four  warp threads at a time in a diagonal pattern -- as with gabardine, flannel and  serge. Satin weave -- damask, sateen and satin -- only looks simple; the weft  threads can cross as many as 12 warp threads at a time. There are also a number  of fancy types: pile, double, gauze and so on.  </P> <P> Table and floor looms are the most common hand-weaving looms -- but there are  hundreds of variations of the two, some with daunting prices. The table loom  makes cloth about 18 inches wide; the floor loom, at least twice that. Harness  looms, attached to a post or wall at one end and the weaver at the other, are  less stable but portable. It's possible to weave a small object, such as a  place mat, using a frame loom made from a picture frame or artist's canvas  stretcher.  </P> <P> Clothes from hand-loomed cloth are very popular, judging from the number of  jewel-toned garments on sale at last fall's arts and crafts show at the Santa  Monica Civic Auditorium. Clothes from hand-woven fabric are usually very simple  in design; the cloth itself is the work of art and the finished garment merely  a method of display.  </P> <P>  Weaving supplies and instruction are available at Casa de las Tejedores in  Santa Ana; Weaving West in Santa Monica; Weave 'n Knit Depot in Torrance;  Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, and Studio of Handcrafts in Tarzana.  Weaving courses are frequently offered by Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys.  Publications include Shuttle, Spindle &amp; Dyepot, 120 Mountain Ave.,  Bloomfield, Conn. 06002; Handwoven, 306 N. Washington Ave., Loveland, Colo.  80537 (offers weaving patterns), and Fiberarts, 50 College St., Asheville, N.C.  28801 (often features weavers and their work).  </P></p>

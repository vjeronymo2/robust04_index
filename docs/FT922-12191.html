			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Arts: Glasgow sweeps Europa Nostra Glasgow is cock of the walk in European conservation, winning five of the annual Europa Nostra awards for conservation and new construction in conservation areas. This year the scheme attracted more than 125 entries from 20 countries. It is sponsored by American Express, and the now merged Europa Nostra/International Castles Institute runs it. Seven projects won medals of honour, and 36 won diplomas of merit. The two British medallists are the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, refurbished to its Victorian splendour, and the 18th century court house and jail in Inveraray, Argyllshire. Other winners are from Germany (the Hotel im Wasserturm in Cologne, and three ancient revolving windmills at Oberoderwitz), Norway (Arendal town), and Spain (the San Isidro chapel in the San Andres church in Madrid, and a 15th century house in Valencia). Diploma winners include a fortified church in Romania, Dublin Castle, Trinity College Cambridge, dock conversions in Amsterdam, the Ca'd'oro Building in Glasgow (along with four other schemes there) and the National Trust's restoration of the exotic Victorian garden at Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire.</p>

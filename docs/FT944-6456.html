			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL power VSEL continued to power ahead on rumours of an imminent increased offer for the submarine maker from electronics giant GEC, rising 15 to 1535p for an advance over the past two trading days of 40. The December 7 deadline for a decision from the Office of Fair Trading on whether to refer either of the two competing bids for VSEL - British Aerospace is the other contender - to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is just over a week away. The odds on Sir Arnold Weinstock and his team at GEC upping the ante before hand look to have shortened significantly in recent sessions. BAe added 3 at 455p, pushing the value of its all-share offer above 1500p. GEC, which improved slightly to 274 1/2 p, has an all-cash offer of 1400p on the table and is expected to lift this to at least 1550p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Petrini: "Pension Blitz Ready: Only for </F> Those Over 65 Starting 1 January"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Prime Minister] Berlusconi's pensions  remedy is about to be administered to the Italian people. After  the controversy created by the Constitutional Court ruling,  which revealed a huge gap in the welfare budget, a major  structural reform of the welfare system is beginning to take  shape. This operation will go ahead irrespective of whatever  solution the government will find to the INPS [National Agency  for Social Security] gap.    Economic ministers are already examining a detailed plan for  pension reform that they could include in next year's finance  bill.    The idea being considered by the government envisions  raising  the retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women starting 1  January 1995. This measure would be coupled with the raising of  the minimum requirement for an old-age pension from 35 to 40  years. According to a plan drawn up by experts and currently  being examined by the government, the total sum gained by these  two measures would permit savings of 4,191 billion lire starting  in 1995 and would permit the INPS to pay out 254,000 fewer  pensions. In 1996 savings would total 7,465 billion lire and  387,000 fewer pensions would be paid. The year after that  savings would total 12,031 billion lire and 611,000 fewer  pensions would be paid. By the year 2010 estimated savings  would be 34,017 billion lire.    Public Administration Minister Giuliano Urbani referred to  reform of the pension system when he put forward three  alternatives for resolving the problem: "To raise the  retirement age to the European average of 65, to lower the level  of pensions, or to seek a combination of these two solutions."  Urbani's remarks, though very cautious, were enough to prompt a  protest from the trade unions: "My sharp opposition to such an  option," Silvano Miniati, of the pensioners' union, said  sarcastically, "is based solely on social considerations. If,  apart from introducing the obligation to continue working until  the age of 65, the right to do so were also guaranteed, my  opposition would be considerably attenuated...."

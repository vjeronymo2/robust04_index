			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>   [Excerpts] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- Only 72 hours before the  beginning of the hurricane season in Cuba, an exercise called  Meteor 94 has begun throughout the country aimed at implementing  the various mechanisms needed to confront the forces of nature  that could hit the island.    It is believed that hundreds of thousands of people  throughout the island will participate in this exercise, which  is based on the UN plan to prevent catastrophes. [passage  omitted]    The goal of this exercise is to prepare the people and civil  defense organizations for floods, earthquakes, heavy rains, and  hurricanes. During the Meteor 94 exercise, the islanders will  pretend to be bracing for and confronting a very big hurricane.    The Cuban specialists have justified this exercise with  numbers. In the past 200 years, the island has been hit by 90  hurricanes that have resulted in many dead and wounded and heavy  material damage. [passage omitted]    During the exercise the people will pretend to be bracing  for  a hurricane that has been baptized "Claudy." This hurricane  will follow the same trajectory followed by "Gilbert," a  hurricane that hit Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,  Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula  in 1988. [passage omitted]    Meteor 94 is designed to alert people to this type of  catastrophe and update civil defense mechanisms, as well as to  establish the role of the media in such a situation. The goal  is to create a safer world as the year 2000 approaches.</p>

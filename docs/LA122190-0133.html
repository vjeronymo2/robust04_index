			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS PLAY SANTA WITH BIKES  </P> <P> Dozens of firefighters spent their days off this week assembling more than 350  tricycles, beach cruisers and 10-speed bicycles that will be given to hundreds  of underprivileged or abused children on Christmas Day.  </P> <P> The bicycles were purchased with money raised by the Orange County Fire  Department as part of Operation Santa Claus, a program run by the county's  Social Services Agency.  </P> <P> "There's nothing worse than to see tears in the eyes of a child during  Christmas, and this is our way of helping to alleviate some of that," said  Capt. Hank Raymond, a firefighter who serves as the program's official Santa  Claus.  </P> <P> Last year, more than 13,000 children were provided with gifts through the  program, which is also supported by the Orange County Board of Supervisors,  various county agencies, several businesses and the Orangewood Children's Home.  </P> <P> The firefighters became involved in Operation Santa Claus after participating  in the Toys for Tots program for many years. They switched to Operation Santa  Claus in 1983 because it specifically addressed the needs of children in Orange  County, Raymond said.  </P> <P> "We are in the business of protecting people, so firefighters have to have some  kind of compassion and caring," Raymond said. "When we're out there in the line  of duty, we get to see how some of the less fortunate live. This is a way to  give a little bit back."  </P> <P> This holiday season has been a particularly busy one for the firefighters. In  addition to purchasing and assembling the bicycles, they have been collecting  hundreds of toys, some of which were distributed at a party last weekend at  Tustin Marine Corps Air Base for the families of military personnel involved in  Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> The remainder of the toys will be given to children who are either staying in  Orangewood Children's Home or in foster homes.  </P> <P> To make sure that each gift suits a specific child, foster parents and social  workers are invited to the Operation Santa Claus store at Orangewood where they  can shop for an appropriate gift.  </P> <P> "A unique part about this program is that a child isn't just handed a random  gift. They usually get something that they asked for or need," Raymond said.  </P> <P> Although donations to Operation Santa Claus have declined a bit this year,  Raymond said it's still not too late to give.  </P> <P> Anyone wishing to donate toys can drop them off, unwrapped, at any of the  Orange County Fire Department's 46 stations, at any of the 52 Carl's Jr.  restaurants in Orange County, or at the Orangewood Children's Home, 401 City  Drive South, Orange.

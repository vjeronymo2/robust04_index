			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFF-ROADERS RIDE ROUGH TRAIL TO BETTER IMAGE  </P> <P> If there is a social group held in lower esteem by modern society than smokers,  it has to be off-road vehicle enthusiasts.  </P> <P> To the average motorist commuting to work through gasoline fumes, the idea of  spending a weekend revving up a four-wheel drive for a bone-jarring trip  through the sagebrush is unthinkable, and the specter of pre-adolescents  roaring up and down the Glamis Dunes on balloon-tired three wheelers is cause  to shudder.  </P> <P> When the federal government recently proposed an off-road trail through the  pristine Cleveland National Forest, backcountry residents rose up in wrath.  </P> <P> And Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, with its thousands of arid acres, has  barred dune buggies and other all-terrain vehicles, pointing to damage wrought  to the fragile environment.  </P> <P> Now, as a state legislative bill designed to allow off-road vehicles back into  Anza-Borrego comes up for its first hearing Tuesday, off-road enthusiasts say  they are suffering the effects of an outdated public image. No longer are they  the madcap drivers of past decades, they say.  </P> <P> Since the off-road vehicle craze began in the 1950s and grew to a frenzy with  introduction of the all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in 1972, its adherents have grown  up, they say. From a few hardy characters determined to conquer the rugged  hillsides despite the cost, the off-roaders have matured into a well-organized  group of more than 800,000 statewide, complete with rules, by-laws, a lobbyist  and a healthy state bank balance derived from vehicle permits and gasoline  taxes.  </P> <P> Lynn Brown, a long-time San Diego off-roader, recalls a time a few years back  when he and other ORV representatives assembled at the County Administration  Center to meet with state and local authorities on the ill-fated plan to place  an ORV park between Lakeside and Poway in Sycamore Canyon.  </P> <P> "We were waiting there, with our suits and ties and briefcases when some of the  opposition came up and asked us who we were," Brown recalled. "When we told  them we were the local off-road coalition, they were flabbergasted.  </P> <P> "Those guys didn't believe that we were really off- roaders," Brown said,  chuckling. "We weren't at all what they expected to see."  </P> <P> Yet, their image remains as harebrained, "belligerent-looking troglodytes," as  quoted in a recent issue of California Magazine.  </P> <P> Bob Ham, lobbyist for California Off Road Vehicle Assn. (CORVA), considers the  legislative hearing this week "a key one" because it will signal the support  that off-roaders can expect from legislators and state agencies.  </P> <P> However, he concedes that powerful environmental groups and local residents are  lined up against the bill, and he is unwilling to predict the future of the  controversial measure, which would force the state parks director to keep a  promise off-roaders say he made two years ago to insure his reappointment to  the post.  </P> <P> Four-wheel drive vehicles, "street legal" autos licensed by the Department of  Motor Vehicles, are allowed in the vast desert park and can cause just as much  damage as ORVs, Ham pointed out. So, why the discrimination against  off-roaders?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taking Unfair Blame?  </P> <P> Lowell Landowski, grants administrator for the state Off-Highway Motor Vehicle  Recreation Division, concedes that the off-roaders, especially ATV riders, may  be taking the rap for past environmental damage in the same way a carrot-topped  kid is picked out as the culprit in a school-ground tussle.  </P> <P> The bright-colored, balloon-tired vehicles with their helmeted riders "are  readily distinguishable," Landowski said, and may have taken the blame for the  lower-profile, street-legal vehicles.  </P> <P> The problem might have been solved by better policing of the Anza-Borrego  wilderness to rid the area of the rebels, rather than banning an entire class  of recreational users, Landowski said. His department, however, opposes the  bill.  </P> <P> Norm Noyes, U.S. Forest Service project manager for a proposed 37-mile ORV  trail through the county's Cleveland National Forest, describes similar  opposition to off-roaders during hearings about the project. He is sampling  local opinion on the Sunshine ORV Trail which will wind from near El Capitan  Reservoir dam north to near San Diego Country Estates and Ramona, then east  past Sunshine Mountain to Boulder Creek Road.  </P> <P> Noise, littering, vandalism, environmental impact and myriad other concerns  have been voiced at three "scoping" meetings Noyes has held in the back country  and in San Diego.  </P> <P> He defends the project as consistent with federal policies to open up federal  lands for the enjoyment of people, and points out that the trail would be a  narrow, challenging course designed for sturdy vehicles at low speeds, not the  straight-aways, hill-climbs and open areas that attract off-road daredevils on  three-wheeled ATVs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> At Least 5 Years  </P> <P> Noyes estimates that it will be about five years before the Sunshine Trail  becomes a reality because of the time-consuming process involved in public  hearings and environmental impact studies, and, in part, because of the growing  opposition to the project.  </P> <P> Parts of the trail may have to be rerouted to avoid residential areas and some  land may have to be acquired to buffer the adjoining private property from the  ORV trail, Noyes said.  </P> <P> The route now runs within a quarter of a mile of expensive homes in San Diego  Country Estates and even closer to Barona Indian Reservation land. Both groups  have objected as have the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society and other  environmental protection organizations.  </P> <P> Brown, who has retired from active ORV sport but continues to champion the  cause, points out that San Diego County has about 200,000 off-road riders  divided roughly into two groups: those who ride for the thrill of it and those  who ride to explore new places.  </P> <P> There are trails for horsemen and hikers. So, Brown asks, why not trails for  off-roaders?  </P> <P> There are a number of trails and ORV riding areas in the county -- ranging from  the giant sandbox called Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreation Area in the  extreme northeastern part of the county to Lark Canyon and Corral Canyon, two  Bureau of Land Management ORV sites in the rugged southeastern sector of the  county.  </P> <P> Off-roaders can ride without interference on dozens of truck trails in the  Cleveland National Forest and on other government lands. Less than legal but  popular is a network of trails and hills on Otay Mesa, which can be reached  from Interstate 805 at Palm Avenue. This, the only ORV area that can boast its  own freeway off-ramp, will soon give way to housing tracts.  </P> <P> To the east, where Otay Mesa rises into the mountains, county and state  officials are quietly negotiating with a private landowner to acquire a sizable  tract for ORV activities. The project, near a proposed border race track for  motorized vehicles, may fall prey to rising land prices in the area. Property  which once could have been purchased for $4,000 to $6,000 an acre now lies  within a mile of land selling for $50,000 and more an acre.  </P> <P> More certain is the acquisition of the Fadam Ranch adjacent to Lark Canyon ORV  areas in the McCain Valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Isn't Enough  </P> <P> Even with the advent of the Sunshine Trail, the addition of two more ORV sites  and the on-going expansion of the Ocotillo Wells area, San Diego will still be  short of ORV recreational space. Eighty percent of the state's ORV enthusiasts  reside in Southern California and San Diego County ranks second only to Los  Angeles County in the number of ORV owners.  </P> <P> Brown admits that some of the blame lies with the off-roaders, past and  present, who have alienated the citizenry with their freewheeling ways.  </P> <P> "It's a lesson we have learned that the jet skiers would be wise to follow,"  Brown said. "If there is a law, obey it. If you don't like it, let's change  it."  </P> <P> He sees in the unregulated jet ski craze the same problems which the  off-roaders brought upon themselves: unregulated activities causing accidents  and incidents, the spotlight of the press focusing on each accident and injury,  and an increasingly hostile public.  </P> <P> "Soon, legislation is coming down (on jet skiers) and if they don't organize  and get with it, they will be in trouble," Brown said. It's much better to set  your own rules and police them than to live by the laws set down by  unsympathetic legislators, he said, speaking from experience.  </P></p>

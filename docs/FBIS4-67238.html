			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>   [Text] The Attorney General Office's [PGR] Planning Center  for Drug Control [Cendro] has said that the area devoted in  Mexico to narcotics crops "increases continually due to, among  other things, the poverty created for years by low agriculture  yields, the lack of infrastructure, and the low prices of  agricultural products."    Cendro added that, after narcotics crops on thousands of  hectares in northern Mexico were razed, drug traffickers moved  to the southern part of the country, devastating forest areas in  Veracruz, Puebla, and the tropical jungle in Oaxaca, Chiapas,  Tabasco, Campeche, and Quintana Roo.    The PGR has admitted that production of narcotics, mainly  opium, has increased in nearly every southern state in the  country as a consequence of the reactivation of the opium market  in the United States and Europe.    Oaxaca is one of the four states where opium fields are most  abundant. These fields are located in San Vicente Coatlan,  Coicoyan del las Flores, Miahuatlan de Porfirio Diaz, Oaxaca de  Juarez, Pinotepa de Don Luis, San Baltasar Chichicapam, and San  Carlos Yautepec, all of them in La Mixteca and the Southern  Sierra Madre, where it borders with Guerrero state and the  Tehuantepec isthmus.    Cendro reports that as a result of unemployment in Oaxaca,  more than 2,000 Zapotec, Mixtec, and Chinantec Indians have been  hired by drug traffickers to grow marijuana and poppy on their  plots of land and store marijuana in their storage areas. This  happens in Ejutla de Crespo, Ixtepec, and San Miguel del Puerto  municipalities.    In Chiapas, Indian communities and Guatemalans, working  together near the border with Guatemala, participate in the  production of drugs. The Papaloapan River basin, one of the  largest production areas, located on the border between Oaxaca  and Veracruz, has begun to be used as a distribution center by  drug traffickers who force peasants to grow narcotics crops.    According to the Cendro report, the Pacific region was  Mexico's largest production area from 1988 to 1992, and it  elicited the strongest action by the authorities.    Sinaloa was the top marijuana producer, with 20.90 percent  of  the total that was destroyed throughout the country. Michoacan  was second. In Jalisco, the area where marijuana was destroyed  in 1992 and 1993 was three times larger than in 1991,  particularly in the municipalities of San Sebastian, Tequila,  and Villa Corona. Other municipalities have been more active,  such as Hostotipanquillo, Magdalena, Colotlan, Pihuamo,  Tecalitlan, and Ciudad Guzman, where vigilance was improved with  1,500 soldiers, who have intensified the fight against the  growing, harvesting, and transporting of drugs. This fight has  been supported by Mexican Air Force and PGR helicopters.    In Sinaloa, which ranks as the largest grower of poppy, the  area where this crop was destroyed increased by 74 percent in  1992 and 1993, as compared to 1991. The destruction of crops  took place mostly in Badiraguato, Mazatlan, and Choix. Last  year, 3,552 hectares planted with poppy were razed in the state.    The municipalities most affected were Choix, Cosala,  Badariguato, Ahome, and San Ignacio, where peasants continue to  be hired on a large-scale basis to grow and harvest the  narcotic. Irrigation systems and tools were observed in some of  the fields that were destroyed.    Cendro says that the production of marijuana has been steady  in most Nayarit municipalities. Nevertheless, the usage of land  increased by as much as 80 percent in 1993, mostly in the  municipalities of Ixtlan, Huajicori, Compostela, Nayar, and San  Pedro.    In Durango, eight times more marijuana was destroyed in 1993  than in 1992. The increase in the identification and  destruction of marijuana fields has been marked. The  municipalities where this problem is greater are Armeria,  Tecoman, Minatitlan, and Coquimatlan. This situation is caused  by the weather conditions both along the coast and in the  highlands.    In states where crops were less abundant, the strategy  changed. This is what happened in Atolinga, Zacatecas State,  where the Federal Judicial Police discovered marijuana fields  interspersed with corn fields.    In the Pacific zone, regarded as one of the largest  producers, 24.7 percent more narcotics fields were destroyed  than last year.    In 1992, the eradication of poppy plantations in the area  increased by 24.69 percent compared with 1991, mostly in  Guerrero State. There, 4,071.4 hectares, which represented 35.1  percent of the total nationwide, were destroyed in 1992. Poppy  plantations were located in the municipalities of Ajuchitlan,  Copanatoyac, Coyuca de Catalan, Chilapa de Alvarez,  Chilpancingo, General Heliodoro Castillo, Iguala, Jose Azueta,  Leonardo Bravo, and Metlatonoc.    The Cendro contends that physical and socioeconomic  conditions in Michoacan favor a high level of drug trafficking.  As a result, Michoacan is one of the major producers of  marijuana and, according to statistics, 3,231 hectares were  eradicated during the 1992-93 period, which is a 60-percent  increase over the previous year.    The mountains of Acuitzio, Apatzingan, and Tacambaro  continue  to be areas for growing illegal crops while Nuevo Urecho,  Penjamillo, Los Reyes, and San Lucas are municipalities that  have recently joined the program to eradicate illegal crops.    Heroin is produced in Michoacan, a state where there is  virtually no eradication of poppy, which leads to the assumption  that the opium comes from Guerrero State.    As for central Mexico, the Cendro reveals that drug crops on  plots equipped with an irrigation infrastructure on ranches  owned by Juan Jose Quintero Payan were detected in San Miguel de  Allende. In addition, marijuana plantations have been detected  in Dolores Hidalgo and Juventino Rosas.    A field of marijuana ready to be harvested was found in  Tejupilco, Mexico State. Mexico State is considered a broad  area for sowing and growing marijuana, particularly places such  as the hills of San Vicente, San Miguel Grande, the highlands of  San Pedro Limon, and along some of the road to Los Bejucos.  <H5>  They Even Have Irrigated Agricultural Areas </H5>   There is a generalized increase in the lands used for  growing  marijuana, expanding its scope of influence in the central area  and incorporating new plots equipped with irrigation systems.    This practice promotes the relocation of this crop in areas  that, because of their characteristics, yield a larger amount  and higher-quality drug. These practices have been detected in  areas bordering San Luis Potosi-Hidalgo-Veracruz and  Guerrero-Michoacan.    As for northern Mexico, the problem of drug crops in  Chihuahua is increasing, especially in the region inhabited by  the Tepehuan and Tarahumara Indians.    In those regions, the Cendro notes, given the poverty levels  among native groups, illegal crops are easily incorporated. In  1992-1993, there was a determined antidrug effort by the  authorities in Baborigame.  <H5>  Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa: the "Golden Triangle" </H5>   Drug-sowing in the Tepehuan region include the States of  Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. This area--also known as "the  Golden Triangle"--possesses the best conditions for the  production of marijuana and poppy among all areas in northern  Mexico. The Tepehuan region garners elements such as  geographical isolation, poverty and social backwardness, which  make it particularly attractive to drug traffickers.    The emergence of drug production in southern Baja California  State is troubling. In 1992-1993, marijuana plantations,  equipped with a modern and working irrigation system, were  eradicated for the first time since 1984 in the municipality of  Comondu. Marijuana plantations have also been found near  Guerrero Negro.    "Mobile" crops represent an option for drug traffickers  because they can be removed easily and rapidly if the  authorities detect them. During 1992, there was an increase in  the eradication of plantations of this type in the States of  Sinaloa and Sonora.    In the months of July, August, and September 1992, 1,559  hectares of marijuana were destroyed in Sinaloa and Sonora, thus  increasing to 33 percent the average of eradicated marijuana  registered during the same period in the three previous years.    However, reports indicate a reversal for illegal crops in  the  municipalities of Alamos and Ures, Sonora State. The  eradication of mobile crops in El Venadito's ejido in the  municipality of Alamos, where marijuana was grown in plastic  bags is worth mentioning.    Regarding poppy production, 2,713.6 hectares of poppy were  destroyed in the states near the northern border. These 2,713.6  hectares represent 23.6-percent of the total destroyed  nationwide, and represents a 136.4-percent, 44.2 percent, and  77.2 percent increase compared with the three previous years,  respectively, the Cendro ends.</p>

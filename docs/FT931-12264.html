			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Cathay Pacific strike ends as labour law debate escalates HONG KONG'S first significant industrial dispute since the 1970s has all but ended, with the management of Cathay Pacific Airlines saying more than 90 per cent of its 4,000 flight attendants are available for work. The 15-day strike has highlighted glaring inadequacies in the colony's labour laws, at a time when Governor Chris Patten's push for further democracy has led to expectations of far-reaching change from the administration. The dispute commenced after cabin attendants temporarily filled junior positions during staff shortages - three air hostesses were dismissed when they refused to comply, sparking a wildcat strike by the Flight Attendants Union. It soon escalated into a debate over the right of workers to go on strike. Hong Kong labour laws provide no protection for management or staff. Cathay Pacific claims the strike was the work of a few trouble-makers and is calling for new legislation. This is being echoed by the strikers, who were threatened with 'disciplinary' action if they did not return - management has the legal right to dismiss them for breach of contract. So far the government reaction has been muted. Mr Albert Chan, spokesman for the United Democratic party, said: 'If there is no action taken by the administration, I would have to question the spirit of (Mr Patten's) policy speech.' The party has been Mr Patten's staunchest supporter in the colony's Legislative Council. The strike took place during Hong Kong's busiest holiday season, the Chinese New Year, when more than 1m people leave the city. Cathay Pacific spokesman Mr Rowland Cobbald said the company would continue chartering flights over the weekend to cope with heavy demand, but he claimed that normal flight schedules would resume by the start of next week. The strike cost Cathay as much as HKDollars 20m (Pounds 1.6m) a day. Mr Sheldon Kasowitz, director of Jardine Fleming Asia Research, said: 'We will be reducing our 1993 profits forecast by HKDollars 250m, to reflect the cost of the strike. On that basis, it is hard to argue that the management has won this battle.'</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Spinning imports hit Shiloh SHILOH, the textile spinner, healthcare and protective clothing group, suffered a Pounds 440,948 setback in profits to Pounds 659,383 pre-tax for the year to end-March. Spinning profits fell significantly. Directors blamed the erosion of margins here on competition from subsidised imports. Group turnover expanded from Pounds 16.28m to Pounds 18.97m - healthcare and protective clothing now account for over 50 per cent of sales. Earnings fell to 7.98p (12.52p). A final dividend of 1.75p makes a 5.125p (2.625p) total. However, 2.5p of the past year's dividend was a special payment arising from profits from the sale of land.</p>

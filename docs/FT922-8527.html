			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: A Washington/Dublin Messiah even a Messiah of superior quality - had not this one, among many other points of interest, brought forward a remarkable mezzo, with the most alluring new voice I've heard this season. She is Denyce Graves, Washington-born, 28 years old, a graduate of the Houston Opera Studio. I had heard of her - she has sung a clutch of Carmens in America and Europe - but I didn't know she was so good. My colleague Joseph McClellan, the critic of the Washington Post, who had heard her in Washington as Maddalena and in Elgar's The Light of Life, told me that every time he hears her she has taken a great leap forward. Washington celebrated the 250th anniversary of Messiah with a reconstruction of the original, 1742 Dublin text. Miss Graves played Mrs Cibber, the tragic (but also comic) actress entrusted with 'He shall feed his flock' (the whole of it, not shared with the soprano, as it was shared at Covent Garden the following year, between Mrs Cibber and Kitty Clive, a Lucy and a Polly from The Beggar's Opera), 'He was despised,' and 'If God is for us'. When Mrs Cibber died, Garrick said, 'tragedy died with her.' She was not a virtuoso vocalist, but, Burney said, 'by perfect conception of the words, she often penetrated the heart when others, with infinitely greater skill, could only reach the ear.' In a splash of luxury casting, America's two leading countertenors, Drew Minter and Jeffrey Gall, played William Lamb and Joseph Ward, the countertenors Handel found in the Dublin cathedral choirs, the first assigned an aria ('O thou that tellest'), the other a duet with the tenor, and the two of them briefly entwined in a duet setting of 'How beautiful are the feet'. Curious to see them sitting by - appraising, admiring - during Mrs Cibber's songs, which both of them, in other versions of Messiah, have so often sung with distinction. Handel had seven soloists in Dublin. In Washington, Benita Valente was his soprano (Signora Avoglio), Curtis Rayam was his tenor (John Bayley) and David Arnold doubled as the two basses (John Hill and John Mason). They were all on peak form, singing lightly and clearly, purely tuned, singing on the words, without pushing. The Smithsonian Concerto Grosso (in this Dublin version just strings, with trumpets and drums in a few numbers) played well. The conductor was Paul Traver, and the choir was his University of Maryland Chorus, which has been the glory, year after year, of the Maryland Handel Festival - fluent, athletic, purely tuned, verbally acute. (The recession and the starving of funds to education last year broke off the festival's progress through the oratorios; but it seems that it may resume in October with Hercules.) Traver is a Handel conductor who can combine lightness and grace with earnestness and majesty. This Messiah moved surely. And the 'Dublin version' moves surely, too. As a generalisation, the first version of any Handel work is greater than the revivals where he adjusted the music to accommodate a new cast. The Maryland oratorio performances use first version as base text. Messiah is perhaps an exception; the 4/4 'Rejoice', for example, is surely an improvement on Dublin's 12/8 version. But the sequence of soloists in the Dublin Messiah - the delaying of the soprano's and of Mrs Cibber's 'entrance arias' - is excellently dramatic. Denyce Graves, in Mrs Cibber's songs, displayed a voice suggesting that, to put it simply, America has acquired a new Kathleen Ferrier, a singer whose tones run from the depths to the peaks - unforced, unpushed - in tones that are beautiful and moving, and one who communicates the sense of the words that she sings. A biographical note in the programme, however, predicted a dull immediate future: merely conventional, commercial star appearances as Carmen and as Delilah here, there, and everywhere. She is a more important singer than that. I look forward to hearing her as the Angel in Gerontius, in the Matthew Passion, as Gluck's Orpheus, and in the new works that our living composers, once they have heard her, will surely be inspired to write for her. This Messiah was a part of Kennedy Center's Tribute to Germany, supported by the German government and sponsored by Robert Bosch, Daimler-Benz, the Deutsche Bank, Lufthansa, Mannesmann, Miles (a Pittsburgh subsidiary of Bayer), Siemens, and Thyssen, along with 'a generous grant' from Du Pont and 'gifts' from various American companies, foundations, and individuals. Handel was born in Germany; the Stuttgart Ballet (Marcia Haydee made her American farewell the day before this Messiah) was another part of the tribute. The patterns of patronage have changed since Handel's day. Jim Wolfensohn, the chairman of Kennedy Center, has evidently mastered them.</p>

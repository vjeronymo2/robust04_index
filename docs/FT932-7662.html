			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / HK anxious over China MFN decision: What the colony stands to lose if Beijing's trade privileges are curtailed THE MOST interested bystander in the run-up to President Bill Clinton's decision on June 3 to renew or not to renew China's most favoured nation trading status is Hong Kong. Hong Kong, which over the past decade has become China's most important international port, has much to lose if the US decides to curtail China's trading privileges. China dominates the colony's burgeoning re-export trade. Last year Hong Kong re-exported to the rest of the world goods of Chinese origin with a value of HKDollars 403.8bn (Pounds 33.9bn) (up 28 per cent on 1991) and re-exported to China goods with a value of HKDollars 212bn (up 38 per cent). This re-export trade - which in real terms earns the colony between HKDollars 16 to HKDollars 20 in every HKDollars 100 of re-exports - has confirmed the colony's role as China's pre-eminent entrepot. But the enmeshing of the two economies has made Hong Kong vulnerable to actions taken against China. The Hong Kong government reckons that in the worst case - the removal of China's MFN status - Hong Kong's growth rate could halve from about 6 per cent to 3 per cent and up to 70,000 workers lose their jobs. The impact on southern China, principally Guangdong, has not been the subject of economists' estimates. It is, however, a fair bet that in the worst case many of the 3m who are employed in Hong Kong-owned factories there would suffer the same fate as their Hong Kong compatriots. One Hong Kong manufacturer of toys and electronic games in southern China has told the local authorities that half its 3,000-member work force will be shed if China loses its MFN status. 'We will immediately set up a factory in Macao if China loses MFN,' a senior executive said. Other observers in the colony, mostly academic economists, greet the annual MFN renewal process with a degree of puzzlement. They point out that by imposing conditions on China's MFN status, the US will be harming the process that it has most applauded in the past, the growth of a capitalist market in China. They also observe that the US is trying to have it both ways. On the one hand it applauds the migration of Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses to the mainland, and the 'subversive' impact that may have on the regime's control of China, but on the other hand by seeking to make MFN conditional it undermines that business migration. Others, like Professor Y Y Kueh, of Lingnan College in Hong Kong, point to the effects this business migration has had on the bilateral trade balances of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China with the US. From this perspective it is possible to argue that the motivating force behind China's trade surplus with the US is not China as such, but the transplanted factories of Hong Kong and Taiwanese companies. The links between investment and trade are well known and for Professor Kueh it is no coincidence that the trade surpluses of Hong Kong and Taiwan with the US fell off sharply at the same time as China's trade surplus with the US began to take off. 'The downturn in the Hong Kong and Taiwan trade surpluses with the US are the mirror images of the upturn in the mainland's surplus with the US,' he said. Whether the recognition of this will have much impact in Washington remains to be seen. Yet curiously the prospect that President Clinton may attach conditions to China's renewal of MFN - or threaten tough conditions in a year's time if improvements in human rights, arms sales and trading practices are not made - has failed to stir the colony as much as it has in the past. This is best seen in the behaviour of the local bourse which rises ever higher on larger and larger volumes of transactions. This time last year and indeed since 1990, when a Republican president was in the White House and showed little interest in MFN conditionality, the annual ritual of MFN renewal always had the power to undermine investor confidence. What has changed this time is that Hong Kong has seen the likely list of conditions Mr Clinton might apply and concluded that the colony, and probably China, can live with them. Mr Paul Cheng, chairman of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce and the head of Inchcape, the UK trading house, says: 'I am cautiously optimistic.' Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, is also confident that he was able to convince the US administration and Congress not to make Hong Kong's political development a condition of renewal, if conditions are placed on MFN. He also points out that for the US to enforce the sanction most touted  -that higher tariffs be applied to goods from China's state-owned sector - would be virtually impossible. But in the end is also the view that annual MFN renewal process is the best stick with which the US has to influence policy in China. According to Mr Enzio von Pfeil, economist with Warburg Securities: 'At the end of the day I do not think the Americans want to remove China's MFN. If they do they will have lost their stick.'</p>

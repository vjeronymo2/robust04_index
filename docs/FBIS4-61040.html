			<p>BFN     [Text] Currently 742 instances of HIV infection are  registered in Russia. Specialists think that it is merely a  tenth of the total number of infected people.    The Russian Federal Scientific and Methodological Center to  combat AIDs is the main body dealing with the problem. Vadim  Pokrovskiy, its head, said that there was no radical method of  treatment for AIDS thus far. Prevention is, therefore, the only  option here. However, it is mainly the costs of treatment that  are being met so far. Thus, for instance, the 130 AIDS patients  at the clinic in Sokolinyye Gory are served by personnel  numbering 340 specialists.    Enormous resources are being spent to find out who is  infected, but there are only three people from the center to  combat AIDS that work in the area of prevention.    This 20th century plague has claimed 105 lives in Russia to  date.</p>

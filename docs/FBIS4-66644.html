			<p>CSO     [Text] London, March 14 (UNI [United News of India]): India  and Britain on Monday added a new dimension to their economic  relations by signing an agreement on promotion and protection of  investments from each other's country.    The agreement was signed by the British Foreign Secretary,  Mr. Douglas Hurd, and the Indian High Commissioner to Britain,  Mr. L.M. Singhvi at 10, Downing Street, in the presence of the  Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and his British  counterpart, Mr. John Major.    Britain is the first country with which India has signed  such  an agreement, aimed at creating conditions conducive for  investments in each other's country and designed to increase  investor confidence. Protection of a wide range of investments,  including moveable and immoveable property, mortgages, liens,  pledges, shares and stocks and intellectual property rights is  covered by the agreement.    An official spokesman for the Indian delegation said the  central idea behind the agreement was that each of the  contracting parties would ensure fair and equitable treatment as  well as full protection and security to investments from the  other country.    He said that initially, the agreement would remain in force  for a period of 10 years. Thereafter, it could be terminated if  either contracting party gave notice of termination to the other.    If such a step is taken, it would be on a non-discriminatory  basis and would entail fair and equitable compensation to the  affected investor.    Article 5 and 6 of the agreement guarantee that investments  of investors of either contracting party shall not be  nationalised or expropriated except for certain public purposes  related to the internal requirements for regulating economic  activity.    Moreover, the investor would also have a right to review by  a  judicial or another independent authority of the contracting  party. Investors, whose investments suffer due to war, other  armed conflicts, national emergency or civil disturbances are  guaranteed of a treatment as regard compensation which would not  be less favourable than which the contracting party accords to  its own investors or the investors of any third State.    Several dispute resolution mechanisms are dealt with  including amicable settlements through direct negotiations  between the parties to the dispute, international reconciliation  under the conciliation rule of the United Nations Commission on  International Trade Law, and recourse to be international centre  for settlement of the disputes.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Danger in making premature judgments Sir, The logic of your recent editorial ('England's local shambles', August 25) fell below the levels that your readers have come to expect. First, you assume what you set out to prove: that the Local Government Commission will produce unnecessary structural change, while ignoring the advantages of a more pragmatic approach and of improvements to the existing two-tier system. You would be wise to wait before rushing to premature judgments. The commission is well aware of all the risks you mentioned; indeed, we have alerted you to many of them. Second, the changes of which you evidently approve - to correct the mistakes made in 1974 - will only be possible with the kind of independent but local consideration that the review is able to provide. How otherwise can Parliament sensibly identify the 'handful of large cities' to become unitary authorities, and those 'counties . . . enjoying little local loyalty' which, presumably, you would like to see abolished. Finally, you take us to task for implementing one of only two reforms that you believe necessary to enhance local democracy, the use of advisory local referendums to give electors a direct say on local matters of concern to them. This is precisely what the Local Government Commission is now doing throughout shire England, as we consult local people on the appropriate structure for their local government and to which there has been a magnificent and unprecedented response. Of course, there are risks involved in the Local Government Review - just as there are in the alternative approach that has been adopted in Scotland and Wales. Managing them is not made easier by premature editorials riddled with fallacies. Sir John Banham, Dolphyn Court, 10/11 Great Turnstile, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC1V 7JU</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Refugee zones scheme urged for Rwanda The presidents of Rwanda and neighbouring Zaire and Burundi called for internationally supervised security zones to be set up in Rwanda to encourage the return of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, Rwanda's Pasteur Bizimungu and Burundi's Sylvestre Ntibantuganya added that refugees remaining in Zaire would be relocated further from the border with Rwanda, according to a statement read on state television yesterday. 'Refugees refusing to return to their country of origin will be moved away from the frontier,' it said. The three men agreed on the need for the zones at a summit on Saturday at Mobutu's northern palace at Gbadolite. It was the latest of several meetings aimed at resolving the crisis caused by an exodus of more than 1m Rwandans who fled the advancing Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in July. The new Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government sees the presence in eastern Zaire of the refugees, discouraged from returning by the former Hutu militia leaders, ex-ministers and army chiefs in their midst, as a serious security threat . Burundi, where there are escalating clashes between local Hutus and Tutsis, believes that an influx of 200,000 Rwandans into its territory is fuelling ethnic hatred. Zaire, a close ally of the ousted Hutu leaders, is deeply concerned about deteriorating security in the squalid camps along its border with Rwanda. Zairean troops shot dead at least 18 people and wounded 70 in the Katale camp on Thursday and Friday after a soldier was killed in a quarrel over a refugee's car registration. Zaire on Sunday expelled 37 Hutus from the teeming Goma refugee camp, handing them over to RPF troops at the border in what an official said was a crackdown on crime. Mr Mobutu, hosting the Gbadolite summit, was quoted as calling the security zone idea a great step forward and saying he hoped it would win international backing.</p>

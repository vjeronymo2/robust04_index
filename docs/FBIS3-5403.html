It was once tolled contrary to usual practice 75 years ago,  at the time of the March 1st popular uprising.    The Buddhist monks defined rice market opening by the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique as contravening the Buddhist rules and  sounded the bell while an all-people rally against rice market  opening was taking place on the Seoul railway station plaza.    This was an expression of their opposition to rice market  opening and dismayed the puppet clique.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Further Barlow Clowes writs THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has issued further writs alleging negligence by financial institutions as part of its campaign to reclaim the Pounds 150m compensation paid to investors in Barlow Clowes, the collapsed financial services group. The first writs were issued in 1990 and further action is likely. Individual investors in Barlow Clowes assigned their legal rights of recovery to the government in return for compensation. National Westminster Bank was among the institutions to receive one of the recent batch of writs. The bank said the action would be vigorously defended.</p>

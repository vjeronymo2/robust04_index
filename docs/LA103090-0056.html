			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PLANS TALKS ON GULF OFFENSIVE;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: OFFICIALS ARE BECOMING CONVINCED THAT IRAQ WILL NOT QUIT KUWAIT.  BAKER WILL CONFER WITH ALLIES ON THE EMBARGO AND A TIMETABLE FOR POSSIBLE  MILITARY ACTION.  </P> <P> Within the next week, the Bush Administration will discuss a timetable for  possible use of military force against Iraqi forces in Kuwait at talks with  U.S. allies in Europe and the Persian Gulf, sources said Monday.  </P> <P> With Administration officials increasingly convinced that U.N. sanctions will  not force Iraq to withdraw, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will visit  Europe, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, perhaps as early as this weekend,  to assess the current status of the embargo and to consider additional steps,  including a military offensive, the sources said.  </P> <P> A senior government official in Washington declared that if the United States  were to exclude the military option, "it would be hard to find a scenario with  any link to reality." He added that the most likely time for a U.S. offensive  would be in December or January, "although it could come earlier or a little  later."  </P> <P> The official, who is involved in Persian Gulf strategy, indicated that he  considers war almost inevitable and said: "I know of no one who disagrees with  my assessment of the situation and what we have to do to achieve our goals."  </P> <P> In Washington and Saudi Arabia, senior U.S. officials, who agreed to interviews  on condition that they not be identified, said the time is fast approaching  when a decision must be made on how much more time sanctions will be given to  work.  </P> <P> And in speeches in California, which a Washington official said may be the  beginning of an orchestrated effort to prepare the American public for war,  both Baker and President Bush warned that the United States would not hesitate  to use force to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis if necessary.  </P> <P> In Saudi Arabia, a U.S. official said there is "absolutely no cause" for  optimism that Iraq's President Saddam Hussein will back down, adding that "we  are approaching the moment at which we'll have to make a judgment about how  long we will give sanctions to work."  </P> <P> Although the official said "no judgment has been made that sanctions will not  work," government analysts in Washington working on the crisis have concluded  that the sanctions alone will not bring enough pressure on Hussein to force him  to abandon Kuwait.  </P> <P> Other U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia said that a new sense of urgency about  resolving the crisis was rooted partly in the destruction of Kuwait, but also  in increasing concern about flagging American public support for what could be  a prolonged standoff.  </P> <P> The Iraqis are continuing to pour troops into Kuwait and build up their  defensive fortifications while looting the country of enough materials and  supplies to keep Iraq from feeling the full impact of the economic sanctions,  according to U.S. intelligence sources. The sanctions have had practically no  effect on the Iraqi military, the sources said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia said that new concerns also have been raised  about the time required to reinforce allied troops and equipment already there  and to prepare for combat in alien territory.  </P> <P> Even without a final decision about offensive operations, "you have to make  some decisions now to provide options for military force somewhere down the  road," said one official. "You have to make a decision to flesh out the options  now if you're actually going to have those options when it comes to the moment  when you weigh whether to use them or not."  </P> <P> Other U.S. officials indicated that some of the pressure for a decision on a  military option has come from U.S. theater commanders who, in making clear that  more troops would be needed for any U.S. ground attack against Iraq's  million-strong army, have asked for new guidance about the nature of the U.S.  mission in the gulf.  </P> <P> "A commander doesn't just ask for more troops," one source said. "He asks for  his mission."  </P> <P> Even though the United States has 210,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region and  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said that as many as 100,000 more may be  deployed, the military still lacks the guaranteed capability to launch an  offensive operation sufficient to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, officials  said.  </P> <P> Among other items likely to be on the agenda of the Baker visit are discussions  of future U.N. and Arab League resolutions against Iraq, discussions of  enforcement of sanctions and further talk about burden-sharing and the economic  impact of the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> But the principal goal of the trip, a U.S. official in Saudi Arabia said, will  be to "trade assessments of the situation" as a means of guiding military  preparations.  </P> <P> At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the purpose of  Baker's trip is to "consult with our coalition partners about the general  situation in the gulf and is part of our ongoing diplomatic effort to achieve  full compliance with the U.N. resolutions, with emphasis on effective  implementation of the sanctions."  </P> <P> However, Baker made clear that the United States will not wait indefinitely for  the sanctions to work. "Saddam Hussein must realize there is a limit to the  international community's patience," he said Monday in a speech to the Los  Angeles World Affairs Council.  </P> <P> Other U.S. officials said that Baker also hopes to repair some erosion in the  international coalition, making sure that U.S. allies stand fast in opposing  Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> A senior Pentagon official said Baker's trip comes at a critical time, both  because strains have begun to appear in the anti-Iraq coalition and because key  military decisions must be made now if an offensive operation is contemplated  before the end of the year.  </P> <P> "Until a couple of weeks ago, everybody was on board" behind Bush's demand for  an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the official said. "But in the  last two weeks, all kinds of contradictory signals have been sent," suggesting  the possibility of some sort of negotiated deal that would allow Hussein to  keep part of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Hussein's strategy ever since Bush dispatched troops to Saudi Arabia after the  Aug. 2 invasion has been to solidify his grip on Kuwait and to avoid any overt  provocation of U.S. forces while engaging in a standoff that he hopes will last  long enough to erode the international forces aligned against him.  </P> <P> "He can sit there indefinitely, and he knows how to absorb pain," said a U.S.  official. "But we can't sit there forever. We've got to make some hard  decisions about how to resolve it, and those decisions may come sooner rather  than later."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Norman Kempster contributed to this story.  </P></p>

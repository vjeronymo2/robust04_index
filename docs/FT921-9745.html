			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Portugal faces public sector strike over pay IN THE first sign of what could become a spring of discontent, unions representing Portugal's 300,000 public sector workers have called a one-day strike for next Tuesday to press for higher wages after the breakdown of tripartite negotiations with the government and employers. The Social Democratic administration of the prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, is determined to bring inflation - currently above 11 per cent on an annual average - and the budget deficit down. This is part of an ambitious plan for economic convergence with the European Community in preparation for Economic and Monetary Union. But the government's budget cuts and efforts to keep public sector wages in check, combined with a decision last month to raise value added tax on basic goods and services, are meeting increasing opposition. The strike call follows last week's unilateral announcement by the government that it will raise public sector pay by 8 per cent, in line with its inflation forecast for this year. The unions say this target is unrealistic and that the government's offer is penalising public sector workers, the majority of whom earn an average of Esc80,000-Esc90,000 (Dollars 580- Dollars 650) a month. They want a double digit rise, and argue that the government's announcement was unconstitutional as negotiations had not been completed. Last month, several thousand public employees demonstrated outside the headquarters for Portugal's EC presidency, and the unions promise more protests. However, the government is intent on pushing through what it considers are necessary if unpopular decisions in the early part of its new mandate, having won an absolute majority in last October's election.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Nam Son-yong from UN Headquarters] </F>   [Text] Hans Blix, director general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], today reported officially to UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that it has become  impossible for the IAEA to make a follow-up measurement [chuhu  kyechuk] of nuclear fuel rods at a reactor in Yongbon, North  Korea.    In his written report, Director General Blix said: Based on  the IAEA inspection team's report on the replacement of nuclear  fuel rods at a North Korean 5-megawatt reactor, the IAEA came to  the conclusion that the selection [sonbyol] of fuel rods to  determine whether North Korea has diverted nuclear fuel or not  has become impossible.    Serving as a final confirmation on the failure of the IAEA  inspection on the nuclear fuel rods in North Korea, his report  provides grounds for the UN Security Council to apply sanctions  against North Korea.    Accordingly, following a verbal report by Director General  Blix this afternoon [3 June], the UN Security Council will  likely have full-fledged discussions on methods of sanctions  against North Korea.    A UN diplomatic source says the United States, ROK, and  Japan  have begun to discuss a resolution on sanctions, and  France,which holds a hard-line position, has also separately  drafted a resolution.    According to this source, in light of the present  atmosphere,  it is highly possible that the UN Security Council will directly  apply economic sanctions without taking steps for warning. If  China continues opposition to sanctions, measures to prohibit  remittances from Japan and North Korean missile exports to the  Middle East will likely be taken, while permitting China to  continue supplying oil and food to North Korea.</p>

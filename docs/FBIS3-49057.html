			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Victor Ciorbea, president of the National </F> Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions-Fratia, by Liana B.  Iacob; place and date not given: "The Unions Cannot Accept a  Government of the Left Extreme That Is Being Prepared Now!"]    [Text] [Iacob] As a result of the PUNR [National Romanian  Unity Party] initiative, according to the statement made by  [PUNR Chairman Gheorghe] Funar, the trade unions should expect  to be invited to participate directly in the establishment of a  political and social pact. What is your opinion regarding this  issue?    [Ciorbea] For the time being, we are expecting a special  invitation addressed to us, after which, together with Alfa  [trade union confederation] and the BNS [National Trade Union  Bloc], we will establish whether we will attend those  discussions jointly or rather separately. In case we are really  invited, we will adopt the same stance as before, because in our  assessment the situation has remained unchanged. The trade  unions will not give up the idea of a real coalition government  set up with the participation of the parties that are members of  the democratic opposition. Otherwise we see no way in which a  social pact could be achieved and we are not prepared to  conclude such a pact with the current government.  Unfortunately, for the time being, all that may be expected is  merely a government reshuffle. However, the trade unions cannot  accept a government of the extreme left that is being prepared  now! Under such circumstances, I do not believe that another  round of talks could be held with the unions.    [Iacob] Do you intend to go on with your plan for the month  of January, referring to the continuation of the union struggle  by means of strikes, even if Cotroceni [the presidency] invites  you to sign a social pact?    [Ciorbea] Yes, our plan remains valid, and I would like to  emphasize the fact that union solidarity is stronger than ever,  despite all contrary rumors and despite the alleged diminishing  of the tension at the basis of the unions. A reshuffled  government, with a significant shift to the left and  authoritarian tendencies makes the entire reform process and  even democracy quite questionable, and therefore we cannot  accept a compromise with such grave consequences. We continue  to consult with the parties belonging to the democratic  opposition and we reassert the need for their authentic  participation in the governing of the country, and not merely by  the participation of a number of their representatives who would  receive decorative offices.    [Iacob] Should a coalition government be set up, are the  leaders of the large trade union confederations prepared to  personally participate in the government?    [Ciorbea] Under such circumstances it is possible that some  of the union leaders would accept to participate in the  government if they are asked to, and considering their  experience achieved in the union movement, they might prove to  be more efficient on the other side of the barricade as well.  Personally, I haven't considered my joining the government, as  I believe that there is still a great deal of work for me to do  here, in the union movement.</p>

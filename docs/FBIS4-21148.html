It is an obstacle  to many things in addition to the counternarcotics effort.  Anything said about corruption in Venezuela is no  exaggeration." Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made those  statements in Congress, where he was called to answer questions  about a U.S. State Department report that corruption in  Venezuela hinders the fight against drug trafficking.    The interior minister clarified that he had not read the  report in question and did not have any details on this specific  case. He did say, however, that "corruption is a very leafy  tree in Venezuela."  <H5>  The Legislators </H5>   For his part, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, representative of the  Social Christian Party and chairman of the Chamber of Deputies  finance committee, said he had read that corruption hindered  counternarcotics efforts just as it negatively affected any  other government action.    The legislator added that he had not read the State  Department report, which has only appeared in the press, and  thus could not comment "on a report that only mentions Venezuela  in a few lines. I prefer that Venezuela be evaluated by  Venezuelans." He admitted that this type of report negatively  affects the government.    MIN [National Integrity Movement] legislator Gonzalo Perez  Hernandez said that if the U.S. Government has such information  on Venezuela "it is probably true, because it is hard to believe  that drug traffickers do not know the importance of politicians  in quieting investigations that could take them or their  representatives to jail."    He added that drug traffickers promote corruption in the  government security organizations to keep drug traffickers from  being punished. "If the United States has the names of people  and institutions at the service of drug traffickers in our  countries, it should identify them to help us combat drug  trafficking and the corruption it generates."</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Not rich, but on top of his world  -Clive Fewins meets a happy band of thatchers THATCHING IS catching, according to mathematics graduate Martin 'Barney' Bardsley, who is confident that, barring ill health or acts of God, he will stay in the profession he switched to 16 years ago at the age of 27 for the rest of his working life. 'I have no regrets. My father, who started as a manual worker and finished life as a teacher, thought I was crazy leaving a secure job in the civil service, but I enjoy the work I do, even high up on roofs in the depths of winter.' Money is a different matter. There may be thatchers who drive BMWs and own farms on which they grow their own materials, but Barney Bardsley is not one of them. In spite of a working week that extends to six days and often breaks into a seventh Bardsley, 43, expects to earn well under Pounds 20,000 before tax this year. The same goes for his partner David Brown, 37. The two have shared all the profits since they merged their businesses to form Bardsley and Brown three years ago, and it has worked. 'Thatching can be a solitary life and both of us still wonder why we did not team up years before. David has always thatched - unlike me he comes from a thatching family - but he agrees that shared expertise and risk taking is a good idea, provided you trust one another.' That view has proved particularly true in the last precarious year. Bardsley and Brown have seen their order book shrink from one to two years in advance to six months. The recession has had a lot to do with it. But there is another reason: the number of thatchers has grown, not decreased, in recent years. 'Nowadays it is possible to go on a six month course, buy a thatching franchise and set up in business immediately after, and this is what a number of people have done after collecting their redundancy money,' Bardsley said. 'The result is that there are too many thatchers chasing too little work. Some thatchers - some of them very good - face going out of business.' Bardsley is slow to condemn the new thatching companies - he says there are some good ones - and he stresses the importance of younger people learning the craft. But he dislikes the idea of teams of thatchers, often employed by the larger companies. He feels this approach takes away much of the craft element of the work, and the interest of the individual thatcher in his work. It is this he enjoys most. 'This year it has been tough. David and I will only get near the Pounds 20,000 each we aim at if we manage to turn over Pounds 80,000, as we did in 1990, but with the bad harvest last year and consequent higher price of straw, the wet autumn, rising insurance costs and increasing competition I doubt if we shall achieve this. 'We could make more money if we dropped our standards, but this is something neither of us are prepared to do. To us job satisfaction is all-important. By now I would probably be earning far more if I had continued as a statistician at the Transport and Road Research laboratory. But I can't help being a romantic. I love thatching and the satisfaction it brings desite the harsh winter conditions and the current insecurity. 'It is hard to describe all the satisfactions, but every roof presents a separate challenge. It is hard to describe the feeling you get when driving past a well thatched roof that you have done many years later and thinking 'I did that'.' 'On big roofs the work can be repetitive. But that only lasts until you hit an interesting spot and with the two of us plus our apprentice, who is soon to qualify, we are able to switch jobs to make it interesting for all three of us.' Thatching has traditionally been carried out by small firms, and even today there are thatching families in which the line can be traced back for many generations. However, while running a larger business with several teams has been shown to be the way to make money, the Bardsley and Brown way is not currently very profitable. 'Pricing jobs is very difficult, particularly when you know you are probably competing with someone who is likely to come in beneath you with a stupid price,' Bardsley said. 'Balancing up the jobs on which you make a good profit against those that turn out barely profitable is very difficult. We price jobs by the square, a square being 100 sq. ft, for which the price is Pounds 600. For ridges - the trickiest part of the job - we charge so much per foot, depending on the style of ridge. 'Then there are the materials. In our area, south Oxfordshire, Berkshire and north Hampshire, we nearly always use combed wheat reed. This is the straw left after harvesting long stemmed wheat. 'Generally we buy it from a dealer based in Somerset, for Pounds 485 a ton. Buying this way guarantees the quality. But even then every load of material has different characteristics. Even bundles in the same load can vary. The skilled thatcher will be able to get the best out of the varying characteristics.' Bardsley and Brown will not guarantee the lifespan of their roofs. Bardsley has seen roofs of water reed - the most durable thatching material - last 70 years and a good wheat reed roof should last 25 years before it needs a fresh top-coat. However, nearby trees, moss or bad air circulation can greatly reduce this figure. 'Thatching still comes back to skill and experience,' Bardsley said. 'If you have a thatched property you have get to know and trust your thatcher, and a good thatcher will respect that. Some firms - I call them factory thatchers  -just go in and out fast and make the job last only seven or eight years. They get away with it, and they often make a lot of money. 'I couldn't sleep at night if I worked that way. But the sad thing is that village communities are changing rapidly and virtually no thatch-owners know anything about the subject. They fall hook, line and sinker for a gleaming, newly-thatched roof, whatever the standard of workmanship. Sadly, only a skilled thatcher can immediately distinguish between the good jobs and the atrocious ones.' Bardsley and Brown, 1, Marlston Cottages, Marlston, Hermitage, Berks RG16 9UN.

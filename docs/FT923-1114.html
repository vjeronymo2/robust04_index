			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok finds support as Australia weakens Roundup TOKYO took the day off for a public holiday, but there was movement elsewhere in the region yesterday. BANGKOK thanked the bullish mood of Thais in rural areas as equities resumed their uptrend, the SET index moving ahead 7.95 to 871.37 in volume of 245m shares valued at Bt17.8bn, compared with 242m shares and Bt18.6bn the day before. Buying was active in the finance, bank and property sectors, with Bangkok Land, the most active stock in terms of turnover value, firming Bt1 to Bt150.00 on 11m shares traded. A malfunction in the SET's computer, which has processed unprecedented levels of business in the latest rally, suspended trading for about 10 minutes just before the market closed. The finance sector index posted the day's sharpest advance, 3.1 per cent. The property share index rose 1.5 per cent and banks were up 1.1 per cent. Finance companies are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings, bolstered by recent record trading volume. SEOUL rebounded from two days of losses, brokers remarking upon the emergence of so-called northern shares, related to trade with former or current communist countries. The composite index finished 5.19 better at 524.35 in moderate turnover of Won193.5bn, down from Tuesday's total of Won226.1bn. Gainers outnumbered losers 529 to 193 with 163 unchanged. Sunkyong moved forward Won800 to Won16,100 on reports that Choi Jong-hyun, the group's chairman, will accompany President Roh Tae-woo on Roh's visit to China later this month, along with 30 other officials studying the investment environment and the Chinese market. Daewoo gained momentum on rumours that Kim Woo-joong, its chairman, will join an economic feasibility team to North Korea later this month, but the stock also saw selling pressure on Kim's rumoured involvement in forming an opposition party. AUSTRALIA closed weaker for the second consecutive day because of uncertainty on overseas markets, Wall Street's 40-point fall on Tuesday keeping institutional investors out and leaving the All Ordinaries index 15.8 lower at 1,505.0. Over the past two days the index has lost 26.6, or 1.7 per cent. Turnover increased from ADollars 165m to ADollars 195m. Foster's Brewing declined 6 cents to ADollars 1.24 in turnover of 3.8m shares as investors remained concerned that its ADollars 1bn rights issue might not be fully subscribed by shareholders. MANILA fell afresh, depressed by the spate of kidnappings which has hurt the economically influential Filipino-Chinese community, and other factors such as the continued threat from the Mount Pinutabo volcano. The composite index lost 8.60 to 1,387.55 following Tuesday's 14.50 retreat. Turnover fell to 87m pesos from Tuesday's 91m pesos.</p>

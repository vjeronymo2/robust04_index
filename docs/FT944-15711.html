			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Economics Notebook: Problems with exchange rates The recent wild gyrations of the rouble may be a world away from the day to day preoccupations of foreign exchange markets. But they have been a reminder that currencies can be very volatile and have the capacity to spring surprises. Indeed, the many instances of foreign exchange market turbulence since the collapse of the semi-fixed Bretton Woods exchange rate system in 1973 have meant that exchange rate stability is rarely far from policy makers' minds. Trading in leading currencies has been comparatively calm so far this year. But this summer's celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods agreement triggered an extensive review among policy makers and academics of the current state of the international monetary system. The first obvious point to emerge from a plethora of conferences and reports is that nobody is particularly satisfied with the so-called 'non-system' of floating exchange rates for the world's leading traded currencies. On the other hand, it is difficult to think of anything better. The last of the big conferences marking the 50th birthday of Bretton Woods took place just ahead of this year's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Madrid. It was clear that there was a strong desire for greater exchange rate stability, particularly among such international monetary luminaries as Mr Paul Volcker, the erstwhile chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund who now heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Equally striking was the rejection by practising finance ministers and central bankers of the idea that the big three currencies - the dollar, yen and D-Mark - should be confined within 'target zones'. The general perception was that financial flows were too strong to permit any attempt by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to peg currencies in a more formal way. With characteristic bluntness, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, said that a return to targets for exchange rates was 'not remotely in the gift of the G7'. The accompanying chart, prepared by Ms Wendy Dobson, a professor at the University of Toronto and a former senior Canadian finance ministry official, suggests that pressure for formal target zones may be misplaced. She points out that 'a fair degree of stability' has existed among the leading currencies since 1987. Although floating rates are thought to worsen the climate for investment and international trade, world trade and investment have grown faster than world incomes since 1983. But these relative successes are no reason for leaving the system unchanged if it can be improved. In considering ways of promoting exchange rate stability, officials have been looking at the surveillance responsibilities of the International Monetary Fund. At present the IMF is charged with exercising 'firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of countries'. To this end it examines international monetary issues and analyses in detail the economic policies of its members, usually by sending missions to national capitals. These comb through the relevant data and discuss the results with the governments concerned. The findings from these so-called Article IV consultations are discussed by representatives of member countries in the IMF board but generally kept out of the public eye. Earlier this month, the Fund's policy making Interim Committee, representing its 179 members, ordered the IMF's executive board to work on strengthening Fund surveillance. The idea is that if countries can be persuaded to pursue sound and compatible economic policies, there will be less danger of exchange rates moving out of line. However, surveillance has been around for some time and has not always proved successful. Mr de Larosiere pointed out in Madrid that it had failed to prevent a sharp increase of public indebtedness in industrialised countries in the 1980s. The policy environment may be more encouraging today, even though this month's IMF meetings were marred by a row between the G7 countries and other nations over a proposed boost to global monetary reserves. Industrialised and developing countries are in broad agreement on the policies required to foster sustained non-inflationary growth. With policies and performance more in line than before there should be fewer fundamental reasons for exchange rates to move out of line. There are also plenty of ideas for making surveillance more effective. Ms Dobson has put forward suggestions for improvements to the existing surveillance system 'to promote international peer group pressure for sound domestic policies'. In particular, she suggests that the results of the IMF's Article IV consultations should be published. She has called for the greater involvement of the fast growing east Asian countries in discussion with the G7 nations. But although surveillance is fashionable, Mr Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist, warns that it would be going too far to see it as a stepping stone to a more fixed exchange rate system. Such words will encourage the supporters of target zones: they have lived to fight another day.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Sharply higher Christmas sales boost retailers Retailers in most of the UK yesterday reported encouraging sales in the last weekend before Christmas and a greatly improved sense of confidence among their customers. Shoppers appeared to welcome the decision taken by many retailers to ignore the law against Sunday trading and flocked to some shopping centres in record numbers. Many stores reported a sharp increase in sales after a November that was subdued ahead of the Budget. Retailers were relieved that consumer confidence seemed to have returned. They were also optimistic that this year would be an improvement on last year and considerably better than 1991, their worst Christmas in recent years. Shops in the south-east, one of the areas hardest hit during the recession by the fall in property values, appeared to have been among the main beneficiaries of the increase in seasonal sales. Liberty and Bentalls, which have branches in the home counties, reported sharply higher sales and were looking forward to a strong finish this week. Bentalls said sales were 17 per cent up on last year. Many retailers expecting this weekend to be their busiest were not disappointed, but they will only be able to report a 'good Christmas' if the late surge continues through Christmas eve. Mr George McDonald, manager of the Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle, one of Europe's biggest city centre complexes, said: 'There's a feeling of confidence. People are saying it's better than last year. The final analysis will be how that final week comes out.' The optimism seemed to be relatively well spread across the country. The number of people shopping and the amount they were spending were reported sharply up in Glasgow and the Midlands as well as London and the south east. Some shops in Leeds reported a 40 per cent increase in sales over last year. Selfridges, the Oxford Street retailer, believes the 1.5m shoppers who visited the department store last week, a 90,000 increase on the same week last year, spent at least 13 per cent more than in the same period last year. In the west country and south Wales, sales were more disappointing, with retailers reporting steady weekend shopping but no surge. In Cheltenham, sales at one of the main centres was slightly down on a week before. There was also a note of caution from the MetroCentre, Gateshead's enormous shopping complex, which is expecting 500,000 visitors this week. 'I think people are perhaps being a little bit more cautious in what they're spending,' said a manager. 'Perhaps there isn't quite so much money around.' Shops regain confidence, Page 6</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Justinian: Elusive definition of privacy It was the loss of the anonymity of Jennifer Bennett  - the girl whose ear condition was the basis of a Labour party election broadcast  - that lay at the heart of her parents' complaint to the Press Complaints Commission. Their complaint highlights the fact that the question of protecting children and other dependent persons against the consequences of publicity which may cause distress raise more direct and important issues than the wider and less specific issue of privacy. The problem for the Bennett family was that the newspaper industry has in its Code of Practice a clause protecting privacy. It says nothing about protecting children from publicity unwanted by parents seeking to safeguard the interests of their offspring. The Press Complaints Commission ruled that the Bennetts had waived their privacy by agreeing to the use in the broadcast of their daughter's experience of delay in getting surgical treatment on the NHS. Their action placed the issue of Jennifer's treatment 'in the public domain', where it then became an appropriate subject for investigative journalism. The waiver covered all aspects of privacy, despite the Bennetts' express reservation that their daughter's identity should not be revealed in any media use of the storm about the supposed failings of the NHS. It is odd that the press has not emulated the law in throwing a protective cloak around children. The law, in fact, goes out of its way to protect young people in Court proceedings. The power of the courts is to direct the press and broadcasting not to report court proceedings which reveal the name, address, or school of a child  - or otherwise give information which identifies the child in court proceedings. The significance of this protective rule is that it covers the child witness and not just the child in trouble with the law, for whom it might be said there should not be overfondness in concealing the identify of an offender. The general practice nowadays is for courts to make orders restricting media publication whenever a juvenile is concerned. All this proclaims society's view that personal information about children is not for public consumption. Why, then, should not the press take a hint from the legislature and regulate itself in the same spirit? Presumably the Code of Practice which the Press Complaints Commission is administering is not immutable. But it is timely for the newspaper industry to propose revision of its code. The endless arguments over the need for, or nature and scope of a law of privacy, founders on where to draw the line between what is public and what remains private. Clearly, if the information is to be protected it must not be a matter of public record or observable in a public place. One step out of the front door on to the street, and the hungry photographer can take a picture. Attempts to specify precisely what is 'private' have so far escaped the authors of privacy legislation. If the proponents want a privacy law of whatever sort it is vital to distinguish what is personal from what is not. The Australian Law Reform Commission in 1979 did attempt to define the scope of the legal protection against unauthorised publicity. It adopted a category of sensitive private facts. The category relates to the health, private behaviour, home life, or personal or family relationships of the individual 'in circumstances in which the publication is likely to cause distress, annoyance or embarrassment to an individual'. Even though the list begs certain questions  - for example, what is 'private behaviour'?  - it does provide the basis for a sensible determination of what publications are 'in the public interest'. Once the scope of private information is established, the remaining issue is how far press freedom and responsibility override the personal fact. The story of Jennifer's ear was a matter of acute public interest. It provided the media in the throes of heightened electoral activity with a significant political row between the parties over the rival values attached to the National Health Service. But did the disclosure of Jennifer's identity add anything to the legitimate story? And if it did conceivably add a dimension to the story, was that addition justifiable, compared to the distress which was likely to be caused to the child and her family. Anonymity of children and other dependents is an issue for anyone concerned with the responsibility of a free press. It deserves to be high on the agenda of anybody involved with a revised code of practice.</p>

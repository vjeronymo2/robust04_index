			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> ROTHENBERG RELEASED ON PAROLE  </P> <P> Charles David Rothenberg was released from prison this morning, nearly seven  years after he burned his son beyond recognition in a twisted plot to hurt the  wife who divorced him.  </P> <P> At 12:40 a.m., Rothenberg was driven from an undisclosed California prison  under guard by four parole agents, who delivered him to an unnamed parole  destination sometime before 9 a.m., officials said.  </P> <P> Dressed in blue jeans and a chambray shirt and toting two boxes of personal  belongings, a prison spokesman said Rothenberg's only remark upon release was,  "I'm afraid and upset." While authorities refuse to identify his whereabouts  for fear such a disclosure would result in repeated and costly relocations,  they did say Rothenberg will hold a clerical job in private enterprise that  will "at least pay for his room and board."  </P> <P> Tipton C. Kindel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said  Rothenberg's living quarters "are essentially some type of an apartment  setting."  </P></p>

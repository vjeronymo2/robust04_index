The armed  forces are least prepared for these tasks at present, Federal  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said today after the cabinet  approved the Bundeswehr 1994 White Paper in Bonn.    Germany needs a minimum contigent "of available, quickly  deployable and transferable crisis reaction forces with a high  degree of professionalism," which were capable of multinational  cooperation.    At the same time the armed forces for national defense  should  be "scaled down both in numbers and in their readiness for  deployment and be made more responsive to mobilization."  According to Ruehe, nothing will be changed with regard to  conscription. It remains a constituent element of the  Bundeswehr.</p>

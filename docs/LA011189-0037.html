			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER ACCUSED OF CAMPUS BOOKMAKING  </P> <P> An English teacher accused of taking bets on sporting events from teachers and  students at a Sun Valley high school has been arrested on suspicion of  bookmaking, Los Angeles police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Charles Hammond, 54, of Van Nuys, was arrested Friday at John H. Francis  Polytechnic High School, where vice officers found bookmaking records in his  possession, Capt. Rick Dinse said.  </P> <P> When police later searched Hammond's home, they found a large amount of paper  work in which Hammond apparently recorded bets from students and teachers,  Dinse said. Police also found cocaine paraphernalia and a small amount of  marijuana in the home, he said.  </P> <P> Hammond was released from the North Hollywood jail on $500 bail after his  arrest.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified School District officials said Hammond has been transferred  to a non-teaching position, but made no other comment. Hammond could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Police said Hammond apparently was running a small one-man operation that  catered to about a dozen teachers and students and took bets of up to $20 on  pro football games and other sports events. But an investigation is continuing  to determine how much money Hammond took in and whether other bookmakers were  involved, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Extensive' Records  </P> <P> "The records we got from him are quite extensive," Lt. Brad Merritt said. "But  so far we have no indications there was anybody else involved."  </P> <P> There are about 110 teachers and administrators and 2,400 students at  Polytechnic High, school officials said.  </P> <P> Merritt said the investigation began in early December, when an unidentified  student told school police that Hammond was taking bets. School police asked  the Los Angeles Police Department to investigate.  </P> <P> Officers determined that Hammond took bets at the school during lunch breaks  and after school, recording each transaction in a notebook, Merritt said. "He  never did it during classes," the police official said.  </P> <P> Under state education code and board policies, any teacher found guilty of  gambling either with students or on school grounds would be subject to  discipline ranging from a letter of reprimand to dismissal, said Ada Treiger,  an attorney for the school district.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Sam Enriquez contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Alice Ghostley always has been a favorite actress of mine, and I've been very  happy to see her appearances as Bernice on "Designing Women." Modeling a  Christmas-tree skirt or singing the blues over a fast-food restaurant  microphone, Ghostley adds a delightful touch to an already outstanding series.  Here's hoping we'll see more of her in future episodes.  </P> <P> Lawrence Rosen, Los Angeles  </P></p>

Police  liaison officers working in Tallin, St. Petersburg, and Moscow  for half a year have only reported minor incidents. This  assertion was made by a Swedish Security Police (SAPO) chief  superintendent who does not wish to be identified. The security  police addressed the audience of a well-visited seminar arranged  by the Baltic Center foundation in Stockholm yesterday.    "I recommend all companies that are active in the Baltic  states and Russia to contact our local police representatives.  They can be reached via the embassies in Tallin and Moscow and  the consulate in St. Petersburg. In May there will be a  policeman posted to Riga as well," the security police  representative said.    The businessmen at the seminar were eager to learn about the  magnitude of the risks for businessmen in the East. "We  recommend that you do not pay protection money. People who  become exposed to protection gangs must contact us immediately  for help," the police representative said. But after these  words of comfort to the businessmen, the security officer  painted an alarming picture of crime in the Baltic states and  Russia. It is perfectly obvious that there are mafia-like gangs  looking for profits in hard currency. They are often organized  by former KGB officers and specialize in controlling specific  areas like airports or dockyards. They defend their districts  with outrageous violence.    The many murders reported from the Baltic states and Russia  often relate to wars between various mafia gangs. It is  dangerous for the police to intervene in these conflicts. In  1990, as many as 364 policemen were killed in the former Soviet  area, compared to five in the United States the same year.    Mafia activities have so far spread mainly to Poland and  Germany. Berlin is indicated as a new center for the expanding  East European mafia. Language differences are mentioned as one  of the reasons why the mafia has still not gained a foothold in  Sweden. But the authorities fear a wave of serious crime with  offenses like drug smuggling, kidnapping, and money laundering,  which have been taking place on a smaller scale.</p>

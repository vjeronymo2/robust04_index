			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: I'll have the elk - Giles MacDonogh samples a slice of food and life in Norway AT THE mention of the 'social-democratic chicken' I was all ears and I pressed Eivind Hellstrom to describe the beast to me. I imagined a chicken designed by committee; some sort of ostrich, but no, it was a deep-frozen, 800 gram standardised fowl. And it was the only chicken available in Norway. The 'social democratic chicken' is not the only hardship suffered by Norwegian chefs. The country which outrages the sensibilities of millions by its stubborn insistance on eating whales and seals, will not tolerate the importation of foie gras. Naturally there is no Bresse poultry, Angus beef, pre-sale lamb, Challans or Barbarie ducks; and unpasteurised cheese is deeply frowned on. On the other hand there are consolations of sorts. Game is plentiful: wild duck, grouse, pheasant, elk and reindeer. There is plenty of fish and sea food. Eivind Hellstrom is Scandanavia's top chef. His Bagatelle restaurant was awarded its second Michelin star earlier this year. It might come as a surprise that he should work in Oslo, which is a far less exciting city than Stockholm or (by all reports) Copenhagen; but Hellstrom is not alone: there are a number of talented chefs juggling for second place in the Norwegian capital at restaurants such as De Fem Stuer at the Holmenkollen Park Hotel, Annen Etage at the Continental, Feinschmecker, D'Artagnan and Babette. When I was in Oslo last month there was gloom among the chefs about the result of the general election, which had increased the vote of the anti-EC farmers' party. The vast majority of people in Oslo are in favour of the Common Market, and this includes the cooks, who see it as the only means of bringing down the puritanical state monopoly which controls food and drink. But I should not give the impression that one eats badly in Oslo, certainly not at the Bagatelle. I was particularly impressed by a dish of scallops on a cake of tagliatelle which was got up with tomato and basil to look like a pizza; or the smoked and baked halibut in a frothy caviar sauce; the lobster tart on a buttery cognac and coral sauce; or the wild duck with its appley sauce. Hellstrom trained with some of the best chefs in France and La Bagatelle is an unabashed 'French embassy'. Up above the city, at the picturesque Holmenkollen Park Hotel, is the De Fem Stuer restaurant. The chef is Bent Stiansen, the first Norwegian to win the Bocuse d'Or trophy in France. His cooking pays more lip-service to Norwegian models than that of his friend Hellstrom. I ate a variation of his winning menu: creamy crabmeat with bleak roe; turbot stuffed with crayfish and fennel; reindeer with a sauce of lingonberries (mountain cranberries); and mixed wild berries with a cardomon ice. De Fem Stuer is a popular business dining room and the prices reflect this. De Fem Stuer's is still quite high-flown stuff compared to the daily diet of ordinary Norwegians. With just half an hour for lunch most people take a couple of open sandwiches to work. Excellent lamb, smoked reindeer and elk sausage form a part of the farmer's diet, just as the fisherman gorges himself with herrings. Something of this will be found at the restaurant Maud in the centre of Oslo, between the town hall and the trendy, Akers Brygge dockside development. One highly recommended place, if you just want to see how Oslo ticks, is the Theatercafeen, which was built at the time when Norway became a nation state; and retains its resplendent art nouveau interior. There is hot food but most people eat the open sandwiches. Bergen, on Norway's west coast, is a fiercely independent city. Hans Inge Bruaroy points out that it is easier to buy large goods in Newcastle or Aberdeen than Oslo, given the problems of negotiating the fjords to Bergen. Bruaroy is one of Bergen's most well-rounded personalities. He runs the Hotel Neptun with its collections of modern art and the best table in the city. The local theatre director eats there after the evening performance and downstairs his cast drinks into the early hours. The food is good too, if a tiny bit marred by the the chef's fondness for sweet sauces. It was nice to eat baby cod there: the fish which made the city's fortune, with a jazzy, orange and coriander sauce; and some excellent local lamb with thyme on a (sugary) aubergine puree. At the Fiskekrogen on the quay you eat a less ambitious sort of meal: some of the city's homely specialities such as a creamy fish soup and cod boiled with potatoes. The Fiskekrogen draws much of its trade from visitors to the famous quayside market and the old merchant houses of Brygge. In season venison, elk and reindeer are also on the menu; but there is no sign of that Norwegian mutant: the social democratic chicken. Information: Bagatelle, Bygdoy Alle 3, Oslo.

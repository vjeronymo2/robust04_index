			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate worries trigger heavy selling - Market Report The spectre of higher interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic returned to haunt the UK equity market, almost wiping out the hard won gains in London that followed the Budget. Dealers, shocked at the level of selling pressure affecting the market yesterday, said they expected further weakness if Wall Street showed any more signs of distress. Some feared another fall below 3,000 on the FT-SE 100, although strategists said such a decline would meet strong resistance, pointing out that recent moves below 3,000 had prompted exceptionally heavy support around 2,980. The FT-SE 100 retreated 41.8 or 1.3 per cent to 3,039.6. Selling spilled over into the second liners, depressing the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 20.2 to 3,477.1. Much of yesterday's business was linked to another flurry of heavy programme trades, which tended to exaggerate price changes in many areas. Dealers also pointed to big shifts as fund manager realigned their sector portfolios in the wake of the Budget. Increased fears that UK interest rates may soon increase to choke off inflationary pressures prompted by excessive economic growth caused the early damage in London, and these worries were gradually heightened as the session wore on with the latest economic news from the US. The UK chancellor is to hold his regular monthly meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England next Wednesday. In the US, the National Association of Purchasing Management survey came in at 61.2 per cent, compared to most forecasts which were below 60 per cent. US personal incomes also increased sharply. These figures, following the higher than expected upward revision of US gross domestic product for the third quarter and a higher than expected Chicago Purchasing Management index, saw Wall Street lose more than 15 points shortly after it opened. The US market then rallied to 7 down before falling away again and posting a 25-point loss two hours after London closed. All eyes will be sharply focused today on the US employment report. If the non-farm payroll in the US increases by much more than an expected figure of around 200,000, dealers fear Wall Street could take another dive. The next meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee takes place on December 20, and more evidence of strong growth in the US economy is thought likely to push the Fed into another rise in rates. The Footsie opened around two points easier but quickly fell away in the wake of sustained pressure from the derivatives markets. When a series of programme trades, some on the sell side and some evenly balanced, hit the market prices tumbled as marketmakers took evasive action. The biggest of at least three programmes was said to have been operated by Smith New Court. There was no let-up in the selling and shares fell to their lowest levels in mid-afternoon before stabilising in the last hour. Turnover reached 721.3m shares, the highest for almost two weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 54 per cent of the total. Customer business on Wednesday was worth Pounds 1.38bn. Only nine of the FT-SE 100 constituents escaped the market sell-off. Hanson pleased the market with excellent preliminary figures, as did BPB with interims well above expectations. Regional electricity stocks outpaced other utilities after Seeboard fulfilled the market's best expectations in announcing a 21 per cent increase in the interim dividend. On the downside, Royal Bank of Scotland came out with sparkling numbers, including a 25 per cent increase in the dividend, but the shares succumbed to profit-taking. MEPC disappointed with a rise of only 13 per cent in its net asset value.</p>

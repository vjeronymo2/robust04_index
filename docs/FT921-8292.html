			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Observer: Mugged Japan's non-tariff barriers are reaching parts which even the most experienced foreign businessman is ignorant of. Recently a German multinational celebrating in Tokyo had the bright idea of presenting its 500 guests with traditional German beer mugs, complete with pewter lid and company emblem - delicately wrapped, Japanese-style. But, come the day of the party, no beer mugs in sight. Japanese customs had refused entry, on the grounds that they wanted to know more about the metal used in the lids and whether it was harmful. Arguments that imports of such mugs were hardly an innovation cut no ice. It took weeks for sense to prevail; by then the guests were long gone and the company was faced with a fat postage bill to send the mug chasers. No doubt worried about disruption to future festivities, the angry Germans prefer to remain anonymous. Maybe they will be sticking to sake in future.</p>

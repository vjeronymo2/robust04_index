			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTS VETO SENDS A WRONG MESSAGE;  </P> <P> WHY SAIL AGAINST SO MANY AMERICANS?  </P> <P> With his veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, President Bush has revived a  divisive issue of social justice and forfeited, on this issue at least, an  important share of his Administration's moral credibility.  </P> <P> If the 101st Congress now becomes the first in the history of this Republic to  sustain the President's veto of a civil rights bill, the minority of senators  and representatives responsible will share the blame for a needless and hurtful  affront to women and members of racial, ethnic and religious minorities.  </P> <P> In his veto message, Bush repeated his charge that the bill "employs a maze of  highly legalistic language to introduce the destructive force of quotas into  our national employment system." To strain his way to that conclusion, the  President has been forced to assert that the civil rights act does not mean  what it says when it states that:  </P> <P> "Nothing in the amendments made by this act shall be construed to require to  encourage an employer to adopt hiring or promotional quotas on the basis of  race, color, religion, sex or national origin."  </P> <P> If that plain language constitutes a legalistic maze, fair-minded people may  puzzle over how to describe the objections raised by Bush and his chief legal  advisers.  </P> <P> They do not, after all, contend that the Civil Rights Act of 1990 requires  quotas. Rather, they insist that it will lead employers to surreptitiously  adopt them rather than bear the burden of legally defending discriminatory  hiring and promotional practices on the basis of "business necessity."  </P> <P> Monday, in a memo to Bush, Atty. General Dick Thornburgh attacked what he  called the bill's "unreasonably restrictive definition of business necessity,"  because it would "force employers to defend any employment practice 'involving  selection' by showing 'a significant relationship to successful performance of  the job.' "  </P> <P> In place of that standard, Thornburgh and Bush have urged Congress to adopt a  bill that would allow employers to justify discrimination in employment or  promotion on the basis of "legitimate business objectives."  </P> <P> The difference implicit in these two tests is clear: Under the well-tested  business necessity standard proposed by Congress, the owner of a factory would  be free to impose a weight-lifting test on applicants for positions as  boiler-makers, even though a disproportionate number of women would be  excluded. However, the owner of a bakery hiring people to make cream-puffs  would not be free to impose such a test.  </P> <P> But under the President's novel "business objectives" standard, the owners of  both concerns could refuse to hire or promote women or minorities simply  because they believe their presence would disrupt the workplace or upset their  customers.  </P> <P> Reasonable people will have little trouble in discerning which of these legal  tests will result in discrimination. They will have greater difficulty in  deciding why a President would choose to set his government's face so firmly  against the legitimate rights and aspirations of so large a number of  Americans.  </P></p>

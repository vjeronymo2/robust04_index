			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Luxembourg PM leads in race to succeed Delors The contest to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission has narrowed to three candidates led by Mr Jacques Santer, the long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg. Mr Santer, who has solid German support, has emerged as a potential compromise after informal contacts between the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the UK at the weekend summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Naples. Senior European diplomats said it was possible that an agreement among the Twelve could be reached in the next few days, to be ratified at the special summit in Brussels on Friday called by the German presidency of the EU. However, Mr Santer's success is by no means assured. He still faces challenges from Mr Poul Schluter, an experienced former Christian Democrat prime minister from Denmark, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Socialist prime minister of Italy who steered his country through its recent political upheaval. France also has misgivings about the EU caving in prematurely to the British veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister promoted by Paris and Bonn. France is resentful that Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has reaped a domestic political victory over his lone opposition to Mr Dehaene at last month's European summit in Corfu. But Mr Kohl appears determined to strike a deal in time for the Commission president-designate to appear on schedule before the new European Parliament at its inaugural session on July 19 in Strasbourg. 'The chancellor does not want a crisis with the parliament,' said one senior EU diplomat. Further delay would disrupt the German presidency of the EU. Mr Santer is a dark horse who has emerged after better-known candidates such as Mr Dehaene, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, and Mr Felipe Gonzalez of Spain have either been blocked or taken themselves out of the running. His appeal lies in his Christian Democrat party background and his small-state credentials, both important factors after the 10-year reign of Mr Delors, a French socialist. He is also a Francophone, a vital concern to Paris. Mr Santer's strongest card seems to be that he is unlikely to offend anyone, although the Danes are unhappy that the Commission presidency may fall to Luxembourg for the second time in 14 years. Mr Gaston Thorn, a former Luxembourg prime minister, preceded Mr Delors between 1981 and 1985. A senior Commission official warned yesterday that a deadlock between Mr Santer and Mr Schluter may force France and Germany to reconsider Mr Lubbers or Viscount Etienne Davignon, the former EU industry commissioner. Both Mr Lubbers and Mr Davignon are viewed as representing a strong Commission. Germany's agenda, Page 18</p>

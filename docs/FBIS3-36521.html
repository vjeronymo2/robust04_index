Speaking on an evening program of Crimean television,  Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev said: "We have repeatedly  emphasized that the Crimean Tatars do not recognize the  institution of the presidency as set forth in the Crimean Law on  the President of the Republic of Crimea." All the more so,  Dzhemilev noted, because while adopting the law the Crimean  parliament "completely ignored the rights of the Crimean Tatar  people -- it dismissed without consideration the draft law On  the President of the Crimean Republic." The Crimean Tatars  nonetheless decided to take part in the presidential elections  in order "to preserve peace and tranquillity in Crimea."    Mustafa Dzhemilev recalled that the Crimean Tatars voted  against Yuriy Meshkov and said that "any recognition of Meshkov  as president is out of the question." The Crimean Tatar leader  said further that everyone can see how often Yuriy Meshkov has  changed his views: "What filthy epithets he used when speaking  about Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, but now he calls him  an outstanding politician of our time." The nonrecognition does  not mean, however, Dzhemilev pointed out, that we will  completely ignore the president. If Meshkov approaches our  problems sensibly, we will support him, but, "unfortunately, his  policy is aimed at confrontation."    The Crimean Tatar leader said that the Assembly will convene  on 19 February: "Some events are going to happen in the  meantime, and we will definitely determine our stance on the  Crimean presidency and personally on Meshkov." Mustafa  Dzhemilev called Yuriy Meshkov's demands that the Assembly be  registered as groundless and absurd. "This will never happen.  We are in for yet another spiral of confrontation," Dzhemilev  concluded.</p>

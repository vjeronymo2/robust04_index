			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET'S EAT OUT: FAMILY STYLE DINING AT MON JAPANESE  </P> <P> You need to slide, rather than push or pull, the front door open at Mon  Japanese in Tarzana. Then part the noren (hanging fabric panels) to enter into  this cozy little neighborhood restaurant.  </P> <P> Run by a Japanese family, the restaurant also attracts a family clientele.  Grass-cloth walls are lined by booths with paper lanterns hanging above the  tables. The L-shaped dining area wraps around the kitchen, leaving only enough  room for three tables in the center.  </P> <P> The photo on our table advertising their special dinners-for-two didn't look  very appetizing, but we ordered the shogun boat for the sake of research. Our  meal arrived on a 2 1/2-foot-long wooden vessel, which some might consider a  bit hokey, but sure caught the eye of the children who had just been seated in  the next booth. It wasn't long before a sister ship floated onto their table.  </P> <P> Attractively arranged on our boat's deck were lobster, tempura, beef and  chicken teriyaki and two cut oranges. Only the lobster was disappointing.  Although the stuffed shell contained nice big chunks of lobster meat, they were  combined with mushrooms and it was difficult to figure out what else, in a much  too heavy cream sauce.  </P> <P> By contrast, the tempura batter on the shrimp and vegetables was light and  lacy; although fried in oil, they weren't the least bit greasy. The teriyaki  sauce was also outstanding -- not too salty and an excellent complement to both  the very tender strips of New York steak and boneless chicken.  </P> <P> The dinner was certainly sumptuous, especially considering it also included  miso soup, rice, sunomono and green tea ice cream. The miso soup at Mon  Japanese has plenty of flavor with shreds of seaweed and a little sliced green  onion. Their sunomono consists of thinly sliced cucumber and shredded carrot  marinated in a slightly sweet vinegar dressing.  </P> <P> The samurai boat dinner includes beef teriyaki, sashimi, tempura, chicken  teriyaki, fruit and green tea ice cream. The Mon boat consists of California  roll, fried oyster, egg roll, chicken teriyaki, fruit and green tea ice cream.  </P> <P> A la carte dinners are less extravagant, but still include soup and rice. The  friend who introduced me to this restaurant ordered the salmon, requesting that  it be grilled longer than the rare normally served. It came beautifully  prepared and accompanied by a simple salad.  </P> <P> Combination dinners combine two items and are accompanied by soup, sunomono and  rice. The same trio comes with the lobster specials and Mon special dinners,  which feature three items. We were pleased with the salmon teriyaki, tempura  and sushi combination artfully presented on a wood framed tray.  </P> <P> The half-dozen sushi, including California roll, shrimp (ebi) and yellow tail  (hamachi) tasted very fresh. The salmon was still nice and moist and the  tempura equally as well-prepared as it had been for the shogun boat.  </P> <P> A pot of green tea brewed with crispy rice is the complementary meal  accompaniment. They also offer sake, Japanese bottled and draft beers, plum  wine, domestic beer and wine, soft drinks and ice tea.  </P> <P> Green tea ice cream is offered a la carte, as well as with the boat dinners.  It's refreshing, although nothing to rave about. Other desserts include fruit  and ice cream tempura.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mon Japanese, 19463 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 342-0307.

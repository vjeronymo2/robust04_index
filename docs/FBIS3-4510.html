			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here today that the Chinese side  sincerely hopes that the civil servants working in various  departments of the Hong Kong Government will rest assured and  will continue to render service for the Government of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and for the local  people after 1997.    The spokesman made the remarks at a press confernece when  asked to comment on a statement of the British side which  proposes to discuss with the Chinese side a list of principal  Hong Kong officials transcending 1997.    He said that there are clear stipulations in the  Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR,  namely, candidates for the principal officials of the Government  of the Hong Kong SAR shall be submitted to the central  government for appointment upon normination by the SAR chief  executive.    Therefore it is clear that the right to nominate and appoint  the principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR Government rests  with the SAR chief executive and the central government,  respectively, rather than a case in which the candidates for the  principal officials will be nominated by the British side and  then submitted for consultation with the Chinese side, he said.    He reaffirmed that the Chinese side will act in strict  accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.    "The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the civil cervants  working in the various departments of the Hong Kong Government  will rest assured and perform their duties, and will continue to  render service for the Hong Kong SAR Government and for the Hong  Kong people after 1997," the spokesman said.</p>

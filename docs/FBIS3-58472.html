			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Couvrat: "Government Accountancy: </F> Reduced Budget, But Exploding Debt"]    [Text] Parliament has adopted the five-year law aimed at  bringing public finances under control. It seemingly reduces  the public deficit, but that is not preventing the national debt  from growing.    The Parliament has just definitively adopted the five-year  law aimed at bringing state finances under control. On the face  of it, this commitment to austerity is squeezing the government  into an unbearably tight corset: Each year it will have to  reduce the budget deficit drastically with a view to bringing it  down to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1997. However, there is good  reason to wonder about the sincerity of the exercise, as the  national debt is habitually increased by the addition of  expenses that do not appear in the budget. In two years, from  the end of 1992 to the end of 1994, the budget deficit will be  reduced to 617 billion French francs [Fr]. However, the  national debt has increased by Fr809, an extra one-third.    The aim of the five-year law is to satisfy the convergence  criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty. The candidates for  the single currency, in 1997 at the earliest, must not record a  national debt in excess of 3 percent of GDP. For France, whose  budget deficit reached 4.5 percent of GDP in 1993, not counting  the social security deficits and those of the local authorities,  this is no easy undertaking.    It boils down to reducing the national deficit by 0.5  percent  of GDP each year for four years, starting in 1994. However, the  state has irreducible expenses, starting with those incurred as  a result of the national debt, on which heavy interest has to be  paid each year. Not to mention the salaries of civil servants,  the reduction of whose numbers would appear to be a more urgent  priority than ever, but whose pay rises correspond to previously  agreed contractual commitments. In short, any effort to cut  spending can only be made in other areas: civil and military  equipment and actions, the budget for which would have to be  reduced by approximately 2 percent per annum in real terms.  Would it be feasible to envision reducing employment subsidies  to the same extent?    However, the government has subjected itself to additional  constraints which will increase its future expenditure even  further. The budgeting of family allowances will cost Fr40  billion in 1997, and transfers to UNEDIC [National Union for  Industrial and Commercial Employment] will reach a level of Fr10  billion per year. That makes a total of Fr50 billion, or 0.8  percent of GDP by 1997. Will the return to growth suffice to  absorb this increase? Nicolas Sarkozy [budget minister] seemed  slightly optimistic, affirming the other evening to the National  Assembly: "The objective of this government is to use any room  for maneuver that a more rapid return to sustained growth may  entail, and a better mastery of public expenditure, to reduce  the fiscal and social contributions."    To be sure, the government has more than one trick up its  sleeve. Last year, it transferred Fr45 billion to companies,  under the pretext of compensating for the one-month VAT  [value-added tax] gap, and by the same token recognized a  residual debt of between Fr50 and Fr55 billion. That makes  roughly Fr100 billion in all financed through borrowing, which  did not figure under budgetary expenditure. No more so than the  return-to-school allowance (Fr5.9 billion), an expense  attributed directly to the national debt, which in turn already  assumed the accumulated social security debt, to the extent of  Fr110 billion, on 1 January 1994.    It will be tempting to review such tricks of sleight of hand  in the future, in order to meet the requirements of the  five-year law without putting the brakes on real state  expenditure. Abolishing, say, state subsidies to the social  security system, while making it support the corresponding cash  advances -- along the lines of the operation concerning the  back-to-school allowance. Unless the finicky observers in the  government Audit Office succeed in making themselves heard.</p>

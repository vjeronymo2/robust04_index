			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Observer: New broom Malcolm Stephens's main regret on resigning last year as chief executive of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department was that it stymied his ambition to run the world's best export credit business. But he now means to do the next-best thing - from September he will head the Berne Union, the club for the world's top credit insurers. True, given the Berne Union's traditional secrecy, Stephens might still end up as the last thing he intended: a museum curator. Even so, the combative record of the former diplomat and banker argues strongly for giving him the benefit of the doubt. After all, it took singular courage to resign from ECGD last November, so signalling to government how much British industry resented its progressive withdrawal of cash support for export efforts. Only six months before, the government had privatised half of the ECGD by selling its short-term credit operations to the Dutch. His moving to the Berne Union comes at a time when the credit insurance industry is set for radical reform. Both the European Commission and the OECD are working on plans to harmonise export finance practices inter- nationally: 'All of the Berne Union members are going through change, so it seems inconceivable that the Berne Union itself can avoid changing,' he declares, new-broomishly.</p>

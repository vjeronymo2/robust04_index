			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Rehabilitation of U.S. Ties Is An Urgent </F> Issue"]    [Text] Repairing ties with the United States is an urgent  task for the newly formed Hata cabinet. The Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks lie at the center of the overall readjustment of  the post-Cold War relationship between the two countries;  however, the talks remain bogged down with no set schedule for  their resumption.    Washington predicates such resumption on Japan's pledge to  establish a long-term plan to cut its trade surplus, carry out  an income tax cut, and augment its public works program.    As a minority regime, the Hata cabinet is likely to face  difficulties in complying with U.S. demands to map out tangible  measures for implementing Japan's "economic reform outline" by  the end of June. Thus, it will be very difficult to fully  rehabilitate U.S. ties by the time the G-7 summit meeting is  held in Naples in July.    We urge Prime Minister Hata to strive to prevent Japan-U.S.  ties from deteriorating, despite these difficulties. As he  stood at the forefront of economic talks as foreign minister, he  knows the core issues, and is acquainted with his U.S.  counterparts.    However, among those Americans, Hata has a negative image as  a politician having close relations with the Japanese  bureaucracy which they dislike--in contrast to former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who was welcomed with a measure of  personal trust by President Bill Clinton. Thus, the United  States is likely to make even more drastic demands on Hata.    Hata needs to emphasize to the nation that we stand at a  dangerous crossroads in our relationship with Washington. Also,  he should demonstrate good faith to the United States in his  quest for better ties.    Some executives in the Japanese private sector maintain good  communication channels with American business and political  leaders. Instead of allowing himself to remain the puppet of  bureaucrats, Hata should utilize his own counselors to build a  communications network with the Clinton administration. And he  should avoid exclusively depending on the Foreign Ministry for  intelligence gathering and negotiating strategy.    At the same time, Hata is urged not to be unduly hasty about  attaining success. During the G-7 summit in Tokyo last year,  the then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yielded too much to  Clinton over the framework talks, giving the latter inflated  hopes for numerical targets and sowing the seeds of calamity in  the subsequent negotiations. Inasmuch as Hata is regarded by  many as a short-term caretaker premier, he should be prepared to  leave the knotty problems to his successor.    The DPRK (North Korea) nuclear controversy remains a time  bomb in the Japan-U.S. security relationship. Whereas Japan,  the United States, and the ROK are keeping pace, they have  potential problems involving sanctions and otherwise dealing  with this crisis.    On this question, Hata is called upon to seek a national  consensus, within the Constitution and on the basis of the  security treaty with the United States. The situation is fluid,  requiring possible emergency measures.    In the meantime, the prime minister should urge Washington  to  continue patient diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang toward a  peaceful settlement and avoid sanctions, keeping in mind that  China has the strongest card to play in allaying the dispute.    On the diplomatic front, in addition to home affairs, Hata's  job dovetails with reform in this country. At the heart of this  endeavor lies deregulation. There is a dire need for Japan to  increase imports, simplify national administration and finances,  and inspire entrepreneurship among medium and small business  through deregulation.    Frankly, however, a strong and stable political process to  make such reform possible is still not likely emerge in the  immediate future. More likely, Hata will be forced to adopt a  realistic course to respond to immediate challenges as they  arise. As such, Washington is called upon to treat the Hata  administration with understanding and flexibility.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Observer: Tarzan of the board Is too much fuss being made of Michael Heseltine's decision to call himself president of the Board of Trade? After all it is not a real board. He can't appoint any vice-presidents, the Archbishop of Canterbury no longer attends, and - unlike Lord Halifax who colonised Nova Scotia - Heseltine cannot expect to have cities named after him. True, he can restore his own office to its former title of the President's Room. But the Foreign Office and the Treasury long ago usurped most of the old board of trade's real powers. Since it digested the Ministries of Production, Supply and Materials after the Second World War, it has lost far more influence than it has gained. There was even a time when the BoT president was also responsible for social security, transport, education, and employment. So much work in the political jungle faces Heseltine if he wants to re-establish his new domain as a force in the land. History is not on his side. The average tenure of presidents of the board of trade over the last two centuries is a shade over two years. Although a stint in the job did no harm to the careers of Gladstone, Lloyd George, Churchill, Wilson, and Heath, they are exceptions. Of Heseltine's dozen predecessors, just three remain MPs - John Biffen, Paul Channon and Peter Lilley - and only Lilley hangs on to his cabinet seat. One has to go back more than a century to find presidents of the board of trade who really left their mark. Perhaps the most notable of them was William Huskisson, who in the 1820s did a lot to win over protectionist Tory merchants to the free trade cause. He was also a great supporter of the development of railways. Even so, Heseltine would be ill advised to follow too closely in the Huskisson's footsteps. His most famous achievement was also a fatal one. He strayed into the path of Stephenson's Rocket on its inaugural run between Manchester and Liverpool.</p>

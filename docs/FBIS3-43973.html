			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chadians have certainly not yet come to the end of  their misfortunes. In addition to the nonpayment of their  salary arrears and the devaluation of the CFA franc, the specter  of war has also come to trouble (?their fragile peace). At 0420  this morning, the inhabitants of Abeche woke up to the sounds of  automatic weapons fire and exploding shells. Elements of the  Chadian National Front [FNT] had attacked the Chadian National  Army [FAT] troops in Abeche. Our correspondent (Solomon  Ngartha) has the details:    [Begin Ngartha recording] At 0450 today, elements of the FNT  present in Abeche, who were awaiting their integration into the  FAT--in accordance with previously signed agreements--attacked  the government troops stationed there, (?flouting) those  agreements.    The assailants launched their attack on the military  garrison  during the first hours of the morning. First they attacked a  training center storeroom and obtained 405 light weapons,  including bazookas, [word indistinct], and Kalishnikov assault  rifles. Once in possession of these weapons, they then attacked  other weapons depots at the camp, including an (?operations)  storeroom where they looted (Bavar 82) 60-mm mortars, in  addition to a large quantity of personnel weapons.    We visited a military camp this morning in the company of  National Defense Minister (Mamadou M'biyi); Youssouf Togoimi,  the prefect of the area; and top military officers, including  (Tetengar), the deputy commander; Lieutenant Colonel (Gbese  Moussa); and Lieutenant Colonel Moussa Haroun. We observed  traces of blood, forced doors, and SAM-7's which had been  destroyed. During our visit to the camp, we were constantly  coming across dead bodies lying on the ground. These were the  bodies of FNT rebels who had been killed by government forces.  Within the camp alone, nine corpses were lying on the ground.  In the [words indistinct] running along the Abeche market, two  other corpses were observed, covered with dust. At the entrance  to the residence of the prefect, two other corpses were seen on  the ground. Not far from the sign indicating the road to [name  indistinct], another rebel (?who was shot in the back was seen).    For the moment, relative calm reigns in the town of Abeche,  punctuated by the sounds of isolated firing. Elements of the  government forces are carrying out mopping up operations. The  attackers have fled toward [name indistinct]. They are being  pursued by government forces. The official provisional results  of the attack say 29 rebels were killed and 32 were captured.  On the government side, two people have been killed and nine  injured. Seven of these people were seriously wounded and were  evacuated this afternoon to Ndjamena. A curfew has been imposed  on the town of Abeche by the prefect. It runs from 1900 to  0600. [end recording]</p>

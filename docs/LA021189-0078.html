			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON PREVIN'S EDITING OF ERICKSON'S 'CORONA'  </P> <P> I was especially upset with Previn's motioning for the orchestra to rise before  the last sounds had finished reverberating and by his hurried exit, as if to  say: "We've fulfilled our obligations. Now let's get on with the rest of the  concert."  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN HERTZOG  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

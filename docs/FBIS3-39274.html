			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Industry Ministry's Document: </F> Sensitive Areas"]    [Text] When he met with the press last Wednesday [12  January], Gerard Longuet took the opportunity to set forth a  first assessment of the results obtained for France in the  course of the Uruguay Round negotiations. This assessment is  contained in a booklet of 35 pages. We are mentioning here the  portions pertaining to certain sensitive parts in our industrial  sector.     -  The European Union has refused to further open up  its market for a number of nonferrous metals and is demanding  the effective elimination of nontariff obstacles by our main  competitors. In order to maintain the 115,000 jobs in their  aluminum sector (of which 15,000 are in France), the European  nations won agreement on the maintenance of tariff barriers in a  market that is suffering seriously from world overproduction.    -  It  was not possible to achieve a multilateral agreement on steel  because of the continuing disputes between the United States and  the exporter countries (European Union, Japan, Korea), and  because of the fact that a decision on the restructuring of the  European iron and steel industry is still awaited. The  discussions be continue. In the absence of an agreement, the  sector would be integrated in the GATT system in 18 months.    -  The  customs duties on the electronic products of the major public  enterprises (100,000 jobs in Europe, 14,000 in France) have not  been lowered. This is a very sensitive sector because of the  manpower costs, the research and development efforts, and the  risks involved in the shifting of production facilities to  Central and East European countries.    -  Despite the mutual opening  up agreed upon by the Americans and the Japanese in the  semiconductor sector, the European nations will continue to  monitor the development of this technology closely. This is  something a tariff schedule cannot do, and this leaves room for  the fear that the established regulations might be  circumvented.    -  The duties on telecommunications and  data-processing equipment were the subject of closed  negotiations in which the Europeans, Americans, and Japanese  participated. This industry in France, where its capacity to  compete depends heavily on manpower costs, will have to adapt  gradually to a new situation, particularly with regard to  telephone sets, on which the duty has been reduced to zero.</p>

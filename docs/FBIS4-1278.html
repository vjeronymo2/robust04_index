			<p>BFN     [Text] The deadline set by the government for the surrender  of firearms expired yesterday. No statement has so far been  issued. Earlier, the government warned all groups in possession  of firearms, whether lawfully or unlawfully, that the Army and  the security committees will be forced to search for firearms if  they are not surrendered. A government announcement called on  armed groups to stop shooting and on the Army to maintain  discipline and to use weapons for self defense.    Speaking to reporters, Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko  disclosed that the seizure of arms would take place in all parts  of the country, that is the municipalities, divisions, and  regions. Meanwhile, our reporter in Karuzi region has reported  that two soldiers were shot and injured by unknown assailants.</p>

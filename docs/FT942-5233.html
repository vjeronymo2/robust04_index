			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: The ins and outs of al fresco dining in London  -Eating Out During the last week of May you could not get a table outside in any London restaurant. The weather was so cold that the few permanent outdoor tables were not laid out. During the first week of June you could not get a table outside in any London restaurant but for a very different reason. Suddenly the sun shone, the temperature rocketed to 20 degrees C and everybody wanted to eat outside. These two consecutive weeks neatly encapsulate the dilemma facing any British restaurateur who wants to offer open-air dining, and any customer who wants to take advantage of those restaurants with relatively quiet pavements and secluded gardens. The British public, may be becoming more European in its eating habits but the British weather remains firmly British  -unpredictable even in the short term. This unpredictability also makes it difficult for the restaurateur to know what to offer. When May and June are fine nothing can better a truly British meal of fresh asparagus, cold poached salmon and the first of the summer's strawberries with Devon clotted cream. The dilemma is how many to cater for. If the sun shines then everyone wants this combination. If it does not, then nobody orders it and a lot of unwanted food goes to waste. When, as I did as a restaurateur, you prepare 30 meals such as this for a restaurant that can seat 100, you are sure to please the first 30 customers who will have ordered this by 13.15 - but you will disappoint many of the other 70. When the sun does shine there is a mad panic among cafe owners, restaurateurs and publicans to move every available chair and table with four stable legs out of doors and on to a relatively level piece of pavement. It is, while it lasts, great fun but sadly illegal. When restaurants apply for a liquor licence the magistrates grant them on the basis of a defined licenced area within which drinks must be served. This naturally, takes account of the normal British climate not those hot days and balmy nights that sadly do not prevail for too long. What follows is a list of just some of the London restaurants, across a broad range of cuisines, which have tables outside or open to the air.

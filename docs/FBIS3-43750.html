			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 13 SAPA -- The Boer Republican Army  (BRA) has warned foreign peace observers to leave the country or  face death, and has also threatened to paralyse South Africa's  economic infrastructure through "unheard-of economic sabotage".  The warnings were contained in a message sent to SAPA on  Thursday.    The BRA also declared war on the "communist anti-christian"  Transitional Executive Council.    The BRA previously claimed responsiblity for several bomb  blasts, including last month's sabotage of a powerline tower  near Boksburg prison. Two people died and at least 14 were  injured when a minibus taxi hit dangling powerlines soon after  the blast which, Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] said, was  caused by explosives.    Little is known about the BRA. It was founded in 1991 and  sends facsimile advisories. Its leadership is unknown and  unreachable.    In its facsimile message on Thursday, it said its previous  acts of sabotage had not been taken seriously. "Now intensive  action will be taken."    It warned foreign peace observers they would not be ignored  in its campaign, but its main target would be the "heartbeat of  the satanic money powers". The BRA said it would rather destroy  everything the Boerevolk [Boer people] had worked for than hand  it to alien money powers.</p>

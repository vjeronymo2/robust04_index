			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Berlusconi approves Fininvest watchdog Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister, yesterday approved measures at his first cabinet meeting to establish a three-man watchdog committee to monitor the conflict of interest between his Fininvest media empire and his role as head of government. Twelve days ago, on being asked to form a government, he announced the committee and named its three components. His move yesterday, immediately after his 25-person cabinet was sworn in, underlined his concern to allay fears over the potential conflict of interest between Fininvest, Italy's second largest private group, and his position as prime minister. The men chosen have been criticised by the opposition for being too close to Mr Berlusconi and Fininvest's interests. Mr Agostino Gambino, a commercial law professor, has worked for Fininvest on several cases including the battle for publishers Mondadori. A second member, Mr Antonio La Pergola, a former head of the constitutional court, has lobbied in Brussels on behalf of commercial television in matters of advertising slots. The committee has been given until the end of September to draw up recommendations on changing existing anti-trust laws. They could also look further into the idea of creating a blind trust for Mr Berlusconi's proprietary interests. So far Mr Berlusconi has only resigned from Fininvest. The conflict of interest issue was also brought up on several occasions by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro during Mr Berlusconi's tortuous efforts to form a government. This led to a block on Mr Cesare Previti, Mr Berlusconi's personal and Fininvest lawyer, going to the justice ministry. It was deemed unacceptable for the justice portfolio to be held by Mr Previti when magistrates in several Italian cities were investigating the activities of Fininvest. This block, coupled with an open warning to Mr Berlusconi on the conduct of his government, soured yesterday's swearing-in ceremony. The warning, contained in a letter, said the new government must support Italy's traditional foreign policy of support for Europe, avoid tampering with the unity of Italy and preserve social peace. This was seen as an implicit reminder that members of the new right-wing government are Euro-sceptics and favour federalism and economic deregulation that could lead to social strife. Most press comments yesterday said Mr Berlusconi had been obliged to make big concessions to his allies, the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The League forced him to concede the interior ministry and five other portfolios. Mr Lamberto Dini, the new treasury minister and number two at the Bank of Italy, indicated he would resign shortly from his position at the central bank. Yesterday's half percentage point cut to 7 per cent in the discount rate was welcome news for him and could even remove the need for a mini-budget before the summer. See Editorial Comment</p>

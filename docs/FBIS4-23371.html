			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis June 5 SAPA -- Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred  Nzo on Saturday [4 June] outlined South Africa's foreign policy,  saying it would be based on "a solid domestic policy of national  reconciliation". Addressing the Organisation of African Unity in  Tunis, Mr Nzo said SA [South African] foreign policy would,  furthermore, be founded on a commitment to: human rights; the  "promotion of freedom and democracy thoughout the world";  justice and international law; international peace and  internationally agreed mechanisms for conflict resolution;  promote the interests of Africa in global affairs; "expanded  co-operation in an interdependent world".    A summary of his speech sent to SAPA also noted the  minister's condemnation of the carnage in Rwanda and that the SA  Government would be ready to supply "all forms of humanitarian  assistance wherever possible".    On the Middle East, the SA foreign minister said he "viewed  with concern the renewed Israeli aggression against Lebanon".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "Put the past to </F> rest"; article published in English]    [Text] The posturings of the ANC Government, and statements  by the new Minister of Justice, Mr Dullah Omar are foolish and  will infect the spirit of goodwill and reconciliation which have  up until now been so evident.    This posturing takes the form both of a proposed Truth and  Reconciliation Commission, and the freezing of amnesty granted  to certain categories of criminals by former President F.W. de  Klerk.  <H5>  NO SYMPATHY </H5>   This newspaper has little sympathy for those who committed  heinous crimes with political motive. Murder is murder, and it  does not take on a more acceptable hue because it is political.    However if amnesty is to be provided this must be done on an  even-handed basis. To do otherwise creates the wholly justified  perception that the Government is prepared only to protect those  murderers and criminals with which it was once associated, and  with which it continues to be associated.    The amnesties were stopped, reportedly, because those  indemnified need to confess all their sins first. However, let  it be borne in mind that many indemnified ANC leaders have not  yet confessed their sins, and are unlikely to ever do so.  <H5>  SELF RIGHTEOUS </H5>   The ANC labours under the mistaken impression that its  murderers are morally superior to those associated with the  former Government.    It is this kind of bizarre thinking which prompts the ANC,  smugly convinced of its self-righteousness, to proclaim the need  for a "Truth and Reconciliation Commission."  <H5>  DANGEROUS </H5>   This kind of delusion is dangerous for a party, which has  amongst its ministers a kidnapper, an alleged diamond smuggler,  persons implicated in bomb blasts, and a foreign minister,  Alfred Nzo, who is on public record as supporting the burning to  death of other human beings.    The term "Truth and Reconciliation Commission" is itself  something of an Orwellian invention, the kind of spurious  semantic facade which so appeals to those on the left. For the  same reason the new Government has decided to call the Ministry  of Police, as it is called in most other countries, the Ministry  of Safety and Security. For its part, the proposed Truth and  Reconciliation Commission is a grand name for what is no more  than a political inquisition.  <H5>  SPURIOUS </H5>   We all know that this has little to do with reconciliation.  And though it would be interesting to know which ANC leaders  ordered Robert McBride's grisly murders, the commission is  unlikely to be this even-handed in its investigations.    The Justice Minister has already stated there should be no  moral comparison between ANC murder and brutality, and that of  the former government.    According to this logic Robert McBride's mutilation and  murder of innocents is not evil because it was done for a good  cause. Acts are not inherently evil because evil is primarily  identifiable with the choice of one's cause.  <H5>  MORAL RELATIVISM </H5>   This moral relativism is itself evil, and leads to evil. It  is this logic which says that the Nazi Holocaust was despicable,  whilst the Stalinist Holocaust was merely unfortunate. Indeed  the latter event should be swept under the carpet and studiously  ignored because the Soviet concentration camps were created in  the name of humanity.  <H5>  TWO COMMISSIONS? </H5>   If we are to have inquisitions let us put both the NP  [National Party] and the ANC in the dock. Better that two such  commissions are established both with similar resources and with  a similar will to uncover evil, one for each organisation. Then  later we can compare the tally sheets and decide which side was  worse, relatively speaking.    Instead we are likely to end up with just another propaganda  forum, which even if it displays half the selectivity of the  Goldstone Commission, will generate more heat than light about  the nature of political evil in South Africa.    So, in the best Orwellian tradition we are likely to have a  Truth and Reconciliation Commission which offsets reconciliation.    The Truth Commission says Dullah Omar, will complete its  work  in eighteen months to two years.    Let us hope it does so more quickly. Because then the  central state can get on, more seriously than before, with its  stated goal of reconciliation and nation-building.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yet another unproductive day was reported in Lusaka  today. The government-UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] talks are still bogged down on the issue  of swearing in UNITA members of Parliament. Our Lusaka  correspondent Alves Antonio has the details:    The UNITA negotiators claim they are still considering the  issue that was placed on the negotiating table on 3 June. This  afternoon the two negotiating teams were at the Mulungushi  Conference Center to once again try to find a way out to that  issue, but to no avail. Meanwhile, efforts continue to be made  to overcome the obstacles so that other aspects relating to  national reconciliation can be addressed. It was not a  productive day, but the delegations are still eager to negotiate.</p>

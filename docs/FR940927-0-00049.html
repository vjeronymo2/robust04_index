			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Navajo EPA indicated that the plan amendment did not incorporate standards to be used by NAMLRD for air, water, soil, radioactivity, and other topics, when deciding whether a site has been completely reclaimed. Title IV of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations do not require specific reclamation standards. OSM, during field reviews, provides the necessary oversight to ensure that projects funded using AMR funds meet the goals established when funding was approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Navajo EPA suggested that section II(D)(1)(a&hyph;e) of the Navajo Nation Rules concerning reclamation priorities may need a clarifying statement to indicate that ``Priority A'' is the same as ``priority 1,'' and so forth, as used in SMCRA and by NAMLRD (to designate priorities of eligible lands and water for expenditures from the Navajo AMR fund). OSM agrees that a clarifying statement would be helpful, but the dual designations are not so confusing as to affect their implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Navajo EPA expressed concern that section II(L)(1) of the Navajo Nation Rules pertaining to general reclamation requirements does not state that the eligibility requirements are set under SMCRA and were not devised by the Navajo Nation. OSM responds that, while the Navajo Nation Rules do not specifically reference SMCRA in this section, these rules implement the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 which is the Navajo Nation's counterpart to SMCRA. The eligibility requirements established by these rules are consistent with section 404 of SMCRA. Therefore, a specific reference to this SMCRA citation is not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Navajo EPA stated that because it had found no indication that any ``State'' has held a reclamation bond for mining activities conducted within the Navajo Nation, the word ``State'' in the Navajo Nation Rules at section II(L)(2)(b)(3) concerning reclamation bonds should be deleted. This is an editorial comment, and the implication that the State may hold a bond for reclamation activities on Navajo Nation lands is immaterial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Navajo EPA commented that section II(M)(2) of the Navajo Nation Rules, which states that ``[f]ollowing the concurrence by the Director [with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation], the Nation may implement a noncoal reclamation program pursuant to the provisions of section 411 of SMCRA,'' should be revised to clarify that the ``Director'' is the Director of OSM. While Navajo EPA's comment is consistent with section 411 of SMCRA, which indicates that the Secretary (in this case, the Director of OSM for the Secretary) has the authority to concur with a Tribe's or State's certification, OSM does not find it necessary to require the Navajo Nation to revise this rule. In requesting the Secretary's concurrence on the Director of NAMLRD's certification of completion of coal reclamation, the Navajo Nation has complied with section 411 of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Navajo EPA stated that the reference to ``the Act'' in section II(P)(1)(c) of the Navajo Nation Rules concerning utilities and other facilities is unclear. OSM interprets the term ``the Act'' as used in this rule to be the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and does not agree with the statement by Navajo EPA that such term is unclear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Navajo EPA felt that section III(E) of the Navajo Nation Rules pertaining to creation of a future reclamation set-aside program did not clearly indicate what happens to Navajo AMR funds after all known coal reclamation has been completed. Navajo EPA asked whether the monies will become general funds, subject then to reappropriation by the Navajo Nation Council and whether the funds can be used for purposes other than coal reclamation. As discussed in finding No. 2 above, upon concurrence by the Director of OSM with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation, the Navajo Nation may, in accordance with section 411(f) of SMCRA, request AMR grant monies from OSM to pursue public facilities projects related to coal or mineral development. The Navajo Nation cannot reappropriate these monies for uses other than what has been approved by OSM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

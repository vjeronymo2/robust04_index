			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Prosperous Decade Forecast: The 1990s should be more prosperous as the result  of new economic competition, according to the new First Interstate Bancorp  Economic Forecast. "Competition among the Untied States, a much more unified  Europe, Japan and the newly industrializing economies of Asia will promote  economic growth," according to Jerry Jordan, senior vice president and chief  economist. He added that the U.S. economy is likely to weaken in the latter  part of 1989, with softness spilling over into early 1990. California's growth  rate will also be reduced due to the national slowdown and a decline in defense  spending, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary general of the </F> Italian Democratic Party of the Left, by Paolo Franchi; place  and date not given: "This Government Humiliates Italy" -- first  paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "The country's democratic life has reached  danger level." This was Achille Occhetto's immediate comment  Tuesday [10 May] on the birth of the new government. And in  today's L'UNITA he went even further: [President] Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro's letter to [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi is "a  shocking, extraordinary, and disturbing development." Does that  mean that you deny that this government has the democratic  legitimacy necessary to govern? "No, we said immediately after  the elections that the victorious Right has the entitlement and  the duty to govern. But this is a different matter. This  government humiliates Italy because of the quality of its  ministers; because of the lies and intrigues that dominated the  period of its formation, just as in the darkest days of the  First Republic; and because at the very moment of its birth it  is already violating all the promises that it made to the  Italian people."    [Franchi] But the Right has won. We might feel prompted to  say: Here is the New that you appealed for...    [Occhetto] The New? Let us be serious. There have been  times when the Right was the New: Fascism was the New with  respect to liberal Italy. So the term "new" is a subject of  debate. Be that as it may, this is a government of recycled  persons. There is even something derisive in what has happened:  Riding on the tide of self-righteousness and revanchism, in an  atmosphere like that of the Circus Maximus, the Bossis and the  Finis have brought to power the rearguard of the forces that  held sway during the first phase of the republic. It is a base  example of the mere appearance of change.    [Franchi] What do you mean? That the people have been  victims of an optical illusion, a great deception?    [Occhetto] A deception, a deception. After a great campaign  against the parties, we find ourselves again with Big Brother  looking out at us from every wall. I say this quite frankly:  We cannot compete with this huge financial and business power,  with a mega-party-cum-firm which wants to render the parties  ineffective.    [Franchi] Do you not think that you are exaggerating? If I  am not mistaken, you were in the forefront of the challenge to  the Old Regime. And the election result and the consequent  government are the outcome of a new electoral system that was  supposed to open the way to alternation...    [Occhetto] But this is not the democracy of alternation that  we wanted when we promoted the referendums. We are in a  republic led by a family business. As an Italian, I feel  ashamed of this. Especially when I think about the European  Parliament where we poor post-Communists -- universally  acknowledged as cultured, intelligent, and civilized -- will  appear with this mass of ignoramuses behind us... Some Liberals  in the twenties actually liked the Fascist action squads, at  least from an aesthetic viewpoint. This time, with people of  this sort, there is no danger of committing the same mistake.  What democracy of alternation? Here we have a prime minister  who in the European elections is standing as a candidate at the  top of his lists in five constituencies, knowing that he will  have to resign immediately. This is a deception against the  voters, an attempt to introduce a system of election by  acclaim...    [Franchi] I take note of your opinion. I would like to ask:  What does an opposition do when it is convinced that the winners  pose a threat to democracy?    [Occhetto] We will conduct a democratic and constitutional  opposition. But we cannot ignore the sinister sickness revealed  by the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi: It  is precisely the existence of this sinister sickness that  demands that we be not only the vanguard of a combative  opposition but also the champions of a democracy that has  reached danger level.    [Franchi] I assume you realize the serious implications of  what you are saying.    [Occhetto] Of course. And I would never have said it unless  Scalfaro had taken the serious action that he did. Let us be  frank. Either Scalfaro was not in earnest, which I exclude, or  his words are set in stone. And these stones must be removed.    [Franchi] Pardon me, but I still find it difficult to  reconcile two such different approaches to opposition. It is  one matter to plan revenge in the next elections, which is what  happens in all the Western countries. But it is an entirely  different matter to combat the threat of reaction...    [Occhetto] I will try to make this clear by means of an  example. In Britain the Laborites combat the Conservative  governments' economic and social policies by monitoring them and  putting forward alternative proposals. And we will do this.  But there is a serious additional problem. This government has  been born amid the suspicion that it wants to deviate from  observance of the fundamental principles of the Constitution.  And we intend to act as guardians of these principles. I would  like to add that it is not we alone who will be establishing  which aspect of our opposition will prevail. A great deal will  obviously depend on what the government does.    [Franchi] Do you not think that a Left that adopts such a  stance will, rightly or wrongly, be accused of being progressive  by name but conservative in deed?    [Occhetto] Why? I say, on the contrary: Left, wake up; do  not close yourself up in your own narrow domain; learn to talk  to the 60 percent of Italians who did not vote for the Right and  who, let us never forget, constitute the virtual majority,    [Franchi] Yes, but the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  and  its progressive allies obtained one-third of the votes. And  very few people actually believe in the possibility of their  increasing to the extent of becoming a majority.    [Occhetto] I do not believe it either. We have crossed our  Red Sea. We are still standing. Indeed, we have gained some  votes. But we certainly must not imagine that the PDS and the  Left can achieve a majority on their own. Not even by taking  nonexistent shortcuts...    [Franchi] Shortcuts?    [Occhetto] Yes, the idea of dissolving, of turning ourselves  -- us and the forces close to us -- into a democratic party,  that is, of eliminating the "S," the Left, from our name, as  though the problem facing the Left were how to constantly escape  from itself... Nonsense. Just as it is nonsense to account for  everything in terms of a sociology of leadership, though sooner  or later the issue will arise of a PDS secretary that does not  have behind him the experience of the PCI [Italian Communist  Party], if for no other reason than that generations come and  go. Just as it is superficial, if not indeed stupid, to believe  that the basic issue is one of appeal to the moderates...    [Franchi] Do you mean that this issue does not exist?    [Occhetto] I accept no criticisms in this regard, even  implicit ones. I went to NATO. I went to talk to bankers in  the City. The enlightened bourgeoisie voted for us en masse.  If I had been told that only a few years ago, I would not have  believed it. What I mean is that there certainly is a problem  regarding the Left, but that above all there is the problem of  the center.    [Franchi] And what is that?    [Occhetto] It is that there is not a center capable of  looking toward the Left with the same vigor and pragmatism with  which Berlusconi, also from the center, looked toward the  right-wing forces, causing them to communicate with each other.  And leading them to victory, thanks to the first-past-the-post  system. This, despite the fact that the progressive forces, the  Popular Party, and the Pact gained more votes.    [Franchi] What do you have in mind to ensure that this  dynamic center takes shape?    [Occhetto] You are asking too much of me. I already have my  problems with the Left. We can, and will, conduct an opposition  that is non-demagogic, non-extremist. And we can confederate  our forces. Of course, I will not ask the Popular Party to join  the confederation of left-wing forces. But I will ask it to  create a new rapport with the left-wing forces in order to set  Italy on a new track.    [Franchi] I almost forgot: What happened to your fling with  [League Secretary] Bossi?    [Occhetto] What fling... I was well aware that Bossi wanted  to use us too to raise the bidding in the government  negotiations. But I also knew that Bossi had, and still has, a  problem: Part of his voters are threatening to leave him for  Forza Italia, while another part could leave him precisely  because he has allied with Forza Italia. Be that as it may,  Bossi has shouldered a serious responsibility. Without him, who  was portrayed as the quintessence of the new, Berlusconi would  not now be prime minister.</p>

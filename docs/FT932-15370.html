			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Group 4 to meet prison officials MANAGERS OF Group 4 Court Services will meet Prison Service officials tomorrow to discuss the problems which arose during the first week of Britain's only private prison-escort service. Four prisoners escaped or were wrongly released last week, when Group 4 took over the contract for escorting prisoners between prisons and courts in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside. Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service, will seek an explanation for the incidents and stress the importance of Group 4 meeting the quality requirements of its five-year contract. Group 4 said that it looked forward to tomorrow's meeting. The company was satisfied that there were adequate explanations for the incidents and said it was 'entirely happy that the basic principles of the operation are sound.' Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, is to raise the issue of private court-escort services in the Commons.</p>

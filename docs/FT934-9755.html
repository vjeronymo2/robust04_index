			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Minolta again omits payout MINOLTA, one of Japan's leading makers of cameras and photocopiers, blamed depressed profits on a decline in consumer and private capital spending and a strong yen. Minolta, which has a high export ratio of nearly 80 per cent, reported a 10 per cent decline in sales for the first half of fiscal 1993 to Y89.2bn (Dollars 825m) from Y99.5bn a year ago. The company made a pre-tax loss of Y1.05bn, which was significantly less than its pre-tax loss of Y4.98bn in the previous first half. However, it is passing its dividend for the third consecutive term. It said that despite the introduction of new products its camera division had suffered a sharp decline in sales of 15 per cent, while its business machinery division saw sales fall back by 7.9 per cent. Minolta has made efforts to deal with the impact of the higher yen and weak demand through price increases, shortening of the time it takes to bring products to the market and standardisation of parts. It has been cutting back on recruitment and other costs. Nevertheless, the company does not expect the main economies of the world to emerge from their gloom easily. Minolta is counting on the launch of new camera products to help lift sales but sees little prospect of improvement in spending by corporations. As a result, it is forecasting a loss for the full year of Y1bn on sales of Y188bn and will pass its final dividend.</p>

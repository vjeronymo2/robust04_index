			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / EU banks raise lending share European Union banks have increased their share of international lending against their North American and Japanese counterparts, according to the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. Outside Asia, EU banks were the world's largest lenders. The BIS said the share of international bank lending by EU banks had risen to 45.2 per cent at the end of 1993 from 34.8 per cent in 1985. The BIS report covers lending by BIS-area banks - comprising the Group of 10 industrial countries plus Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain - to non-BIS countries over the past eight years. The BIS also named Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a former Italian premier, as vice-chairman, succeeding Mr Lamberto Dini, Italy's new treasury minister.</p>

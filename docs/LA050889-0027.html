			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH TRIES OUT THE OTHER BARBER  </P> <P> Figaro, Figaro, Figaro. Everybody knows Figaro. Everybody uses Figaro.  </P> <P>  Figaro qua, Figaro la, Figaro su, Figaro giu. . . .  </P> <P> Figaro is everywhere -- here and there, up and down. He is, after all, the  world's busiest baritonal factotum.  </P> <P> He is Rossini's beloved barber of Seville. In another incarnation, he is  Mozart's most celebrated bridegroom.  </P> <P> But wait. Rossini and Mozart weren't the only composers to get involved with  this mercurial tonsorial manipulator.  </P> <P> Inspired by Beaumarchais' quasi-anti-establishment comedy, Giovanni Paisiello  wrote a pioneering opera-buffa called "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" in 1782.  Rossini didn't get around to his own strikingly similar version of the same  text until 1816 -- the year Paisiello died. Meanwhile, in 1786, Mozart  consciously followed -- and expanded -- the Paisiello-Beaumarchais example when  he officiated at the mellifluous marriage of Figaro.  </P> <P> The ever-enterprising Long Beach Opera is surveying the evolution of the Figaro  revolution this month with performances of both the Paisiello rarity and the  Mozart perennial. The familiar Rossini variation is missing, alas, and so is  Darius Milhaud's setting of the ultimate sequel, "La mere coupable" (1964).  </P> <P> Reliable rumor has it that the publisher withheld the Milhaud materials because  of financial problems in Long Beach. Be that as it may, Michael Milenski has  scheduled a production of the original, unsung Beaumarchais play on May 20.  This "Guilty Mother" will be embellished with new incidental music by Mark  McGurty.  </P> <P> The Paisiello "Barbiere," which opened at the intimate yet skimpily attended  Center Theater on Saturday, was very popular in its day. That day,  unfortunately, seems to have passed.  </P> <P> It is a pretty opera, full of graceful tunes, neat set pieces, pleasant lyrical  flights. Taken on its own innocent terms, it offers discreet charm and muted  wit.  </P> <P> It turns up from time to time in modest workshop productions. Walter  Felsenstein temporarily renewed Paisiello's lease on stage life with an  exquisite production in East Berlin in the late 1950s. Boston ventured a  reasonably ambitious version a few seasons ago.  </P> <P> An operatic exhumation like this is always interesting, often instructive. Long  Beach deserves our gratitude for taking us on a rare time trip.  </P> <P> Still, the trip was haunted, possibly fatally, by the spectres of Rossini and  Mozart. One recognizes a procedural point borrowed by the former, a structural  device appropriated by the latter. At the same time, one yearns for the brash  vitality of Rossini at one extreme and for the inspired humanity of Mozart at  the other.  </P> <P> For all his suavity and skill, Paisiello didn't make waves. He was just another  Salieri.  </P> <P> Peter Schaffer notwithstanding, that is no insult. Nor is it tantamount to  glorification.  </P> <P> The production, politely mild by Long Beach standards, didn't make waves  either. Hans Nieuwenhuis, the young Dutch director, decided that the thrust  stage didn't exist. He pretended that the Center Theater was really an  old-fashioned proscenium house -- and slighted opportunities for theatrical  immediacy in the process. He also introduced the fleeting redundancy of a  fatuous narrator.  </P> <P> In general he allowed the familiar action to unfold fluidly and with elegant  restraint. He used Paul Gallis' drawing room cum colonnade set and muted  costumes as a versatile period frame.  </P> <P> He couldn't resist peppering the proceedings, however, with some cutesy-fussy,  anachronistic sight gags. A plastic credit card facilitated the Count's payment  to Figaro. Floating cable-car cages accommodated characters who were supposed  to appear in windows. The 17th-Century servants brandished an "ON STRIKE" sign.  A leitmotific dinner table rose and sank on an elevator ad tedium, for no  particular reason.  </P> <P> In the too-prominent pit, Nicholas McGegan conducted a patently under-rehearsed  orchestra with dauntless panache. He also struck a few continuo chords with  stylish abandon. He couldn't distract attention, however, from Paisiello's  relatively simplistic harmonies, his inevitable cadential cliches and his pat  orchestral formulas.  </P> <P> The ensemble of singing actors was strong. John Fanning brought deft baritonal  bonhomie to the title role. Kathryn Gamberoni chirped sweetly, even sexily, as  Rosina. Don Bernardini exerted manly bel-canto as Almaviva. David Evitts  blustered agreeably as Bartolo. Michael Gallup easily overcame a mishap at the  peak of a crucial cadenza and played Basilio with gleeful bravado.  </P> <P> Minor roles were crisply etched by Ken Remo, Christopher Webb, John McConnell  and Alan Nitikman. Everyone articulated Ross Halper's English translation  carefully.  </P> <P> This Figaro venture was nice. Too bad it wasn't exciting.  </P> <P>  Ah, bravo, Figaro, bravo, bravissimo?  </P> <P>  Not quite.  </P></p>

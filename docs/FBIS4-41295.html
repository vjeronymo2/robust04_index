			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius replied to  questions from journalists at a traditional news conference  today. He also agreed to reply to questions by a correspondent  of this program.    Asked whether there will be any changes in the government  economic policy after the Seimas debate on a government no-  confidence vote, Slezevicius said:    [Begin Slezevicius recording] We have very carefully studied  all statements without exception by Seimas members. We have  analyzed all critical remarks and focussed our attention on many  of them during the preparation of a corrected government  program. As you know, the no-confidence issue is one side of  the matter, but now, in accordance with our constitution, we  have, after a change of more than a half of the members of the  cabinet, submitted a new government program to the Seimas. [end  recording]    Having stated that the stability of the litas is helping the  development of the economy but is not sufficient to make this  development more dynamic, Slezevicius continued:    [Begin Slezevicius recording] In our program we emphasize  our  attention on those issues which require a very fast solution.  This includes taxation policy, the administration of taxes, the  control of borders, and improvement of the work of the customs  offices. And, of course, it is very important to step up the  investment process. [passage omitted]    A limiting factor in the development of the economy is the  very high cost of credits, and, of course, not a single investor  is able to use local credits for investment processes. This is  closely connected with the credit resources of our commercial  banks and with the stability of these banks. Together with the  Central Bank, we have to accomplish a great deal in this sphere,  so that the price of credits in our country goes down in a more  dynamic manner than now. [end recording]    Slezevicius then stressed the government's tasks in creating  favorable trading conditions for Lithuania's industry and  businessmen and mentioned that at a foreign policy coordinating  committee meeting relations with Russia were discussed today.  Then he continued:    [Begin Slevevicius recording] As you know our relations with  Russia are being extensively discussed. They are closely linked  with the strategic situation of the Kaliningrad region and with  the necessity of normalizing transit through our country. As it  happens, our country is situated between two territories of  Russia and our task is to find together with Russia mutually  acceptable means of solving all problems. [passage omitted]    I think that we will find mutually acceptable solutions in  the immediate future and that the agreement signed by Mr  Chernomyrdin on 18 November will be implemented.

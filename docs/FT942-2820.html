			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No mood for a shift to United States of Europe Sir, Presented with a fourth slate of candidates for the Strasbourg parliament, Europeans were about as excited as they would be by a fourth plate of lasagne. But the European Union, like an Italian mother, just won't take 'no' for an answer. With recent polls revealing growing anti-Maastricht sentiment across Europe, 'citizens of the European Union' were in no mood to ratify further moves toward the creation of a United States of Europe. Yet, with no outlet for legitimate desires to keep accountability lodged in national parliaments, Europeans used the European Parliament elections to deliver a loud, but garbled, message on the state of the union and domestic politics. With voter turnout at its lowest since Euro-voting began in 1979, substantial numbers were effectively endorsing the closest thing to a pan-European movement; the movement to stop further transfers of sovereign control to remote supranational institutions. Where well-financed, anti-Maastricht groupings were on offer, such as in France, voters delivered stinging rebukes to the main parties. As for the main parties, their representatives generally vied to woo voters either with nationalist lines or promises to pick the pork barrel better than the other side. There are 567 MEPs who are the illegitimate children of this unedifying affair. They will form a new parliament resembling a Tower of Babel in ways other than linguistic. Article 138a of the Maastricht treaty emphasises the importance of European political parties 'as a factor for integration within the Union'. They contribute, we are told, 'to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of Europe'. With nine contrived and tenuous parliamentary groupings - some including anti-unionists, and the third largest being the 'non-attached' - anyone with a 'European awareness' should recognise that they cannot manifest a 'political will'. Despite the parliament's dubious pedigree, there is a disturbing, almost religious, aura attached to its status as a 'democratically elected' institution. Newly elected MEPs are already crowing about their mission to bring the Union under 'democratic control and scrutiny', which will largely consist of exercising their new powers of obstruction under Maastricht provisions. MEPs of all political hues have united behind gratuitous threats to veto new commissioners and legislation, all in the service of arrogating more powers from national governments, and thereby contributing to the construction of the United States of Europe which Europeans have been saying they don't want. 'There can be collective European ventures only if the citizens take an interest and are convinced that the overall direction is the right one'  - the words of Commission president Jacques Delors. This time, at least, it is worth taking him seriously.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Rosyth workers warned of up to 40% job losses THE WORKFORCE at the Rosyth naval dockyard could fall by nearly 40 per cent to 2,200 by the year 2005, employees were told yesterday. Staff were warned that their present pay and conditions will have to be renegotiated as the yard reduces costs and is fully privatised. Babcock Thorn, which operates the yard on the Firth of Forth, yesterday held the first of a series of meetings in which it is spelling out the yard's prospects to its 3,600 employees. This follows the government's decision in June to award the contract for servicing Trident submarines to Devonport, while allocating Rosyth a workload of surface ships which will decline after 2000 and end in 2005. Early next year the Ministry of Defence will seek tenders for the full privatisation of the two naval dockyards. Mr Allan Smith, Babcock Thorn's managing director, said Babcock intends to bid for Rosyth without Thorn EMI and is negotiating to take over Thorn's 35 per cent stake. The workforce was told that submarine work would continue to 1996 and would be followed by the refitting of two aircraft carriers as well as frigates and Type 42 destroyers. By 2000 the workforce was likely to fall to 2,800. After 2000 Rosyth will have to compete for most of its naval workload and the labour force could drop to 2,200. The exact size depended on its success in improving efficiency and reducing costs. The workforce was told that Rosyth's wage, salary and overtime costs were the highest in the ship refitting industry, and the company's contribution to the pension fund was twice that of most of its competitors. The yard was 'top of the league' for holidays, the employees were told. Mr Smith said that Babcock Thorn had taken over a dockyard that enjoyed civil service conditions. Change would be necessary and would be discussed with the workforce. The yard is to be reorganised to cope with the new workload. About 70 of 270 buildings on the site may be returned to the MoD and 90 may be demolished. Part of the site could be turned into an industrial estate. The dock designed for Trident submarines could be used for constructing sections of the proposed second Forth road bridge. Rosyth already gets about 20 per cent of its Pounds 165m turnover from non-MoD work, and would like to increase this to 30 per cent. It refurbishes London Underground trains, builds boats and has a joinery division which makes furniture and supermarket counters.</p>

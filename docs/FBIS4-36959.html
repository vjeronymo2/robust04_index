			<p>BFN     [Text] New developments have taken place in the Saharan  voters' registration issue. After new information was given by  the Saharan side with regard to the travel by thousands of  Moroccan citizens to the Saharan territory, the UN mission in  charge of organizing the referendum in Western Sahara denied  this information. Over to you Abdelkader Cherti,    [Abdelkeder] In a statement delivered to APS yesterday, the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de  Oro [Polisario] affirmed the arrival by bus in recent days of  thousands of Moroccan citizens in Laayoune and Bojador to  participate in the voter identification, which started in  Western Sahara under UN supervision before the organization of  the referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara.    The Polisario Front said that the operation is considered a  blatant violation of the UN peace plan in Western Sahara and the  aim behind it is to undermine the referendum and spoil the  atmosphere in which the UN committee for voter identification  works.    In view of these developments, the Polisario Front called on  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the UN Security  Council to take the necessary measures to guarantee the smooth  operation of voter identification in an atmosphere of freedom  and strictness.    In contrast with the contents of the Polisario Front's  statement, the UN committee in charge of implementing the  referendum in Western Sahara denied yesterday evening the  information contained in the Saharan statement and stressed that  they did not notice buses loaded with Moroccan citizens, and,  according to their statement, they did not receive any  information to this effect.</p>

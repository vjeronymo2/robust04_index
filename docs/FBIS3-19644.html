This was announced by Horst Waffenschmidt, the Federal  Government's resettler commissioner, upon inquiry on Friday [18  March]. The parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Interior  Ministry summarized the results of the meeting of the  German-Russian government Committee that recently took place in  Bonn, chaired by himself and by Russian Nationalities Policy  Minister Shakhray.    The Committee set down the direction of future activities.  The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politician noted that it  is primarily important to "create a stable and generally  favorable sociopolitical situation in their compact settlement  areas and places for resettlement in Russia" for Russian Germans  who want to stay in Russia. A first step toward fulfilling  President Yeltsin's decree "on immediate measures to  rehabilitate the Russian Germans," has been made by establishing  national local councils and self-administration organs in the  Kamyshin rayon (Volgograd area) and in the Engels rayon (Saratov  area). It is a step on the path toward the goal of 10 July 1992  of implementing the "protocol on cooperation between the  government of the Russian Federation and the government of the  FRG with the aim of gradually reestablishing the Russian  Germans' state." According to Waffenschmidt, it was helpful  that the Russian Government has now put together a "package of  juridical documents" about the legal status of a national okrug,  rayon, and national local councils and presented it to the  Russian Federation Assembly ("Upper House").    The Russian nationalities policy minister explained his  "concept of a bilateral program for the development of the  Russian Germans' culture" as well as a draft of the "federal  program for the reestablishment and development of the system of  steady national formation of Russian Germans and the first steps  for its implementation by the year 2000." Agreement has been  achieved on discussing the proposals of the Russian  Nationalities Policy Ministry at a special meeting of the  German-Russian Cultural Cooperation Committee in Bonn on 20 and  21 April, with the participation of representatives of the  Russian Germans' organizations.    Waffenschmidt added that both partners welcomed ideas for  the  Russian Germans' self-organization, which are aimed at the  confirmation and official Russian recognition of their national  and cultural character. This applies, above all, to the "German  People's Assembly," some kind of Russian-German parliament. The  People's Assembly should participate in specifying forms of  national-cultural autonomy and the development of the Russian  Germans' self-administration organs. Bonn will give priority  support to a Russian-German administration college, which is on  the point of being established.  <H5>  Focus Western Siberia </H5>   Waffenschmidt said that it was noted with satisfaction that  Moscow registers positive investment results for Russian-German  joint ventures, expressed in a clear increase in the financing  volume. For 1994 the Russian budget allocates 39 billion rubles  (39 billion marks) to projects for the benefit of Russian  Germans; the budget of the German Interior Ministry allocates 65  million marks to this purpose. The regional development  societies in the German national rayon of Asovo (Omsk area) and  in the German national rayon of Halberstadt in the Altai area  have proved their worth. Bonn and Moscow agreed to examine the  resettlement project in Nashchokovo (Tomsk area) with the aim of  implementing it as soon as possible if the result of the study  is positive. Russia's federal immigration authority wants to  provide financial means for this purpose. In addition, it is  useful to intensify measures that promote the Russian Germans'  own initiative. This is to be achieved by granting low interest  loans for the construction of owner-occupied houses and for the  establishment of small and medium-sized companies (loans for  setting up new business).    Waffenschmidt also stated that for him the promotion of  church centers is an important element in the work of Russian  Germans. In Omsk the Hannover Evangelical-Lutheran Land Church  and the FRG Interior Ministry are supporting the construction of  an Evangelical church center. In addition to church rooms,  meeting places for young people and senior citizens as well as  rooms for charitable work are being built. The church center in  Omsk will become a cultural center for the 500,000 Russian  Germans in western Siberia. Together with Land Bishop Hirschler  from Hannover, he, Waffenschmidt, will inaugurate the center in  the summer. In Marx (formerly Katharinenstadt) on the Volga,  Cardinal Sterzinsky, the bishop of Berlin, inaugurated the  Catholic church center last year. Many descendants of the Volga  Germans, who settled in the area of Saratov, have found a new  spiritual home in this church center.    Upon the request of the Russian Lutheran Church and the FRG  government, the city has once again made St. Peter's Church in  St. Petersburg available to the Evangelical church. In  communist times a swimming pool had been built there.  Waffenschmidt said that gradually "St. Peter's church is to be  expanded into a church center and a cultural center, in  cooperation between the Evangelical church and the FRG  government." In the view of the CDU politician, the meeting of  Russian Germans and their non-German neighbors is to be  particularly promoted in the above-mentioned church centers.  Upon his urging, three church centers have already held  ecumenical services with Evangelical, Catholic, and Russian  Orthodox clergy.</p>

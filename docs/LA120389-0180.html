			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> A debate over whether Huntington Beach should hire a public relations  consultant to help spread the word about the city's redevelopment will come to  the floor at the City Council meeting on Monday. Council members will discuss a  proposal that the city spend $150,000 for the consultant. While some officials  believe such a move is unneeded, others say the consultant may be able to  deliver national media coverage of the city's redevelopment effort.  </P> <P> The hub of the city's efforts has been the Main-Pier area Redevelopment  Project. Officials envision a "village-type" area, complete with hotels, shops  and restaurants, along Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway. The municipal  pier will be the centerpiece of the project. Another new development is the  Waterfront project -- which will include a 12-story hotel-restaurant-convention  complex -- on Pacific Coast Highway between Beach Boulevard and Huntington  Street. It is scheduled to open in July.  </P></p>

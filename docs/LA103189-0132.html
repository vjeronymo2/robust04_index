			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SHANGHAI QUARTET JOINS MUSIC OF EAST AND WEST  </P> <P> Though not proofed against street noise or internal off-stage distractions, the  courtyard of the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena proved an evocative, engaging  concert space for the Shanghai String Quartet Sunday evening. Performing for  Chamber Music in Historic Sites, the young ensemble played a well-constructed  program with vigor and elan.  </P> <P> At the center of the agenda was the "Song of the Ch'in" by Zhou Long and  Bartok's Third Quartet. Though literally a world apart in mood and expressive  focus, both works employ many of the same compositional and technical tricks,  making a very effective pairing.  </P> <P> "Song of the Ch'in" is an episodic, atmospheric piece that re-creates sounds of  the ch'in, a Chinese type of zither. In doing so, the composer reveals a sure  understanding of the string quartet as a single entity. The ensemble --  violinists Wei Gang Li and Hong Gang Li, violist Zheng Wang and cellist Kathe  Jarka -- met all the colorful demands with confident, integrated playing.  </P> <P> Their Bartok alternated between fire and ice, in a taut, purposeful account.  The Shanghai violins are slender-toned and sweet in contrast to the big, dark  sounds of the viola and cello, which left some passages unbalanced. But the  cumulative effect was one of convincing intelligence.  </P> <P> The concert began with a light flight through Haydn's currently fashionable  "Lark" Quartet. At the end of the printed program came Brahm's C-minor Quartet,  Opus 51, No. 1, in an initially generic reading troubled by more than just  Jarka's loose string, which she retuned while the others continued playing. It  peaked into an individual statement in the Allegretto, though, and continued  with fiendish brio in the finale.  </P> <P> The group came back for one encore, the folk song "The Chinese Girl," in an  arrangement that sounded like pure Dvorak.

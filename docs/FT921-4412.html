			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Degussa to shed more staff DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, intends to cut its labour force by a further 1,000 people by October 1993, as part of its programme aimed at cutting costs and improving profitability. The company, which holds its annual press conference today, intends to achieve as many of the job cuts as possible through early retirement so as to minimise redundancies. It said it wants to cut overheads by up to 25 per cent at its Frankfurt-based parent company. Its worldwide labour force was about 33,000 at the end of last October, a drop of 2,100 on the previous year. Degussa has already announced a sharp cut in its dividend payment to DM7 from DM11 a share after a drop in group net income of 33 per cent to DM99m (Dollars 62m) in the year to September, 1991. Earnings per share slid to DM12 from DM25.50. Before tax, profits were 44 per cent lower at DM179m. The company's problems stem mainly from the slowdown in its export markets at a time when competitive pressures have emphasised the high level of German costs. The decline in the world motor industry has also affected Degussa, which makes carbon black, used by the tyre industry, and produces metals for catalytic converters. Thus the company is keen to realign its operations by trimming the workforce, cutting the number of business units, selling off peripheral activities, and shifting some production to lower-cost countries. Its restructuring programme, called Degussa 2000, began in 1989.</p>

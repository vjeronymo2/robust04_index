			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: US gas sales offset tax changes at Hardy Oil THE BUOYANCY of the US market for natural gas helped lift half year turnover at Hardy Oil &amp; Gas, the independent exploration and production company, by 40 per cent to Pounds 29.5m in the half year to September 30, compared with Pounds 21.1m. However, the negative impact of recent UK tax changes resulted in after-tax profits sinking by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 4.63m). The company yesterday confirmed that the government's removal of tax concessions for exploration activities in last March's Budget was affecting short-term cash flow and earnings. Its Petroleum Revenue Tax credit in the period was Pounds 1.69m, against Pounds 4.1m. Mr Douglas Baker, chairman, said the change had 'adversely affected the risk/reward ratio of exploration in the United Kingdom continental shelf'. He added that Hardy would continue to explore in UK waters, but 'opportunities there will have to be more rigorously justified'. The effect of the UK tax changes were partially offset by Hardy's strong position in the US, which accounted for half of group operating profits, which almost doubled to Pounds 6m (Pounds 3.2m). The US contribution was Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 984,000), the result of higher volumes, stronger US gas prices and positive foreign exchange movements. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.14m (Pounds 527,000). Earnings per share were 3.8p (5p). Mr Baker noted that Hardy's high levels of gas production, accounting for two thirds of current output, had reduced its vulnerability to low oil prices. He predicted that Hardy would continue to benefit from rising gas production in the US, where prices remained buoyant because of seasonal high demand. 'The group's operating cash flow, even at current levels, should substantially exceed that for last year,' he added. The company also pointed to exploration successes in Canada and Pakistan as positive factors for future growth.</p>

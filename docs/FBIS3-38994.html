For  Austria, which had 40 billion schillings in claims in export  credits, the redemption of these debts means a burden on our  budget of between 2.5-2.8 billion schillings a year. In the  meantime, however, Poland's credit rating has significantly  changed.    As Gerhard Praschak, managing director of the Austrian  Control Bank (OeKB), told DIE PRESSE, guarantees for Poland  credits are available again. "Experience in new transactions is  excellent, the Poles are fully rehabilitated," Praschak said by  way of explaining this decision in terms of economic policy.  Although export guarantees are handled by the OeKB, it is the  Federal Government, and thus ultimately the taxpayer, that  assumes the liability. Still, liability fees for Poland are  relatively high, namely 3 percent, while for exports to Slovakia  they are only at 1.5 percent.    There are still no guarantees for exports to Russia, while  Iran and Algeria have become new "problem cases." In both  countries, credits granted by Austria amount to some 12 billion  schilling. In the case of Iran, which is paying back debts only  very slowly, Praschak expects a "de facto rescheduling of  debts," since, owing to political resistance from the United  States, an official one is hardly possible. Algeria is also  again and again being regarded as a rescheduling candidate, even  though Austrian credits have hitherto always been serviced.    In the past few years, the OeKB had to put up with a  50-percent reduction of its export guarantee turnover. In 1990  the figure was still 95 billion schillings, and in 1991 81  billion schillings. The loss of exports to the USSR and  Yugoslavia, the decrease in project deals and exports to the  Arab countries, which declined as a result of lower oil prices,  resulted in a reduction of the guarantee turnover to 48 billion  schillings in 1992. Guarantees went down further to 45 billion  schillings in 1993, Praschak said. [passage omitted]</p>

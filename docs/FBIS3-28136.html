			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Japan, at a news conference in the Diet --  live]    [Text] There earlier was a joint meeting of the heads of  the ruling parties, the Economic Council, and the  representatives of the five floor groups. At the meeting, the  prime minister gave an explanation.    Following the explanation, I did my best to make it clear  that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot agree  [to what the prime minister said]. The prime minister insisted  that the SDPJ should cooperate. The budget formulation is the  responsibility of the cabinet, and the prime minister is in  charge of it. As such, I told him clearly that while I am not  referring to the budget formulation per se, I cannot agree to  the substance of his explanation. Based on that stand, I am now  announcing a statement by the party.    Prime Minister Hosokawa today announced the government's  basic policy on a tax system reform which will become the basis  for formulating the 1994 budget. The policy proposes  instituting, in lieu of the consumption tax, a 7-percent public  welfare tax in 1997 as a measure to follow 6 trillion yen in tax  cuts -- including 5.3 trillion yen to be cut from the income tax  and residential tax. Our party is unable to agree to this.    While the tax hike plan is proposed as being the  introduction  of a public welfare tax, there is virtually no difference  between it and the consumption tax. Now that the government is  being urged to cut taxes as an immediate measure to stimulate  the economy, it is wrong to attach a much bigger tax increase,  even if it is imposed three years later. The unpopular effects  of the consumption tax would not be corrected by the public  welfare tax.    Our party has proposed that a specific tax whose revenues  would be earmarked for welfare be instituted and further  discussions be carried out on the tax rate and on when it should  take effect, but our proposal has not been accepted. It is  truly regrettable that Prime Minister Hosokawa persisted with  the Finance Ministry-led tax reform proposal. Our party  believes that a tax system reform must be premised on the  assumption that the people agree to it, and it must be one that  takes a balance of income, assets, and consumption into account  and that is appropriate for the era of the aged population and  internationalization.    As far as the consumption tax is concerned, in view of the  history of how the system came to be adopted in the first place  and of its defects, we have pointed out the need to carry out  another review of it -- including the possibility of abolishing  it altogether -- concerning a reform. As for its bearing on the  income tax cut, the proposal to raise the rate is not a wise  alternative even when considering the existing poor level of  consumption.    The policy on a tax system reform announced by Prime  Minister  Hosokawa does not accept this stand of our party, which is a  member of the ruling coalition. The process of reaching an  agreement on it has been very inadequate as well. If Prime  Minister Hosokawa incorporates the tax hike plan in the budget  plan to be introduced at the cabinet meeting, SDPJ cabinet  members will not support it. Moreover, it would become extremely  difficult for our party to cooperate with the government as a  coalition member.</p>

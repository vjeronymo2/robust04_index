			<p>BFN     [Text] Military Court investigators in Lebanon have  interrogated Lebanese Army Sergeant Sharfan Bulus and two former  members of the disbanded Lebanese Forces accused of plotting to  kill President Ilyas al-Hirawi.    Lebanese judiciary sources say that the Military Court will  try Ghassan Tuma, head of the Lebanese Forces' security  apparatus, in absentia. Tuma asked Sergeant Bulus, a bomb  expert working at the Presidential Palace, about the possibility  of planting a bomb, the target of which would be the president,  in a flower vase, a car, or a telephone set, according to the  same sources.</p>

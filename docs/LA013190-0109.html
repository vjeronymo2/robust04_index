			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS;  </P> <P> NEW WELFARE OFFICE TO SERVE S. COUNTY  </P> <P> A new welfare office to serve poor and elderly residents in South County will  open April 1 near La Paz Road and McIntyre Street.  </P> <P> Financing the office became a priority in September after an attempt by county  officials to close down the small welfare office in San Juan Capistrano caused  a public outcry. Those opposing the closure said it would force the poor to  make the long trip to the county welfare office in Costa Mesa. The San Juan  Capistrano office was closed for less than a week.  </P> <P> According to budget documents, the net cost to establish the new office will be  $120,000. Ten new staff members will be needed.  </P> <P> The action for the additional tax funds for the office came Tuesday during the  County Board of Supervisors midyear review of the 1989-90 budget.  </P> <P> County welfare officials said they originally decided to close the Capistrano  facility because the three staffers were overwhelmed by the workload and the  welfare recipients could be better served at the larger Costa Mesa office.  </P> <P> "This board action provides for the reorganization of the Social Services  Agency staff, so services can be provided at the South County facility," said  Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose 5th District includes Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> The new office will offer Medi-Cal services for disabled, elderly and  low-income residents. It also will offer assistance to Aid to Families with  Dependent Children recipients, those receiving food stamps and immediate help  for the homeless and their families. The office will include child abuse  response workers.  </P> <P> The 6,000-square-foot facility has already been leased by the county and will  be ready to open in about 60 days.  </P> <P> "The voluntary agencies and many of the South County cities have been strong  advocates for a regional county facility to which they could refer residents  needing help," Riley said. "I am excited that we will now have a permanent  program in place."  </P> <P> County figures show that more than 600 welfare recipients live in the southern  part of the county.  </P> <P> In another matter, supervisors said that in two weeks they will tackle the  financial problem of trying to increase the number of sheriff's deputies  patrolling unincorporated areas of South County.  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he is confident a plan will be worked out to  add deputies in South County, which has experienced an 18% population increase  in each of the last four years.  </P> <P> Hiring 54 more deputies could cost $3.6 million a year, an earlier report said,  although a less expensive option would be to hire eight unsworn officers and 20  sworn deputies at an annual cost of $1.2 million.

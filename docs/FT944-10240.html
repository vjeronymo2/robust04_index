			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ScottishPower signs joint National Grid deal ScottishPower said yesterday that together with Scottish Hydro-Electric it had signed an agreement with the National Grid to increase the capacity of the England-Scotland interconnector by more than a third. Mr Ian Preston, chief executive, said the interconnector increase from 1,600MW to 2,200MW would mean that the company could export 'well over 30 per cent' of the electricity it produced from 1997, when the improved facility is operating fully. The announcement accompanied a 6 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 122.9m. The interim dividend is raised 10.2 per cent to 4.55p, payable from earnings per share in the six months to September 30 of 11.01p, a 2 per cent improvement. Earnings were depressed by an increase in the tax charge from 24 to 27 per cent. This compares with 26 per cent for the whole of last year. Turnover rose 9.6 per cent to Pounds 733m. Mr Preston said there were no plans to implement a share buy-back programme. 'We are not short of good opportunities to invest funds and enhance shareholder value,' he said, citing the company's telecommunications, retailing and gas interests as examples. Asked if the company was considering takeovers or mergers with regional power companies in England and Wales Mr Preston said: 'We have ruled nothing out'. A reduction of 300 in core staff levels to 5,500 held employee costs at Pounds 75m (Pounds 74m). Retailing profits fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.8m following the acquisition of 50 Clydesdale stores which it has been refurbishing. The company said the stores were back in service and exceeding expectations. It expects to better last year's retail profits of Pounds 7.4m. Debt amounted to Pounds 18m, with gearing of 1.8 per cent. Mr Ian Russell, finance director, said he expected gearing to be close to double figures by the year-end. COMMENT ScottishPower's problem is that, like Scottish Hydro-Electric, it is more tightly regulated than companies south of the border and its ability to outshine them in profit or dividend growth is constrained. It is seeking to distinguish itself by building shareholder value, rather than distributing it through share buybacks and one-off dividends. Laudable though diversification into 'utility-related' business may be, it has yet to prove itself: annual retailing profits will be closely scrutinised. ScottishPower's advantages include the expanded interconnector, which could have a significant effect on profits, and the fact that it has less to fear from a Labour government penalising over-profitable utilities. The shares are trading on a prospective yield of 4.8 per cent, assuming a full-year dividend of 13.65p, and are fairly rated.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Russian parliament set to challenge Yeltsin: Showdown will threaten reform programme THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday set the stage for a showdown with President Boris Yeltsin over who holds power in Russia in a move which threatens his reform programme. The parliament rejected Mr Yeltsin's proposals for a power-sharing deal and voted to summon an emergency session of Russia's supreme legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies, next Wednesday, to debate the constitutional crisis. The move came amid signs that the congress, which meets only occasionally, would also seek to cancel a referendum on power-sharing, to which it agreed in December. If the congress blocked both options for Mr Yeltsin to cut the bloated legislature inherited from Soviet days - either through constitutional change or by referendum - Mr Yeltsin would have little choice but to call a personal plebiscite seeking the support of the Russian people. Such a move, without the backing of the congress, would carry little weight constitutionally. However, Mr Yeltsin has suggested that it would at least show who the people support. He has even hinted that he would consider emergency powers if a power-sharing deal did not follow from the plebiscite. The president's lawyers already appear to be preparing the way for him to hold the plebiscite: they warned deputies that they would lose their legal right to any say over the referendum if they reneged on their December vote to hold one in the first place. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, told deputies earlier that Mr Yeltsin's proposals for a truce over power-sharing were not final: the issue was whether they wanted an agreement at all. The answer from parliament was no. Mr Shumeiko also told the parliament that Mr Yeltsin wanted the referendum to ask three questions, which touch on the main issues of the day: Should there be private ownership of land? Should a new constitution be adopted by a constituent assembly (as opposed to the existing congress)? Should the highest branch of legislative power be a two-chamber legislative assembly? But, with some regions threatening not to stage a referendum at all, Mr Yeltsin knows that a vote would be a high-risk gamble. However, he has virtually no alternative, pending an 11th-hour Russian compromise, to save the reforms and his credibility. Apart from asking the parliament to stick to legislative functions, Mr Yeltsin has proposed that the central bank and the state statistics committee be transferred from parliamentary to government control. He also wants an end to tinkering with the existing Soviet-era constitution until a constituent assembly approves a new constitution. In the meantime he is seeking the suspension of Article 104 under which congress is 'the supreme organ of state power'. Mr Yeltsin also wants to abolish the system of state property funds, which answer to the legislative branch and are supposed to share the task of privatisation with the government's privatisation committees.

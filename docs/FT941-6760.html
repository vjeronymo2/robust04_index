			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (8): Earning power has dropped - The mining industry Jamaica's mining industry, traditionally tied to bauxite ore, is contemplating a new and potentially lucrative frontier. There are whispers in the international gold industry that the island may contain commercially exploitable deposits. In the past six months government officials have spoken with more than passing confidence of the impending opening of a mine. Companies involved in exploration in the island are not yet so sure. Orvana Minerals of Vancouver, Canada, reported that an exploration study had confirmed the existence of a 3.3 kilometre-long mineralised zone with between 2m and 6m tonnes of gold bearing ore in Jamaica's central interior region. Orvana bought the concession from BHP Minerals, the Australian-US miner, but later concluded that the mineralised area did not contain a commercially exploitable deposit, and that further exploration is needed. While awaiting conclusion of these studies, the island's mining sector is preoccupied with the impact on the bauxite industry of the soft aluminium market. Flooding of the market by the Russian Republic, which has depressed prices for the metal, has limited growth in mining and refining. As in other countries, the industry also fears an adverse impact from the US decision to reduce its strategic stockpile by selling relatively small quantities at prices about one third of those being asked by the ore producers. The effects on the industry of weak international demand are becoming painfully clear. Bauxite ore production last year was 11.2m tonnes, 0.7 per cent less than 1992, while exports of crude bauxite of 4m tonnes were 1.4 per cent less than in 1992, according to the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. 'The absence of strong growth in local output is a clear indication of the overall weak position of the world aluminium industry which is suffering from a supply demand imbalance and depressed prices,' says Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting managing director of the institute. He adds: 'Jamaica's bauxite and alumina production, and earnings from the industry, reflect also a high level of output of primary aluminium in all the producing countries, especially by the members of the former Soviet Union, and the reluctance of producers to curtail production to correct the oversupply.' The economy is feeling the effects in a decline in the industry's earnings. These fell to Dollars 529m last year, down 8.3 per cent on the 1992 earnings, and about Dollars 200m less than in 1991. Under agreements with miners and refiners operating in the island, earnings from bauxite and alumina are pegged to the international prices for aluminium. Earnings have also been depressed by a steady depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, with mining and refining companies spending less to meet local costs. Conventional wisdom holds that the industry is going through another of its cycles of slump and recovery, and that prices and demand will harden when the market stabilises, but there is increasing concern in the industry that it could suffer longer term if miners and refiners are forced to reconsider a Dollars 500m investment programme planned for the next seven years. As the world's third largest producer of bauxite ore, after Australia and Guinea, Jamaica has proven reserves which will last 200 years at current rates of recovery. Much is to be gained economically by getting out and selling as much of the ore as possible. According to Mr Carlton Davis, chairman of the Bauxite Institute, there is a conscious attempt to export less and refine more, allowing the economy to benefit from the value added in refining. 'The current state of the market might lead some companies to reconsider their capital programmes, but in times like these one prepares to meet an upturn in the market.' The aim of the Jamaican industry is to lift refinery capacity to 5m tonnes per year by the year 2000. The Jamalco refinery in central Jamaica, owned jointly by the island's government and the Aluminum Company of America, is being expanded to a rated capacity of 1m tonnes per year at a cost of about Dollars 60m. The refinery is producing 700,000 tonnes per year, but there are already plans of further expansion which could lift its capacity to 2m tonnes per year. Alumina Partners of Jamaica, owned by Kaiser of the US and Hydro Aluminum of Norway, is spending Dollars 200m to increase the output from the island's largest refinery to 1.5m tonnes per year - and then to 2m tonnes by the turn of the century. Two refineries operated by Alcan of Canada, with a combined capacity of 1.1m tonnes per year, are being refurbished to lift output to 1.5m tonnes. Mr Davis says that the plants could be further expanded to produce 2m tonnes per year, using a grade of ore which was not yet being processed by the company. While there is optimism that the state of the industry will not adversely affect these expansion plans, two ventures have been reconsidered. The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago had been discussing the construction of an aluminium smelter in Trinidad, using a 'modular' system, starting with a small plant and enlarging in stages to meet market demand. Both governments were considering starting with a 'module' of 55,000 tonnes per year. This project is not now being given priority because of the state of the market, and uncertainty over the cost of the local natural gas which would fuel the plant. The industry's plans also included the construction of a caustic soda plant to reduce the reliance on imports to meet part of the demand for 300,000 tonnes per year for the refineries. The project for a 50,000 tonnes per year plant has been set back, Mr Davis says, because of a significant drop in world prices of caustic soda. But there seems to be sufficient confidence in the industry that the recovery will come, and that when it does, Jamaica should be ready to take advantage of firmer prices and new markets.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise setback The failure of Enterprise Oil's bid to absorb fellow oil exploration group Lasmo saw the former's shares wilt under heavy selling pressure following a welter of criticism in the weekend press. Enterprise shares were the worst performers in the FT-SE 100 list, closing 9 1/2 lower at 389p. Turnover of 6.1m shares was the fourth highest this year. Dealers said the market had taken Enterprise's failure in the bid battle very badly, and added that there had been growing criticism of Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive and viewed by the market as the architect of the bid strategy. A number of brokers were said to be recommending a switch out of Enterprise and into Lasmo, notably Kleinwort Benson and Nomura, a move which helped Lasmo shares move up 3 to 139p on heavy turnover of 13m. Nomura said: 'The clear message of the Enterprise bid is that Lasmo is undervalued in relation to Enterprise.' Other analysts, however, said there was a danger that selling of Enterprise could be overdone. 'It was the terms of the offer that was given a vote of no confidence, rather than Enterprise as a company,' said one. He added that all the bad news that could possibly emerge on Enterprise in the short term had done so, by courtesy of Lasmo. 'The bad news is all in the price,' he said.</p>

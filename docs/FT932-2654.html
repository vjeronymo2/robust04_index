			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (4): Voters look for new faces to support - Christopher Bobinski considers the shifting political alliances in the run-up to September's elections POLAND faces 10 weeks of frenetic electioneering and pre-election alliance-forming among a plethora of small parties in the run-up to general elections on September 19. However, President Lech Walesa's decision to dissolve parliament last month, after opposition deputies passed a vote of no confidence in the the six-party coalition led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, was generally well received by the electorate. Poles had increasingly come to see the two chambers of parliament - the 460 seat lower house, or Sejm, which legislates and appoints governments, and the 100 seat senate - as little more than self-centred talking shops, unwilling or unable to address their day-to-day concerns, which centre on the prospect of further job losses, a continuing low wage regime and uncertainty about the future of the education, health and welfare safety net put in place by the communists, now unravelling at a pace which seems frightening to many. The popular mood suggests that voters, irritated by politicians whom they feel have lost touch with the grass roots, will be looking for new faces to support this autumn. And for the moment it appears that President Walesa is thinking of providing such candidates. Already he and his aides have begun to talk of a new movement for reform. 'A kind of non-party movement for reform has to established which would act as a counterweight to other forces,' Mr Walesa said after mass one Sunday earlier this month on the steps of St Brigid's Church in Gdansk. The site - a Solidarity shrine, which the president had shunned lately  - was deliberately chosen. It had been the place from whence, in the final years of communist rule, Mr Walesa had led and encouraged his supporters in the old anti-communist Solidarity movement. 'Nominate people whom neither you or I will be ashamed of, and I'll have my photograph taken with them,' he said, seeking to capture the mood of those days with a reference to Solidarity's posters in the 1989 election (Poland's first free ballot.) 'There is a chance to reverse everything that was bad over the past four years. Choose deputies who see the poverty of the pensioners and the activities of the gangsters and I will work with them,' he told the crowd - with a populist spin which, as he knows, any successful campaign in Poland needs. President Walesa's move to put a strong group of loyal supporters into parliament may work; he retains the support of that part of the electorate which originally voted for him in the 1990 presidential election. But it leaves the established parties, bereft of funds and stunned by the sudden decision to dissolve parliament and call elections, with some difficult choices. Their task is made more difficult by the new election law, passed by the outgoing chamber at the last minute, which bars the way into parliament to those parties which fail to get 5 per cent of the national vote - 8 per cent for coalitions. This is likely to restrict entry to about eight groups. The governing coalition parties running the caretaker government decided to stay together in the cabinet room. They are talking about running separate campaigns, but they have agreed a 'non aggression pact' during the campaign, to smooth governmental caretaking. This is expected to enhance the already strong electoral appeal of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister, and the Democratic Union (UD) party of which she is a member. The Democratic Union, which groups some of Solidarity's historic leaders, is seen from abroad as 'sound' on monetary and privatisation issues. On social policies it tends to lean to social democratic options. Until now it has been able to rely on a solid 15 per cent of the electorate, mainly the intelligentsia - a base which may be eroded, as teachers and doctors turn their back on a government committed to holding public servants' pay within strict budgetary limits. It was this issue which led to the present crisis. The Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) a free market group and another coalition member, is the most likely to work together with the UD during the campaign, and afterwards to form a government. But it will be the right wing, catholic, nationalist Christian National Union (ZChN), the third of the main coalition partners, which will find staying in the government and running a separate campaign the most onerous. Outside the coalition, the parties slot into several segments. The former Communist party, renamed the Social Democrats (SdRP) can be expected to push its electoral support up into double digits, winning the votes of the disillusioned as well as diehard supporters of the ancien regime. The PSL, a farmers' party, survived the postwar years by collaborating with the communists. It stands to do well in the countryside and small towns where a disaffected 40 per cent lives. Another group aiming to harvest the protest vote is the anti-communist Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN). Its right-wing populist rhetoric should win it seats in the next parliament. The smaller right wing parties which, unlike the ZChN, have consistently opposed not only the government but also President Walesa, pose one of the larger questions. They all charge that the ruling establishment has blocked attempts to purge parliament and the administration of those who had formerly worked with the communist police. Many of their supporters remain convinced that former communists continue to run Poland, in conjunction with their erstwhile opponents from the Solidarity movement. 'Poland - time for a change', the slogan encapsulating the programme of one groups, the Centre Agreement, could have some appeal. But unless all these separate parties form an electoral pact, none will transcend the electoral barrier. The hope is that the new election law, by limiting entry into parliament to fewer parties, will stabilise government over the next few years and prevent a repetition of Mr Jan Olszewski' experience. Asked, at the start of his premiership, if his government would fall, he replied: 'It is already falling, but very, very slowly.'</p>

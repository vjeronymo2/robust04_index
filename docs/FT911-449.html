			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Brazil in interest backlog accord Brazil should be able to finalise within a few days an accord with its leading commercial banks on the settlement of an Dollars 8bn interest backlog, according to Mr William Rhodes, the senior Citicorp executive who leads bank negotiations with the country, Stephen Fidler writes. If this happens, negotiations on its medium- and long-term bank debt could begin next month, he told a conference in London. The agreement on interest arrears will need ratification of Brazil's senate and 95 per cent of creditor banks.</p>

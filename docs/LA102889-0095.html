			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CABINET CHAOS OPENS DEEP WOUNDS FOR THATCHER;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: 'SHE WILL BE A LESS POWERFUL PRIME MINISTER FOR MONTHS,' PREDICTS ONE  EXPERT.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher "has never been worried about people loving  her," one of her closest aides boasted to a small audience of foreigners  earlier this week. She has strong views and says what she thinks. At the risk  of sounding corny, the aide elaborated, you could characterize her philosophy  as: "To thine own self be true."  </P> <P> That depiction seemed particularly ironic less than 48 hours later, after a  duplicitous bit of personnel management by Thatcher blew up in the surprise  resignation of her longtime chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson.  </P> <P> The resignation triggered a wholesale shake-up of top Cabinet posts, brought  turmoil to the financial markets, and inspired some of the harshest criticism  of Thatcher in the decade she has been in power.  </P> <P> The Bank of England intervened heavily Friday morning to stop a slump in the  value of the pound triggered by uncertainty over the country's future economic  policy. Prices also fell sharply on the London Stock Exchange, despite  Thatcher's assurance that government policies will continue "precisely as they  were, so we shall have complete continuity."  </P> <P> The British press was filled Friday with talk of political "crisis," even  though few here see the prime minister in any immediate danger of losing her  job. Still, according to many analysts, the affair has opened deep wounds which  at the very least will diminish her political maneuvering room.  </P> <P> "She will be a less powerful prime minister for months, or possibly right up to  the next election," said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex  University and a respected political commentator.  </P> <P> On Friday, the Independent titled its lead editorial, "The Prime Minister Who  Betrayed Her Own Government." It concluded that while she may remain in office,  "her great days are over."  </P> <P> Even the tabloid Sun, Britain's largest-circulation newspaper and ardently  pro-Thatcher, conceded that her position was "inevitably . . . shaken" by the  affair.  </P> <P> Lawson resigned Thursday after Thatcher refused his demand that she fire Alan  Walters, her personal economic adviser, over public comments critical of the  chancellor's policies. Within a couple of hours, Walters also resigned and  Thatcher had a new finance minister, John Major.  </P> <P> Although Lawson may have reacted partly to hurt pride, the affair goes much  deeper than that. Walters had been speaking out for at least 18 months, since  long before Thatcher hired him as a $50,000-a-year, part-time adviser last May.  His position was thus seen as a clear slight to Lawson, who is the Cabinet  officer supposedly in charge of government economic policy.  </P> <P> In fact, Thatcher has had policy differences with Lawson for months, and  Walters' presence at No. 10 Downing Street was a constant reminder of the  tension.  </P> <P> "Here we have a chancellor whose position has been rendered intolerable by an  agent of the leader," Thatcher biographer Hugo Young wrote in the Guardian.  "Her taunting of Lawson, by failing instantly to repudiate Walters, drove the  last big man out" of her Cabinet.  </P> <P> The conservative Daily Telegraph, in an otherwise sympathetic editorial, chided  the prime minister: "Leadership, in which she excels, must not degenerate into  dominance, intolerance, and a simple refusal to work with those she has  appointed to serve her. Even before the Lawson decision, there was mounting  evidence in the country of a certain restlessness with her style."  </P> <P> The Financial Times recalled that just three months ago Thatcher shunted aside  her longtime foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe. It said that with Lawson's  departure, she has managed to alienate two important contributors to the  revolutionary changes known as "Thatcherism."  </P> <P> "From being a government of people committed to a set of coherent, radical and  timely ideas, it has now become a government committed to the prime minister  herself," the newspaper said. "As she has become more pre-eminent, her  government has become much more vulnerable."  </P> <P> What baffled many was the way this most determined of prime ministers was  apparently so indecisive when it came to a policy conflict between two members  of her governing team. Similarly, two years ago, she allowed a Cabinet dispute  over how best to save Westland, an ailing government helicopter manufacturer,  to fester to the point of rupture. Two of her ministers, Michael Heseltine and  Leon Brittan, resigned in that fracas.  </P> <P> Actually, wrote biographer Young, the Westland affair and Lawson's resignation  underline a common Thatcher leadership tactic that has now received "its  devastating comeuppance."  </P> <P> Young calls it "covert distancing" -- endorsing a policy in such a way that  there always remains a suspicion that she opposes it. "The gift (that her  tactic) bestowed, of excusing her for policy failures, was sometimes thought to  reveal her political brilliance," he wrote.  </P> <P> It works with people as well as policies, said Essex University's King, who  said in an interview that Thatcher has a habit of "referring to other members  of her own government as 'them' and 'they' as if she didn't have anything to do  with it."  </P> <P> In the aftermath of Lawson's embarrassing resignation, King predicted, Thatcher  will be forced to revert "to something more like the British norm of collective  leadership."  </P> <P> The Independent's highly regarded political columnist Peter Jenkins noted that  the immediate policy issue underlying Lawson's departure was a dispute over  full British membership in the European Monetary System. This is a step that  Thatcher is loathe to take because it might amount to ceding partial control  over her country's economic policy to the European Community.  </P> <P> "Europe has been the issue underlying most of Mrs. Thatcher's biggest errors,"  Jenkins wrote. "Europe was at the root of the Westland affair, which in 1986  provoked the resignation from the Cabinet of Michael Heseltine and, by her own  admission, could have brought her down.  </P> <P> "It was Europe which drove her to excesses which helped to lose her the  elections to the European Parliament last June. Europe was the issue on which  she sacked . . . (Howe) from the Foreign Office last summer, badly upsetting  her party in the process."  </P> <P> The question of Britain's future role in a more united Europe "is the big,  seismic issue of the 1990s," agreed John Barnes, a lecturer in government at  the London School of Economics, "and it's one the Tories are ill-equipped to  handle at the moment."  </P> <P> Barnes, who is an acknowledged expert on the Conservatives, said in an  interview that "if Mrs. Thatcher withdrew (from office) at this point, there'd  be a huge sigh of relief" among many in the party. However, he said, he sees  little chance of her stepping down voluntarily. Meanwhile, "the only way there  would be a coup against her in the Conservative party is if all the possible  successors agreed on one of them," he said.  </P> <P> That is an unlikely possibility, King agreed. "Who is going to take risks with  his political career to make someone else prime minister?" he asked.  </P> <P> But with the revitalized, opposition Labor Party already looking more like a  credible alternative than at any time in the last decade, and Thatcher's  government slipping in the polls, Lawson's startling departure clearly adds to  the prime minister's troubles.  </P> <P> As the Guardian said Friday: "Politically, this is one hell of a mess."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHO'S WHO IN CABINET CRISIS  </P> <P> Margaret Thatcher, in midst of the worst political crisis in her decade in  power, shuffles her Cabinet.  </P> <P> Nigel Lawson -- His resignation Thursday as chancellor of the exchequer  astonishes Parliament.  </P> <P> Alan Walters -- Thatcher's personal economic adviser, who feuded with Lawson,  also quits.  </P> <P> John Major -- A former Lawson assistant, he replaces his former boss in the  exchequer post.  </P> <P> Douglas Hurd -- He moves from the Home Office to head the Foreign Office.  </P> <P> David Waddington -- Parliament's chief business manager, he replaces Hurd as  Home Secretary.  </P></p>

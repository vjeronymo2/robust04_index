			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: San Franciscans abroad - Music On Wednesday the San Francisco Symphony played the Festival Hall, with a resounding report. The orchestra is a model of professionalism, high technical competence and single-minded unanimity, and in Herbert Blomstedt it has a most judicious music director. If you scent reservations in the offing, it is only because of the programme: as the main work they chose Bruckner's Fourth Symphony, the 'Romantic', where something else might have been better for our side of the Atlantic. They began with John Harbison's new Oboe Concerto, written very specifically for their first oboe William Bennett, and first heard last December in their home town. Harbison's musical idiom is 'accessible' middle-of-the-road (he was a Boris Blacher pupil), which doesn't preclude individual ingenuities. The concerto proved quizzical and affable. It had unmistakable tunes, plenty of lyrical and virtuoso exercise for Bennett (who delivered it with charm) and appealing jazz-effects. The composer has an ear for offbeat instrumental combinations: he rings clever changes on muted brass, and creates whimsical effects with bassoons and an alto sax. Given the dearth of concerti for oboe it may be gratefully taken up by other performers. Bruckner Four is tougher stuff. The orchestra performed it with the utmost concentration, answering precisely to Blomstedt's every request, with each section playing like a single musician. On the one hand, this conductor had a firm grasp on the proportions of the work, set it out in broad paragraphs, chose unimpeachable tempi and drew high-definition, carefully nuanced 'solos' from his violas, high cellos and violins. The opening was lovely: a pianissimo thrill in the air, unhurried eloquence in the first brass phrases. On the other hand - doubts set in with the second subject, which arrived without a trace of its natural Austrian lilt. For all his admirable tempi, Blomstedt's bar-to-bar beat was severely unbending. The big paragraphs needed more freedom to breathe and speak, and often seemed straitjacketed, even frog-marched, by the unrelenting rhythm. Since brass entries in forte struck like mailed fists (more aggressive than expressive), clocking them in so metronomically evoked the parade-ground rather than the symphony. Their impact nearly always obliterated the other orchestral voices - though that might have resulted from unfamiliarity with the dry acoustic of the Festival Hall. The net effect was too bald, too hard-edged and unrelaxed for expansive middle-period Bruckner. I think Bruckner's autumnal place in a precise middle-European tradition may be hopelessly remote from the Pacific coast of America.</p>

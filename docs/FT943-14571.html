			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Mr Atlantic helps fans get into the groove - Ahmet Ertegun says Major League Soccer will succeed in the US On the shelves behind Ahmet Ertegun's desk sit dozens of framed photographs of the sort you might expect to see in the Manhattan office of Atlantic Records' co-founder and chairman. There is a picture of Ertegun with Quincy Jones, the legendary record producer, and one of Ertegun arm-in-arm with Mick Jagger. Yet on the top shelf is a prominently displayed picture that has no connection with the worlds of rhythm and blues, jazz and soul in which Ertegun has spent most of his working life. It is a photograph of Ertegun holding a cumbersome gold statuette instantly recognisable as the centrepiece of international sport's crown jewels - the World Cup trophy. In the picture, Ertegun is sporting the awed, slightly sheepish grin that any soccer fan might wear in the circumstances. But Ertegun is no ordinary soccer fan. He is a member of the World Cup 1994 organising committee. Ertegun, who is 70, earned his place on the committee for his efforts over the past 25 years in helping the roots of soccer grow in a seemingly infertile land. During the early 1970s, he and his late brother Nesuhi persuaded Warner Communications to provide the financial backing for a New York team - the Cosmos - to play in the North American Soccer League. For a few glorious years, the Erteguns, with the help of Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and other soccer greats, put the Cosmos and the NASL on to the American sports map, where it stayed until excessive spending and insufficient revenues plunged the league into bankruptcy and failure a decade ago. In spite of the unhappy ending, Ertegun remembers the days of the Cosmos fondly. He recounts a story about Beckenbauer's astonishment at finding himself dribbling the ball towards goal in his Cosmos debut while an announcer carefully explained the rules of the game to the crowd over the loudspeaker. But Ertegun is too busy enjoying this World Cup to dwell on the past. As someone who was always confident that the tournament would be a success, he is especially delighted with the large numbers of Americans who have attended the games. He says the television pictures which have shown stadiums filled with colourful, partisan fans following their national teams have not told the full story. 'It always looks as if there are more foreigners than Americans, but there aren't. The foreigners are very visible, and very audible. You know: 'Ooh, aah, Paul McGrath. Ooh, aah, Paul McGrath.' Right? You hear that.' Yet, he says, referring to a popular US player, 'there's no 'Ooh, aah, Alexi Lalas. Ooh, aah, Alexi Lalas'.' Ertegun's point is that traditional soccer countries may not know it, but Americans have embraced the World Cup wholeheartedly - but not noisily. 'Soccer in America is a family sport,' he says. 'In Europe men go to see soccer, and they sometimes take their sons, if they're old enough. Here the whole family goes. They have picnics in the parking lot. The Americans view it as a nice day out.' But can a top-level US professional soccer league be founded on the enthusiasm of fans who view the game as a nice day out? Fifa awarded the World Cup to the US in the hope that the interest generated would provide the basis for a fully-fledged soccer league, one that would last longer than the ill-fated NASL. Ertegun is realistic about whether the World Cup legacy will sustain Major League Soccer, the new league planned for next year. But, he says, 'I'm not sure that a game between Tulsa and Buffalo will attract many viewers. We've got to build again from the ground up.' He believes the best American players should be allowed to play abroad, because it is only in the big European leagues that they can earn the kind of money which will start enticing young athletes away from mainstream American sports and into soccer. 'If some of our players playing abroad start to make a million bucks a year, we may see a lot of kids from the inner city hone their talents. 'Maybe we'll have some of those young men who can run 100m in under 10 seconds learn how to do the same with a ball between their feet. When that happens, we could have the world's greatest team.'</p>

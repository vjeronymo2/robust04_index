			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALEMANY MAKES MOST OF RUNNERS IN 9-6 WIN  </P> <P> Alemany High maintained control of the Del Rey League on Friday, outscoring  Loyola, 9-6, despite being outhit by the Cubs, 13-12, at Loyola.  </P> <P> The Indians stranded only four runners in improving to 11-8 overall, 5-1 in  league play, 1 1/2 games ahead of St. Francis. Loyola (6-9, 3-3) is in third.  </P> <P> But for some Alemany seniors, the game was more than just another step toward  the league championship.  </P> <P> "It was our last time playing at this place and we wanted to win real bad,"  senior Ray Cano said. "The whole team was pumped up."  </P> <P> However, Cano was a little more excited than the rest.  </P> <P> The left fielder was three for four -- including a game-clinching two-run home  run -- and finished with five runs batted in. Loyola pitcher Eric Bacura fed  Cano a changeup in the sixth inning and Cano deposited it over the left-field  fence.  </P> <P> "I was sort of expecting an off-speed pitch and he gave me an off-speed pitch  right in the strike zone," Cano said. "So what else can you do with a pitch  like that but hit it over the fence?"  </P> <P> The home run boosted Alemany's lead to 8-5. The Indians added an insurance run  when Jon Beauchemin followed Cano with a solo blast over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> The Indians took advantage of two errors by third baseman Ryan Lefebvre in the  first inning to score two unearned runs. Alemany increased its advantage to 3-0  in the second when Leo Tejada doubled to center and scored on a single by Cano.  </P> <P> Loyola pulled to within 3-1 in the second when designated-hitter David Vida led  off the inning with a single, advanced to third on a single to center by Pat  Gilhooly and scored on an overthrow.  </P> <P> The Cubs went in front, 4-3, an inning later on Vida's three-run homer.  </P> <P> But the lead was short-lived. With two out in the Alemany fourth, Brian Swanson  reached first on an error and leadoff batter Greg Thompson bunted for a single.  </P> <P> Both scored on a double by Cano, who advanced to third on a passed ball and  scored on wild pitch to give the Indians a 6-4 lead.  </P> <P> The Cubs pulled to within 6-5 in the fifth when Lefebvre, aboard on a bunt  single, scored on a fielder's choice.  </P> <P> After Cano and Beauchemin homered to push Alemany in front by four in the  sixth, Loyola loaded the bases with three consecutive singles in its half of  the inning.  </P> <P> Lefebvre's sacrifice fly scored pinch-runner Dan Dwyer, but Alemany pitcher Tom  Daniels (6-2) retired the next two batters to end the threat.  </P> <P> "He did a hell of a job getting out of that jam," Alemany Coach Jim Ozella said  of his pitcher.  </P> <P> Daniels, a senior right-hander, gave up 13 hits, but struck out seven and  walked one en route to a complete-game victory.  </P></p>

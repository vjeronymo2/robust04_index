			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Holland outclass Irish to end Charlton's dream Shrugging off criticism of their first-round form, Holland stirred memories of their heyday a generation ago by beating a bedraggled Ireland 2-0 in Orlando yesterday to take their place in the World Cup quarter-finals. Bergkamp and Jonk scored the first-half goals for Holland which ended Ireland's low-scoring run. The Irish tried to rally in the second half - a late goal by McGrath was disallowed - but their limitations had been exposed by a far sterner and more imaginative Dutch side. Bergkamp scored in the 11th minute and Jonk blasted home the second in the 41st. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper - extending his record of Irish caps to 77 - grappled with Jonk's searing 25-metre drive but failed to stop it. Holland's two-goal advantage was the least they deserved as their forwards constantly out-paced the Irish defence. Manager Dick Advocaat had flirted with the idea of fielding just two men up front but changed his mind. Overmars, whose place on the Dutch right flank had appeared most under threat, more than justified his inclusion. In the quarter-finals Holland meet the winners of last night's Brazil-US clash in Dallas.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: A raffish ex-minister of whom myths are made GENTLEMANLY, unpredictable, wealthy, sardonic, and brimming with self-confidence bordering on arrogance, Mr Alan Clark, the former defence minister, is a rich character in every sense of the word. Some of the stories about him may be apocryphal but he is the sort of raffish character who attracts and almost revels in myths about him. On becoming a minister he was supposed to have looked at the modest official car provided and remarked: 'You expect me to get in that?' before arranging for his own Jaguar to convey him with suitable dignity. Mr Clark often enraged others. He accused some European countries of 'running for the cellars' during the Gulf war and once referred to 'bongo-bongo land' during a discussion about immigration. He survived partly because he was close to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, who appreciated his quirkiness and maverick free-market zeal. After serving in the MoD and the DTI and following nearly 20 years in parliament, he stood down as MP for Plymouth Sutton at the general election  -and managed to infuriate his constituency party by making his announcement at the 11th hour. With the Commons now bereft of many of the strongest characters of the 1980s, he would perhaps have been too colourful a character to have enjoyed himself much longer.</p>

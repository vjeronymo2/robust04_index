			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> ARSON SUSPECTED IN FIRES ON UC IRVINE CAMPUS  </P> <P> Arson is suspected in two small fires that broke out on the UC Irvine campus  early Thursday morning, UCI officials reported. The blazes were quickly  extinguished and caused little damage.  </P> <P> Colleen Bentley-Adler, a spokeswoman for the university, said the first fire  broke out about 2:45 a.m. Thursday on the first floor of the university's  Administration Building. She said that boxes of financial-aid blank forms were  stacked beside a wall on the building's first floor and that someone apparently  set fire to the boxes.  </P> <P> The Orange County Fire Department doused the blaze before it could spread from  the stacked boxes, fire officials said. John Hamilton, a spokesman for the  County Fire Department, said damage to a wall and floor where the boxes were  situated was estimated at $1,000.  </P> <P> Bentley-Adler said police began a search around campus after the first fire was  discovered to see if any other blazes had been set. A second small fire was  found about 3:15 p.m. in a trash-storage area by a loading dock at the UCI  Social Science Laboratory, Bentley-Adler said. This fire also was quickly  extinguished and caused no damage, she said.  </P> <P> Bentley-Adler said the university has no idea why a person or persons ignited  the two fires. "We have no leads and no suspects," she said.  </P></p>

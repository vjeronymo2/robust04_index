			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tougher checks on pupil tests TOUGHER checks to ensure accurate marking of national curriculum tests were ordered yesterday by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. The move follows criticism by school inspectors, who found one in five results in last year's tests for seven-year-olds were inaccurate. Mr Patten also said teachers would be given two or three weeks longer to conduct the tests on seven-year-olds next year - they must now be completed four weeks before the end of the summer term.</p>

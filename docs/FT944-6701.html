			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Aid plan to back Irish peace European Union leaders are expected to agree substantial new aid to bolster the Northern Irish peace plan at their summit in Essen on December 9-10, senior EU officials said yesterday. The 'peace grants', targeted mainly on creating jobs and improving infrastructure, could total Ecu625m (Pounds 490m) in new money between 1995 and 1999. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, briefed foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on the shape of the peace package, put together for the whole of Northern Ireland and the six bordering counties of the Irish Republic. The Commission is expected to agree a final proposal for Essen on December 7, and has been consulting widely at grassroots level in the pro-British Unionist and Irish nationalist communities in the province. Senior officials in London and Dublin say both governments endorse the initiative. 'It's virtually gift-wrapped for Essen,' one Irish official said. Brussels is suggesting an initial commitment of Ecu300m from the EU budget for 1995-97, with an extension of the same rate of new funding - Ecu100m a year - for a further two years if the scheme is working. About 80 per cent of this would go to Northern Ireland and the rest to the bordering counties. The UK and Ireland would contribute additional new money, worth 25 per cent of the new EU funds spent within their territory, for a total potential package of Ecu625m. Britain, which has clashed with the Commission in the past about the normal legal requirement to 'match' EU aid with 'additional', or genuinely new money, says there will be no repackaging of already committed funding for the province. Mr John Major, British prime minister, gave a public commitment in Belfast late last month that the UK would put in new funding to match extra EU grants. The EU has already committed Ecu1.23bn to Northern Ireland in 1994-99, under the structural funds aid programme, as well as Ecu20m a year to the multinational International Fund for Ireland.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Next Irish premier likely to be Reynolds MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the rebel former cabinet minister, looked set yesterday to become Ireland's next prime minister after his main rival decided to back him, Reuter reports from Dublin. Mr Charles Haughey, who has dominated Irish politics for a decade, agreed to step down on Thursday after accusations that he knew about the phone-tapping of two Dublin journalists in 1982. Mr Reynolds, 55, sacked by Mr Haughey last November after leading a failed party mutiny against the prime minister, is now likely to enjoy an easy road to victory after Mr Bertie Ahern, the man who replaced him as finance minister, decided not to contest the leadership. Mr Ahern, at 40 the youngest member of the cabinet, said: 'I think it's far less divisive to rally behind one leader and I am backing Albert.' He denied that his decision not to stand had been prompted by his admission that he had separated from his wife and backed divorce, which is banned in predominantly Roman Catholic Ireland. Mr Ahern, much praised for the budget he presented last week, said of his leadership ambitions: 'I worked on this for three days. Albert has been working on it for three years.' He added: 'After Albert Reynolds, I will be the next Taoiseach (prime minister).' The new leader will be picked by the 77 deputies in the ruling Fianna Fail party on Thursday. The winner needs to have a simple majority. Mr Reynolds said: 'I am becoming more confident with every day that passes.' Mr Ahern, who reckoned he had the support of about 32 deputies against 36 for Mr Reynolds, did not expect all his backers to switch to Mr Rey-nolds but said his former rival should win easily. The other candidates in the leadership race are the health minister Ms Mary O'Rourke, trying to become Ireland's first woman prime minister, and Mr Michael Woods, the agriculture minister, whose chances of victory as a compromise candidate always looked slim.

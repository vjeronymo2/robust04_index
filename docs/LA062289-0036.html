			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  LET'S EAT OUT: LOWER CALORIES, HIGH QUALITY OF LA FAMIGLIA FARE  </P> <P> The last time I was in La Famiglia in Beverly Hills I spotted Dino Martin  sitting at a booth digging into his gnocchi. Gnocchi? What's that we asked at  the time. That was almost 15 years ago. Now, of course, we know. We know all  about pasta all Checca, pesto and primavera, and all the new Italian dishes  that have happily entered our lives.  </P> <P> Back then, the cozy, comfy place was jam packed with gorgeous Westside people  and celebrities, the food was glorious and the price high. But who cared? We  were happy.  </P> <P> Well, I was back last week after a long absence and, lo, there was Dino Martin  sitting at the same booth digging into his gnocchi. So was his agent, Mort  Viner, who, says owner Joe Patti, lost 35 pounds eating his low-cal food. The  cozy and comfy clubby restaurant is still jam packed with gorgeous guys and  gals, the prices are still high and the food has risen to new heights of  achievement.  </P> <P> In fact, I stopped at La Famiglia because I heard Patti had been serving  low-cal, low-sodium, low-cholesterol Italian dishes. Bravo Patti. He's in tune,  he knows and he cares. And, more important, he's smart. He knows that already  many restaurants are moving toward the direction of dietary considerations. And  the sooner the better.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modern Cuisine  </P> <P> Patti was one of the first Italian restaurateurs to introduce modern Italian  cuisine back in the '70s, when Los Angeles was a wasteland of hanging Chianti  bottles, fake grapes and heavy tomato sauce. Patti's sophisticated neighborhood  restaurant has survived with flying colors, despite the high mortality rate of  neighborhood restaurants in Beverly Hills, perhaps because he's not only  keeping up but anticipating.  </P> <P> His health-conscious cooking came into the picture a few years ago, when his  eldest son developed a medical problem requiring careful attention to  preservatives and additives, fat, sodium and cholesterol. "I started reading  labels. Then I started checking our own food supplies and made changes," said  Patti.  </P> <P> The nice thing is that the menu doesn't ram "health food" down your throat. You  can pick anything from the menu and tell the waiter to keep it on the  low-cal/cholesterol/sodium -- or whatever -- slant. Just ask.  </P> <P> But there is also a group of specialita nostra dishes containing no butter or  flour that have been designated as healthful on the menu for those looking for  them outright; things like poached eggplant Parmigiana, which was as light as a  feather and absolutely the best I've eaten anywhere, the thin sheet of melted  cheese (low-fat, I trust) notwithstanding. There is also a poached whitefish,  pollo al vino bianco (poached chicken in wine) and vitello casalinga (veal made  Paillard-style: pounded thin and grilled) served with wonderfully fresh,  steamed vegetables also recommended for low-calorie dining. A shrimp scampi,  which is generally loaded with butter, is on the list too.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waiter Will Help  </P> <P> If it's low-cal/fat/cholesterol pasta you want, the waiter will guide you. On  one visit our waiter suggested pasta with fresh tomatoes (all Checca) or  primavera. I tried the primavera because of the extra vegetables you get on top  and it was splendid. Filling, yet fresh and light.  </P> <P> There is an idyllic steamed vegetable plate that looks like a Matisse painting.  If you're on a weight-loss diet, you can't go wrong there. A beautiful plate of  fresh asparagus was brought to the table with low-cal dressing, which was hard  to dissect and I forgot to ask about.  </P> <P> The grilled dishes are also a good bet if you're on a weight-reduction regimen.  They will make you feel pure while purging your body of oils, flours and  butters.  </P> <P> Well, halfway through the meal we cheated. I couldn't take my eyes off the  gnocchi on Dino Martin's plate. His was topped with a thick marinara sauce  reminiscent of the kind you get in the East Coast neighborhoods. "His family is  from Abruzzi and that's the way he likes it," said Patti. "But you can have it  with a lighter marinara sauce. Practically no oil. Want to try it?" What's a  little cheating among good friends, so I said, "OK." And I wasn't sorry. The  gnocchi, unlike the bullets I've bitten into in my time, were tiny pillows of  fluff. It was definitely one of the lightest gnocchi's I've had.  </P> <P> We tried La Famiglia for lunch earlier and ordered a wonderfully light, low-cal  chopped salad with poached chicken. You can have it with seafood or other meats  too. Also a good choice is the insalata nostra (house salad), made with hearts  of palm, green beans, mushrooms and lettuce in a dressing based on tomato and  balsamic vinegar. The poached white fish is another good choice. The menu is  flexible and so are the waiters, so ask and you shall receive.  </P> <P> For more casual lunching or dining (with price break), you can go next door to  Piccola, Patti's cafe where most all of the dishes offered in the restaurant  can also be ordered.  </P> <P> If you're dining with a non-dieter, he or she need not fear. There are plenty  of ways you can go hog-wild on calories. The special on the menu the night we  were there was osso buco. I would have killed to order it, but, of course,  refrained. There is also excellent bistecca peperonata (pepper steak), cutlets  Parmigiana, chicken alla cacciatori, steak and peppers, a number of fresh  pastas (including tortelllini with meat, cannelloni filled with chicken, beef  or veal, ravioli filled with chicken and risotta.  </P> <P> You have dry pastas topped with meat sauce, prosciutto and eggs, olive-caper  sauce, four cheeses, pepper and sausage, shrimp and clams and others. Fish  offerings (salmon with lemon and capers, sole with lemon butter, scampi with  tomato sauce and poached swordfish are among them. You can also order a broiled  live Maine lobster (at market value) if you are so inclined.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Price of Dining  </P> <P> Prices are not low, as we already warned. In fact, expect to pay anywhere from  $15.95 to $20.95 for pasta alone. The meats range in the mid-$20 and appetizers  under $10.  </P> <P> We were ready for dessert. There was plenty of room, having gone light on  dinner. The waiter, diplomatically overlooking our digression over gnocchi and  keeping in line with our pristine program of low-cal eating, suggested assorted  fresh fruit for dessert. But that wasn't exciting enough for Patti, who doesn't  miss a thing when he's around. He butted in with a suggestion to try melon with  berries. "No calories there," he said. "But how about creme caramel?"  </P> <P> "But that has cream," I said.  </P> <P> "No, it's made with low-fat milk," Patti said.  </P> <P> Well, that was yet another offer I couldn't refuse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> La Famiglia and Piccola, 453 and 455 N.

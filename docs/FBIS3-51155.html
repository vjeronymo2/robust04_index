			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Excerpt] Mining Minister Alejandro Hales yesterday  endorsed the suggestion of Juan Villarzu, the executive  president-designate of Codelco [Copper Corporation], that the  Armed Forces should be funded directly from the National  Treasury and not from 10 percent of net sales of copper.    After learning that different sectors of the country support  Villarzu's views, Hales stated that it would be advisable to  include appropriations for the Armed Forces in the National  Budget. "Nobody is seeking to deprive the Armed Forces of its  financing, rather that it should come from a more legitimate  source," he added.    The mining minister explained that the allotments derived  from the Reserved Law on Copper (No. 13196) -- which came into  effect during the military regime -- totalled $313 million in  1989, $287 million in 1990, $223 million in 1991, $204 million  in 1992, and $197 million in 1993. He noted that as last year's  allotment was lower than the $180 million minimum contemplated  in the law plus the Consumer Price Index readjustment, the total  for 1993 will be $210 million. "The National Treasury will have  to supplement the minimum payment with $30 million. This  financial obligation will not be defrayed by Codelco but by the  National Treasury," he said.

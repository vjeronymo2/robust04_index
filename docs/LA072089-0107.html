			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE LEAVES 3 VISITORS BITTER  </P> <P> Here we were, three women alone, away from home for the first time in many  years. Sent to beautiful Santa Monica to participate in a workshop by our home  company, US Health Care of Blue Bell, Pa., and conducted by Value Health  Services of Santa Monica. Away from our home and families for the first time in  many years and after spending a very intense day of workshops looking for a  pleasant evening at dinner and relaxation.  </P> <P> We were told of a very fine restaurant called Ivy at the Shore along Santa  Monica Beach. We decided to walk the short distance from our hotel, the Holiday  Inn Bay View on Pico Boulevard, to the restaurant to allow the cobwebs to  disappear as we strolled slowly to dinner. As out-of-towners, we were unaware  of the dangers that were ahead.  </P> <P> A few short blocks from our hotel, we encountered hundreds of derelicts and  homeless lying on the streets. More of them, as we approached, began accosting  us, begging for money, touching and pawing at us. As tourists, new to the area,  we became very frightened. We looked around for help and to our surprise we saw  a Santa Monica police officer across the street only a short distance away.  </P> <P> The three of us ran from the crowd that surrounded us and bolted for the safety  of the officer. Before we could explain our situation and ask for assistance,  the officer, Gary Hagerman, Badge No. 2577, whipped out his citation book and  stated that we had crossed the street against a red light and was going to  issue each of us a ticket in violation of the city code. As we desperately  tried to explain why we had crossed in such a hurry, Officer Hagerman refused  to listen. He proceeded to ask us for our driver's license or any other  identification so that he could properly issue us the citations. As this was  taking place, a crowd of derelicts gathered around as Officer Hagerman  proceeded in his official demeanor to ask us our names, addresses, color of  eyes, height, weight, hair color and the hotel we were staying. Never once did  he attempt to hear our dilemma or try to disperse the crowd that had gathered  to listen in.  </P> <P> After issuing us our citations, Officer Hagerman simply walked away, leaving us  again at our own disposal . . . alone and scared.  </P> <P> With this experience happening on our first evening in Santa Monica and with  six more days to go, we continued to feel in jeopardy so we decided that our  other evenings and free time would be spent somewhere else other than the  "community" of Santa Monica. Being away from the street people and the "police  state" of Santa Monica proved to be a much more pleasant experience for us all.  </P> <P> Yesterday, I received a copy of the citation and the summons from the Municipal  Court of Santa Monica. This reminder of our stay has added to the bad taste and  surly response we received from the officer we had fled to for "help." Enclosed  find a copy of the check for $10 asked for by the good people of the Santa  Monica courts for our "misconduct." I hope that this money goes to a fund that  will help perpetuate the good name of Santa Monica so that other tourists and  out-of-towners will continue to receive the kindness and understanding that we  received while we were there.  </P> <P> It is inconceivable to me that in this day and age in America, a citizen  seeking help and finding a police officer would get the kind of treatment that  we received that evening. Officer Hagerman should be placed on a pedestal by  the city officials of Santa Monica and rewarded with a citation for duty "below  and beyond" the call of duty. If all of the officers of Santa Monica serve  their community as well, I feel sorry for the citizens of the city. Santa  Monica deserves better!  </P> <P> KATHY COHEN  </P> <P> Plymouth Meeting, Pa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Editor's note: Asked about the incident, Santa Monica Police spokesman Sgt.  John Miehley said that according to Hagerman, Cohen and her friends made no  mention at the time of being harassed by people on the street.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR-PLANT'S NEIGHBORS AWAIT PRELIMINARY DATA ON EXPOSURE LEVEL;  </P> <P> NORTHWEST: THE FIRST RESULTS ARE DUE FOR RELEASE IN APRIL. BUT OFFICIALS FEAR  THAT RESIDENTS WILL MISINTERPRET THE REPORT ABOUT HANFORD NUCLEAR RESERVATION'S  IMPACT ON THE AREA.  </P> <P> Scientists studying what the radiation exposure levels around the Hanford  Nuclear Reservation were during the Cold War are trying to decide how to break  the news of their preliminary findings to Northwest residents.  </P> <P> The initial announcement of results from the first-ever study on the question  is due in April, and the task of releasing the data is fraught with dangers of  misinterpretation.  </P> <P> "We're walking such a fine line," said Mary Lou Blazek, Hanford programs  manager for the Oregon Energy Department in Salem and vice chairwoman of a  panel of independent scientists overseeing the $15-million Energy Department  multiphase study of radiation exposure from Hanford.  </P> <P> The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project, conducted by the  government contractor Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, was launched  after the public learned for the first time in 1986 of massive radiation  releases from Hanford.  </P> <P> Blazek said the initial announcement may involve hypotheticals and stressed the  information is subject to change as the study progresses.  </P> <P> "We may say if you were 16, and you lived in Pasco in 1944-'46, and your food  intake was this, then your dose could have been this," Blazek said.  </P> <P> Blazek, who chairs the communications subcommittee of the oversight panel, said  scientists may also try to explain what the health consequences of a certain  dose could be.  </P> <P> "It's difficult because of the science involved," she said. "It's difficult  because there are so many variables involved. You have to make so many  assumptions.  </P> <P> "Say you have X millirems. That is equivalent to what? We can't even agree on  that in our own panel."  </P> <P> The government said in 1986 that more than 500,000 curies of iodine-131 were  released between 1945 and 1956 from Hanford during accidents and planned  experiments. An estimated 15 to 24 curies were released during the 1979 Three  Mile Island nuclear accident.  </P> <P> The studies under way are designed to estimate how much of the radiation people  were exposed to in the 570-square-mile site along the Columbia River in  south-central Washington.  </P> <P> Hanford, an old complex of military reactors that is now focusing on cleaning  up extensive environmental contamination, helped build the first atomic bomb  exploded in New Mexico, as well as the weapon that fell on Nagasaki.  </P> <P> Many Hanford "downwinders" claim the radiation releases have increased the  cancer rate in the area.  </P> <P> A controversial and limited state study found cancer mortality rates near  Hanford are actually lower than the national average, although the federal  Centers for Disease Control is preparing to conduct its own $5-million study of  cancer rates in the area.  </P> <P> The CDC has previously estimated that about 20,000 children may have drunk milk  exposed to radioactive iodine from Hanford.  </P> <P> The Hanford dose reconstruction project is planned in four phases and may  continue through 1993. Results from the first phase will reflect its limited  scope, Blazek said.  </P> <P> The first phase focuses on 10 counties closest to Hanford: Washington's Adams,  Benton, Walla Walla, Franklin, Klickitat, Yakima, Kittitas and Grant and  Oregon's Umatilla and Morrow.  </P> <P> No decision has been made on whether future phases will expand the study east  and south into more of rural Washington and Oregon and into Idaho, or north to  the region's population center around Spokane.  </P> <P> The study's first phase will estimate exposure to iodine-131, although future  phases could look at other isotopes.  </P> <P> The initial phase will examine exposure from airborne radiation from 1944 to  1947 and exposure through water from 1964 to 1966.  </P> <P> Indian tribes were not extensively studied in the first phase, but in later  phases eight Northwest tribes are expected to participate. Scientists are  interested in radiation exposure to Indians because their diets and life styles  differ from other populations.  </P> <P> Although exposure levels have not been released, scientists have already come  up with some potentially important conclusions.  </P> <P> Milk drinkers in the Walla Walla area may have received more radiation than  people closer to Hanford because of the milk distribution system in place at  the time, and scientists think the same may apply in Pendleton, Ore. The milk  was contaminated because cows ate radioactive feed.  </P> <P> And potential radiation exposure from the Columbia River was probably low  because of the huge river's diffusion capabilities, Blazek said.  </P> <P> After the Energy Department declassified 19,000 pages of information about the  radiation releases, Blazek said officials tried "sort of back of the envelope  calculations" of potential radiation doses to people.  </P> <P> "Now we're at an 8-by-11 sheet of paper. We're nowhere near the finished  report," she said.  </P></p>

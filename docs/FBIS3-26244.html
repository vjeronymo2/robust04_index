Chiang Friday welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to  lift a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, saying it will help  accelerate economic reforms which will eventually benefit Taiwan  investors.    The Clinton decision, announced Thursday night at the White  House, will end an embargo imposed on Hanoi in 1964 and extended  to the whole country at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.    Chiang said U.S. businesses led the rally to end the  embargo.  U.S. businessmen said the embargo locked them out of the  potentially lucrative Vietnamee market while European and Asian  nations invested hundreds of millions of dollars and secured  development contracts there.    Chiang said with the lifting of the trade embargo, more  foreign capital will flow into the burgeoning Vietnamese market,  which will help boost incomes and buying power.    The country's need for machinery and consumer products from  Taiwan will also increase, Chiang remarked.    Up to Jan. 19, the Vietnamese Government had approved 113  applications by Taiwan investors for investments worth over  US$1.53 billion, making Taiwan the No. 1 foreign investor in  that country.    Chiang added that the government will continue to promote  Taiwan investments in Vietnam, fully implementing the Republic  of China [ROC]'s "southern strategy."    Two-way trade between Taiwan and Vietnam, inaugurated in  September, 1989, jumped by a factor of five in under four years.    In 1993, bilateral trade totaled US$655 million with Taiwan  enjoying a US$360 million trade surplus, according to ministry  statistics.    Trade and investment ties between Vietnam and Taiwan became  closer after the two countries signed an investment guarantee  agreement on April 21, 1993, according to the Vietnamese  Economic and cultural office in Taipei.    With the signing of the investment agreement, more and  steady  Taiwan investments weno to vietnam, contributing to the  country's economic growth, said Lin Shui-chi, ROC representative  in Vietnam.    "It won't take long for Vietnam to turn itself into the  fifth  little dragon in Asia," Lin said.    Taiwan previously lent Vietnam US$30 million to expand a  highway and another US$15 million to fund the development of  small- and medium-sized Vietnamese companies.    Taipei decided to lend an additional US$10 million to  Vietnam  last month to help the country build an industrial park in Hanoi  to house Taiwan-invested factories.</p>

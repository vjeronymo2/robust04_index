			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate May 25 SAPA -- The first sitting of the  Senate on Wednesday was marked by parties united in their praise  for the president's opening address to Parliament, but also  sober reminders of the task at hand.    First on the speaker's list was Senator Arulsivanathan  Naidoo  (NP [National Party]), who praised President Mr Nelson Mandela  as a remarkable man while saying his predecessor, Mr F W de  Klerk, deserved the nation's gratitude for his vision and  courage.    The NP was committed to the government of national unity and  would co-operate with all parties.    The first ANC speaker, Mr Simon Makana, said he had been  given "a great opportunity to break the ice on our side".    Mr Mandela had outlined the enormous task of social  emancipation, one which could only be brought about by economic  growth based in a politically stable society.    A first priority was a national campaign, harnessing both  the  armed security forces and the public, to stop the bloodshed.    [Orange] Free-Stater Mrs Isabella Direko (ANC) smilingly  remarked that she and the president of the Senate, Mr Kobie  Coetsee, shared the same provincial roots.    She said children deserved the right to nutrition for full  physical and mental development. Youth development had to be  made a national priority. "An empty stomach results in an empty  and unreasonable mind."    The 2.5 million marginalised African children had to be  reincorporated into society. "We dare not give them up as the  lost generation. I am sure they have ambitions and desires."    Mr Stephanus Grove (ANC) said the courts were prohibitively  expensive and out of reach to people who most needed them to  exercise their new rights.    The government of national unity should appoint a commission  of inquiry to investigate rights' matters being heard by  magistrates, lawyers' rights of appearance in supreme courts, a  review of the legal aid mean's test and setting up a legal fund  similar to medical aid.    Mrs R Rabinowitz (IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]) appealed for  openness in the government of national unity, with "no more  deals, unilateral decisions and domination from the centre".    Devolution of powers should be encouraged, with people being  empowered to understand the costs of population growth, as well  as take pride in education and work in a culture of equal  opportunity.    Dr Siyabonga Cwele (ANC) said nutritional education and  breastfeeding were necessary.    Mr Mohamed Surty (ANC) said Parliament should be stripped of  symbols of oppression.    Mr David Malatsi (NP) said people should be encouraged to  pay  for services like electrification and be discouraged from  persisting with a boycott culture. Water conservation also had  to be encouraged.    Mr Holoma Lebona (ANC) said the dual exchange system was  creating great economic harm and as long as it existed there  would not be economic recovery.    He also called for an inquiry into the origins of the  reserve  bank.    Mrs Yolanda Botha (ANC) said the state should contract work  to small businesses, encourage co-operatives and the use of  modern technology to stimulate job-creation.    Maj-Gen Tienie Groenewald (Freedom Front [FF]) said the past  few days had been a "fantastic experience". "What impressed  most was the spirit of how senators and parliamentarians  approached their jobs."    The FF had listened to Mr Mandela's speech with great  expectation. His party would not play a negative role or embark  on political boycotts. "We will make a very positive  contribution to the new South Africa in which the different  nations can live in peace..."    The government did, however, have to ask if the RDP  [Reconstruction and Development Program] did not create  unreasonable expectations.</p>

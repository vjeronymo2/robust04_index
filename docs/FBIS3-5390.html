			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] considers Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's decision on the evening of 2 March  to abandon his plan to reshuffle the cabinet a natural move. In  view of the impending Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994  draft budget, LDP President Yohei Kono asserted: "It is not the  right time to be reshuffling the cabinet. Is it not necessary  instead to do something for the people who are having problems  in their everyday lives?"    However, the LDP questions Prime Minister Hosokawa's  leadership, because the prime minister abandoned his plan due to  opposition within the ruling coalition alliance, despite his  initial determination. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP  Diet Affairs Committee, said: "This indicates the Prime  Minister's Office, which is the heart of the government, is not  functioning at all."    Regarding Hosokawa's carrying out his administrative duties  in the future, a senior LDP official said: "The ruling coalition  alliance has completely split in two, and there is an internal  rift in the Prime Minister's Office as Prime Minister Hosokawa  and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura remain at odds.  As such circumstances have surfaced, the prime minister has  lost his prestige to a considerable degree."    The LDP predicts the prime minister will now face many more  difficulties than in the past. For example, LDP Secretary  General Yoshiro Mori said: "Since so much confusion has been  generated, there are bound to be some consequences."    In the series of developments over the cabinet reshuffle  issue, however, there also are moves within the LDP in response  to the split in the ruling coalition alliance. Such moves have  emerged mainly among junior party members. For example, it has  been revealed that Prime Minister Hosokawa and Michio Watanabe,  former LDP vice president and foreign minister, held a secret  meeting. Since such moves could very well trigger a further  split in the LDP, party President Kono and other party  executives plan to pull the party together more firmly by  hammering out an offensive strategy against the Hosokawa  administration in Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994  draft budget and on other occasions.    Meanwhile Kazuo Shii, secretary general of the Japan  Communist Party, criticized the ruling coalition parties,  saying: "The ruling coalition parties are engaged in an ugly  power struggle, merely in speculation over a political  realignment and election strategies in which the public is  ignored. Neither those who want to reshuffle the cabinet nor  those who are opposed to it have any good reasons."</p>

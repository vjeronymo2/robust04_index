			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 19 (AFP) -- A northern Yemeni delegation  will leave here Sunday [19 June] for Cairo to attend ceasefire  talks sponsored by the United Nations, an official here said.    Sanaa told UN special envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi that it would  send a delegation to Cairo "on condition the (meeting) is held  in the context of the Republic of Yemen and not that of two  states as the southerners want," he told AFP.    The meeting will last one day, said the official who  requested anonymity.</p>

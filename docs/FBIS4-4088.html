			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--Beijing Association of  Writers recently set up a computerised "shopping center" where  publishers can see what manuscripts different writers currently  have on offer for publication.    The center collects a brief synopsis of each manuscript and  also summarizes writers' future literary plans.    All this computerised information can be accessed by  publishers looking for works to produce.    Already more than 300 writers, including some noted ones  such  as Zhang Jie, Lin Jinlan, Liu Shaotang, Lei Jia and Luo Binji,  have presented their authorship plans to the center.    The 1,000 manuscripts it has received include novels,  historical fiction, martial-arts fiction, biography, popular  stories, children's stories, scientific and technological works,  translations of foreign literature and academic works, current  affairs, and poetry.    Last week the center held a talk for more than 30 publishers  who showed interest in a dozen subjects stored at the center.    Young writer Cui Jingsheng has signed a contract with Hebei  People's Publishing house to print his novel, "Seven Bachelors",  and received an advance of 1,000 yuan.</p>

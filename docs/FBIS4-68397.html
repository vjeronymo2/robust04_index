			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korotkova: "Importers Are Deprived of </F> Yet Another Tax Niche"]    [Text] The Russian State Customs Committee's new directive  "On the Application of the Special Processing Customs  Classification," which the directors of customs agencies  received yesterday, is aimed, first and foremost, at clearly  defining the framework in which the special processing  classification is to be applied, and at stopping potential  attempts to apply it inappropriately.    The State Customs Committee's directive is a temporary  normative act that remains in force, as indicated in the Customs  Code, until comprehensive regulations regarding the processing  classification are promulgated. The new document specifies, in  part, that goods may be imported for processing only by  enterprises at which processing operations are included in the  normal production process. And goods subject to excise tax may  not be considered goods for processing at all. Moreover, if  goods imported for processing are placed into free circulation  on the internal market (which is permitted), a duty, the  value-added tax and a special tax must be paid.    In the opinion of experts, the special processing customs  classification is not particularly relevant to Russia at  present, given the present capabilities of its production  branches. Experience indicates that Western partners are  interested in processing goods at Russian facilities only when  what is involved are hazardous production processes that are  restricted or banned altogether in most developed countries.  Therefore, when goods are brought into Russia for processing,  what is usually involved is the importation of waste products of  the chemical industry or nuclear power engineering. However,  even without the special directive, operations to process such  goods may be carried out only after special permission (a  license) is received from the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations. At the same time, it is no secret that the special  processing classification has often taken the place of the  temporary importation classification, especially since the  introduction of procedures requiring mandatory advanced payments  when various property is imported on a temporary basis (for a  period of up to one year). On the other hand, in the absence of  a normative basis, the special processing classification has  been used as a niche for evading excess taxes when goods subject  to excise tax were imported. For example, the ordinary decanting  of alcohol from barrels into half-liter bottles was called  processing. So now importers have lost the possibility of  utilizing the processing classification, under which customs  duties are not collected, in order to relieve their tax burden.  <H8>  Some Mandatory Conditions for the Importation of Goods Under </H8> the Special Processing Classification in Accordance With  Directive No. 01-12/74 of the Russian State Customs Committee     -  Goods are imported into Russia for processing by the  enterprises that directly carries out the processing operations,  and are produced in accordance with the enterprise's usual  production process.    -  The goods imported for processing are not subject to excise  tax.    -  The level of customs duties on the goods imported for  processing does not exceed 100 percent of their value.    -  The processing period is no longer than six months.    -  The enterprise submits a pledge to a customs agency that the  products of processing will be re-exported in accordance with  customs export regulations.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Paper company to shed 500 jobs John Dickinson Stationery, which makes Basildon Bond, Challenge, Three Candlesticks and Lion paper and envelopes, is to cut 500 jobs over the next 12 months. The company is to shed 300 jobs from its plant in Apsley, Hertfordshire, by May. The GPMU print union said this included 86 managerial and technical staff. The rest of the cuts are expected at the company's other manufacturing plant at Kirkby near Liverpool, and at distribution sites at Glasgow, Belfast, Birmingham and Salford, Greater Manchester. Mr Peter McLoughlin, chairman and chief executive of John Dickinson, said: 'Difficult trading conditions have forced us to shape our plans in this way to safeguard our future. An unfortunate and sad consequence of these plans is the need to cut jobs.' The company added: 'Wherever we can, if people are offering voluntary redundancy and if that fits in with our plans, we will accept these offers. But compulsory redundancies may become necessary.' The decision follows a business review late last year. The company has an annual turnover of about Pounds 70m and has lost money for two years. John Dickinson is owned by Biber of Switzerland, and employs 1,200 in the UK. Mr John Abbott of the GPMU said the redundancy plans were a shock. Union representatives are meeting management tomorrow.</p>

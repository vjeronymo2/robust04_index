			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Giorgio Armani accused of bribing taxman As the Italian press has been rubbing home this weekend, the famous names of fashion are having to get used to a new style - the style of justice. The name of Giorgio Armani has now been added to a growing list of fashion designers who have fallen foul of an inquiry by Milan anti-corruption magistrates into pay-offs to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. A total of 14 designers are believed to be under investigation for paying L1bn (Pounds 407,000) in order to ensure 'friendly' tax inspections of their accounts. Those involved include the Versace group, Krizia (designer Mariuccia Mandelli), and Gianfranco Ferre. The investigation has extended from its initial focus on Milanese industrialists and comes at an embarrassing moment for Italy's fashion business, with the annual autumn shows due to start in Milan at the beginning of October. On Saturday Mr Giorgio Armani, who has just celebrated his 60th birthday, was briefly interrogated by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best known of the anti-corruption magistrates. Mr Oreste Dominioni, his lawyer, subsequently told journalists Mr Armani had paid L100m during a tax inspection in 1990 to members of the financial police. The payment was made under duress, Mr Dominioni said. This is the same defence employed by every businessman caught up in this investigation - from steel magnate Alberto Falck to Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the prime minister's brother. Mr Armani's appearance before Mr Di Pietro was quickly followed by Gianfranco Ferre, the architect turned designer. He declined to comment on his interrogation; but judicial sources said he admitted paying over L300m also in 1990 at the time of a tax inspection. Both Giorgio Armani and Gianfranco Ferre are among the most successful of the Italian designers. Armani's 1993 worldwide turnover was L856bn; while that of Gianfranco Ferre, who designed the Italian world cup football team's outfit, was close to L900bn. The problem now is less the damage to the image of Italy's profitable and dynamic fashion business and much more where will the magistrates turn their attention next. More than 50 members of the Guardia di Finanza have been arrested, including a general and an official working with Mr Di Pietro. Three have committed suicide over the past three months. Most of these officials are now co-operating under plea bargaining deals. 'Why pick on the designers and not say the cake-makers?' commented satirist Mr Philippe Daverio. It would seem that the magistrates are determined to remind the public with these easily identifiable figures that anti-corruption investigations have restarted with vigour after the summer break.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The "war" waged by rival drug traffickers of  Mangueira shantytown, which has already resulted in 14 deaths,  reveals that the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command) are  becoming weaker and more divided. This change began in the late  1980's following the arrest of the main leaders.    This version on the situation of trafficking in the Rio de  Janeiro shantytowns -- with incidents during the past years --  is upheld by a "friend" of CV leaders who chose to remain  anonymous. He said that the "media" has created an image of  power that these groups never enjoyed. He added: "Moreover,  most drug traffickers have always been independent."    Another person who does not believe in the power of the CV  and TC as organizations is Prosecutor Raphael Cesario, 55, who  believes that this oversizing -- nourished by some policemen --  is designed to protect the true cocaine and weapons traffickers:  The numbers game operators. Cesario says people "are stupid" if  they believe the great traffickers "live in shantytowns  surrounded by cockroaches and open sewers."</p>

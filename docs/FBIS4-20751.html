			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article filed by the EL WATAN bureau in </F> Annaba: "Security: Annaba Unbearable"--first paragraph is EL  WATAN introduction]    [Text] Day after day, Annaba, the steel capital, is  becoming increasingly unlivable. The cause of this is the  presence of several gangs of armed hooligans who haunt downtown  attacking and robbing young women, mothers, and even fathers  with families.    Annaba--It is a practice that has become widespread and is  encouraged by passivity, indeed by the cowardliness of some who  under other circumstances would become conscientious objectors.    So at a time when some people wallow in unchecked  carelessness and slovenliness and take home a salary for work  that they no longer do, some crazies organize themselves into  gangs to produce a reign of terror on sidewalks, streets, and  within our government institutions.    Annaba has now regained its 1980's title as the most rotten  city in Algeria, literally and figuratively. It is a city in  which vagrants, speculators, swindlers, traffickers, influence  peddlers, racketeers, housebreakers, and pickpockets fight over  workers' salaries. Jostled, indifferent, and discouraged by so  many disappointments, these workers get drawn into a feeling  that everything is sinister and catastrophic and still try to  keep the words fatherland and patriotism in their vocabularies.    The gangs of pickpockets get organized, and so do the  prostitutes and young homosexuals. These veritable carriers of  viruses and other veneral diseases, veiled or not and even  wearing the hijab, and in the company of young toughs, can be  found near the Law School campus, at Sunrise Beach, and on  Revolution Avenue soliciting customers or discussing "the price"  with drivers, most of whom are farmers in high spirits after the  breaking of the fast.    If as regards security [text illegible] the darkest period  of  its existence, on that of business and prices, it is a massacre.  It isn't only speculators who do it, it is practically all young  people who have begun to engage in speculation, particularly  with products subsidized by the state.    At the El-Hatab Market, at the marketplace, everywhere  private business is established, the price checking service has  died. It is the big department stores that pay the piper or  justify our "brave" checkers coming out. There is the El-Hadjar  EDGA, the only store out of 31 others located in five wilayas,  that has miraculously saved the store's credibility by putting  products within reach of modest pocketbooks and by making a  constant effort to supply the population of El-Hadjar and  elsewhere; it is the only store to have dealt with most of its  bank overdraft and saved 85 jobs; it has just been the victim of  a genuine scene entitled "hoarding food."    Now from a survey conducted among a large number of  El-Hadjar's citizens it appears that ever since the arrival of  the store's new director, the people of El-Hadjar have somewhat  forgotten the word shortage in the sense that with respect to  [text illegible] and that the sale of goods in an atmosphere of  tension occurs under the eye of the daira's security services.  The various people surveyed reported that there was manipulation  by the speculators' lobby, which the activity and the efforts  made by the El-Hadjar EDGA were disrupting. Workers in the store  also unanimously agreed that the case had been fabricated and  that they wholeheartedly supported the director of their store.    In fact, if there is hoarding, you need to look for it  closer  to El-Hatab, the marketplace, in the big department stores.  Where semolina and flour are concerned, certain shopkeepers,  particularly those in Oued Eddeheb, no longer worry about  selling their products since they are already sold well before  they get there, but not to neighborhood consumers.    Unlivable by day, Annaba is also unlivable after the  breaking  of the fast. Although they have been closed for several hours,  the cafes, cafeterias, and drugstores are dirty and repellant.  Prices for food have doubled. If you want to buy a few grams of  kalb ellouz, baklava, or hrissa, you need to spend several dozen  dinars.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA TO WEIGH LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council will consider a proposal next week that would  limit campaign contributions in municipal elections.  </P> <P> The proposal is the brainchild of the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning  and Environment, a watchdog citizens group commonly known as SCOPE.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, candidates for City Council could not accept more than $250  from a single contributor. Candidates could borrow no more than $250 from  individuals and no more than $1,000 from any one bank to finance their  campaigns.  </P> <P> Moreover, candidates could not accept contributions from people "with assumed  names" or from businesses contracting with the city. Businesses with bids  pending on city contracts would also be prohibited from contributing to City  Council races.  </P> <P> Donations from anonymous contributors would be limited to no more than $50 per  contribution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Curbing Influence  </P> <P> The group recommended the fund-raising restrictions to water down the influence  of developers over planning, SCOPE President Robert Silverstein said Friday.  Such influence over the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors produced  runaway development that has overcrowded the schools and clogged the streets of  the Santa Clarita Valley, he charged.  </P> <P> "They buy their votes," Silverstein said of developers. "And we don't think  that's fair."  </P> <P> Santa Clarita, incorporated Dec. 15, 1987, has had only one election.  Silverstein said his organization hopes that the council approves campaign  restrictions now to avoid problems in the future.  </P> <P> Three council members -- Dennis Koontz, Jo Anne Darcy and Carl Boyer III --  will face reelection in April, 1990.  </P> <P> In a Feb. 6 memo to the City Council released Friday, City Atty. Carl K. Newton  said state law would allow Santa Clarita to enact all but one of the  recommendations. The group had recommended a $7,200 limit on overall spending  per candidate, but state law prohibits the city from limiting campaign  spending, Newton said.  </P> <P> The City Council will discuss the proposal in the council chambers, 23920  Valencia Blvd., at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.  </P></p>

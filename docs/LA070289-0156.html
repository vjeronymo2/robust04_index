			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGEWEEK: CRYER ISN'T HIMSELF IN LATC 'BOYS' LIFE'  </P> <P> "Basically, I've had to unlearn 24 years of post-feminist training," said Jon  Cryer of his role in Howard Korder's "Boys' Life" (opening Friday at the Los  Angeles Theatre Center). "The story with Jack is that he's in a perpetual state  of arrested adolescence. He's still a kid -- that vicious kid you remember from  when you were little. He's very misogynist, his major motivation is anger. And  that anger takes its toll on his friends."  </P> <P> Cryer, Greg Kean and Charlie Stratton play the post-college buddies; Kari  Lizer, Jennifer Tilly and Maria Tirabassi are the women in their lives. "It's  about understanding male/female relationships, becoming a man and accepting  responsibility," Cryer continued. "It also deals with a lot of base instincts,  a lot of truths -- sometimes frightening. What other people think, Jack says."  The tone, he admits, is dark. "What the play's saying about men . . . is not  good."  </P> <P> Although the actor claims that he knows a lot of people like his character,  playing the role -- with all of its adult complications -- has been a new  experience. "You get into bad habits forever playing teen-agers," Cryer  acknowledged. "But this director (David Beaird) is working on getting something  out of me I've never done before. Usually, I play people pretty close to me.  Even Ducky -- in 'Pretty in Pink' -- though he was way out there, was kind of  like me. This guy Jack is nothing like me."  </P> <P> Cryer is looking forward to another stretch this fall, when his new comedy  series "The Famous Teddy Z" premieres on CBS in the coveted Monday slot  following "Murphy Brown." In the series (from "Frank's Place" creator Hugh  Wilson), Cryer plays a young guy just out of the Army who lands a job in a  talent agency mail room -- and is suddenly catapulted into being the hottest  agent in Hollywood. Explained the actor: "It's a normal person's adventures  among the world of show biz."  </P> <P> THEATER FILE: Local playwright Robert Schenkkan won first place -- and $5,000  -- in the 1989 Beverly Hills Theatre Guild/Julie Harris Playwright Competition  for his "Heaven on Earth." Second place ($1,000) went to New Yorker Bryan  Williams for "Icarus Variations," with third place ($500) to Richard Hellesen  of Fullerton for his "Once in Arden." Schenkkan's work will be staged this  summer at the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre  Center in Waterford, Conn. Hellesen's play will be given a mainstage production  next season at South Coast Repertory.  </P> <P> Film commitments were cited in actor Andrew Stevens' withdrawal from the  Pasadena Playhouse production of the one-man show "JFK: Of Cabbages and Kings."  As a result, the Playhouse replaced "JFK" with Betty Garrett's solo piece "No  Dogs or Actors Allowed" (opening July 13) and Grammy-winning comedian Dale  Gonyea's "An American in Pasadena" (opening July 28).  </P> <P> The Padua Hills Playwrights Festival hosts a benefit fund-raiser July 9 at the  Cal State Northridge Art &amp; Design Center, featuring a retrospective  selection of works presented at previous festivals -- with some of the original  casts. The evening includes Murray Mednick's "Coyote 1: Pointing," with Norbert  Weiser and Darrell Larson; Leon Martell and Elizabeth Ruscio in their "Hoss  Drawin' " and John O'Keefe's "The Magician," featuring Matthew Goulish. Also  planned: excerpts of John Steppling's "Neck" with Jack Slater, Roxanne Rogers,  John Diehl, Kathleen Cramer and Lola Glaudini; and Maria Irene Fornes' "Fefu  and her Friends" with Lorinne Vozoff, Susan Krebs and Laura Fanning. Hosting  are Ed Harris, Amy Madigan and Joe Spano. For information: (213) 281-6799.  </P> <P> CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Steven Dietz's "Ten November," a new drama (with songs by  Eric Peltoniemi) based on the 1975 disappearance of the ore carrier S. S.  Edmund Fitzgerald, recently opened at Los Angeles Theatre Center.  </P> <P> Said The Times' Dan Sullivan: "Since Dietz directed the show, as well as  supplying the text, he deserves some of the credit for its visual sureness. But  it's not at all clear what story Dietz the writer wants to tell."  </P> <P> From Charles Marowitz in the Herald Examiner: "As an evocation of mood and an  imaginative reconstruction of a historic event, it has unquestionable impact.  But as soon as one looks beyond its sentiments to its sense, it begins to lose  credibility."  </P> <P> In the Orange County Register, Thomas O'Connor wrote: "Perhaps if Dietz were  not his own director, he'd have a better fix on 'Ten November's' lack of focus,  its tendency to ramble. Dietz is like a dutiful reporter on a feature  assignment, determined to cram in every jotting in his notebook, when judicious  editing would help."  </P> <P> Said Tom Jacobs in the Daily News: "There's no dramatic arc here. But it's not  missed. Dietz's writing is vivid. He manages to be angry without getting  self-righteous or preachy. And his direction is superb. This show really moves,  but it never seems rushed."  </P> <P> And from Bruce Feld in Drama-Logue: " 'Ten November' eloquently, in shifting  documentary style, tries to find the answers to this tragedy and becomes a  paean to the significance of loss in general. The cast is impeccable . . . Much  praise is due composer-lyricist Peltoniemi and guitarists Marcos Loya and  Jeffrey Willkomm."  </P></p>

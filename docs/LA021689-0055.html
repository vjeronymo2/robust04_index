			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> VIOLIN RECITAL BY LEONIDAS KAVAKOS  </P> <P> Reviewers tend to toss around too casually such a comprehensive term as  virtuoso. It has become a catch-all cliche that no longer specifies anything in  particular.  </P> <P> But it is the only word that immediately comes to mind in describing Leonidas  Kavakos, a boyish-looking, 22-year-old, Athens-born violinist who gave a  recital on the Gold Medal series at Ambassador Auditorium Monday night.  </P> <P> Kavakos has technique to burn. In a program mainly devoted to pyrotechnics,  Kavakos proved himself the easy master of every style of playing from Tartini  and Paganini to Ysaye and Ravel.  </P> <P> Kavakos is a prodigious master of his instrument, and within the limits his  program set he offered a sensitive musical profile. He could not very well  plumb interpretive depth in such mannerly pieces as Schubert's Fantasy in C, or  in Eugene Ysaye's unaccompanied Sonata No. 5, Opus 27. There were no soaring  lyrical flights but there was never less than a quietly urgent soulfulness that  is the violin's birthright.  </P> <P> By way of novelty, and stressing his enterprise, Kavakos played 12 Caprices for  solo violin by Earl Kim that did not break any new compositional paths, but  that skillfully explored the violin's capacity for unorthodox sound.  </P> <P> When Kavakos closed his printed list with Ravel's "Tzigane," it was instantly  apparent that he commands every shade of modern color, and when he added  Kreisler's "Libesleid" among the encores it was instantly recognizable that he  distinguishes between sentiment and sentimentality.  </P> <P> His tone did not suggest lushness or over-ripeness; it was rather a tasteful  blend of reticence and innate musicality. For so young a performer, his arsenal  of violinistic tricks and turns seemed complete and invariably reliable. Keep  an eye on this exceptional talent.  </P> <P> Also remember the name of Anne Epperson, who played the piano parts with the  smoothest and most fluent technique and constantly produced shades of pianistic  color that skillfully matched the effects of the violinist. Epperson appears to  belong in the same exceptional category as Kavakos. ALBERT GOLDBERG  </P></p>

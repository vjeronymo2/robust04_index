			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US eyes potential for trade with Asia THE US is considering proposals that could amount to a new Asian trade round and that could be discussed with other regional leaders in Seattle later this year. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday said that the US had in mind 'a framework around Apec (the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group) which would engage the US and the Pacific rim countries to build a regime that would regularise trade in the region.' Mr Kantor offered no further details but noted that the US had 'a natural alliance in Asia to which we have not paid enough attention in the past.' More than 40 per cent of US trade, he said, was now with Asia, and the region's economies were growing faster than anywhere else in the world. The US remained a 'stabilising force' in economic, political and security affairs. President Bill Clinton will be attending the Apec meeting in Seattle in November. He has devoted substantial segments of two big speeches this week to highlighting the importance of the Asian dimension to US foreign and economic policy. US officials insist this new focus should not be translated as an adverse reflection on the state of trans-Atlantic relations, but naturally reflected economic and geopolitical realities. Contrasts were also drawn with the initial Asian policies of President Jimmy Carter, who sought to reduce the US military presence in the region, particularly Korea. Mr Clinton goes to Seoul tomorrow with a very different message. Meanwhile, Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, agreed to have dinner tonight, raising some hopes that the US and Japan might reach agreement on a negotiating framework designed to reduce bilateral trade friction. Mr Kantor, still savouring the breakthrough achieved in the market access agreement, refused to predict if an agreement was imminent. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, was equally non-committal though perhaps marginally more optimistic. Mr Kantor said it mattered less if it was reached 'this week or next month' than that it was a solid agreement, with quantifiable targets, that made possible greater import penetration of Japan. But he conceded that a pact with Japan would greatly increase the chances of approval by Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Can-ada and Mexico 'because it shows your policies are working.' There were many inter-connections in trade negotiations, he said. Congressional approval last week extending the president's 'fast track' negotiating authority until December 15 had helped get the market access agreement in Tokyo. He hoped that the 'side' agreements to Nafta - covering the environment, labour standards and trade 'surges' - would be completed by the end of this month.</p>

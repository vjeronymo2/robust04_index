			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Fighter unit at General Dynamics 'up for sale' GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group which has been selling off large parts of its businesses, has put its jet fighter division on the auction block, according to union officials. Wall Street analysts believe it could fetch Dollars 1bn or more. The company declined to comment, but such a move would represent a substantial change of strategy by the group's management, which had identified fighter aircraft as one of four core businesses it intended to retain. Potential buyers are rumoured to include Northrop, the Los Angeles-based defence group, and Lockheed, the California-based aerospace group. The jet fighter division makes the F-16, a key component of the US defence system but a programme which is now relatively mature. President George Bush recently gave the division a fillip by authorising the sale of 150 of the aircraft to Taiwan. The division is also one of three contractors developing the air force's next generation of fighter, the F-22.</p>

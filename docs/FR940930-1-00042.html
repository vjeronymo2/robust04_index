			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because RSPA is not proposing any changes in the final rule with respect to hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines, the suspension of enforcement with respect to those lines is immediately (insert date of publication of this NPRM) lifted and compliance will be enforced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Replacements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authority for Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> INGAA argues that RSPA lacks the authority to promulgate a rule requiring operators to modify line sections to accommodate smart pigs when portions of the sections are replaced. INGAA bases its argument on the assumption that the statutory authority for the rule is the change to the basic authorities for requiring modification of existing pipelines to accommodate smart pigs that was made by sections 103 and 203 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;508, Oct. 24, 1992). That change authorizes RSPA to require changes to existing lines whose basic construction would accommodate a smart pig. The 1992 authority would allow RSPA to require the installation of launchers and receivers in lines that already can be smart ``pigged'' should the decision be made in a future rulemaking that the line must be so inspected. INGAA's assumption that RSPA was relying on this 1992 amendment in this rulemaking is incorrect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement in the final rule for replacement of the line section is based upon authority enacted in 1988 that now reads:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary shall prescribe minimum safety standards requiring that the design and construction of a new gas pipeline transmission facility or hazardous liquid pipeline facility, and the required replacement of an existing gas pipeline transmission facility, hazardous liquid pipeline facility, or equipment, be carried out, to the extent practicable, in a way that accommodates the passage through the facility of an instrumented internal inspection device (commonly referred to as a ``smart pig'').  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. 60102 (f). This section supports the final rule that requires any needed changes to the line section to accommodate smart pigs whenever one or more components must be replaced. A more narrow reading, one in which only the individual components must be made smart ``piggable'', would render the provision virtually meaningless. This is so because the factors that restrict ``piggability'' are often related to the geometry of the line (such as bends) rather than to an individual component (such as a valve). The use of valves that cannot accommodate smart pigs is largely in pipelines in which the geometry does not allow inspection by smart pigs. Thus a more narrow reading, in which only the single component being replaced must accommodate the internal inspection by smart pigs, would result in virtually no change in the ``piggability'' of existing pipelines. Congress clearly intended that change in the ``piggability'' occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, RSPA has the authority to issue the final rule. However, as discussed below, RSPA agrees that there may be instances in which the final rule requires that modifications be made to the entire line section which may not be feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Scope of the Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AGA and INGAA argue that both the definition of ``line section'' and the mandatory modification of line sections were not included in the proposed rule, effectively precluding meaningful comment. AGA and INGAA claim that the notice of proposed rulemaking was so inadequate as to violate the requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for notice and comment in the informal rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice proposed that each ``replacement transmission line'' (or, for hazardous liquid pipelines, each ``replacement pipeline'') be made to accommodate smart pigs. Much of the comment on the issue of replacement questioned the scope of the terms ``replacement transmission lines'' and ``replacement lines.'' Commenters speculated about the end points of the segments of lines that had to be made to accommodate smart pigs when a replacement was required. Under the proposed language, any replacement in a transmission line could require modification of the entire line to accommodate smart pigs. AGA itself expressed concern that the proposed rule would be read to require altering an entire transmission line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A scholar, gentleman and gourmand KARL FRIEDRICH VON RUMOHR: THE ESSENCE OF COOKERY Translated by Barbara Yeomans Prospect Books, Pounds 12.50, 212 pages Karl Friedrich von Rumohr (1785-1843) enjoyed a certain reputation in his day as an art historian. What was possibly less well-known at the time was that Rumohr was the first German to make something like a systematic study of what we eat, writes Giles MacDonogh. To some extent this obscurity was intentional: in the high-minded world of German art history, it might not have done for a scholar to show an interest in anything so frivolous. Rumohr therefore published his book on food - Der Geist der Kochkunst - under the name of his cook: Joseph Konig. The question is, how does Rumohr compare to his French contemporaries, Grimod de La Reyniere and Brillat-Savarin? Rumohr was one of the first advocates of what we now call 'healthy eating' while both Grimod and Brillat had an unabashed French tendency to the over-elaborate. Some thing of Rumohr's approach derives from his knowledge of the ancient world: he wanted to feturn to the simplicity of the Homeric Greeks and the Augustan Romans. The nearest he could see to this in the modern world was England. He appreciated the simplicity of the English roast at a time when the French still boiled their meat, and thought the English would recreate the Roman fish sauce, or garum, which was splashed on to Roman food in the way that the Americans apply tomato sauce. He is fascinated by what is now (only stupidly) called the 'Mediterranean' diet which he encountered on his trips to Italy. He liked olive oil and tomatoes and thought the latter should be introduced in Germany. He would not have enjoyed listening to Frank Sinatra in restaurants: 'Playing music during meals tends to stupefy people and is therefore reprehensible.' Where Rumohr really is interesting is in his early adoption of the socio-anthropological approach. He hears of the Maori hangi and he goes off and cooks it; he samples all the dishes he hears about from travellers and is far more ready to experiment than his smug, French contemporaries. That is the chief revelation of this book. The chief drawback is the translator's introduction which is largely irrelevant and ill-informed.</p>

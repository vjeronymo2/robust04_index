			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Kirillov under the "Postscript: Events and </F> Commentaries" rubric: "37 to 1 -- Alas, Not in Favor of  Settling the Conflict"]    [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Russian  Federal Assembly Federation Council, held a news conference 28  June on problems of settling the Ossetian-Ingush conflict.    He described as grave the situation which has taken shape  there, "although a degree of stabilization is taking place out  of the laws of evolution, with no special interference, and  maybe even despite interference by federal and local organs of  power. People are tired and are themselves seeking peace."    Abdulatipov pointed out that in the past, in fulfillment of  the president's edict of 13 December 1993, which clearly  designated ways out of the crisis, the Russian Government  adopted a corresponding decree. Of its 37 points, to date  just...one has been fulfilled. Although the deadline was set  for March-April of this year. The matter is being held up  either at the Ministry of Economics or at the Ministry of  Finance. Whether they want it or not, Abdulatipov declared,  their sluggishness could lead to new clashes.    For example, the planned capital investments in Ingushetia  amount to 91 billion rubles [R]. To date, however, Ingushetia  has received only R800 million -- just 0.8 percent of the set  amount. In Ingushetia 0.8 percent has been spent on housing  construction, and 6 percent on other sectors. The construction  workers who have rebuilt houses for refugees in North Ossetia  have not even received their wages. The most interesting thing,  Abdulatipov pointed out, is that money is being allocated in  accordance with all the documents. But very insignificant  amounts reach the addressees.    What question can there be of resettling refugees if houses  are not being rebuilt? At the same time dozens of construction  companies are looking for work in the North Caucasus. There are  approximately 110,000 unemployed people in the region. There is  a construction infrastructure. There is no money.    Unless decisive measures are taken, the state of emergency  zone in the region of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict will become a  paradise for political adventurers and criminals.</p>

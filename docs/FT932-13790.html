			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Mexico reports small rise in its foreign reserves MEXICO'S international reserves rose to Dollars 18.55bn (Pounds 12.2bn) at the end of December, a small increase on the Dollars 18.26bn October figure, the central bank reported yesterday. The reserves are a closely watched indicator of investor confidence in the peso. The bank also reported a year-end current account deficit of Dollars 22.8bn, and surplus in the capital account of Dollars 26bn. The current account deficit was far above the government's implied estimate of Dollars 19.2bn made in last year's budget. Bank figures confirmed that the economy grew by a sluggish 2.6 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bank of France acts to protect franc against speculators THE European government bond markets continued to be driven by currency movements yesterday, with the Bank of France forced to raise its overnight interest rate in order to curb speculation against the French franc, while both the German and French central banks stressed their commitment to defending the D-Mark/franc parity. Early in the trading session, the Bank of France suspended its 10 per cent five-to-10 day lending rate and announced an overnight lending rate of 12 per cent. The move was intended to halt speculation against the franc by making it more expensive for speculators to borrow funds. The Bundesbank revealed that it had spent DM3.5bn on intervention to defend the franc on Monday, when the financial markets reopened after the holiday break. The Bundesbank and Bank of France issued a joint communique, stating their intention to defend the franc's parity against the D-Mark. French government bonds ended the day slightly weaker, but some dealers remained sceptical over whether the franc can avoid a devaluation. GERMAN government bonds closed higher on the day on hopes that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates to alleviate tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from the opening level of 92.63 to reach a high of 92.88 before falling back to around 92.85 by late after-noon. Dealers noted particularly strong demand for two-year and three-year paper, leading to a flattening of the yield curve in that area, while in the five-to-10 year area the yield curve steepened slightly. Investors are continuing to flock to the D-Mark bloc due to its safe-haven status. UK government bonds closed as much as half a point lower as hopes of a cut in base rate receded and investors took profits. Dealers pointed to signs that the UK economy may at last be pulling out of recession, citing yesterday's provisional money data for December which showed M0 rising at 3 per cent on the year. Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said that the Bank of England's money market operations yesterday also suggested that a base rate cut may be delayed until later in the spring. A delay in the next interest rate cut may have contributed to sterling's strength. In the cash market, the 9 per cent Treasury stock 2008 ended at 102 3/4 to yield 8.67 per cent against Monday's close of 103 11/32 . JAPANESE government bonds rallied strongly on the back of stock market weakness and hopes of an easing in interest rates, with the cash and futures markets touching their highest levels in four years. The March futures contract climbed to a new high of 108.50 before ending the day at 108.45, up from its opening level of 108.25. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved to 4.495 per cent, corresponding to the highest price level for the benchmark bond since December 1988, before ending at 4.505 per cent. US Treasury prices eased slightly across the board yesterday in the wake of Monday's strong rally. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 103 9/16 , yielding 7.323 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/4 , to yield 4.475 per cent. In the absence of fresh economic news, prices slipped into negative territory as the market set about consolidating the gains earned on Monday, when the long bond advanced almost a full point. The minor correction aside, the focus of attention was firmly fixed on Friday's employment report for December. Analysts are expecting an increase of about 80,000 in non-farm payrolls, and for the unemployment rate to remain steady at 7.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Babes in the woods There is good news for the Conservatives this morning. They have not begun to show signs of cracking under the strain. Better yet, they are managing to keep their spirits up. They have taken the disappointments of the first weeks of the campaign on the chin, straightened themselves out and resolved to keep fighting. Some deride the image of the prime minister taking his portable soapbox out to the crowds, but he is to be admired for trying to get into the thick of it. Tory supporters may take courage from this. The government has a case to make. I will elaborate on what it might be in a moment, but first consider the essential selling point, the one they privately intimated yesterday would be tried this week. It is admittedly a last-ditch argument, but it may nevertheless have some effect. It is quite simple: who do you trust to get us out of the recession - the Conservatives or Labour? Such a line could be persuasive, if it was exploited by people who knew how to sell a political party. You could, however, put this same question in another way. The government has good reason to know what kind of a mess the economy is in. It could admit its errors, then assert that because it understands what went wrong it should be the one to save us. I can see the posters now. A huge ship is sinking, its prow just above the waves. Below it would run the punchline, in wavy black letters: 'Would you change crews just when you were heading for the iceberg?' It might capture the floating vote. Perhaps we had better think it through again. One case for supporting the Conservatives is that should there eventually be a resumption of economic growth they are likely to return some of the national dividend to payers of income tax. Mr John Major promised as much in a confident press conference performance yesterday morning. It was marred by the irrepressible honesty of Mr Norman Lamont, who let slip that there would be little room for reductions in taxation for the lifetime of the next parliament. Still, I can offer them a poster. A huge hand reaches into a purse, taking out 20 per cent, 25 per cent, or 40 per cent of its contents. 'After the election after next, we may take less,' reads the slogan, 'But we can't promise . . .' No? Let us try another tack. A subsidiary case for voting Conservative is that the government's policies on education and health are better than Labour's. This is especially true of health. The government's reforms of the NHS are not flawless, but they do constitute a serious attempt to get some structure into its administration. The Labour party appears to reject all that, thus casting doubt on its protestations that it has been converted to an abiding faith in fiscal discipline. Unfortunately for the Tories, most people do not concern themselves about this. They still prefer Labour as potential mentor of the NHS. Just mention those three little letters and the polls turn away from the Tories. The correct Conservative poster on health, therefore, is a blank hoarding. Just stick eight white sheets up and leave them there. It might puzzle some passers-by, but it would be more beneficial to Mr Major's campaign than anything that mentioned the health service, in any context. All right then, let us make a final attempt. Labour could be portrayed as hugely profligate, which in aspiration it certainly is. The trouble with this is that you have to make hyperbole credible. The existing Tory campaign literature - 'Labour's tax bombshell' - tells us that Labour's manifesto promises would cost the average taxpayer Pounds 1,250 a year, or Pounds 25 a week. This lacks verisimilitude. It sounds like what it is: an argument from extremes. I would have preferred a dripping tap. The steady drip-drip of the opposition's undertakings and hostages to fortune is disquieting, in spite of the care taken to present every commitment as carefully costed. You will see why I have not been offered the job of designing Conservative advertising. There is, however, one thing that any creative consultant could tell them before sitting down to lunch. It is: get a line and stick to it. Do not confuse people with a variety of messages. If it is not to be a blanket use of 'you can't trust Labour', on the ground that people react badly to negative slogans, then it surely has to be something along the lines of 'The recovery is coming - the Conservative recovery.' Mr Major finds this a hard sell because both he and his chancellor made the same prediction in vain last year. Their optimism was premature. People will need to feel the upturn before they believe it. It is no good putting up a poster whose line is 'the way ahead,' if it depicts the chancellor cutting a path through the undergrowth - even if he is in boy scout uniform and has tied a piece of string to the tree stump behind him. But the prime minister is not dispirited. He keeps his eye on the next step. There must be a way out somewhere.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Keating to face budget that refuses to budge MR PAUL KEATING will probably return home from Monte Carlo in a blaze of glory after securing the Olympics for Sydney. But even this is unlikely to deflect the spotlight for long from a far more fundamental domestic issue - the Australian budget. Five weeks after it was unveiled, the Australian government's first post-election finance bill still lacks sufficient support to pass the Senate. The resulting economic uncertainty has contributed to a plunge in the nation's currency. The Australian dollar stands close to 65 US cents compared with more than 68 cents when the budget was announced on August 17, although an increasingly bleak outlook for commodity prices also bears some responsibility. The exchange rate might be lower still but for remarks on Tuesday by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor. These suggested that the authorities might have to consider an increase in interest rates to protect the currency from large falls. 'To date, we have achieved our objectives with intervention,' said Mr Fraser, 'but if necessary, we would also use interest rates.' The roots of the budget problem lie in the 1993 election campaign, which the Labor party of Mr Keating, the prime minister, was not expected to win. After the surprise victory, the government found itself committed to some expensive promises on the expenditure side, but lacked much leeway over how it could finance them. As a Price Waterhouse analysis noted: 'The real focus of the 1993-4 budget is about the funding the promised tax cuts - cuts that are to apply to businesses and certain lower-income earners.' The solution chosen depended heavily on indirect taxation. Much of the 'pain' required to pay for the measures was to come from an immediate increase of one percentage point in all wholesale sales tax rates; increased taxes on wine, cider, tobacco, petrol - especially unleaded petrol - and from a broadening of the fringe benefits tax net. This strategy, it was admitted, would push up inflation; the 1993-4 rate was forecast at 3.5 per cent (although the figure has since been the subject of some controversy), compared with an average 1 per cent in 1992-3. The budget deficit, meanwhile, was predicted to rise from ADollars 14.6bn to ADollars 16bn (Pounds 6.2bn to Pounds 6.8bn). In many respects, the budget measures were unsurprising. But they left the government open to attack. Within days, the opposition - despite being two votes short of a blocking position in the Senate - had decided to make a fight of the issue. That left the balance of power with two minority parties: the Australian Democrats, who have seven senators, and the Green party, which has two. They duly joined the rout. Embarrassingly, the government's own bedrock support, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Federal Labor party caucus, decided that the regressive nature of some proposed tax changes was unacceptable. After some heated exchanges, the government yielded. To pacify the Democrats, it increased a tax rebate for low-income earners, reversed a decision to exclude eye tests from Medicare rebates and lowered the proposed differential between leaded and unleaded petrol. To buy off the Labor caucus, it modified a previous budget plan to include unrealised capital gains in pension assets tests. To offset the effect of these concessions, the government said it would delay the introduction of its tax cuts by two weeks. This largely placated the Democrats, although the increased wine tax continues to be contentious. However, the two Green senators, both from Western Australia, remained far more obdurate. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, met the senators two weeks ago, but was left holding a long shopping list of proposed budget changes - from a freeze on defence spending to an increase in unemployment payments. He declined to budge, and a stalemate ensued. There, during the current parliamentary recess, matters stand. In theory, a failure to pass the bill once parliament sits again next week could lead to 'double dissolution' - that is, the dissolving of both houses of parliament and the calling of a new election. That has happened before, in 1974, although Labor was re-elected. In this case, none of the budget's opponents has seemed anxious to pursue such a drastic course. Meanwhile, a good deal of political point-scoring has also been under way. Opposition from the Labor caucus has been interpreted as an attempt by members of the party to trim Mr Keating's sails. The prime minister, after all, is often viewed as a rather remote figure, disinclined to consult with the rank and file. The budget's form as well as its content has been attacked. Unusually, the government had packaged the finance proposals into one bill, in an attempt to prevent its opponents from picking off specific measures. However, legal opinion has suggested that this may be unconstitutional. So, on Tuesday, Mr Dawkins ate more humble pie, and said that the package would be redrafted into eight bills. This, he maintained, would 'preserve the integrity of the budget and allow the government to achieve its medium-term fiscal strategy'. In an effort to ensure that the bills do not pass or fail selectively, Mr Dawkins added that the government would not implement the tax cuts unless the revenue bills were also approved. However, the opposition has made clear its continued objection to certain revenue measures, the Greens still want modifications, and the Democrats remain unhappy about the wine tax. The strain on government members - especially Mr Dawkins - is clearly telling. 'Whenever it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle (his home town), get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political retirement does well in my mind,' the treasurer confessed this week. This incautious remark was duly whipped up into a resignation threat by the Canberra press, although Mr Dawkins' office denied that the embattled treasurer had meant anything of the kind.</p>

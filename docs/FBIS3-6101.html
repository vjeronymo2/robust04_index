			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tadao Karino and Masaharu Shimokawa; from MAINICHI </F> SHIMBUN 15 March Morning Edition]    [Text] Seoul, 14 Mar -- Yi Yong-tok, South Korean deputy  prime minister and minister of national unification, gave an  exclusive interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 14 March. On the  unresolved issue of an exchange of special envoys between North  and South Korea, Yi said: "Theoretically, it is still possible  to have the exchange in time," but "that is only what we are  hoping for. In reality, this will be difficult to achieve."    He indicated he was pessimistic about the possibility of  exchanging special envoys before 21 March, when the third round  of high level talks between the United States and the DPRK  (North Korea) is scheduled to be held.    Yi revealed that during recent talks with visiting U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, they had agreed  that "if the exchange of special envoys does not materialize,  the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks will be postponed,"  indicating the possibility the talks may be delayed.    Yi cited the fact that on 12 March North Korea virtually  withdrew the four prerequisites it had set [for the exchange of  envoys] -- including "discontinuation of military exercises  using nuclear arms" -- at the North-South working level  negotiations in Panmunjom, and predicted that "even if the  exchange of special envoys could not take place in time, I am  optimistic that we will be able to reach agreement (in the end)."    However, as far as the timetable for exchanging envoys is  concerned, Yi said: "We would not be able to tell before the  working level meeting on 16 March."    Yi stated that the exchange of special envoys with North  Korea has already been agreed between the North and South, and  it would amount to an indirect dialogue between the leaders of  the two sides, which might open the way to direct dialogue.  Seoul, therefore, intends to work for this patiently.    He also said that the reason the North is not eager to  exchange envoys "seems to be that it wants to give priority to  negotiations with the United States. However, the North is  surely aware of the importance of direct North-South dialogue."    Touching on the nuclear inspections currently being  conducted  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yi said:  "While we cannot say they are proceeding smoothly, they are  somehow progressing."    On recent developments in North Korea, Yi said: "There are  signs of policy change, such as the North's admitting the  failure of its economic construction. It also seems to be in  the process of reconsidering its withdrawal from the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ruling coalition parties decided 18 May to call  on both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to cooperate in establishing a  council on the tax system. The ruling coalition parties' Tax  Reform Council is now working out reform bills to be ready by  the end of June. However, there is little possibility that the  Hata minority administration can win Diet approval for its  bills. Therefore, the ruling parties decided to seek an  agreement with the LDP and the SDPJ through tripartite  consultations before the legislation of the bills. The LDP has  also shown its intention to submit a motion of no confidence  against the cabinet as soon as the budget bill for fiscal 1994  is approved. The ruling parties are believed to be aiming at  securing their hold on political power by proposing dialogues on  policies.    With regard to the tax system reform, all parties agree on  the need to continue income tax reductions after fiscal 1994.  The LDP proposes not only to review the ratio of direct to  indirect taxes, but also to discuss this matter in the context  of the people's overall tax burden ratio, including social  insurance charges. The SDPJ will soon start separate  discussions with Sakigake [Harbinger] on tax system reform. In  light of such a situation, the coalition parties plan to propose  that the LDP, the SDPJ, and coalition parties should bring in  their own bills for discussion to reach an agreement before the  extraordinary Diet session scheduled for this fall.    Regarding raising indirect taxes, which is the focal point  of  the tax system reform, the ruling parties' Tax Reform Council is  studying the possibilities of the following: 1) preparing  several alternative proposals on this matter; and, 2) refraining  from indicating concrete tax rates. The council is thus trying  to leave room for discussions with the LDP and the SDPJ. It has  already been decided that several alternative proposals  concerning this matter will all be included in the report to be  worked out by the basic tax system subcommittee in early June.    At a meeting of heads of the government and ruling parties  held on 16 May, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said  that the government's tax reform bill should be decided within  June to prepare for the major industrialized nations' summit  talks (the Naples summit). However, a senior ruling party  official said on 18 May: "What the United States urges is the  continuous implementation of income tax reduction to expand  domestic demands. Even if discussions on how to secure revenue  sources [to make up for the shortfall that may result from the  tax reduction] should be delayed, it will not exert adverse  influence upon Japan-U.S. relations." He thus showed the  intention to entrust the ruling and opposition parties with  discussing how to handle the consumption tax issue.    However, the Finance Ministry is believed to be demanding  the  enforcement of an income tax reduction together with a  consumption tax hike after fiscal 1994. Coordination between  the government and the ruling parties is expected to face rough  going.</p>

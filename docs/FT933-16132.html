			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tail-end Yeltsin asks for more RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin has three requests for more, to put to leaders of the Group of Seven when he attends the tail-end of their summit in Tokyo this week: more money, more trade and more understanding. Although support for Russia's market reforms is not high on their list of priorities, it is one of the few areas on which leaders of the world's seven richest countries will be able to agree. 'The rails have already been laid down for this,' said one western diplomat, referring to the Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28.6bn) package of aid and loans drawn up in April. Some of it has already been delivered, in the shape of a Dollars 15bn debt rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor governments. The only disagreement is over the size of a fund which Russia wants to help in the restructuring of its industrial enterprises after their rough and ready privatisation. Europe and Japan have already scaled it down - to about Dollars 2bn from the Dollars 4bn requested by US President Bill Clinton. Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russian finance minister, who is accompanying Mr Yeltsin to Tokyo for the meeting on Friday, says the only 'real failure' since April has been the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's inability to deliver, 'even in prototype form', a Dollars 300m fund to promote small businesses. But, as he battles at home on several fronts, Mr Yeltsin wants to avoid appearing a weak supplicant on the international stage. 'Yeltsin is quite cautious. He does not want to be in the position of (former Soviet leader Mr Mikhail) Gorbachev in London in 1991. He wants to come for concrete results,' Mr Fyodorov said. Unlike Mr Gorbachev, who presented an unimpressive reform programme when he made a first request for G7 support, Mr Yeltsin has earned and received western support since launching economic reforms in January 1992. The relationship has developed so far that the Russian president will even be able to tell western leaders what he does not want from them. For instance, he will be pressing for more western assistance in the form of grants and soft loans, saying that loans at commercial interest rates to pay for western imports do not really amount to help. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said at the weekend Russia could not afford to borrow more than Dollars 5bn of the G7 package's Dollars 10bn in export credits and guarantees. Western leaders in turn should be able to conclude that setting conditions for western support, as a way to further reforms in Russia, can work. This thesis was somewhat discredited last year when domestic political pressure caused Mr Yegor Gaidar, the reformist prime minister who launched market reforms, to fail to deliver over-ambitious promises to the International Monetary Fund. But, since Mr Yeltsin's referendum victory over his conservative opponents in April, Mr Fyodorov and other reformers in the government have been able to secure a liberalisation of coal prices and big increases in interest rates, as part of the conditions for a new Dollars 1.5bn loan from the IMF granted last week. Mr Yeltsin has said his most important task at the summit is to end trade 'discrimination' against Russia, so that it shall be in a stronger position to help itself through increased export revenues. It is difficult to see what concessions can be granted at Tokyo on this front, apart from a vague statement supporting Russia's speedy admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and a pledge to remove outstanding Cold War restrictions. Mr Shokhin says the most useful result of the summit would be 'a change in language' to one between equals. For Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, the enterprise fund is of utmost importance for the west to prove itself a 'historic partner' in Russia's striving for economic freedom and democracy. As he sets about transferring to private hands half Russia's industrial capacity this year alone, his main concern is to prevent privatisation being discredited by failures while domestic credit is increasingly hard to come by. Mr Fyodorov says his top priority at Tokyo is to start discussing further loans from the IMF - including a a more traditional stand-by loan which carries stricter conditionality and which Moscow wants to conclude by October 1. He will also be telling G7 leaders that Russia is on track to cut its budget deficit and inflation rate, and that the rouble has at last stabilised at about 1,000 to the dollar. There are doubts as to how these developments may last but progress has been made in furthering market mechanisms - for instance, in widening the foreign exchange market and controlling the distribution of central bank credits.</p>

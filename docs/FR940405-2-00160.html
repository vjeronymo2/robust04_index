The Contracts are individual flexible premium variable deferred annuity contracts. The Contracts may be purchased on a non-tax-qualified basis, or they may be purchased and used in connection with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment. Generally, the Contracts may be purchased with an initial purchase payment of at least $5,000. However, the initial purchase payment may be reduced to: $100 if the Contract owner has executed a preauthorized check agreement for additional purchase payments to be automatically withdrawn monthly from the Contract owner's bank account (a ``PAC agreement''); or $2,000 if the Contract is to fund an Individual Retirement Annuity (``IRA''). (The Companies reserve the right to lower or raise the minimum premium for IRAs.) Generally, subsequent purchase payments must be at least $1,000. However, such purchase payments may be reduced to: $100 or more if the purchase payment is made by preauthorized check pursuant to a PAC agreement; or $50 or more per month if an IRA Rider is in effect, and provided that no purchase payment, together with the total of other purchase payments, would exceed $1,000,000 unless the applicable Company consents to a larger amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. A Contract owner may allocate net purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the applicable Account, each of which will invest in a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. (Net purchase payments equal purchase payments less any premium taxes deducted.) Purchase payments will be credited with the investment experience of the selected subaccount(s). A Contract owner also may allocate net purchase payments to the applicable Company's general account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Prior to the annuity date, a Contract owner may transfer Contract value among subaccounts of the applicable Account, or surrender a Contract or withdraw a portion of the cash surrender value. The amount payable upon surrender, the cash surrender value, is the Contract value less any applicable contingent deferred sales charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Contracts provide for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. A Contract owner may select from several annuity payment options, all of which are fixed options that provide for payments out of the applicable Company's general account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

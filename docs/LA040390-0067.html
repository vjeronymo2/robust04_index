			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8 billion of new three-month bills at an  average discount rate of 7.83%, down from 7.85% last week.  </P> <P> Another $8 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate  of 7.81%, down from 7.83% last week. The new discount rates understate the  actual return to investors -- 8.10% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill  selling for $9,802.10, and 8.24% for a six-month bill selling for $9,605.20.  The discount rate reflects the price discount received when government  securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

The day I hurried to Sarajevo was  precisely the 10th anniversary of the 1984 Sarajevo Winter  Olympics. Heavy snow covered the scars and wounds left by the  war. Hotels in suburban Sarajevo under the control of the Serbs  in Pale were packed, and many of the visitors were foreign  reporters carrying luggage and cameras.    Air strikes was a popular topic everywhere. Some residents  considered leaving their home for relatives elsewhere to take  refuge for a while, because this time "the wolf" seemed to be  really "coming." However, some people did not think much of it,  believing that the West was once again "swashbuckling" to press  the Serbs to make greater concessions. This reporter asked some  Serb soldiers: "Would you attack UN peacekeeping troops should  NATO really carry out air raids?" Some said no, and others said  they would "fight selectively," and hit the "blue helmets" of  those countries which sent their aircraft on air strikes. In an  interview with a Serb leader, he said that the Serbs would do  their best to settle the crisis through negotiations. Even if  NATO launched air strikes, they would not give orders to attack  UN peacekeeping troops. However, he stated that air strikes  would result in a turbulent situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  mean "losing control over Serb soldiers"; consequently, UN  troops would be endangered.    This reporter interviewed a family, comprising a mother and  a  daughter. The mother had already retired, and the daughter was  a worker in a factory; for three months they had received no  pension or wages. Every month, the daughter received some  rations from the factory, while the mother only received six kg  of flour, one kg of edible oil, and one kg of sugar from an  international relief organization each month. They were so poor  that they could not afford to buy toilet paper. The old lady  took care of the child of a family, but received less than 2  marks in return. The old lady said: "Now NATO will carry out  air raids. Our house is located close to the television station;  it is impossible to sleep well. They might as well withdraw the  artillery troops." However, her daughter promptly objected:  "We have already withdrawn one step; why should we have to make  another concession? No. No way!"    Men in military uniform could be seen everywhere on the  streets of Pale, because all male Bosnian Serbs must join the  army. Even so, how could the Bosnian Serbs, with a population  of 2 million, confront the powerful NATO? General Mladic, the  Serb commander-in-chief, said that NATO had aircraft, and the  Serbs had "whatever there is"; "NATO should not think that the  war will come to an end by dropping a few bombs; they must send  their ground forces here. Let them see how many big mountains  and forests in Bosnia-Hercegovina await them."    It was getting very late, and snowy suburban Sarajevo was in  the still of the night. Dull sounds of bombardment from  Sarajevo city proper used to be heard here, but not this  particular evening. This associated people with "the stillness  on the eve of a big action." Many foreign reporters stationed in  Belgrade have arrived here in haste and are ready to cover the  scene of the air strikes; however, these are scenes people do  not wish to see.</p>

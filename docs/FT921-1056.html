			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Barratt returns to profit at mid-way SIR Lawrie Barratt, chairman of Barratt Developments, Britain's third largest housebuilder, will this month receive his first pay cheque for seven months in recognition of the group's return to profit after making a pre-tax loss of Pounds 105.9m during 1990-91. Sir Lawrie, who earns Pounds 220,000 a year, announced yesterday that the group had a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m during the six months to the end of December. This compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.5m during the corresponding six months a year earlier. Barratt's chairman, who came out of retirement last year to resurrect the group's fortunes, had promised shareholders that he would not draw any salary until the group returned to profit. He will receive seven months back pay after taking the company back into the black. Sir Lawrie, 64, was optimistic about housing recovery prospects in the UK and California. He said that sales by British housebuilders had risen between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the first three months of this year, compared with January, February and March last year. He believed that a slow recovery had begun in the UK and that this should continue irrespective of the outcome of the election - provided interest rates did not rise by more than two percentage points. He said that house prices in relation to annual earnings were the cheapest they had been since the early 1980s. Higher taxes by a Labour government would hit the upper-end of the housing market while many first-time buyers would be better off. He was encouraged by an improvement in California where housing starts were forecast to increase this year by up to 25 per cent. Barratt's share price rose by 8p to 65p yesterday, lifted by reports that net borrowings had fallen from Pounds 184m at the end of 1990 to Pounds 108m by the end of last year. This represented gearing of 63 per cent. Off-balance sheet debt had fallen from Pounds 71m to Pounds 25m and had been reduced by a further Pounds 10m since December. Sir Lawrie said that the group intended to reduce gearing to below 50 per cent by the year-end. He said that the group would not be paying an interim dividend although intended to return to paying a dividend as soon as possible. Earnings per share of 1.4p compared with a loss of 5.1p during the first half of 1990-91. Analysts forecast a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m for the year. Details, Page 30</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz May 26 TASS -- The situation in the zone  under state of emergency on the territory of North Ossetia has  sharpened again, according to military sources.    This is connected with the fact that on May 25 at about 9  p.m. unidentified persons shot at a Zhiguliy car with two people  inside near the village of Yuznyy situated in the security zone.  Both people died of mortal gunshot wounds. The incident is  being investigated.    The situation in the zone under state of emergency is  aggravated by acts of terrorism, bandit attacks and incessant  taking of hostages, a spokesman for the press service of the  president and the government of North Ossetia told ITAR-TASS.    Unfortunately, so far the fate of three citizens of North  Ossetia taken hostages in the village of Maiskiy of the  Prigorodnyy district on March 30 this year, is not known yet.    The measures carried out to search and liberate six Ingushes  who were taken hostages by criminals on May 19 in the city of  Vladikavkaz have not produced positive results either.    Today President of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov met with  members of the presidiums of the government and the parliament  of the republic, representatives of the law enforcement bodies  of North Ossetia and the temporary administration. They  discussed urgent measures to search for the hostages.    The president expressed an extremely negative attitude to  the  unlawful actions of persons involved in the crimes in the  Maiskiy village and in Vladikavkaz, and stated that the  leadership of North Ossetia would do everything in its power to  find hostages and take additional measures to ensure security of  residents of the republic.</p>

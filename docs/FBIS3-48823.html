			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Fook Kwang in Bangalore] </F>   [Text] Bangalore (India) -- Singapore's largest project in  India -- a 58-acre (23.4-ha) Information Technology Park was  launched by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong here yesterday.    He unveiled a plaque at the construction site for the S$250  million one-stop industrial estate which has drawn interest from  information technology industry giants like IBM and AT&amp;T.    Noting the speed with which the park has moved from idea to  reality, he said it was testimony to the vision of India's  leaders in opening up the economy.    "If India's reforms stay on course, I am sure that Indian  companies which are already household names in the domestic  market will soon be well known abroad," Mr. Goh said.    The Bangalore Information Technology Park, which will offer  factory, office and residential space, is expected to be ready  by the end of next year. It aims to meet the needs of high-tech  companies in the computer, electronics and telecommunications  industries.    There was an air of expectancy and optimism at yesterday's  ceremony as speaker after speaker praised the speed with which  the project has progressed.    Singapore's Economic Development Board chairman Philip Yeo,  who was involved in the initial discussions on the project, said  that if the record time -- six months from conception to ground  breaking -- was an indication of things to come, he was  confident of the park's future.    Mr. Ratan N. Tata, chairman of the Tata group, one of the  park's joint-venture partners with a 40 per cent stake described  it as a small step towards India joining the action that was now  taking place in the booming economies of east Asia.    Bangalore is the capital of Karnataka state, which has a 20  per cent stake in the project. Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily  of Karnataka state made a pledge to the park's investors,  promising to speed up the pace at which permits and licences are  processed.    The idea for the park was conceived by Prime Minister Goh  and  his Indian counterpart Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao when they met in  Jakarta in 1992. In his speech yesterday Mr. Goh said the  decision to have the park here was based on Bangalore's good  reputation with foreign investors.    However, before the expected influx of investors took place,  Bangalore would have to restructure itself and develop its  supporting infrastructure, he said. Singapore companies, he  added, would be able to work with local partners here to bring  this about.    If all went well, the park could become a forerunner of  future industrial estates, and form a nucleus for the  development of satellite townships around the city, said Mr. Goh  who is on a week- long visit to India.    After the ceremony, Mr. Liew Mun Leong, group managing  director of L&amp;M Group Investments -- a member of the  Singapore  consortium which has the remaining 40 per cent stake in the  project -- told reporters that Bangalore was an eminently  suitable site. It had many computer companies and professionals.    "Rather than bring them back to the US or Singapore it's  better to operate here -- it's cheaper," he noted.    Dubbed the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore is home to  many  household names like Texas Instruments, Motorola,  Hewlett-Packard and IBM.    And with what is estimated to be a third of the 9,000  information technology professionals in India living or working  here, the city has been a driving force behind the country's  growing software industry. The Information Technology Park will  add to its attraction, and to Singapore's profile here.</p>

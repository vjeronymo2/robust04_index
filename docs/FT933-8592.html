			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DERIVATIVES markets had a much quieter session in London yesterday, and tended to follow the fortunes of the UK government bond future contract, writes Terry Byland. The September contract on the Footsie, which has played a significant role this week in the equity market's move above the 3,000 mark on the FT-SE Index, moved nervously at first as profits were taken in the underlying market. At worst, the contract dipped to 2,996. However, renewed demand as the underlying stock market moved into the new trading account was given a further and significant boost by the Bank of England's decision not to hold the usual gilt-edged auction this month. With both the gilt future and bond prices rising sharply in late trading, the Footsie September future jumped to a close of 3,024, a premium of 17 against the cash market; fair value premium is now below 3 points. Volume in traded options fell by about one-third to 20,783 contracts, with the FT-SE contract down to 4,931.</p>

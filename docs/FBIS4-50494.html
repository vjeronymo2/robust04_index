			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Foreign Minister Fredrick  F. Chien said Monday [16 May] that President Li's 13-day,  four-nation visit has contributed greatly to the strengthening  of Taiwan's relationships with both friendly countries and those  countries with which it does not maintain formal diplomatic ties.    Chien, who was a member of President Li's entourage during  the overseas trip, made the remarks at a press conference.    President Li returned home Monday afternoon after visiting  Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland.    Chien said that Li had met with around 30 heads of state  during his stay in South Africa.    He said he would like to use the Chinese proverb, "I will do  what I should do no matter how difficult it is," to describe  what Li had done and his dedication in expanding Taiwan's  diplomatic arena.    Chien, however, denied news reports that Li met with  Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during his stopover at  Singapore's Chang Kai-shek International Airport on Monday  morning.    He said Li only had a 30-minute meeting with Ker Sin Tze  [name and title as received], Singapore's state minister for  information, arts, and education.</p>

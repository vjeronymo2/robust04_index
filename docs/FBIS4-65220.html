			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leena Hayrinen: "Big Propaganda War Beginning: </F> EU: Yes or No?; Citizens' Organizations Rapidly Forming To Teach  Finns How To Vote on Membership in European Union"]    [Text] "I merely respond to that by saying that Kalevi  Sorsa seems to be a humorist. For reasons just as good as this  in 1939 we might have said that we would become more independent  if we got to decide on these issues as a member of the Union of  Soviet Socialist Republics," Keijo Korhonen, a rank-and-file  member of the People's Independence Front of Finland, quipped.    Korhonen was referring to a statement made by bank director  Kalevi Sorsa at a Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc.  news conference held last weekend. At that time Sorsa declared  that he thought that the most telling argument of factions  opposed to European Union [EU] membership was loss of  independence. Sorsa said that, after considering many factors,  he had come to the conclusion that Finland would become more  independent as a member of the EU as compared with its present  situation, in which Finland just goes along with decisions made  elsewhere through the EEA [European Economic Area].    "As a member, we will participate in influencing decisions,"  said Sorsa, who viewed the EU's discussion of a prescribed  minority these past few weeks as a good indication of with what  indifference Community members regard outsiders.    Now that the national referendum on European Union  membership  is approaching, supporters and opponents are quickly organizing  themselves. This is how a number of organizations that have  applied for funds intended for, among other things, providing  information on integration describe the situation. Last year  the government allocated a total of 2.7 million markkas of  discretionary aid for information in two installments:  Twenty-five organizations were included in the first and 26 in  the second. Some 91 applicants, whose applications total 14  million, are eager to get their hands on some of this year's  2-million-markka appropriation.    In addition, 10 million markkas have been set aside in a  supplementary budget for providing information on alternatives  in the referendum. The conditions for allocating these funds  will not, however, become clear before the bill governing the  referendum is made public.    It does, however, seem to be quite clear that aspirants want  to improve their chances of getting money for their own  alternatives by setting up many organizations. Thus Mikko Vesa,  who told us that he is also the chairman of the Young People's  Europe Committee, which was formed a couple of weeks ago,  answers the telephone at the office of No to the EU -- until now  the VEY [expansion unknown] -- the oldest organization opposing  membership, launched as early as 1991.    According to Vesa, a new, nonorganization is needed because,  from young people's viewpoint, "men of the past's" decision on  independence is not of any importance. Vesa said that young  people want to mark the no box with an X for relevant reasons.  <H5>  Papal Conspiracies? </H5>   Three kinds of organizations and committees are distributing  information on the EU and influencing citizens' opinions:  supporters of membership, its opponents, and neutrals.    The Foreign Ministry's Information on Europe office also  sends out the word that it is pursuing a neutral policy. Its own  material is objectively presented, well founded, and well  composed. The ministry's Information on Europe also distributes  material from citizens' organizations, but it does not procure  it for their choices. Therefore, whether they supply their  printed matter for distribution through Information on Europe  depends on how active these organizations are.    A spot check indicated that at least No to the EU has seen  to  the availability of its publication VAIHTOEHTO through this  channel, as has the MTK [Agricultural Producers Association],  among others -- both recipients of big government information  subsidies. Since the publications were prominently in evidence,  at least as far as this is concerned, Seppo Aaltonen of the  Popular Front Against the EC's acrimony-tinged invitation to  take a look at how opponents are being discriminated against did  not produce the desired result.    Closely associated with the Communist Workers Party, the  movement represented by Aaltonen backed Pekka Tiainen in the  presidential elections. The movement's principal argument is  "loss of independence." The EU is a federation from which, in  its opinion, one cannot secede. Its most important form of  activity is the publication and distribution of a paper called  EI EUROOPAN UNIONILLE -- KYLLA SUOMELLE [No to European Union --  Yes to Finland]. This activity is funded by "the horny hand of  toil." Another group that has gotten by without public support  is the Free Finland Civic Movement, which is collecting  signatures for a petition to be submitted to the parliament and  which claims that it has already amassed nearly 200,000 names.    Membership in the EU may be supported or opposed for very  many different reasons. There is even talk of the pope, who  opposes the Community because he considers it to be Catholic!  During the final vote, however, the reasons why will not be  asked for. Therefore, both those who plan to vote yes and those  who plan to vote no have been exploring the possibilities of  common action. Largely personified in Hilkka Pietila in the  press, No to the EU is cooperating with the Independence  Society. Jan-Magnus Jansson, for example, is indeed active in  both of them. He has also been in contact with the People's  Independence Front of Finland, whose arguments focus primarily  on security policy, as well as with the Social Democratic  Independent Nation -- Cooperative World group. The  last-mentioned opposes the EU chiefly for being a neoliberalist  community on whose scale of goals employment, for example, does  not occupy the position hoped for by these critical Social  Democrats. Because of a shortage of funds, this group headed by  Jorma Bergholm has up to now been evident primarily in  letters-to-the-editor columns.  <H5>  To Cooperate or Not </H5>   During Easter Week Better Alternative -- a European Finland,  Inc., which has begun to create a national network of local  organizations, also explored cooperation with other  organizations that support EU membership.    As a movement composed chiefly of young academicians, at  least Yes to Europe, an independent civic organization that has  developed an idea almost contrary to the original one, has  responded negatively to Better Alternative -- a European  Finland, Inc.'s wooing. Kristiina Hartikainen told us why: As a  subsection, the youthful group, which has even produced its own  lively publication, would certainly have been trampled  underfoot. The movement led by her sees many reasons for joining  the EU. She cited as one of the main reasons young people's  opportunities to study at European universities.    "What personally gives me food for thought the most is the  future of agriculture," Kristiina Hartikainen said and told us  that she had also through a farmer friend come to understand the  farm sector's critical views on the matter.    The Better Alternative -- a European Finland, Inc. citizens'  delegation and the coalition government have also in excellent  fashion described how EU membership is dividing the parties, on  the one hand, and, on the other, is uniting people from groups  with the most divergent backgrounds. For example, RKP [Swedish  People's Party] MP Eeva Biaudet, Left League Governor Kalevi  Kivisto, Finnish Center Party MP Olli Rehn, Greens MP Paavo  Nikula, Conservative Party power figure Ilkka Suominen, who is  soon to leave parliament, as well as bank director Kalevi Sorsa,  an important and influential Social Democrat, are on the  citizens' delegation committee. Each of them also has party  comrades among the opponents of EU membership.    The plethora of civic movements, of course, reflects  citizens' interest in the issue and because of that division is  not necessarily regarded as a bad thing in either camp. After  all, aside from affording them the possibility of applying for  money, it also provides more and more of those holding different  opinions with a goal they can identify with and a channel for  taking action.  <H5>  Europeans or Tenant Farmers? </H5>   So far no action group has succeeded in assembling a large  number of members. No to the EU is the biggest with about 4,000  members. Better Alternative -- a European Finland has just  started to recruit members. There are from 300 to 400 members in  the Yes to Europe group.    The activities of all the organizations are at present being  hampered by uncertainty as to when the promised referendum will  be held. Once that is decided on, a lot of money will also be  applied for -- how it will be divided up among supporters and  opponents is uncertain at this point.    Unanimity extends only to the yes-or-no level and in one  sense the civic movements that have arisen now are disposable  goods. If and when the Finns take their place in the EU, they  will certainly soon be arguing just as cleverly as before. But  not necessarily in the organs of the Community. We must believe  that Finns in Brussels would above all be Finns.    In Kalevi Sorsa's opinion, a certain reference group within  which Finland would probably be operating is even now evident:  The Nordic countries, Germany, and Austria are societies with  which Finland can enter into geographical and business-based  cooperation. Social thinking and equality are those areas in  which Finland could serve as a leading or exemplary country in  the EU.    Finland would also be able to provide its experience as a  builder of bridges between East and West. "At the same time our  own security will be best served," Sorsa felt. In his opinion,  staying out of the Union would mean identifying with a group in  which Finland does not belong.    "Unthinkable. I look on anyone who with open eyes advocates  that Finland join the EU as a traitor," Keijo Korhonen of  Kajaani lashed out. He can only explain supporters' behavior as  the gullibility of primitive tenant farmer folk.    "Sheep have to be treated like sheep: with an ax to the  head." Korhonen condemned them and insinuated that he could  certainly brush the EU-Finland dust off their birchbark shoes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 2 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng said  that better Sino-U.S. relations would create favorable  conditions for the U.S. enterprises to expand business in China.    In an hour-long meeting with Cyrus Vance, former U.S.  secretary of state today, Li noted that many big U.S.  companies have submitted tenders for infrastructural projects  in China.    He said that China and the U.S. are complementary to each  other economically, noting that the U.S. has a very strong  economic force and is a leader in hi-tech and infrastructure  while China enjoys sustained economic growth and has a vast  market, rich resource of manpower and fairly strong technical  force.    Therefore, he said, the two sides can accomplish much in  launching multi-form economic and technical cooperation.    He reaffirmed that China attaches great importance to its  relations with the U.S. and hopes that such ties will turn for  the better.    As China and the U.S. are big and influential powers,  statesmen of the two sides should look towards the future and  even to the 21st century while handling their bilateral  relations, the premier said.    Li also briefed the visitor on the reform of China's  taxation  system, policies for absorbing foreign funds, the role played by  the People's Bank of China as the central bank and how the  interest rates are fixed.    Vance told Li that he saw tremendous changes in Beijing. He  expressed the conviction that when in Shanghai, he would see  even greater development and prosperity.    Vance said he knows that President Clinton wants very much  to  establish a stable and healthy relationship with China.    He believed that there would be further development of the  mutually-beneficial U.S.-China cooperation in various fields.    Li Peng recalled that the doors between China and the U.S.  were opened when the Republicans were in power and the  diplomatic relations were established while the Democrats were  in office.    Therefore, "we have many friends in both parties in the  U.S.," Li said.    Vance said that the two parties are of the same opinion that  no matter which party is in power, the U.S. will continue to  work to promote relations with China.</p>

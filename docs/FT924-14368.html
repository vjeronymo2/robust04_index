			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Blystad directors fight takeover INDEPENDENT directors at Blystad Group are continuing their rearguard action to thwart Mr Alistair Locke's takeover of the oil service group that has paid no dividend for seven years. The directors yesterday recommended that minority holders reject the offer from Mr Locke's private company, Abbot Holdings, which declared its Pounds 7.5m bid for Blystad unconditional this week. In a letter to shareholders they said Mr Locke's unquoted redeemable preference shares in place of the quoted Blystad shares were a 'totally inadequate substitute.' Mr Locke will gain management control after three of the Norwegian Blystad family directors, who control 62 per cent of the shares, accepted the offer. Blystad shareholders were being asked to give up shares in a company with real assets for shares in an unquoted company with no assets, the letter said. Furthermore, any payment on Abbot's preference shares would have to be funded from Blystad's own resources. 'As an existing shareholder in Blystad you already own those assets and any profits they generate,' the letter said. The rearguard action threatens to prevent Mr Locke from being able to take Blystad private to sort out a group that has one of the rockier history's in the offshore oil industry. A high level of rejection of the offer will leave Mr Locke with an expensive public quote to maintain and a potentially obstructive minority shareholder base who have probably already written off the value of their shares. Blystad shares closed yesterday at 1 1/2 p.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DRINKING DRIVERS NOW FACE GREATER ARREST RISK;  </P> <P> THE LAW: A 13.8% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE JAILED IN THE COUNTY SINCE  THE BLOOD-ALCOHOL LIMIT DROPPED TO 0.08% HAS NOT MEANT A SIMILAR RISE IN  PROSECUTIONS.  </P> <P> Drunk driving arrests in Ventura County have increased almost 14% this year  since a new law went into effect lowering the legal blood alcohol level for  driving under the influence.  </P> <P> The increase in the county is only slightly lower than a 16% increase reported  statewide by the California Highway Patrol, but twice the 7% increase in Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> Since the new law which lowered the legal intoxication level from 0.10%  blood-alcohol to 0.08% went into effect Jan. 1, arrests in Ventura County have  increased by 13.85%, from 2,108 in the first nine months of 1989 to 2,400 in  the same period of 1990.  </P> <P> So far, however, the increase in arrests has not resulted in a similar increase  in prosecutions by the Ventura County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office prosecuted 7,614 drunk driving cases last year  and by Aug. 31 this year had filed 4,907 cases -- roughly the same rate of  prosecution, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials said the prosecution rate in Ventura County has  remained stable partly because county prosecutors have always been tough on  prosecuting drunk drivers.  </P> <P> According to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, drunk drivers also receive  tougher sentences in Ventura County than in most other counties.  </P> <P> Bradbury, who as part of a general policy against plea bargaining refuses to  let drunk drivers plead guilty to lesser charges, said he would like to see the  legal intoxication limit dropped to 0.00%.  </P> <P> Even before the legal limit was dropped, state, county and local police  officers in Ventura County sometimes arrested drivers with blood-alcohol levels  as low as 0.07% and 0.06%.  </P> <P> In other counties such drivers can nearly always plead guilty to reduced  charges or have their cases dismissed, law enforcement officials said. But here  the police "know we'll prosecute those cases," Bradbury said.  </P> <P> The conviction rate is high. Of the 191 felony drunk driving cases filed in  1989, 118 have gone to court so far; 113 defendants pleaded guilty, three were  convicted, two cases were dismissed and four cases were reduced to  misdemeanors, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Totten said. None were acquitted, said  Totten, who oversees prosecution of felony drunk driving cases.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of 1990, 153 cases were filed; 88 of those charged  pleaded guilty, two were convicted, one case was dismissed for lack of evidence  and four were reduced to misdemeanors. None was acquitted, Totten said. The  average prison term was 28.75 months and the average jail sentence was 346  days.  </P> <P> Sentences in Ventura County are generally stiffer than elsewhere in the state,  officials said. Judges usually give 48-hour jail terms to first-time drunk  driving convicts who by law are eligible for a 90-day license restriction  instead.  </P> <P> Drunk driving convicts in Los Angeles County's Newhall Municipal Court usually  receive the license restriction instead of jail time, said Pamela Davis  Springer, the court's deputy district attorney-in-charge.  </P> <P> The tough atmosphere in Ventura County has kept the prosecution rate for drunk  driving cases stable despite the new law, said county Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward  F. Brodie, chief of the office's misdemeanor division.  </P> <P> Unlike other counties, Brodie said, drunk driving suspects here are not allowed  to plead guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving with alcohol, or "wet  reckless," as it is known.  </P> <P> "Counties like L.A. would give you a wet reckless at 0.12%," he said. "But as  far as we were concerned if the reports indicated driving impairment in the  field sobriety tests even if the blood-alcohol was below 0.10%, we'd file the  case. And we won a substantial number of those cases . . . . Juries in our  county take a hard look at DUI drivers. And we also take a hard look at them."  </P> <P> Brodie said that 5% to 10% of drunk driving cases filed here last year were  against drivers whose blood-alcohol content was below the then-legal  intoxication level of 0.10%.  </P> <P> This year, about 2% of the cases in this county are being filed against drivers  who test below the new level of 0.08%, he said.  </P> <P> "Under a 0.08% it becomes extremely difficult to prove impairment," Brodie  said. "Below that level you're looking at a lot of people sitting at the  two-beer level, depending on their weight . . . . We try to weed those cases  out at the filing stage."  </P> <P> County criminalist Norman Fort said the knowledge that Ventura County has a  tough approach to drunk driving probably keeps some drinkers off the road, but  he said society is changing, too, and tolerance of drunk driving is declining  steadily.  </P> <P> "If you're going to drink and drive you'd better do it in L.A. County; the odds  of you being arrested there are much less," said Fort, who oversees  blood-alcohol testing for the sheriff's crime lab. "And the odds of you being  prosecuted here are much higher. We don't take plea bargains; we don't take wet  reckless as a plea or dry reckless like they do in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley said the atmosphere of intolerance may  drive some people with defensible cases to plead guilty.  </P> <P> Farley worked as a deputy public defender from 1978 to 1986 in Orange County,  where she said drunk driving charges often were reduced to wet reckless.  </P> <P> In Ventura County, she said, private attorneys often visit the public  defender's office for insight on their clients' drunk driving cases.  </P> <P> When the lawyers learn the district attorney is dead serious about prosecuting  even the low-level cases, they're shocked, Farley said.  </P> <P> The county's tough prosecution policies drew criticism from Mark S. Borrell,  president of the Ventura County Criminal Defense Lawyers Assn.  </P> <P> "In Santa Barbara the district attorneys are interested in talking about cases,  trying to work out cases and reach dispositions that seem appropriate," said  Borrell, who defends drunk driving suspects here and in Santa Barbara County.  </P> <P> "Down here in Ventura, essentially, once a case has been filed nobody wants to  talk about it any more, so it goes to trial . . . . We have a court system  that's already overloaded, and forcing cases to trial only adds fuel to that  fire."  </P> <P> Borrell also blamed Bradbury's stated no plea-bargaining policy for some of the  court's backlog.  </P> <P> But Bradbury said tougher courtrooms mean safer streets.  </P> <P> "What we've tried to do for a long time is change this perception that you can  drink and still be safe to drive," Bradbury said. "The scientific and medical  data now indicates that you're an unsafe driver at 0.04%."  </P> <P> Felony Supervisor Totten said the office's hard-nosed attitude is meant to  shake even the most irredeemable alcoholics' beliefs about drinking and  driving.  </P> <P> "For a person to change his behavior and go dry, he has to hit bottom, and we  like to think that one of the things that criminal prosecution does is raise  the bottom for people," Totten said. "Where there are still that hard-core  group that will continue to drink, regardless, a lot of people who do get sent  to prison are going to change their behavior."  </P></p>

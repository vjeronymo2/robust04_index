			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Clerides victory may harden stance on Cyprus talks at UN THE surprise victory of Mr Glafcos Clerides in Sunday's presidential election in Cyprus could lead to a harder Greek Cypriot stance in United Nations-sponsored talks on reuniting the island. Mr Clerides, the veteran leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party, edged out Mr George Vassiliou, the incumbent, by a margin of less than one percentage point. The result, determined by fewer than 2,000 votes, upset opinion poll forecasts that Mr Vassiliou would win by a comfortable margin. Mr Vassiliou, backed by the Cyprus communist party and many Socialist voters, held a seven percentage point lead after the first-round ballot. The change of leadership may mean that the next round of UN-sponsored talks on reuniting Cyprus, set for March, is delayed while Mr Clerides works out a new negotiating policy. Mr Clerides, a 73-year-old lawyer making his third bid for the presidency, served as chief Greek Cypriot negotiator in talks with the Turkish Cypriots in the 1960s and early 1970s. He is considered to have a realistic approach to solving the division of the island. However, he may be constrained by his party's alliance with the centre-right Diko, which is unwilling to make concessions to the Turkish Cypriot minority in northern Cyprus. Prominent members of Diko are expected to be offered senior jobs in the administration. Mr Clerides has said he wants to change the 'set of ideas' developed by Mr Vassiliou and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, as a basis for making Cyprus a federated state with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living in separate zones. Mr Clerides wants to improve the terms on which Greek-owned property occupied by Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus would be returned or compensated for. Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, responded to the news of Mr Clerides' election by asking to meet him ahead of talks in New York.</p>

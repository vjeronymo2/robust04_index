			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Wembley Trail: Legacy of ill-judged expansion - Debt mountain Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley, is frank about how the stadium and greyhound track operator saddled itself with a mountain of debt. 'We made some appallingly timed acquisitions and bought stuff for cash when plainly we shouldn't have.' In a four-year spree between 1988 and 1991, Wembley spent more than Pounds 130m to expand from a London-based venue business into an international leisure group. The group bought overseas betting equipment manufacturers, a disco and hospitality company, five US greyhound tracks, catering interests, a film distributor and ticketing operations. At the same time, it also invested heavily in improving its flagship assets  -the famous north London soccer stadium, conference centre and exhibition halls. But then a combination of rising interest rates and recession began to undermine the strategy. 'We hit the recession at 100 miles an hour with a weak balance sheet,' Sir Brian admitted. By the end of December last year, net borrowings stood at Pounds 152.1m  - equivalent to almost three times shareholders' funds. Under that debt burden, the balance sheet proved too weak to absorb large property write-downs, which Wembley made this year following its first valuation in three years. The value put on its net assets tumbled from Pounds 175.1m to Pounds 62.8m, forcing the group to put a Pounds 48.3m loss through its profit and loss account as an exceptional charge. The group, meanwhile, embarked on a round of disposals to meet bank demands for a Pounds 40m debt repayment earlier this year. Interests in catering, discos, films and ticketing have all been sold or heavily diluted. With another Pounds 30m debt repayment due at the end of the year, Wembley is now considering selling the US greyhound tracks - acquired for Dollars 92.5m (Pounds 57.8m) in 1989. Sir Brian, who is thought to be negotiating with possible bidders in the US, said: 'If you add up all the disposals, we might be 10 or 15 per cent down (on what was paid) in one way or another.' 'But the devastating loss was on the property,' he added, referring to the impact of last year's revaluation on the balance sheet and the P&amp;L. With pre-exceptional operating profits failing to meet interest payments last year, a capital reconstruction with the banks swapping debt for equity is one of the few options left. The Wembley chairman has no illusions about the challenge. 'We need a substantial infusion of new equity. This is not a sticking plaster, it's a total care package.'</p>

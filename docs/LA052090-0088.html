			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GROSS LOSES NO-HITTER, BUT HE STILL BEATS GIANTS  </P> <P> Kevin Gross could only wonder if the way he lost his bid for a no-hitter  Saturday at San Francisco was really fair.  </P> <P> Gross pitched a perfect six innings in the Montreal Expos' 7-4 victory over the  Giants, but he walked the first batter in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> Will Clark hit a roller to first baseman Andres Galarraga that appeared to be  the first out. But umpire Greg Bonin called it foul over the objections of the  Expos.  </P> <P> Given a second chance, Clark lined the next pitch to right for the Giants'  first hit. Apparently upset, Gross (5-2) didn't even make it through the inning  before he needed help.  </P> <P> He gave up three runs and two hits before Tim Burke replaced him with one  batter retired. Burke gave up a run in the ninth inning but earned his ninth  save.  </P> <P> "It looked to me like Kevin lost his concentration after walking (Brett) Butler  on four pitches," Manager Bob Rodgers of the Expos said. "You can't pitch with  more complete command than he did for six innings."  </P> <P> Roger Craig, whose team had won four games in a row, agreed.  </P> <P> "Gross had great stuff," he said. "He had a good slider and a cut fastball. He  had great command of everything until the last inning."  </P> <P> After Clark spoiled his no-hitter, Gross walked Kevin Mitchell and Kevin Bass  followed with a two-run double. Burke took over and a run scored on an infield  out before he got out of the inning.  </P> <P> "The ball was getting up there in a hurry," Gross said. "I was able to keep  them off balance. I had a real good fastball. I mixed my pitches, I threw  strikes and I kept the big hitters from hitting the ball out of the park."  </P> <P> In ending their four-game losing streak, the Expos jumped on Bob Knepper (2-2)  for three runs in the second inning. Knepper hurt his own cause with  consecutive balks.  </P> <P> Tim Raines, who had three hits, singled in the third inning, advanced to third  on a wild pitch and scored on a groundout.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 4, St. Louis 0 -- The Reds have the best record in the majors --  25-8 -- despite playing much of the season without center fielder Eric Davis  and their best starting pitcher, Danny Jackson.  </P> <P> One of the main reasons has been Jack Armstrong. Armstrong, getting a chance to  start because of Jackson's injury, pitched a four-hitter at Cincinnati to  improve his record to 7-1.  </P> <P> Armstrong, who had won six games in parts of the last two seasons, gave up two  of the hits in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> In 28 starts for the Reds, Armstrong never made it through the eighth inning.  </P> <P> Rolando Roomes, playing because Davis is hurt, hit a three-run home run off  John Tudor in the fifth inning to break a scoreless tie.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week Tudor, who won his first four starts, said he wasn't sure  he had enough strength in his arm to get the ball to the plate. But, he went  six innings, giving up six hits and three runs, two earned.  </P> <P> The Reds are making a runaway of the West. Jackson returns and will start  today. Davis, who came off the disabled list Saturday, said he is ready to  play.  </P> <P> Atlanta 2, Pittsburgh 1 -- Tom Glavine lost his shutout in the ninth inning at  Atlanta, but reliever Joe Hesketh saved the victory.  </P> <P> Glavine (2-2), coming off four consecutive no-decisions, had a six-hitter  through eight innings, but he gave up a walk and a hit and Hesketh came in.  </P> <P> Gary Redus beat out a bunt to load the bases. Bobby Bonilla struck out. A force  out scored a run, but Don Slaught grounded out.  </P> <P> The first Atlanta run scored when Andres Thomas hit into a double play in the  fourth inning. Jim Presley homered in the eighth for the other run.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Houston 1 -- Andre Dawson hit a two-run homer and a sacrifice fly at  Houston to take over the major league RBI lead with 38 and help Les Lancaster  improve to 3-1.  </P> <P> Lancaster, who was recently moved out of the bullpen into the starting  rotation, gave up eight hits and a run. Mitch Williams held the Astros hitless  for the final 1 2/3 innings to get his eighth save.  </P> <P> New York 6, San Diego 4 -- Kevin Elster hit a three-run home run and David Cone  pitched a strong eight innings at San Diego as the Mets ended an eight-game  road losing streak.  </P> <P> The Mets built a 6-1 lead, but John Franco got the final out with the potential  tying run on base.

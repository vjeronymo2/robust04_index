			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: A trolley-full of worries for supermarkets - London WE MAY soon learn the answer to one of the stock market's most intriguing questions: was the 1980s success of the three big UK supermarket chains the result of outstanding management or dumb luck? Success there certainly was: the collective market capitalisation of Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll rose from around Pounds 2bn in 1983 to over Pounds 17bn earlier this year. There was good management, too: the three chains are world leaders in developing own-brand goods, they enjoy margins that are the envy of overseas rivals, and they have transformed UK shopping. But are those margins, and that leap in market capitalisation, due solely to management skill, or did luck and British planning restrictions play a decisive role? The question was given fresh pertinence this week by the 5 per cent drop in the shares of Tesco, the industry's number two. On Tuesday, the company announced disappointing interim profits, a rise of only 3.4 per cent though turnover rose 9.5 per cent. More important, it finally admitted that the new wave of discount stores were enough of a threat to warrant a fierce competitive response. As the chart shows, the glamour of the supermarkets has been fading for much of the year; for Tesco it became tarnished more than 12 months ago. The scale of the market's worries can best be judged, however, by looking at Sainsbury, by any reckoning one of the great British growth companies of recent decades. This year, Sainsbury shares have been selling at a sustained discount to the market as a whole for the first time in recent memory. Throughout the last two decades, Sainsbury has almost always sold at a price / earnings ratio well above the market average, often double it. You can now buy Sainsbury shares for 14 1/2 times current earnings, when the figure for the market as a whole is 19 1/2 . (Tesco's p/e ratio is 9, less than half that of the market.) The yield figures tell a similar story. At the turn of the year, Sainsbury was selling at a yield of less than half the market average. Now, it is yielding 3.0 per cent, at a time when the market yield is 3.8 per cent, a difference of only a quarter. The gap has been closing inexorably. For Tesco, it has closed already: its shares are yielding 4.6 per cent, a fifth higher than the market as a whole. One way of looking at the change in sentiment is to examine the real cause of the chains' remarkable profitability in the 1980s. Part of it, no doubt, was due to innovation and good logistics management. But part of it was due to the nature of the British food retailing market: a semi-cartel enforced by the planning authorities. Planning regulations made suitable sites for huge modern supermarkets very hard to come by. Only the big groups had the expertise in coping with the regulations and - more important - the deep pockets necessary to pay the high prices that tight planning restrictions ensured for the few available sites. The big chains raised ever larger lumps of capital to buy their way to an ever larger market share. Some of their managers, at least, put pressure on suppliers to restrict shipments to rivals who wished to compete on price. Instead, the big three chose to compete on innovation, location and ambience, a recipe for a stable and profitable industry. The two next-biggest chains, Asda and Gateway, were slipping behind in the capital spending race, so the big three could continue to achieve steady growth, even though total food sales were essentially static. In the last few years, almost all those trends have started to move into reverse. The arrival of European discounters like Netto and Aldi raises the spectre of sustained competition on price from companies that are not likely to be intimidated by suppliers' pressure. US 'warehouse clubs' such as Costco threaten to make the supermarket chains' mastery of the site acquisition irrelevant, since if classified as wholesalers rather than retailers they are not subject to such tight planning restrictions. Asda and Gateway, back from the dead, are no longer easy targets. Customers' value perceptions have been changed by the recession. And the property slump has put a question mark over the price at which supermarket sites are carried in the chains' books. In short, once an industry's luck turns, even the best-managed companies suffer the consequences. The market as a whole managed, however, to shrug off worries about food retailing with as much aplomb as it ignored the excitements in Moscow. The FT-SE 100 index stayed healthily above 3,000, with traders taking comfort from revised economic figures that showed much stronger growth in gnp and corporate profits in the first half of the year than earlier estimates had suggested. Another statistical source of cheerfulness was the revelation, from the figures on institutional liquidity, of just how much money UK fund managers had been pumping into domestic equities and gilts. In the first half of the year, UK institutions made Pounds 24bn in net new investment, almost half as much again as in the same period in 1992. The consensus still seemed to be that the tone of companies' comments during the interim results season had been disappointing. The steady flow of medium-sized rights issues has continued - on Tuesday, for instance, Tarmac asked its shareholders for Pounds 215m. But for at least one big broker, James Capel, the results have been coming in slightly ahead of expectations, the first time that has happened since the recession began. And one top investment manager complained this week that the results season had been disappointing largely because it had not produced the drop in share prices that would have provided him with an opportunity for bargain-hunting.</p>

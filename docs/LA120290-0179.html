			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA WINS BEHIND 48 BY LOWERY  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount found the winning combination Saturday, getting 48 points from  Terrell Lowery and pushing the pace to beat Idaho State, 114-110, in the  consolation game of the Freedom Bowl Classic at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Lowery's point total set a tournament and Bren Center record, but the Lions got  big plays from several players down the stretch to improve to 2-3 after Idaho  State (1-3) erased a 13-point second-half deficit and took a two-point lead  with 4:27 to play.  </P> <P> With the Bengals leading, 106-104, Lowery answered with his seventh three-point  basket. The lead seesawed until Christian Scott converted a tough inside shot  and added a free throw to give the Lions the lead for good at 112-110 with 2:07  left.  </P> <P> In the final minute Loyola milked the clock and Brian McCloskey, who had 16  points, put the game away by hitting a jump shot with 35 seconds to play. Scott  blocked the Bengals' last two shot attempts.  </P> <P> Alex Kreps led Idaho State with 26 points.  </P> <P> With the seventh-best scoring total in school history -- and his second game of  40 or more in the last three games -- Lowery hit all 15 free throws and has  made his last 32. The Lions hit 29 of 35 free throws to 20 of 23 for Idaho  State. Lowery had 31 points by halftime, when the Lions led, 61-50.  </P> <P> "What a struggle," a relieved Lion Coach Jay Hillock said. "I'm proud of 'em  'cause they could've cracked and didn't. Our valleys weren't as deep or as  long."  </P></p>

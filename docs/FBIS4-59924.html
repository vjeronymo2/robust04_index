			<p>BFN     [Text] Police Commissioner Asaf Hefetz today disclosed  plans to set up a guard unit to secure the passage from Jericho  to Gaza. The unit, called Safe Passage, will daily guard one of  the four roads on which Palestinians will drive from Gaza to  Jericho. The unit consists of 400 border policemen: two  companies of policemen will drive along the road, and two other  companies will serve as reserves and will be based in Qiryat Gat.    Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin ordered the establishment of this unit to thwart  terror attacks, arms smuggling, and provocations by Jews against  Arabs.</p>

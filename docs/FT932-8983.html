			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Sociable city of counter-cultures - FT Guide to Civilised Breaks / All the world and Nicholas Lander beat a path to Amsterdam OF ALL the European cities, there is an intimacy about Amsterdam that makes it different. It has not got the hard-edged drive of cosmopolitan London or the self-conscious fashionability of Paris. It has not got Florence's art, Madrid's energy, Rome's history, St Petersburg's architecture or Geneva's wealth. What it has is sociability. On a continent of crowded urban anonymity this is indeed a civilised quality; to my mind it makes Amsterdam a splendid choice for a civilised weekend. What is it about Amsterdam that gives it such immediate familiarity? Even on the Leidseplein, the busy commercial entertainment district where I began my weekend wanderings, visitors feel a relaxed spontaneity. This is a city that asks you to let the mask down, to relax your guard, to be just a little bit more your private self in public. Why? Certainly one answer is Amsterdam's scale. This is a small city of human proportions. You can walk across its centre in half an hour. Nowhere will you find the overwhelming, the monumental. The buildings here, like most things Dutch, are plain, functional and without ostentation; they are narrow and rarely more than four stories tall. In a crowded city where space is at a premium, the streets, too, are narrow. Even the city's bright yellow trams are toy-like. Bicycles by the thousand add to this air of domesticity. They are not shiny, hi-tech products but heavy-framed black clonkers. They give the city a wonderfully homey feel. Another answer to Amsterdam's casual, somewhat bohemian atmosphere is its canals, boats and water. The canals give the city its distinctive topography. Radiating outwards in concentric circles from the port, the city's 160 canals are everywhere. But the canals give more than just a physical definition to the city. As any resident of Amsterdam's 2,500 houseboats will tell you, there is something wonderfully soothing and peaceful about a prospect of placid water. Normally, city walking is a tiring business: I found long canal-side walks in Amsterdam refreshing. The essential element to Amsterdam's character, though, lies in its people. Strolling in the sun past the outdoor cafes of the Leidseplein, I had the odd sensation that Amsterdammers could be a Mediterranean people. There is a tremendous sociability about them, an obvious enjoyment found in conversation and in the company of others. Like Latins hundreds of miles to the south, Amsterdammers are cheerful, expressive, energetic and gregarious. There is, however, an essential difference. Underlying this happy countenance is a cool, northern rationality, a social awareness and sense of civic involvement wholly foreign to the egocentricities of the Mediterranean. It is from this strong recognition of a social contract that Amsterdam's renowned liberal tolerance springs. Exactly how a society with morally rigid traditions like Holland's gave birth to a permissive society like Amsterdam's is confusing - Amsterdam made itself the greatest trading city in the 17th century world by virtuous adherence to a Calvinist work ethic. But the basis of capitalism was also the basis of egalitarianism, civic democracy and personal freedom, beginning 300 years ago, when minority groups started to find in Amsterdam the liberty to pursue their ideals. More recently, the city's traditions of tolerance were hijacked by the counter-culture of the 1960s. Easy-going attitudes towards sex, drugs and alternate lifestyles made Amsterdam a world centre for the non-conventional. People poured in from everywhere. Aids, hard drug abuse and economic recession have made youth culture a less flamboyant spectacle. But the young, and those middle-aged Amsterdammers who retain something of the 1960s - no-one seems very old in Amsterdam - continue to exert influence on a city lifestyle that is offbeat, creative and sensitive to social issues. And the world continues to pour in: one out of every four Amsterdammers is an immigrant. Today, tolerance is not just some fanciful notion; it lies at the heart of Amsterdam's survival. It is the spirit of the city that makes Amsterdam so attractive. Walk the streets here and you will see vastly different kinds of people and styles. Yet more conventional Amsterdammers take it all without raising an eyebrow. The best way to experience the city is simply to wander about, have a look at everything, and try whatever you like. Tour-boats are precisely what they sound - touristy. But they are a wonderful way to see Amsterdam. I liked them so much that I went on them twice, once clockwise around the city under brilliant blue skies and sunshine, once anti-clockwise under grey overcast skies. Both moods suit the sombre, liver-coloured brick of the bridges and the austere, white-window-framed, gabled-topped houses that lie to either side. Add leafy canal-side trees, colourful barges and their even more colourful inhabitants, and you have a city that is a delight to explore by boat, on foot, or by bicycle. The great fun of Amsterdam is that all its nonsense - drugs, sex, loony leftism, bohemian living - takes place against a traditional, 17th century background. The restaurants, cafes and coffee shops one floats past in the day take on a life after dark. I became hopelessly lost trying to relocate one attractive cafe, but in the labyrinth of bridges and canals that make up the Jordaan area I found all sorts of compensations. Still a working-class district with a strong local character, the Jordaan quickly became my favourite part of Amsterdam. Rich in small shops, restaurants and 'brown' cafes - bars named for their dingy, old-fashioned decor - it still has an authentic atmosphere. Quite different are the city's designer cafes, steel and glass monuments to modernism. And different again are its 'coffee shops,' where the main interest is not coffee but hashish and marijuana, sold openly and legally. I enjoyed mixing Amsterdam's high culture and pop culture in equal proportions. In the Rijksmuseum I gazed at Rembrandt's Night Watch, Amsterdam's most celebrated painting, but found far more to marvel at in 17th century still life. How did the Dutch masters so precisely capture the texture of things like oyster shells, lemons, pewter, clay pipes, tablecloths? They were magicians. Afterwards, I relaxed on the grass in the nearby Vondelpark, favoured haunt of joggers, frisbee players and sun-worshippers, and gazed at more conventional magicians - the types who use top hats and white rabbits. They are just one of the scores of different kinds of artists, musicians and street entertainers who make modern Amsterdam's sidewalks anything but still life. One could hardly find a more eclectic mix than in Amsterdam. On my last day I spent the morning looking at some of the world's best-loved tableaux at the Van Gogh museum. I passed the afternoon in the red-light district; the spectacle of women in their underwear sitting in windows is matched only by bus-loads of wide-eyed tourists giggling at it all. Early evening found me at the Concertgebouw, home to one of the great orchestras, listening to a chamber music festival. The late evening was spent watching a Jamaican reggae band through clouds of hashish smoke at a club. That is all very well, you might say, but every city in the world has its sacred and profane, its great circus of human variety. And you would be right. But nowhere in the world can you pass with such equanimity from one to the other. Amsterdam may not always be entirely civilised, but it is almost always sociable.

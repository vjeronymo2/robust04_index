			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSTITUTE'S CLAIM STUNS MINISTRY TO RUNAWAYS;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: A MAN, 20, SAYS FATHER RITTER, FOUNDER OF COVENANT HOUSE, GAVE HIM  MONEY AND HAD SEX WITH HIM.  </P> <P> Father Bruce Ritter's network of runaway shelters has made him a hero to  millions, a beacon of hope on the nation's most troubled streets.  </P> <P> Just a month ago, no less a fan than former President Ronald Reagan dropped by  Ritter's New York Covenant House shelter to offer his own hard-luck story as an  inspiration to the youths there. When a temporary Covenant House office opened  in Hollywood early this year, Los Angeles County supervisors proclaimed "Father  Bruce Ritter Day."  </P> <P> But this week, Ritter's reputation, as well as his $85-million-a-year  fund-raising operation, threaten to come crashing down around him.  </P> <P> A 20-year-old male prostitute, who had sought refuge at Covenant House, has  alleged that Ritter funneled at least $25,000 from the program to lavish cash  and other gifts on him as well as pay for his apartment while the two were  engaged in a sexual relationship. The scandal has dominated local television  news and the front pages of New York tabloids.  </P> <P> Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau has confirmed that his office is in  the "earliest stages" of an investigation of Ritter, but declined to comment on  details. He did, however, make the unusual move of condemning unspecified news  accounts as being riddled with "numerous inaccuracies."  </P> <P> The New York Post, which broke the scandal, said the probe has included wiring  the young man with a recording device so that investigators could eavesdrop on  at least one conversation that he had with the priest last month.  </P> <P> Anne Donahue, the executive director of a 20-bed Covenant House shelter that  opened last month on Hollywood Boulevard, said in an interview Friday: "There's  no question in my mind that this will be rapidly cleared up. We all knew the  risk of working with the kids we work with."  </P> <P> Covenant House had initially hoped to make its Los Angeles debut in a much  larger facility. However, it was forced to scale back amid friction with other  youth groups, which had complained that their own operations would fall victim  to Covenant House's superior public relations and political skills.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Ritter held a tearful news conference to deny the allegations of  financial and sexual impropriety, and assert that his worst transgression was  the "almost unforgivable" lapse in judgment he showed in spending two nights  alone with the troubled young man he sought to rescue from the streets.  </P> <P> The 20-year-old prostitute approached Covenant House in New Orleans last  February, seeking protection from the drug dealers and organized crime figures  for whom he worked, Covenant House spokesman John Kells said. He was given the  alias Tim Warner, and sent for protection to New York, where Ritter said he  recognized someone who needed special help.  </P> <P> Ritter said he took the case himself, because "frankly, I had more experience  than anyone else." Kells said it was not unusual for Ritter and other Covenant  House staff members to spend much time, even overnight, with the particularly  troubled young people who are put in its mentoring program.  </P> <P> "The mentors are encouraged to take the kids home and treat them as their own  children," Kells said. Other groups, however, have criticized this approach as  blurring the line between professional and personal involvement.  </P> <P> At the news conference, Ritter produced an independent audit that he said  proved that Covenant House spent only $9,800 to house, employ and help educate  Warner, which is lower than its $15,000 average per case.  </P> <P> When the young man began failing to attend Covenant House-financed classes at  Manhattan College and slipping back into prostitution, Ritter chastised him and  warned that he could face expulsion from the program. At the news conference,  Ritter speculated that this might have caused the bitterness that led the young  man to accuse him of wrongdoing.  </P> <P> However the investigation is ultimately resolved, Ritter told New York Newsday  columnist Dennis Duggan, "it's something I'll have to live with the rest of my  life. I will always see that question in the eyes of people. Did he or didn't  he? I didn't. But I was stupid."  </P> <P> Over more than two decades, Ritter has expanded Covenant House from a one-man  operation in his East Village apartment to a giant network that claims to  rescue, shelter and counsel 25,000 young runaways a year in six U.S. and  Canadian cities and four Central-American countries. Its blue-and-white vans  are a familiar sight, scouring the seediest areas for young runaways who might  need help.  </P> <P> Ritter has been deluged by accolades. In his 1984 State of the Union Address,  Reagan singled Ritter out for special praise. Last month, Ritter, who has often  been compared with the legendary founder of Boys Town, received the Father  Flanagan Award for Service to Youth from that Nebraska boys' home.  </P> <P> But he has also gathered his share of detractors, including those who say that  Covenant House is a monument to Ritter's own ego, and is far less effective  than programs that operate on a smaller scale.  </P> <P> Many of those complaints resurfaced early this year, when Ritter laid plans for  a 100-bed shelter in Hollywood. In a struggle with rival youth programs that  was mediated by City Councilman Michael Woo, Covenant House agreed to start on  a much smaller scale than it had initially planned. Nonetheless, Donahue said,  it is sheltering at least 50 young people a night, in its own facility and  elsewhere, and plans to open other facilities around the city over the next few  years.  </P> <P> Ritter has come up against the most wily of political opponents, and won.  Proving wrong the adage that you can't fight City Hall, he outbid and  outmaneuvered New York Mayor Edward I. Koch in a bitter 1987 battle to buy a  Manhattan building that Koch had wanted to use for jail inmates.  </P> <P> Koch accused Ritter of "dirty pool," but conceded: "I can't win it. . . . It is  very difficult to enter combat with a priest, especially one suffering from  cancer." Ritter has undergone treatment for Hodgkin's disease, a lymphoma which  is now in remission, Covenant House spokesman Kells said.  </P> <P> The current scandal, with its allegations of homosexual behavior by Ritter,  comes at a particularly bad time for the Catholic Church in New York. Last  Sunday, in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, about 4,500 demonstrators  protested the church's policy on AIDS, saying it was an attack on gays.  </P> <P> Chanting protesters also entered the church and lay down in the aisles, forcing  Cardinal John J. O'Connor to interrupt his sermon as they were carried out.  </P> <P> Researcher Lisa Romaine contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the press center of the Kaliningrad Oblast </F> Administration under the "Official" rubric]    [Text] The 31 March 1994 issue of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  published an article entitled "Matochkin's Den." The article  was written by the same authors who prepared the publication  "The Amber Chamber for General Dunayev" in September 1993. The  press center of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration is  authorized to make the following statement:    1. An inquiry into the facts contained in the aforementioned  article was conducted by procuracy. The inquiry did not confirm  that these facts were linked with the head of the Kaliningrad  Oblast Administration [Yuriy Matochkin].    Y. S. Matochkin has brought an action against the newspaper  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Currently, the case is being investigated  by the Krasnopresnenskiy people's court in Moscow. The  respondent (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA) has not appeared before the  court for a single meeting.    2. After the head of the Oblast Administration had sued the  newspaper, he received proposals through different channels to  withdraw his action. Otherwise, they promised to launch a  series of publications "unmasking" him. It is common knowledge  that the authors of the given article were in Kaliningrad  between February and March 1994, when they engaged in collecting  "discrediting" information. The fact that the authors did not  try to meet with either law enforcement officials or the head of  the administration demonstrates their specific orientation.    3. Regarding the contents of the article, it does not  contain a single new fact unknown to the public. The authors  again return to the story about the funds and the establishment  of the RIFK "Alliance." There are the decisions of the  prosecutor, law enforcement institutions, and the Oblast Soviet  of People's Deputies concerning these issues.    4. In our opinion, the emergence of this publication is a  continuation of the planned campaign by a group of defeated  local politicians and representatives of semi-Mafia and Mafia  structures, seeking to seize power in the region. They must be  eager to have a submissive person as oblast leader, so as to be  able to engage in illegal operations unpunished. It is no  accident that attacks on the head of the administration  intensified after his attempts to impose order in the sale of  amber, toughen controls on customs, and vitalize the tax policy.    Given the fact that any calls for honesty and decency are  meaningless with regard to the authors and those who ordered  this publication, the head of the administration reserves the  right to defend his honor and dignity through legal channels.</p>

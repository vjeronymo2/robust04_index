			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--The Arab League Secretariat  General expressed its deep concern over the military  confrontation in Yemen which is threatening its unity, security,  and stability and subjecting the constant Arab efforts to find a  solution for the crisis to failure.    In a statement issued today, the Arab League appealed to all  the Yemeni parties to exercise self-restraint, unite their  ranks, resolve their differences through frankness and dialogue,  and abide by what was agreed on in the Pledge and Agreement  Document signed by the Yemeni brothers in the Jordanian capital,  Amman, on 20 February 1994.    The statement stressed that Yemen's unity is a "national  gain  and a pan-Arab achievement" that should be protected in order to  establish stability and security in Yemen in particular and the  region in general.    It reiterated the need for all the Yemeni parties to protect  the state of unity and overcome all the obstacles and  difficulties that are impeding the attainment of national accord.    The statement declared the Arab League Secretariat General's  readiness to mobilize all its resources in order to help remove  the specter of civil war in fraternal Yemen.</p>

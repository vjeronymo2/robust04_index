			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Malaysia hits at Austria move on timber imports COUNTRIES of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei) have expressed their concern about a recent move by Austria imposing mandatory labelling on all tropical timber imports. Mr Sanusi Junid, Malaysia's agriculture minister, said the Austrian action went against the spirit and content of an agreement reached at the Earth Summit in Rio on the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. Asean took a serious view of the Austrian action, he added. It had agreed to adopt a common stand on the issue, to dissuade other countries from making similar moves against tropical timber products. 'We are of the opinion that if such action is to be imposed, it should also involve temperate timber.' Malaysia, the world's leading exporter of tropical timber, has been at the forefront of a campaign aimed at countering concern about continued logging in the tropical rain forests. It says much of the developed world's criticism about forestry management in Malaysia and other countries is ill informed.</p>

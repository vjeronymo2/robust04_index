			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Victoria election blow to Keating THE re-election prospects of Australia's federal Labor government dimmed yesterday after the opposition conservative parties scored a landslide victory in state elections in Victoria. The Liberal/National party coalition achieved a bigger than expected swing to eject Labor from government in Australia's second most populous state for the first time in 10 years. Counting was still continuing last night, but it appeared that Labor would win less than a quarter of Victoria's 88 state parliament seats. The defeat will be a severe blow to Mr Paul Keating's federal government, which needs to retain several marginal seats in Victoria to win the next national election, due by next June. Labor's federal prospects have also been weakened by a defeat in Tasmania earlier this year, and by its failure to dislodge a minority conservative government in New South Wales. Labor governments in South Australia and Western Australia have also been forced to accept independent support to survive, and both are expected lose state elections next year. Mr Keating played down the Victorian result, claiming it was due largely to local factors which would be forgotten in the federal election. The Victorian Labor government lost significant support as a result of high unemployment and tax increases following heavy losses by state-owned financial institutions. Mr Keating's main hope of rebuilding support in Victoria lies in a confrontation between the conservatives and the trade union movement, which has threatened to oppose proposals for industrial relations reform. Any signs of industrial unrest in Victoria are likely to be portrayed by Labor as a foretaste of what would happen under a conservative government in Canberra.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The State Department  Monday refuted North Korea's claim that the Korean Armistice  Agreement is useless and invalid, affirming that the pact  remains in effect. Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly,  commenting on Pyongyang's statement that the Armistice Agreement  is null and should be replaced by a peace pact, said that "We  cannot accept its claim that the armistice is `useless' or  `invalid.'"    "Our position is that the Armistice Agreement remains in  effect. We are proceeding on that basis," Shelly said.    Pyongyang officials have demanded negotiations with  Washington on the matter, a move interpreted here and in Seoul  as an attempt to blur the current international focus on the  North Korean nuclear row and to engage the United States in yet  another form of dialogue.    North Korea insists that talks on the peace agreement should  be held exclusively between it and the United States since South  Korea is not a signatory of the 1953 armistice pact.    "...We note that in February 1992, North and South Korea  agreed that questions of peace and security on the peninsula  should be resolved primarily through inter-Korean dialogue,"  said Shelly. "We strongly support that approach."    The spokeswoman added that Washington will abort all talks  with Pyongyang if the latter goes ahead and refuels a nuclear  reactor without the presence of International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) experts. North Korean officials have repeatedly  threatened to go ahead with the refueling if the IAEA continues  to make inspection demands on the process.    Reminding that inter-Korean talks can play an important part  in resolving the nuclear impasse, Shelly said Washington hopes  the two Koreas will resume dialogue in the near future.</p>

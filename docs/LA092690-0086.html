			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND / PLAYING THE BARD;  </P> <P> ALL THE CLASSROOM'S A STAGE FOR LESSONS ON SHAKESPEARE;  </P> <P> FOLGER LIBRARY GIVES TEACHERS A CUE ON HOW TO GET HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN ON  THE ACT.  </P> <P> If their kids could see them now: a score of high school teachers of English  slashing at each other with long dowel sticks on the lawn of the usually sedate  Folger Shakespeare Library.  </P> <P> "When do we get to die?" calls out one awkward battler in retreat. A teacher,  looking forlorn, carries her broken stick to the fencing instructor, Michael  Tolaydo, the artistic director of the Maryland Shakespeare Festival. "Teacher,"  she says in mock lament, "I broke my sword." He smiles and hands her a  replacement.  </P> <P> Tolaydo then shows the teachers how to rain blows on each other with their  fists, how to simulate pain and might. "With kids," he goes on, "you give them  a whole bunch of match sticks. When they get hit, yurrrrup." He fakes spitting  out match sticks like broken teeth. "They love it."  </P> <P> The recent shenanigans at the Folger -- the world's most extensive and hallowed  depository of books by and about William Shakespeare -- were far from a lark.  The teachers were slashing and smashing at each other as part of a Folger  program offering new techniques in teaching Shakespeare. These antics reflect  the power of two American phenomena: the persistent fascination with  Shakespeare throughout American history and the recent revolution in the way  many American teachers now teach his plays.  </P> <P> Shakespeare, in fact, is probably more popular in the United States than in his  native England. "In America, almost every high school student has read one or  two plays by Shakespeare," said Tony Hill, director of education for Britain's  famed Royal Shakespeare Company. "That is not true in Britain."  </P> <P> And yet, the works of Shakespeare are too often treated in American schools as  a forbidding text that can only be deciphered with eye-squinting footnotes, as  a dreaded store of formidable and boring exercises to memorize.  </P> <P> To free Shakespeare, the Folger Library's staff and many educators have been  campaigning to move him from the textbook to a makeshift stage in every  classroom, to encourage children to understand Shakespeare by acting him out.  For seven years, the library has invited small groups of high school teachers  for summer courses in new techniques of presenting plays to pupils.  </P> <P> "I think the best way to learn Shakespeare is for kids to get up and do it,"  Peggy O'Brien, the director of the Folger's education department, told the  teachers. "So we get goofy things like seventh-grade kids dressed in bedsheets  and Nikes acting as Romans. But it's great. It's his words in their mouths."  </P> <P> Shakespeare has long been popular in America. He was first venerated by the  Establishment as the preeminent poet in the English language. Thomas Jefferson,  outlining the proper education for young lawyers in the 18th Century, urged  them to study Shakespeare night and day. He and John Adams visited  Shakespeare's birthplace in 1786 and chipped a piece off one of his chairs for  a souvenir.  </P> <P> Under the influence of Shakespeare admirer Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Clay  Folger, president and chairman of Standard Oil, assembled the world's largest  collection of rare editions of Shakespeare's works and then built the Folger  Library for them, a marble building that fits easily into the assembly of  houses of government on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> In its educational program this year, mostly funded by a $200,000 grant from  the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Folger Library combined its  resources with those of Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company for the first time.  As a result, 15 British high school teachers joined 25 American high school  teachers in the month of studies at Stratford-on-Avon in England and at the  Folger Library in Washington. The teachers studied acting techniques,  curriculum development and text analysis and watched performances by the Royal  Shakespeare Company.  </P> <P> But the teachers probably gained the greatest insight into teaching Shakespeare  by acting out the plays. Susan Carol Ledford of Flathead High School in  Kalispell, Mont., who had taken the part of Lord Capulet in a makeshift  performance of "Romeo and Juliet," said: "When I see a play of Shakespeare now,  I see it in a whole new way."  </P> <P> O'Brien, who started out as a high school teacher of English two decades ago  and joined the Folger staff in 1981, believes Ledford's pupils will see it in a  whole new way as well. "There's an affinity between Shakespeare and kids," she  said, because children can relate to his language when spoken aloud. "Kids can  memorize rap in 10 minutes," she said. "The key for the kids to make the  connection with Shakespeare is to put his words in their mouths.  </P> <P> "Teachers have been acting out Shakespeare for years," O'Brien added. "I didn't  invent the idea. Shakespeare did."  </P></p>

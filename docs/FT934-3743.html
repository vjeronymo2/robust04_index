			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: UBS to sell kinegram gold bar Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the leading suppliers of small gold bars to the retail market, has launched a new line of bars designed to foil the forger and tamperer, and attract new custom to the lacklustre gold trade. The bars feature a highly complex, multi-coloured hologram-like pattern on one face. The recently developed technology, called kinegram, is used on some banknotes and security documents and is virtually impossible to copy. The kinegram is very sensitive to disturbance. Anyone attempting to take some of the gold out of a small bar and substitute tungsten or another similarly dense metal would cause a distortion to the pattern that would be visible to the naked eye. UBS said that the level of forgeries in the world retail gold bar market was still low, but it wanted to prevent it from growing. The company also clearly wanted to give its gold bar marketing a lift. Mr Fabio Torboli, an executive of the World Gold Council participating in the launch, described the new bars as great fun. 'This market needed an innovation,' Mr Torboli said. He predicted that the new bars would not take away from sales of other gold products, but would bring in new buyers. Mr Urs Seiler, the bank's metal trade manager, said the premium charge for the new bars would average 3 per cent of the price of the underlying gold, only 0.3 per cent higher than on ordinary bars. UBS was counting on higher volume making the development worthwhile, he said. Initially, the kinegrams will appear on five gram, 20 gram and one ounce bars, but UBS said it intended ultimately to put them on all its bars. They will be produced at the UBS gold refinery at Mindrisio near the Italian border.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 6TH-SEEDED MAYOTTE OUSTED IN FIRST ROUND OF AUSTRALIAN OPEN  </P> <P> Teen-ager Pete Sampras served notice that another U.S. tennis star was rising  by outlasting sixth-seeded Tim Mayotte 7-6 6-7 4-6 7-5 12-10 today in an  all-American clash in the first round of the Australian Open.  </P> <P> Spain's Emilio Sanchez, seeded seventh, was another opening-day victim,  succumbing to big-serving Frenchman Jean Fleurian, ranked 57 in the world, by  6-2 6-4 6-4.  </P> <P> Steffi Graf, the queen of women's tennis, survived a scare in the second set  against 17-year-old American Carrie Cunningham, trading hammer forehands for 75  minutes before winning 6-2 7-5 on a day that mixed rain and sunny spells.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl, the men's top seed and defending champion, found his best form  elusive but moved safely into the second round of the first grand slam  tournament of the 1990s, beating American Jim Pugh 6-3 6-2 6-4.  </P> <P> Sampras took four hours and 45 minutes to wrap up his second victory in six  days over Mayotte, who signed his own death warrant by serving double faults on  the final two points.  </P> <P> Despite earlier saving himself with an ace on his second serve on match point  against him, Mayotte was left regretting his frail second serve that caused him  to serve 11 double faults in the protracted final set.  </P> <P> "It's a real Achilles' heel for me," said Mayotte, who had appeared well beaten  at 4-1 down in the final set before rain caused a 26-minute interruption.  </P> <P> "It's tough because I've trained as hard as I've ever trained for two months  and was very excited at coming down here. That's the way the chips fall, I  guess."  </P> <P> The 18-year-old Sampras, who initially came to prominence by beating Mats  Wilander in last year's U.S. Open, admitted the match could easily have swung  the other way.  </P> <P> "I was very lucky," he said. "But most of the guys on the tour know Tim has a  pretty shaky second serve, especially in tight situations."  </P> <P> Graf, who has not dropped a set in winning two successive titles here, lost her  touch for several games in the second set to present the left-handed Cunningham  with a 5-2 lead.  </P> <P> But the moment of truth proved too much for the 1988 U.S. Open junior champion,  and the West German world No. 1 conceded just five more points before wrapping  up victory in a thrilling match with two successive aces.  </P> <P> "It's everyone's nightmare to play Steffi in the first round, but I was proud  of the way I played," said Cunningham, 17. "I couldn't believe it when I was  5-2 up. I was so astonished I think that's what made me start making errors."  </P> <P> Lendl, who came close to collapse last year from heat exhaustion, played during  the hottest part of the day and wore a Foreign Legionnaire-type hat to ward off  the sun.  </P> <P> He broke Pugh, who won the 1988 and 1989 doubles titles with fellow American  Rick Leach, in Pugh's opening service game and quickly wrapped up the first  set.  </P> <P> The second set resembled a comedy of errors with both players drawing groans  from the crowd with a welter of unforced mistakes before Lendl grabbed the  vital break in the fifth game.  </P> <P> Lendl attributed his unimpressive showing to his early departure in last week's  New South Wales Open where he was beaten in the quarterfinals by France's  Yannick Noah.  </P> <P> "I had too much stored energy and I was over-hitting like crazy," Lendl told  journalists.  </P></p>

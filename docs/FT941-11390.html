			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Level of bank's doubtful loans Sir, In his article, 'BCI improves 1.8 per cent to L268bn' (January 27), Robert Graham says: 'The proportion of doubtful loans in BCI's portfolio rose to 3.3 per cent from 2.9 per cent - but this was almost the average percentage for the Italian banking system.' Although the figures are correct for BCI's domestic loans (the figures for all loans are 2.8 per cent in 1993, compared with 2 per cent in 1992), the comment comparing them with the Italian banking system is misleading. In October 1993 (the most recent date for which figures are available), BCI's doubtful loans were actually around half the level of those for the Italian banking system as a whole, which were 6.4 per cent, compared with 5.7 per cent in 1992.

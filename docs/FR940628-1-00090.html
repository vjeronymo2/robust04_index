			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) The surfaces of the areas on the platform(s) where the tires of the test vehicle rest are in the same plane at all times during the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The surface of each tire contact area is smooth, cold rolled finished, unpainted steel. The surface of the platform(s) is dry and free of corrosion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The table is able to rotate about a longitudinal axis not less than 50 degrees from the horizontal position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The axes of rotation are horizontal and parallel to one of the sides of the tilt table platform(s). If rotation is accomplished via hinges, all of the hinge axes of rotation are collinear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The rate of rotation is constant and does not exceed 0.25 degree per second.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) The tilt table platform has a 2.5 centimeter high trip rail for each of the vehicle's axles. Each trip rail is parallel to the axis of rotation of the table and is able to move perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The length of each trip rail is equal to or greater than the diameter of the tire on the vehicle to be tested. The trip rail surface facing the tire is parallel to the axis of rotation of the table and perpendicular to the table surface. The trip rail does not move during a test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) If the tilt table has a vehicle restraint system to prevent the test vehicle from falling off the platform during a test, the restraint system shall allow all tires on the uphill side of the test vehicle to lift at least 0.33 meter off the platform(s). The portion of the restraint system supported by the test vehicle when the uphill tires have lifted off the platform(s) shall weigh no more than 6.75 kilograms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) The tilt table instrumentation consists of means to measure the angle of the platform(s) from the horizontal and one contact switch under each of the uphill side tires to indicate when each tire has lifted off its platform surface contact area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vehicle <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) The test vehicle has all fluids, other than fuel, at the full level. The fuel tank and the fuel system are filled as specified in S7.1.1 and S7.1.2 of &sect;571.301 of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The vehicle's seat is positioned according to S8.1.2 and S8.1.3 of &sect;571.208 of this title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Tires used during the test are of the same size and construction recommended by the manufacturer for the vehicle. The tires have accumulated not less than 80 and not more than 1620 kilometers. Not less than 80 of those kilometers are accumulated at a speed of not less than 80 kilometers per hour. All tires are clean and dry. All tires are inflated to the vehicle tire manufacturer's recommended inflation pressure for maximum vehicle loading and measured when the tire is cold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) All vehicle openings (doors, windows, hood, trunk, convertible top, etc) are in the closed position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Load <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A Hybrid III Test Dummy, as defined in Subpart E of &sect;572 of this title, is placed in the left front seating position, positioned according to S11 of &sect;571.208 of this title, and secured with the vehicle's safety belt system, whether manual or automatic. The dummy may be placed in the test vehicle before or after moving the vehicle on to the tilt table. The test vehicle carries no load other than the test dummy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ambient conditions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The tilt table test is conducted with both the vehicle and the tilt table at a temperature not less than 4 and not more than 39 degrees Celsius. Air motion around the vehicle and tilt table is less than 6 kilometers per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Test Procedure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vehicle Positioning <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) The test vehicle is positioned on the tilt table such that the vehicle's longitudinal axis is parallel to the axis of rotation of the table and the left side of the vehicle is positioned such that the driver's side of the vehicle will be on the low side when the table is tilted. The wheels are parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) After the vehicle has been positioned in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the engine is turned off. For automatic transmission vehicles, the transmission is in Park or, if the vehicle does not have a Park position, the transmission is placed in the Neutral position and the parking brake applied such that the vehicle does not roll during the test. For manual transmission vehicles, the transmission is in first gear and the parking brake is applied such that the vehicle does not roll during the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The front trip rail is moved until it is just touching the driver's side front tire of the test vehicle, then locked in place. The rear trip rail is moved until it is just touching the driver's side rear tire of the test vehicle, then locked in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Testing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) Each tilt table test consists of six tilts. The positioning of the test vehicle on the tilt table and the contents of the vehicle are not adjusted between tilts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For each tilt, the platform is rotated from the horizontal until all of the uphill tires on the test vehicle have lifted off the platform, as indicated by the contact switches under the uphill tires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The platform angle at which the last tire lifts off the platform is the TTA of the vehicle for that tilt. The vehicle shall then be returned to the horizontal position at a rate not to exceed 0.25 degrees per second.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The lowest TTA of the last three tilts in the six-tilt series is the TTA for the tested vehicle. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on June 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15598 Filed 6&hyph;23&hyph;94; 11:51 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

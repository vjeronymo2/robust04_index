			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Border and CLT in radio licence link Border Television, one of the smallest of the ITV companies, has teamed up with CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcasting group, to acquire radio licences in the UK. CLT is the main shareholder in Atlantic 252, the pop music station that broadcasts into the UK from Ireland. It recently bought a stake in Country 1035 and also operates 12 radio stations throughout mainland Europe. The two companies have set up a 50-50 joint venture. Mr Peter Brownlow, finance director of Border, said it was exciting that 'a tiny minnow like Border has managed to reach this agreement with CLT'. Over the past four years Border, which is too small to play in the ITV takeover battles, has been gradually building up radio expertise with small stakes in local stations. However, it was recently involved in two of five new large regional stations which went on the air last month. Border, whose chairman is Mr Melvyn Bragg, the writer and broadcaster, owns Century Radio, the new commercial broadcaster in north-east England. It is also a partner with Grampian Television in Scot FM, the new regional broadcaster for central Scotland. A new company, called Investors in Radio, will be headed by Mr Ron Coles, former managing director of Midland Radio. The plan is to apply for new radio licences and possibly even acquire existing ones.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 29 Jun (INA) -- Competent Yemeni authorities  have seized three MS-17 military cargo helicopters supplied by  the rulers of Kuwait to the separatists in southern Yemen.  Yemeni political sources told INA's correspondent in Sanaa that  the three helicopters were brought under control recently upon  landing at one of the airports in Shabwah Governorate, north of  Aden.    The sources said the three helicopters were commanded by  Yemeni pilots who had recently fled the control of the  secessionists, along with their families, to seek refuge with  the forces of legitimacy.    Diplomatic sources in Sanaa said the Kuwaiti helicopter deal  is one of the arms supply deals between the Saudi and Kuwaiti  regimes and the secessionists in Yemen.</p>

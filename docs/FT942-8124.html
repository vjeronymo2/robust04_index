			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Summer Festivals: Jazz blows its own trumpet There are two kinds of jazz festival: a straining at the seams where there is the potential for spontaneity or, more likely, a series of tenuously linked concerts. Brecon and Cork, held over the weekend, and both floated on prodigious amounts of ale, fall, literally, into the first category. Brecon Jazz (August 12-14, Tel: 0874-625557) is held in the civic buildings, hotels and meadows of the picturesque Welsh market town. This year the very ovine Market Hall will swing to the sound of Slide Hampton's Jazz Masters' Big band and George Shearing's 75th birthday celebration. 'Stroller' day-pass tickets are available for the fringe concerts. The Cork Jazz Festival (October 28 -31, Tel 21313131) is sponsored by, and runs, on Guinness. It too takes over the town: the 'pub trail' comprises 25 bars and headline concerts are held in the Opera House. The Glasgow International Jazz Festival (July 1 - 10, Tel 041 552 3572) promises an intimate event on the cobbled streets of the old Merchant City. The line-up is impressive and features pianists Herbie Hancock, Horace Silver, Ahmad Jamal, Joe Zawinul and Bheki Mseleku. Trumpeter Bobby Watson is composer-in-residence and drummer Max Roach is making a rare visit. Likewise, much of the old town in Edinburgh (August 7-14, Tel: 031-557-1642) is pervaded by a McMardi Gras atmosphere and McEwans 80/- sponsors a 'free jazz trail'. Headliners this year include the Ted Heath Band. The London gatherings make up for their lack of festival conviviality with heavyweight programming. The 95.8 Capital FM/JVC Jazz Parade (July 16 - 24, Tel: 071-379-1066) combines the reliably famous (Wynton Marsalis, Joe Henderson and BB King) with the famously unreliable (Nina Simone) all found in the un-festive confines of the Festival Hall. The London Jazz Festival, last night tomorrow, spreads throughout North London with headline concerts held in diverse places such as the Union Chapel and the splendid Hackney Empire. Main attractions include Chick Corea and Carla Bley. A long way from Hackney, the Stravinsky Hall in is the focus of the Montreux Jazz Festival (July 1 - 16, Tel: 21 313 45 67). A mind boggling line-up which features Van Morrison and Bob Dylan on consecutive nights also has the entire Verve roster on the same stage across two nights. Purists will be astonished to see names such as Johnny Cash on the same programme as abstractionist Albert Mangelsdorf. The only rival to Montreux, in terms of sheer volume and diversity of music, is the North Sea Jazz Festival (July 8 - 10, Tel: 70 354 2958) which in one weekend somehow manages to pack in 1000 artists on 13 stages under one roof, the Dutch Congress Centre. Or one might prefer to sit under a tree on the Ile du Berceau and listen to the sound of gypsy guitars carried by wafting Gitanes smoke. The 15eme Festival de Jazz Django Reinhardt (June 24 -26, Tel: 1 64 69 54 66), is traditionally a meeting place for guitar players, and this year features young american saxophonist Steve Coleman.</p>

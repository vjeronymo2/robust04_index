			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / 'Greatest' gathering of heads of state in history if only because he took so long to make up his mind. But who else will be present at what has been billed as the greatest gathering of heads of state and governments in history? Invitations went to 185 of them. We know the king and queen of Sweden are attending, because they have already arrived. Also from Europe, John Major is coming, but Prince Charles, for whom this might have been a suitable event and who is friends with President Collor of Brazil, is not. Chancellor Kohl of Germany will put in an appearance, as will the prime minister of Italy (the name has been left blank in the official list in case there is a change of government in the meantime). President Mitterand is expected, though there is some uncertainty. His security people have said he cannot make the road journey to the conference centre because it passes through two tunnels. The leaders of Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain (where King Carlos is also 'considering coming') have all accepted. A tricky one is the European Community. After Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment commissioner tore up his air ticket in a fit of pique, the most senior Brussels representative is the little-known Mr Abel Matutes, commissioner for north-south relations. The Holy See, whose controversial position on population control issues which loom so large on the Rio agenda, will also attend, though not in the person of the Pope. Instead one of his top cardinals will come. Japan sees the Earth Summit as a chance to trumpet its green credentials, and is emphasising the fact by sending not just Prime Minister Miyazawa, but also two former ones, Mr Noboru Takeshita and Mr Toshiki Kaifu. Virtually every country in the third world is represented. The absences are more notable. Civil war-torn Afghanistan has yet to respond (so, for similar reasons, has Yugoslavia). Fidel Castro is coming, though for security reasons that is a secret. South Africa and the Sudan have yet to decide. The only problem the organisers must solve is that every country leader has the right to speak, and 20 minutes per person has been suggested. That would make four days of non-stop speeches.</p>

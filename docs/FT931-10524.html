			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: The Prisoners of War - Theatre The New End Theatre in Hampstead has unearthed a minor masterpiece in J R Ackerley's The Prisoners of War. Ackerley is perhaps most remembered for his autobiographical novel 'We Think the World of You', published in 1961. He had become literary editor of The Listener in 1935 and held the post for nearly a quarter of a century. He died in 1967. His dramatic work came early on. Prisoners will always have a footnote in theatrical history because it was the first English 20th century play to deal seriously and overtly with homosexuality and to be passed by the censor, who may have missed the point. It was first performed at the Royal Court in 1925. What I did not know before, however, is what a play it is in its own right. Prisoners works not because it is shocking (it is not) but because it is such splendidly mature drama. In terms of theatrical development it looks back to the best of Harley Granville-Barker at the beginning of the century, where grown-up people attempted to discuss grown-up subjects, and forward to Terence Rattigan where the limits to what can be said even by articulate people had become recognised. It is an uncanny coincidence that Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea should be revived at the Almeida in Islington almost at the same time as Prisoners is rediscovered in Hampstead. The two plays have a remarkable amount in common and you should try not to see one without the other. Ackerley's piece is set in Murren, Switzerland in 1918. The prisoners of war are genuine: they are officers removed from camps in Britain or Germany to neutral territory where the conditions are reasonably civilised, including tennis, dancing and some freedom to move within the country. But the background of the war is to some extent a subterfuge. These are males in a predominantly male institution; the extended meaning of prisoner is homosexual. One, in particular, stands out. He is Captain Jim Conrad, played to perfection at the New End by Ashley Russell. He has the best rooms in the Swiss guest house, invites the other officers to use them as a mess room, but plainly has eyes only for Second Lieutenant Grayle (Neil Roberts). Both Conrad and Grayle are virgins, Conrad because of his proclivities, Grayle because is so young. A large part of the play is about Conrad's frustrated feelings. There is at least one subplot. Another British officer forms an attachment to the Canadian Captain Rickman to the point that they want to set up business together in Canada. It is left deliberately unclear whether this is a homosexual relationship. Russell as Conrad is about as moving as you can get without going over the edge. He is not handsome, has strangely protruding teeth and a tendency to wear shorts when others are in long trousers. The emotion is nearly, but not always, suppressed. In the end he breaks down, a pathetic figure who is a prisoner of convention. The play is flawlessly directed by Ken Butler. New End Hampstead until February 28. (071) 794 0022</p>

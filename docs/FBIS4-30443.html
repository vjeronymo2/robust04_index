			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Somsvat Lengsavat sent a  congratulatory message Today to Comrade Kim Yong-nam, deputy  premier of the Administration Council and foreign affairs  minister of the DPRK.    The message reads:    On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment  of diplomatic relations between the LPDR [Lao People's  Democratic Republic Government] and the DPRK, on behalf of the  LPDR, its people, and myself, I would like to extend my warm  congratulations and best wishes to you, comrade, and, through  you, to the fraternal DPRK Government and people.    I am overwhelmingly elated to see that over the past 20  years, the relations of friendship, solidarity, and cooperation  between our two countries have been continually consolidated and  strengthened on the basis of the principle of respect for each  other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;  noninterference in each other's internal affairs; equality; and  mutual benefits.    I firmly believe that the traditional fine relations between  our two countries will develop continuously for the interests of  our two peoples, thereby contributing to the cause of peace,  stability, and cooperation in the region and the rest of the  world.    On this majestic and glorious occasion, I wish the fraternal  DPRK people success in building the socialist north and  reunifying their country through peaceful means.</p>

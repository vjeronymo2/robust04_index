			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Asean to train Cambodia military South-east Asian countries and their main trading partners from the industrialised world yesterday said they wanted to provide military training to help the fragile Cambodian government in the fight against Khmer Rouge guerrillas and would eventually consider sending weapons. At the end of the week-long series of meetings among foreign ministers hosted by the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), delegates said they were concerned by the weakness of the Cambodian coalition. It was elected last year at the culmination of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) UN peace plan for the country. Khmer Rouge guerrillas based on the Thai border recently routed government troops who attempted to seize their strongholds in northern and western Cambodia. 'France and other countries have provided aid for the army and the police and this could eventually include deliveries of arms,' Mr Alain Lamassoure, the French European affairs minister, told a news conference. France has some 40 military advisers in Cambodia. Paris and other governments are putting the emphasis on training rather than material at present because the Cambodian army is undisciplined and soldiers sell weapons to the guerrillas. Indonesia and Malaysia yesterday said they were willing to help train the army. The US says it is considering Cambodia's request for military aid. Last week Australian military advisers visited Cambodia to assess the situation. Thailand was implicitly criticised by several foreign ministers and officials at the Bangkok meetings for failing to prevent supplies reaching the Khmer Rouge. Thai leaders say they support the government in Phnom Penh, but Khmer Rouge guerrillas sell gems and timber to Thai traders on the frontier and use the money to buy arms. A senior US official said the US wanted a reaffirmation of support not only for Phnom Penh but 'for the objective of sealing off the border in terms of anything that could be construed as assistance to the Khmer Rouge'. Asean and western governments said they had moved closer together on policy towards Burma's military junta. Asean members - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - welcomed Mr Ohn Gyaw, the Burmese foreign minister, to Bangkok as a guest but they also raised the issue of human rights. The European Union, Australia and others remained critical of the junta's human rights abuses but accepted that their attempts to isolate the regime had not produced results and that Asean's policy of 'constructive engagement' could have some merit.</p>

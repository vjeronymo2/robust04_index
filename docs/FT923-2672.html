			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Spain sets up Dollars 1.5bn seven-year offer THE Kingdom of Spain is taking bids from a number of investment banks for a seven-year Eurobond issue totalling at least Dollars 1.5bn, but has yet to award a mandate. The deal, expected to emerge this week, will add further supply to the dollar sector, which has already digested a Dollars 2bn offering of global bonds by the Province of Ontario, arranged by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. The Ontario offering, launched on Monday just ahead of the German rate cut, suffered from its timing, according to some under-writers. 'When you have such a huge dislocation of markets, no one wants to make investment decisions,' said one underwriter. In addition, the Japanese market was closed yesterday, and many bankers and investors were not at their desks on Monday. However, the lead managers said that investor sentiment on the dollar, which at last appeared to have turned, spurred buying of the deal, especially in south-east Asia and Europe. The five-year bonds were priced yesterday at 48 basis points above the comparable Treasury yield, the wider end of the indicated spread range. However, even at this level the pricing appeared rather aggressive to US investors. The US corporate bond market had to digest about Dollars 10bn of supply last week and investors are becoming rather choosy. The spread on the Ontario offering widened to 50 basis points at one point. However, a weak US Treasury market allowed the spread to tighten back to 48 basis points. Despite some resistance to the Ontario deal, Spain could meet a more enthusiastic welcome. While Ontario has already borrowed heavily in the US and Eurobond market to meet its heavy funding programme of nearly CDollars 10bn (USDollars 8.10bn) this year, Spain has never issued in dollars, and should have some rarity value. In the equity-linked market, Nestle Holdings launched a Dollars 250m issue of seven-year bonds with equity warrants attached. European equity-linked offerings have become a rarity recently, as few companies are keen to issue at current stock market levels. However, Nestle is considered one of the most attractive stocks in the sector, having released good interim results on Friday. Elsewhere, Citicorp launched a Dollars 40m two-tranche Eurobond issued by International Bonds Investments, which holds Venezuelan debt.</p>

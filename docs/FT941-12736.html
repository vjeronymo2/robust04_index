			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB considers financial restructure British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, is considering the possibility of a financial restructuring to repay some of the money invested by its shareholders. BSkyB has been investigating with merchant banks the possibility of organising up to Pounds 500m in non-recourse debt. The talks are, however, at an early stage and no decisions have yet been taken. The aim of the financial manoeuvre would be to repay some of the money the main shareholders - Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Granada, Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and Chargeurs, the French transport and communication group - put into the venture. BSkyB has moved into operating profit and last month made its first Pounds 50m payment to its shareholders with another similar payment expected before the end of the financial year. The company is still, however, incurring large pre-tax losses.</p>

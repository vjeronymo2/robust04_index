			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / France ponders superhighway gamble From the network of trains a grande vitesse to the construction of a new national library, France has a penchant for grands projets. Today, the government will consider a project which could rank with the grandest - the creation of a national autoroute d'information, a gallic information superhighway. Ministers from the relevant departments of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's government meet this afternoon to discuss a long-awaited report from Mr Gerard Thery, a former managing director of France Telecom and an architect of the Minitel project, the teletext system which now has more than 23,000 services. Like Minitel at its launch in 1979, Mr Thery's new project is ambitious. His report proposes the establishment of a network of fibre optic cables linking every household by 2015. The aim is to build a national infrastructure allowing the French public and businesses to connect to a network of interactive television, telephone entertainment and data services. According to Mr Thery, the cost of the infrastructure alone would be between FFr150bn (Pounds 18bn) and FFr200bn (Pounds 24bn) by the year 2015. Much of the investment, he argues, should be borne by France Telecom, which should switch resources from copper telephone lines to the fibre optic cables needed for the superhighway. 'We are behind not only the US, but also our main partner, Germany,' he says, citing the Opal project, which will provide fibre optic connections to 1.2m east Germans by 1996. The message strikes a chord with the French government. But it has yet to decide how far Mr Thery's ambitious proposals will be transformed into reality. In his letter commissioning the report, Mr Balladur asked Mr Thery in February to 'elucidate' the objectives for France in the area of information superhighways. Officials say the study will lead the debate but that it is not a blueprint for legislation. But Mr Thery's proposals have also drawn criticism. 'There is little analysis of the role of competitors,' says one industry analyst. 'Telecoms markets are in the process of liberalisation, but there is no mention of any other players except France Telecom.' The report also skirts the issue of how France's programme should relate to that being studied by the European Commission. In particular, Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner is proposing that private companies rather than governments should take the lead in the development of a European information superhighway. Some EU member states are pressing for national operators to surrender their monopolies over their national infrastructure. In France, communications and utilities groups such as Bouygues and Generale des Eaux are pressing for increased access to the telecoms market. More serious, given the central role it has been prescribed by Mr Thery, are the reservations expressed by France Telecom. The state operator is wary of such a bold investment in infrastructure. Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman, says: 'Rather than put in place immediately a colossal infrastructure, let us focus on the contents, namely the programmes, which we will be able to offer our future clients.' Behind such sentiments lies a worrying precedent - the Plan Cable. Launched in 1982, the plan committed FFr25bn to create a state of the art cable network. But competition from more terrestrial and satellite TV broadcasters, the high cost of subscriptions and the lack of services have all limited demand. France still has one of the lowest rates of cable penetration in Europe. 'France made just about every mistake in cable that it was possible to make,' says Mr Gerard Eymery, chairman of the multimedia operations of France Telecom. The task for ministers today is how to plot a path so that the next grand projet of the information era is not such a grand failure.</p>

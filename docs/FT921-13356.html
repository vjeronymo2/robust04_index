			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Starting with a clean sheet - A look at Budgens' recovery plan THE CHIEF executive of Budgens, the food retailer, does not believe in hard-sell techniques - certainly when it comes to persuading the City. Since being installed by institutional shareholders last May, Mr John von Spreckelsen has been 'practically invisible', according to analysts who follow the lively retail sector. Mr Spreckelsen said: 'We decided to concentrate on improving the business, and that we would talk when the results had improved sufficiently for us to have a story to tell.' Yesterday's figures from the group are only an interim chapter of a tale which took a dramatic twist when institutional shareholders forced the resignation of Mr John Fletcher as chairman, recruited Mr von Spreckelsen and injected Pounds 21.7m into the business. In July the new management team reported a loss of Pounds 14.7m for the year to April 27, after heavy exceptional costs and and write-offs. Mr von Spreckelsen said yesterday's interim profits figure of Pounds 2.2m was 'completely clean - we cleaned out the balance sheet in April.' Although he described the results as 'a significant first step on the road to recovery', he accepts that he has still to demonstrate that Budgens has a future in a world of increasingly large and competitive food retailers. An initial priority was to sort out problems at the group's distribution centre at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, which is far too large for a chain of only 95 stores. Mr von Spreckelsen said security and productivity had been increased, and distribution costs were now down from 6.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent of sales. Availability of stock in some lines was down to 70 per cent but has now improved to 98 per cent. Wellingborough was still too big, he said, but bricks and mortar only accounted for about 25 per cent of costs - the main outlays were on transport and staff. Budgens is already distributing food from Wellingborough for Betta Stores, and is working to develop a billing system, which would allow it do other third-party work - probably for small independents. Stock losses had been substantially reduced, but Mr von Spreckelsen said it was difficult to estimate by how much: 'There was such a poor information base that there could have been a numbers graveyard.' The group suffered from very high wastage levels in fresh foods. A large adhesive coding label being stuck on top of every open tray of yoghurt tubs meant that as many as eight cartons were being wasted every time. A smaller label is now attached to the side of each tray. Milk was being kept in the warehouse for 48 hours, giving it a less attractive sell-by date. The minimum size of carton was 24 units; some stores could sell only 12 items, so the rest was wastage. Mr von Spreckelsen, a very methodical man, said: 'Business is all about attention to detail.' Budgens is currently testing electronic point of sale (Epos) equipment in three stores and aims to have it installed across the group within three years, which should substantially improve stock management. Having identified competitive disadvantages such as costly distribution, the new management team has also been asking more fundamental questions - such as whether the Budgens type of small neighbourhood store is viable. Mr von Spreckelsen said: 'Demographics suggests this type of store has a future. The average age of the population is growing. They are not going are going to be basket shoppers. We are not competing with hypermarkets - we are well positioned in city centres or small towns.' Budgens is placing more emphasis on product and price flexibility, according to location. Mr von Spreckelsen insists: 'Business is local.' The group has completed its market research and now has a business plan for each store. In some, there will be no change. Others have had pizzerias installed or have taken in franchises such as post offices. The chief executive said: 'A lot of pensioners collect their pension, and then may do their shopping. The trick is to convert the extra traffic into extra shoppers. This sometimes means you have to change your stock - pensioners buying whisky want half-bottles, not full bottles.' Mr von Spreckelsen, who turned round Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based supermarket chain, said Budgens' recovery plan was still was still on course, although competition had increased since the summer. He has identified a significant number of projects, but is keeping his cards close to his chest. Analysts acknowledge progress has been made, but say the group's retail formula for the future is still not clear. Until it is, the jury will remain out on whether there is a future for Budgens.</p>

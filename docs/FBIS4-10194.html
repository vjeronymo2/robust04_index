			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 6 Apr (EFE) -- Today, the Freedom and  Democracy Institute of Peru (ILD) submitted a proposal to  Congress to amend the 1993 Constitution. The proposal, which  was signed by 500,000 people, is based on the people's  constitutional right to initiate laws. ILD President Hernando De  Soto, who is a former adviser of President Alberto Fujimori,  reported that the proposal contains 12 amendments "that seek to  make governments listen to the people and to prevent the market  economy from becoming a privilege of a few."    One amendment proposes the establishment of a "democratic  procedure for popular consultation to decentralize the  government's decisionmaking power" so that the executive branch  will no longer exclusively make decisions "on every subject  without listening to the opinion of the Peruvian people." Other  proposed amendments deal with the creation of multiple electoral  districts in lieu of the current single district system "so that  elected officials may be held directly accountable to their  constituents" and to make the constitutional right to cancel  terms in office applicable to all political representatives and  officials.    De Soto said that during the 5 April 1992 coup, President  Fujimori said he took that extreme measure, among other reasons,  to democratize political power through a constitutional reform.  De Soto contended that Fujimori has not fulfilled his promise  because the new Constitution has incorporated "only half" of the  changes he promised. Therefore, he said, the ILD has availed  itself of the people's right to initiate amendments to the  Peruvian Constitution. The Peruvian Constitution recognizes this  right of the people, "but only to a certain extent," De Soto  said, "because it is the Congress, not the people, that has the  power to approve or reject the proposal."</p>

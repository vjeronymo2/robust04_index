			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Property: For lovers who can tryst the night away - Gerald Cadogan suggests some discreet meeting places The distinguished, silver-haired man, accompanied by a beautiful young woman, entered the Kensington office of a well-known estate agent. It was December 19. 'We're looking for a small flat,' he said. 'What can you show us?' At the fourth one, she put her arm through his and said: 'Darling, I'd love this.' He turned to the agent and offered almost the full asking price. Then, he took the agent into a corner. 'I'd like to give it to her for Christmas.' That same day, the senior partner of a smart London legal firm telephoned to confirm the deal and contracts were exchanged on December 23 - to the delight of agent and vendor, who had achieved an excellent sale, and presumably to the joy of the pair ensconced in their 'love nest'. The term appears to date from 1919 when the Oxford English Dictionary defined it as 'a secluded retreat for (esp. illicit) lovers'. But the idea must be as old as adultery - somewhere discreet to park the mistress or toyboy for surreptitious visits. (Rumour had it that this once used to be a special function of the cream-stuccoed villas in St John's Wood, London.) Such a place is not for couples living together day by day, even if they are not married. Either one lover lives there all the time, courtesy of the richer (and usually older) partner. Or they meet there only for trysts. Such people make ideal residents. They pay promptly, are generous to the cleaning woman or housekeeper, and do not punish the place with the wear and tear of permanent occupancy. In the country, it is hard not to be seen conducting an illicit romance, but London has plenty of discreet properties. And the love nests are not always where you would expect. At one house in Kensington, west London, the man installed his mistress next door to himself and his wife. He then knocked a hole in the party wall and had a door fitted - in the back of the mistress's bedroom cupboard. So where to go? Always quiet, Mayfair is a good meeting ground, as former government ministers can reveal. 24 Hays Mews, W1, is a pretty city cottage with one bedroom, ideal as a pied-a-terre in town that doubles as a trysting place. Wetherell offers a 56-year lease for Pounds 197,500. More useful still might be 21a Brick Street, W1: Pounds 225,000 freehold from Chestertons Residential. It is tucked away in a mews behind the Park Lane Hotel and has a garage for a quick getaway (or to hide the car from paparazzi who know the number). On the other hand, Vivien Thompson, of buying agent Property Vision, points out the advantages of buying a small flat in a grand block. Assuming a reasonable price, such a property can have all the advantages of a central location plus porters to keep watch when you are not there. MPs are often on the lookout for such a place, as they cannot afford to be too far from parliament. But the problem is finding something close enough to reach the House in time to vote after the division bell installed in the flat rings - especially if there is a need to dress first. After all, there are only eight minutes from calling a division to locking the lobby doors, and the traffic jams in central London are legendary. Walking or bicycling seem to be the answer. If there is nothing available in Smith Square, Lord North Street and Strutton Ground to the south and west of parliament, go north. 71a Whitehall Court, SW1, is a one-bedroom flat in a large block with porterage which meets Thompson's criteria admirably. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley offers a 34-year lease for Pounds 195,000. Belgravia, Kensington and Chelsea are also too far for a quick dash to the Palace of Westminster although they have plenty of small flats with one and two bedrooms. Strutt &amp; Parker has a good selection. The 22-year lease outstanding on 64 Pont Street, SW1 (price Pounds 138,000) should outlast any romance. And Pounds 100,000 buys a fourth-floor flat at 4 Sloane Gardens, SW1. But the best place of all 'to sin with Elinor Glyn/On a tiger skin - Or would you prefer/To err with her/On some other kind of fur?' is the huge studio/drawing room of 49 Lyall Mews, SW1 which costs Pounds 1.15m for a 44-year lease from Lassmans. Cheaper, at Pounds 179,000 from Foxtons, is a New York-style loft flat in Cromwell Road, SW3. If your love is on the periphery of central London, take your pick of 1 Glentham Cottages, SW13, next to the playing fields of St Paul's School (Dixon Porter, Pounds 120,000), or Crescent Grove, SW4, a converted coach house near Clapham Common, convenient for the Underground station and with a walled garden for maximum privacy (Winkworth in Battersea, Pounds 159,000). On the north side of the Thames, Rio Cottage in Grosvenor Road, SW1, could not be in a more romantic setting and has just been sold for Pounds 275,000 from Winkworth, in Pimlico. The original asking price was Pounds 345,000. It is the refurbished old cottage of the gatekeeper who controlled the sluices where the Tyburn (better known uphill at Marble Arch) ran into the Thames. The Tyburn is now in a tunnel and the house sits on top of this, with all the back windows looking out on to the Thames. And you might also think of England in a flat in the main turret of the Gothic Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, SW18 (to rent from the same agent for Pounds 500 a week). There is a secret entrance from a self-contained 'nanny' flat to the 'study', and three exits - but now we are talking French farce.

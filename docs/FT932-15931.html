			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Letter: Offer worth refusing Sir, With the volume of column inches expended on the Hoover promotion, I am a little surprised that nobody has looked at the much larger Sainsbury/British Airways promotion which took place at about the same time. As a result of some careful planning of my shopping, I acquired vouchers that would have entitled me to two reduced air fares. Sainsbury/BA further rewarded me with two additional 'bonus' vouchers. I have found these to be valueless. On flights since Christmas, all on BA, I have been able to book tickets through West End agents considerably cheaper than the BA 'reductions'. I have probably lost nothing (and may have gained a little) as a result of rescheduling purchases to boost my total expenditure at Sainsbury during the crucial period. Certainly Sainsbury gained some of my market share at the time, but in the immortal words of rock star Pete Townsend, I 'won't get fooled again'. And my expectation is that Sainsbury will not actually spend very much on subsidising air tickets under its scheme. J J Plant, 101 Clova Road, Forest Gate, London E7 9AG</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Additional Blue Helmets To </F> Baranja"]    [Text] After some hesitation about increasing the number of  Belgian military personnel in Baranja (Croatia) by several  dozen, the government decided on Friday [3 June] to take another  path. For more than two years, a reinforced Belgian UN battalion  has been stationed in Serb-occupied Baranja. In late February,  at the height of the tension surrounding Sarajevo, one armored  combat company, however, was assigned to go and back up the UN  troops in Bosnia posthaste. This move meant that a large  proportion of the protection for the Baranja detachment (BELBAT)  was lost. After the experience in Rwanda, it was decided to  reinforce this detachment with extra armored vehicles. On  Friday, it was decided not to send new men or equipment there.  The general staff were ordered by the UN senior command to  investigate how the Belgian combat company in Bosnia could be  reincorporated into BELBAT. Belgium is, however, temporarily  keeping its transport and engineering company in Bosnia.</p>

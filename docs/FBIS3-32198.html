			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cuba has stated in Geneva that the United States  intends to overwhelm with hunger the firm desire of our people  to exercise their right to self-determination and independence,  for which Cuba has been enduring a severe economic and financial  blockade for more than 30 years.    Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations Jose Perez Novoa told  the UN Human Rights Committee that the U.S. occupation of  Guantanamo against the will of Cuba is one more example of the  denial of that right.    Novoa spoke a second time today to express his position on  point nine of the agenda, that is, free determination and its  application to nations submitted to colonial domination or  foreign occupation.</p>

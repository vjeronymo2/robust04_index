			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / More cash for poor EC members sought SPAIN has snubbed EC attempts to get north-south economic disparities within the Community off the agenda for European union, by re-presenting its ideas for an equalising budgetary fund on federal lines. Madrid's renewed bid for more money for the EC's laggards 'greatly complicates' the already difficult negotiations being conducted on economic, monetary, and political union, senior EC officials and diplomats said yesterday. In a hardened version of the ideas it put to the inter-governmental conference (IGC) on political union in early March. Spain is insisting on: an 'inter-state compensation fund' to invest in 'physical and human capital' in those EC members whose gross domestic product per capita is below 90 per cent of the Community average. a progressive system of taxation for the EC budget, with contributions by member states measured by their 'relative prosperity'; a change in policy for aid to backward regions, which would loosen member governments' current obligations to contribute to the financing of EC-backed projects, instead matching this to their 'financial capacity'. Madrid's proposals for revising the Treaty of Rome were re-submitted to the IGC on political union on Thursday, as tantamount to Spain's price for agreement on the economic and monetary union accord being negotiated in parallel. A compromise suggested last month, by the current Luxembourg presidency of the Community, was last week dismissed as 'unacceptable' by a senior Spanish official. Unlike its poorer colleagues at the bottom of the EC development division - Ireland, Portugal and Greece - Spain gets little out of the EC budget in net terms. In 1989 it put in Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) and got back Ecu3.5bn. But Spain's demand that the EC should redistribute wealth southwards by straight budgetary transfers has so far been backed only by Ireland. The Commission would prefer less overtly federalist means. Commission research suggests it would take 20 years for the EC's four poorer members to reach the GDP per head of 90 per cent of the Community average wanted by Spain.</p>

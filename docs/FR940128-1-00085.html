			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has also evaluated the potential health benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with increased consumption of seafood. Because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative publicity concerning water pollution and seafood safety,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer perception of seafood safety may overestimate actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk. In addition, contamination scares cause drastic short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drops in consumer demand for seafood products and undoubtedly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to the chronic level of consumer concern about seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety. Thus, safety concerns about seafood are a likely factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing wider consumer acceptance of seafood as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. diet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If this proposal is finalized, consumer concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood safety may be reduced which may, in turn, lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased consumption of seafood. FDA has evaluated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility that consumers may switch from higher fat flesh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein, such as meat and poultry, to seafood. The resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced dietary fat in the diet of the general population would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the same methodology employed in an earlier analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA analyzed the benefits of a 1- and 5-pound per capita increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in consumption of seafood. These were estimated to decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deaths by 673 and 2,782, respectively, over a 10-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The resulting benefits are valued at $3 and $14 billion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Small Business Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule will have a substantial impact on small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood processors as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eighty percent of the seafood processors covered by this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation are small, where small is defined for nonshrimp firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as less than $1 million in annual gross revenue and less than $2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million for shrimp firms. The provisions of this rule, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and recordkeeping, are largely fixed costs (costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which do not vary significantly with the amount of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced) which will impose larger per unit costs on small rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than on large businesses. In addition, small firms may have as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many critical control points as large firms because critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control points tend to be related to the complexity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation, not the size of the business. However, it may be that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller firms are less complex than large firms, although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency does not have sufficient data to determine if this is so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases the increase in cost will be large enough to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause some firms to go out of business. For example, estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of firm failure have been as low as 2 percent (96 firms) of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms (from the Canadian experience) to 334 firms (estimated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with MSSP). However, FDA does not have enough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to estimate the number of firms that will close if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule becomes final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several factors that affect the ability of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors to comply with the proposed regulations. First, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basic HACCP requirements proposed in subpart A of part 123  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberately include only the essentials of HACCP in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keep fixed costs to a minimum. Second, FDA is developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable guidance in the form of a hazard guide and model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plans to enable small processors to implement an effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP system at the lowest possible cost. Third, FDA is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware that academia and trade associations are available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist processors to implement HACCP. Finally, for those small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors that have very simple operations requiring few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points, an inherent feature of HACCP is that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusts to the complexity and risks of an operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While any closure is regrettable, the agency strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that firms that are unable to identify the likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards associated with their products and take reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventive controls to prevent those hazards from occurring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be selling food in interstate commerce. As described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the preamble, FDA is keenly interested in keeping the costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing HACCP to a minimum and is issuing guidance documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and model HACCP plans to facilitate such implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is specifically requesting comment in areas where costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and benefit estimates are either very uncertain or potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large. FDA will utilize answers received on these comments along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all other comments to help formulate the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

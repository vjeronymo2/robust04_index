			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Repossessions fall adds to housing hopes COURT ORDERS to repossess mortgaged houses fell 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year, compared with the previous quarter. Figures released yesterday show they were at their lowest level since the second quarter of 1990. The figures suggest a slowly recovering housing market but analysts pointed out that the fall appeared to be flattening out. Mr John Wriglesworth of UBS, the stockbroker, said he still expected 70,000 repossessions this year, compared with 69,000 last year. The reduction in repossession orders to 26,910 from 27,656 in the final quarter of last year was the fifth consecutive quarterly fall. The number of orders - not all of which end in repossession - was 24 per cent lower than the number in the first quarter of last year. Mr Wriglesworth said the fall in repossession orders did not necessarily indicate that fewer people were having difficulty with mortgage repayments. Building societies had 352,000 properties more than six months in arrears at the end of last year and the fall in orders probably indicated that more borrowers were being allowed to go more than a year into arrears. The number of actions initiating repossession proceedings rose to 31,371 compared with 29,583 in the last quarter of last year. They were well down on the 42,267 in last year's first quarter, according to the Lord Chancellor's Department. Mr Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell, said that financing house purchase through variable interest rate mortgages had contributed to the volatility of the UK economy. Fixed-rate mortgages would damp down swings in the mortgage interest rate, reducing the size of the boom and the length of the slump. He also warned that it would be hard for sterling to return to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism unless a higher proportion of mortgages were on fixed rates.</p>

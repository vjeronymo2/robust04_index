			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Strike vote over pay MORE than 200 British nuclear scientists working on the Joint European Torus project near Oxford will this week vote on strike action over pay. The IPMS Civil Service union says scientists from other countries working on the same project earn twice as much. The scientists, who are employed by the UK Atomic Energy Authority, have failed to win pay parity in spite of a 10-year campaign.</p>

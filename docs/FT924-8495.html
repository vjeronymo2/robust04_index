			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Sarajevo refugees begin exodus: UN distances itself from Red Cross evacuation in response to fears about ethnic cleansing allegations MORE THAN 1,000 Moslem and Croat refugees yesterday began a hazardous journey from Sarajevo to Split, the Croatian port, after being trapped for more than seven months by a Serbian siege of the Bosnian capital. As a convoy of 14 Red Cross buses carried the women and children from the capital, many of the passengers wept, waving desperately at friends and families left to an uncertain future in the devastated city. As darkness fell the convoy of overloaded buses was stranded in freezing cold after being halted at a Serb roadblock, according to UN peace-keepers. But the convoy was allowed to move on after being halted for only a few hours at the Serb checkpoint. It later reached its overnight destination in Croatian-held Kiseljak 30km away. Plans to evacuate Serb refugees in another convoy north to Belgrade were disrupted by transport difficulties. Only one bus left and hundreds of people, many of them elderly were stranded in freezing weather at the departure point. An estimated 6,000 people are due to leave the city during the next few days. The United Nations has distanced itself from the evacuation because of fears of being seen to assist the Serb policy of ethnic cleansing. Humanitarian officials also fear that the evacuation is only the beginning of a mass exodus from the city to escape death from exposure or starvation. The civilian evacuation may pave the way for Serb fighters to seize Sarajevo despite a pledge made yesterday in Sarajevo by military officers representing the warring parties in Bosnia that they would observe a fresh ceasefire. The announcement coincided with reports of continued fierce fighting near the strategically important Croat-held city of Mostar, 75 miles to the south. Heavy fighting broke out east of Mostar on Sunday with an offensive by the HVO, the Bosnian Croat army. Serb forces retaliated by shelling Mostar and the Dubrovnik area of Croatia. An aid convoy had to turn back on Monday. Radio in Belgrade yesterday said 20 Serbs were killed and 100 injured. The setbacks experienced by the Serb forces may explain their willingness to sign another ceasefire pledge to take effect throughout Bosnia at midnight. The agreement emerged from the mixed military working group meeting under UN auspices in Sarajevo, but was greeted with scepticism. Bosnia's Moslem-led government has rejected an offer by Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, of peace in return for land he has seized - nearly three-quarters of the republic.</p>

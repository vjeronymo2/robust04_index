			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Call to curb laundering Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, yesterday called for concerted international action against money laundering. 'Money laundering poses a threat to every member of the Commonwealth,' said Mr Clarke in a speech to the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' meeting in Malta. He said it allowed drug traffickers to develop and expand their operations, illegal arms dealers to spread more and deadlier weapons to terrorists, and international fraudsters to bleed economies dry. Rough estimates of the total amount of criminal money which may be laundered run up to Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333bn) a year. Mr Clarke said finance ministers should take forward the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, set up by the Group of Seven countries in 1989. They should ensure financial institutions know their customers and do not operate anonymous bank accounts, he said. Financial institutions should also pay attention to large, complex or unusual transactions, and develop programmes against money laundering. Finally, supervisory authorities should ensure financial institutions have adequate procedures in place to combat the laundering.</p>

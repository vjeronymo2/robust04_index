			<p>BFN     [Text] Srbinje, May 22 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Parliament  President Momcilo Krajisnik said on Sunday that the Bosnian  Moslems and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina could make agreements  and tailor the future federation to suit them, but they could  not do that on Serb ethnic territories.    The Serbs would not allow a Moslem-Croat federation to be  formed on their own land, Krajisnik said in Srbinje (formerly  Foca) at a local ceremony. The Bosnian Moslems and Croats on  March 18, without the participation of the Serb side and under  strong U.S. pressure, signed an accord on a dual federation  which would later enter a confederation with neighbouring  Croatia. A federation was set up in this way, with no clearly  defined territory.    Work is in progress on settling the issue of territorial  division in Bosnia. In Vienna, the Moslems and Croats agreed on  a proposal allocating 58 per cent of the territories to a  Moslem-Croat federation and 42 per cent to the Serb side, but  this was not accepted by the Serbs. According to the prewar  land registers, the Bosnian Serbs owned 64 per cent and after  the two-year old war they now control about 70 per cent of the  Bosnian territory.</p>

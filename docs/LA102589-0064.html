			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINKINS LEAD SLIPS IN RACE FOR N.Y. MAYOR, POLLS SHOW;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE MARGINS VARY, BUT SURVEYS AGREE THAT RECENT CONTROVERSIES SEEM TO  HAVE HURT THE DEMOCRAT'S CAMPAIGN.  </P> <P> Contrasting polls showed the lead of Democratic mayoral candidate David N.  Dinkins to be slipping Tuesday, but the degree to which his margin was eroding  remained in question.  </P> <P> A Daily News-WABC-TV survey showed that Dinkins had plummeted from 19 points  ahead of his Republican rival Rudolph W. Giuliani to a four-point lead.  </P> <P> But a New York Observer poll showed Dinkins with a 20-point lead. A poll by  that weekly newspaper earlier this month reported the Democratic contender with  a 33-point lead.  </P> <P> Despite the discrepancy, both polls may be a reflection of the most recent 10  days of Dinkins' campaign to become New York City's first black mayor.  </P> <P> Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, has been forced to deal with  controversies over the true value of a stock gift he made to his son, and his  campaign's payment of $9,500 to a community activist who was once convicted on  a kidnaping charge and who organized a demonstration last month that ended in  battles with police.  </P> <P> When Sonny Carson, the activist, called a news conference last week to explain  that the funds were designed to help get out the vote on primary day, he also  denied being anti-Semitic. "I'm anti-white," he said.  </P> <P> Dinkins then denounced Carson and said that had such comments come to his  attention, Carson would never have played any role in his campaign.  </P> <P> New York's heated mayoral campaign also echoed in the financial marketplace on  Tuesday. Moody's Investors Service, which rates the city's bonds, warned that  unless New York's next mayor has a detailed plan to deal with a projected  budget gap, his new administration "will face the prospect of a weakening  credit outlook."  </P> <P> Moody's criticized both Dinkins and Giuliani for failing to come up with such a  plan. New York faces a $528-million budget gap for the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> Some political analysts said that in such an economic climate, questions about  Dinkins' finances have become magnified -- and are reflected in polls. Dinkins,  who did not pay income taxes for four years two decades ago, has been  scrutinized recently on a stock transaction with his son that may have skirted  a capital gains tax bite.  </P> <P> In 1983, in a form he filed, Dinkins valued the stock at more than $1 million.  But the same year, in another form, he valued the stock at $20,000 to $60,000.  He transferred the stock in January, 1986, to his son for a $58,000 promissory  note due in 1991, with interest.  </P> <P> Dinkins said the million-dollar figure was given to him by the chairman of the  non-publicly traded company and the price he charged his son was close to the  price the company had offered to redeem its shares during the same period.  </P> <P> The Daily News poll reported that 34% of voters were less likely to vote for  Dinkins because of the new reports about his finances. The poll showed major  defections among Jewish voters, white liberals and independents.  </P> <P> Some politicians and polling experts Tuesday questioned the Daily News-WABC-TV  survey for its relatively small sample of 501 registered voters and the fact it  was taken during just one day. The poll had a 5% margin of error.  </P> <P> Analysts pointed out the ripples from the Daily News poll may be more  meaningful than the numbers themselves.  </P> <P> The New York Post headline on Tuesday: "Dinkins Sinkin'."  </P></p>

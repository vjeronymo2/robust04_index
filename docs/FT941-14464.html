			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Observer: Better late Sir Tim Lankester's straight-talking is tame stuff compared with the latest outburst by David Marshall, just back in Singapore after 15 years as Singapore's ambassador in Paris. Singapore-born Marshall is unimpressed by modern Singapore and its ruling Peoples Action party. His latest verdict is that censorship is worse, broader and more strict than at any time under British rule. He should know; he was chief minister of the first local government, formed under the old British colonial administration. He also berated Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of the island republic, for brushing aside public spiritedness and encouraging Singaporeans to worship the 'golden calf' of financial gain. Lesser diplomats might have shied away from such bluntness, especially in a disciplinarian society like Singapore. But Marshall is a sprightly 86 and has probably given up hope of further diplomatic advancement.</p>

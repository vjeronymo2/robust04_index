			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAM NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> UNLIKE LAST YEAR, OPPONENTS ARE GETTING THE BREAKS  </P> <P> Were the 1989 Rams as dominant as their 13-6 record indicates? Is the 1990 team  really a four-and-nine kind of hapless?  </P> <P> The answer, in both cases, is probably "No."  </P> <P> A quick look shows the two teams are statistically similar. In 1989, the Rams  averaged 119 yards rushing and 258 passing; opponents rushed for an average of  96 yards and passed for 251. This year, the Rams are averaging fewer yards --  106 on the ground and 244 in the air -- but so are opponents (99 and 246).  </P> <P> Clearly, those numbers don't explain the disparity in the won-loss column.  </P> <P> In fact, one could argue that the difference is simply a case of good fortunes  gone bad.  </P> <P> And, unfortunately for him, the football gods apparently have decided that  Cleveland Gary should be in charge of evening things up after all that Ram luck  in '89, when opponents suffered from dropsy.  </P> <P> Follow last year's bouncing ball:  </P> <P>  -- The Rams beat the Green Bay Packers, 41-38, but were outscored, 31-3, in  the second half. Packer running back Brent Fullwood lost a fumble going into  the end zone during the fourth quarter.  </P> <P>  -- A week later, the San Francisco 49ers' Tom Rathman fumbled deep in Ram  territory in the fourth quarter, and the Rams came back to win, 13-12, on a  last-second field goal.  </P> <P>  -- Dallas fullback Darryl Johnson fumbled with less than five minutes to play  and, two plays later, the Rams had scored their third touchdown that was a  direct result of a Cowboy fumble. The Rams won, 35-31, when time ran out with  Dallas on the Ram 13.  </P> <P> The Rams also were lucky to get into the playoffs last season, escaping the New  England Patriots on Christmas Eve with a 24-20 victory after three Steve Grogan  passes from the Ram four-yard line fell incomplete in the end zone. In the NFC  division playoff game against the New York Giants, the Rams rallied to tie the  score in regulation, won the coin toss, were aided by a questionable 27-yard  pass interference and won on a Jim Everett pass to Flipper Anderson in  overtime.  </P> <P> "Last year, we made most of the key plays," tight end Pete Holohan says. "This  year, we've been on the short end of the stick."  </P> <P> That pretty much sums it up, and Coach John Robinson says there's no explaining  it.  </P> <P> "We're just not making the plays," he said. "Whether we're not playing as well  or not coaching as well or the fortunes of the gods of football are against us,  those are debatable questions, I guess.  </P> <P> "But we're in the situations where we can make the plays, and right now, we're  not."  </P> <P> And that -- for whatever reason -- has been the most disheartening aspect of a  season of discontent. Robinson points to four losses -- to the Philadelphia  Eagles (27-21), Cincinnati Bengals (34-31 in overtime), Dallas (24-21) and the  New Orleans Saints last Sunday (24-20) -- as the ones that got away.  </P> <P> "Our season, you could look at a lot of things that went wrong, but (those)  were all there to be won. A year ago, when all those same situations presented  themselves, we went in and scored and won. A lot of other things have  transpired this season that have been disappointing, but that certainly has  been one, just the winning and losing of games."  </P> <P> Sure, the media have been tough on Gary. And maybe the fans have been merciless  (although we haven't seen any "Doctor Drop" signs at Anaheim Stadium yet). But  Robinson says the second-year running back hasn't exactly been consoled by his  teammates, either.  </P> <P> "There weren't a lot of guys saying, 'Hang in there, Cleveland, you'll get the  next one,"' he said. "The word hanging was used, but . . . "  </P> <P> A look at the game films of Sunday's loss and a close inspection of the  statistics didn't leave Robinson feeling any better. The Rams had more than  twice as many total yards, nearly three times as many first downs and finally  throttled an opponent's passing attack.  </P> <P> "It was so one-sided, that's what was so astounding," he said, shaking his  head. "I might see how Cleveland commits suicide and do it with him."  </P> <P> Add Gary fallout: Robinson indicated that Marcus Dupree, who was activated five  weeks ago after a five-year absence from the game, might see more playing time  at tailback. But don't expect to see Dupree, who has six carries for 30 yards  as a Ram, take over the bulk of the duties.  </P> <P> "We will see Marcus in some capacity," Robinson said. "I feel like he's just  about ready to play, but there's some limit. Let's don't jump that far ahead.  Let's just see if we can get him in the game with more than a minute left in  the game. Let's just take it gradual.  </P> <P> "One of the things that really has been a problem with Cleveland is the  fundamental work he's missed in missing two training camps. Here's a guy  (Dupree) who's never had a training camp and hasn't played the game for five  years. Let's don't jump those gaps."  </P></p>

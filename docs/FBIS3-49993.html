			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Lamper article: "Skoda Plzen Denies Arms Contacts </F> With the Iranian Regime; the Documents State Otherwise"]    [Text] On Monday 10 January a strange denial was published  in MLADA FRONTA DNES: "It is out of the question that Skoda  Plzen would want to offer Iran the modernized version of the  T-72 tank." This statement was issued to the press by Skoda  Plzen Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec. According to him, he wanted to  curb "speculation by some of the media about the visit to Iran  by the Skoda director." Until Hudec's statement, however, there  had been no trace of suspicion in any Czech or foreign newspaper  that Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek had offered tanks to  Tehran. Until now, his trip to Iran has been marked by a  completely different scandal: A willingness to supply the regime  with technology for its nuclear program. Why did Spokesman  Hudec decide to deny "speculation" that has so far not occurred  to anyone?  <H5>  The Deputy Minister and the General </H5>   The answer is simple. On Friday 7 January RESPEKT asked  Director General Soudek the following question: "During your  visit to Iran at the end of last November, did you hold talks  with representatives from the Iranian Defense Ministry and  military experts"? As Soudek was unable to reply -- apparently,  he was too busy -- Jaroslav Hudec dealt with the matter: "I am  authorized to state on behalf of the director that, while he was  in Tehran, he did not hold talks with any of the people you  mention." Three days later, the aforementioned denial was  issued. Although no specific arms were mentioned in the RESPEKT  question, Hudec thought it necessary to deny in advance talks  about T-72 tanks.    The two negative statements issued by Spokesman Hudec are,  of  course, at variance with the document RESPEKT has managed to  obtain. This is an internal memorandum from the trip to Iran  prepared for select trading partners of Skoda Plzen after the  delegation's return home. The following two notes are contained  in the comprehensive text:    A Meeting at the Defense Ministry.    Present on the Iranian side: Deputy Minister Vaheed and five    members of his staff; the deputy foreign minister.    We briefed them on the RDP Group and its possibilities. We    gave them a rough outline, prepared by the RDP Group, of the    options for supplying our hardware .    Interest in:    -- the new generation of surface-to-air missiles    -- Tamara    -- the modernization of tanks.    Talks With the Army.    Present: General Rahimi, deputy head of tank production.    The general is an expert on tanks. It was recommended to:    -- send him a list of RDP Group shareholders and their  military    production program (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 31    December 1993)    -- invite representatives from the Iranian Army to a    demonstration of the T-72 and other weapons innovations    (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 2/94).    On the basis of a demonstration of the hardware, it is  possible    to conclude an agreement on the purchase of weapons or on    cooperation in the production of weapons systems in  components.  <H5>  The Risk: An Unnecessary Fuss in Advance </H5>   Jan Vlcek, the director general of the Czech RDP Group arms  consortium, knows nothing about a list of shareholders or about  inviting Iranian experts, which he is supposed to arrange. "I  have not heard anything about this," he says. "We respect the  law and Czech foreign policy." Like Jaroslav Hudec, he also  describes all the reports about talks between Soudek's team and  Iranian military officials as "mere deduction and speculation."    Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy is more cautious  in his judgment. In reply to a written question on whether he  had been informed of Soudek's talks at the Defense Ministry in  Tehran-- either before the visit or after it -- he said: "I am  only given a brief outline of Mr. Soudek's plans during his  foreign visits. I was not informed in advance of any specific  contacts in Iran. I was briefed on his talks only after the  visit was over."    And the second question was -- what do you think of them?    "During all of these negotiations, the RDP Group management  exposes itself to the substantial risk that the activities that  attract unnecessary attention in advance will come up against a  stumbling block -- that the government will not grant a license  for the anticipated exports."    There is a slight slip here: In the Czech Republic today it  is Vladimir Dlouhy's own office and not the government that  grants licenses for military contracts. According to a cabinet  resolution of May 1993, it must -- at the same time -- be guided  by the point of view of the Foreign Ministry. It, according to  its spokeswoman, Lucie Pilipova, only considers trade with  countries under the UN Security Council's embargo to be  unequivocally prohibited. Despite this, the Cernin Palace  apparently also "carefully analyzes" all other requests to  export arms and, after weighing up the situation, gives its  consent or rejects them. Would the Foreign Ministry now permit  the export of tanks and missiles to Iran? "It is impossible to  give an unequivocal answer to such a hypothetical question that  does not concern a specific application for a license," said  Pilipova. "I think, however, that, after taking into  consideration all the circumstances, our office would be  inclined to the view not to permit such exports."   <H5>    An Element of Human Culture </H5>   Jaroslav Hudec has prepared a little show piece for  reporters  in connection with the discussion on arms production at Skoda  Plzen: A copy of the technical design for a saber -- "until  now, our last arms order" -- that Skoda produced 300 of 10 years  ago for the Castle Guard. "Nevertheless, I would like to  emphasize one thing," says Mr. Hudec apropos the drawing. "Arms  production is an element of human culture. It is a fact of life  and we are realists. We are not ashamed of wanting to  manufacture special technology. Unfortunately, however, we have  found ourselves on the defensive."    It is, of course, hard to determine the true extent of this  "defensive." Skoda Plzen is one of the 40 shareholders in the  RDP Group arms consortium and, within its framework, it  coordinates the program for modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank.  "It should be a truly quality tank," said Lubomir Soudek in  LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE on 29 September last year. "We will modernize  it right on the spot based on verified documentation from  Western firms and tried-and-tested engines. I believe there  will be a great deal of interest in it. In the near future, I  will hold talks with the ministers of national defense of  certain states outside Europe. We have to agree on some  deliveries."    Now the Skoda spokesman "on behalf of Mr. Soudek" is casting  doubt on some of the statements made by his director. In  particular, it is -- apparently -- out of the question that our  arms producers could agree with anyone on supplies of the T-72  "in the near future." The entire modernization process is --  regardless of the verified documentation and the  tried-and-tested engines -- in its infancy. The company has  only just hired an expert to determine the course of the  project, to prepare the budget, calculations, and so on.  Apparently, no one has any details at the moment and nothing  will be clear for about two years. The situation is the same  with regard to another of the statements quoted --  "modernization on the spot." "So far, we do not know how the  tank's modernization will proceed," Hudec told RESPEKT. "Mr.  Soudek's statement was merely an entrepreneurial idea that has  not yet acquired firm contours."    Untrue again, at least as far as Jan Vlcek, the head of the  RDP Group, is concerned. For him it is a fait accompli:  "Country X will simply place an order for the modernization of  its tanks and we will go there and carry out the work locally.  The state where we will carry out the modernization has to be  -- naturally -- approved by the government."    There is a problem here, however. Today, there are very few  countries X that have the "T-72" and that, at the same time,  would meet our conditions for arms exports. The only logical  customer would be our army. However, the RDP Group management  itself admits that, so far, it has not managed to conclude a  contract with it. Therefore, if Vlcek's company wants to adhere  to our state's political line in its business dealings, its  stake on the T-72 looks like an inexplicable risk: The markets  that would be interested are embargoed and those to which the  tank may be exported do not want the product.    According to rival experts from this branch, the answer to  the riddle lies in the phrase "modernization on the spot."  Instead of provocative and largely unsuccessful attempts to  "smuggle" assembled weapons to terrorist countries, this method  provides scope for more dignified camouflage: Only parts of  these weapons, licenses, and the appropriate know-how can be  exported.  <H5>  Until the Bear Starts Waving His Arms </H5>   Of course, tanks and missiles were not the only hot items  discussed by the Czech businessmen during their visit to Tehran.  Apart from General Rahimi and Deputy Minister Vaheed (the former  head of the Iranian intelligence service), the Skoda Plzen  director also visited Reza Amrollahi from the Iranian Atomic  Commission. A well-known scandal erupted around these talks  immediately after the return of Soudek's delegation.    "The Iranian regime is trying to turn Prague into a  purchasing center for technology, know-how, and materials that  would be denied it elsewhere in the world," wrote the Israeli  newspaper HA'ARETZ on 5 December and thus provoked an outcry in  the domestic and foreign media. The most severe reaction came  from North America. "According to the U.S. strategic doctrine,  it is necessary to ward off the risk that Iran will produce a  nuclear weapon. Germany, after it got its fingers burnt in Iraq  and Libya, banned the export of nuclear technology to terrorist  states, but people from executive power are trying to get round  this ban. And the hungry Czechs want to sell to anyone," wrote  THE NEW YORK TIMES three days before the end of the year. The  article ended unequivocally: "If Prague sees its future as a  merchant of death, it should be told that it cannot bank on  membership in NATO. If the Russian bear again begins to wave  his arms, whom would the Czechs want to guarantee their  security? Will it turn to its nuclear customers in Tehran?"    The domestic press mostly limited itself to quoting the  official statements issued by Skoda Plzen. It admitted that  negotiations were held on supplying a reactor to Iran, but it  denied that it acted as an intermediary for Siemens or  Westinghouse. The mass media, the Skoda Plzen spokesman, and  some government ministers then repeated several times that  Skoda's offer concerns "peaceful technology," which can in no  way be used for the production of nuclear weapons. This  argument was used recently by MLADA FRONTA DNES on 10 January:  "To be slightly cynical, selling the Iranians a reactor just  means a good deal to the tune of tens of millions of korunas.  It would be hard for the company's management to explain to its  shareholders that they had left such an opportunity to the  competition."   <H5>    The Road to Prosperity </H5>   The uproar over the nuclear reactor is the second time  recently that the world has tried to scuttle Czech-Iranian  nuclear cooperation. In June 1993 the secretary at the U.S.  Embassy in Prague asked the Foreign Ministry to suspend the  contract to supply technology for extracting and processing  uranium ore concluded between the Prague company Geoindustria  GMS and the Iranian Atomic Commission. The Czech side replied  that it was impossible to turn down the deal because it involved  "peaceful equipment," but in the end -- apparently, thanks to  voluntary cooperation from the exporter -- the export deal fell  through. Last year the GMS company even terminated its work on  a geological survey of the uranium deposits in the Anarak and  Bandar Abbas regions in Iran.    Skoda Plzen, of course, refuses to make similar concessions  in the nuclear business. The pressure to terminate the contract  is, according to it, merely an "unfair move by the competition."  The question of who this competition is remains unanswered. In  democratic countries today there is no risk of being lost in the  crush over orders for the Iranian nuclear program. The Federal  Government (under pressure from the United States) prohibited  Siemens from undertaking nuclear activity in Iran several years  ago and the French Framatome company and -- of course -- the  U.S. Westinghouse company cannot export there either. Skoda has  also been criticized in the foreign press not for reasons of  "competition," but on the contrary, because -- as an alleged  intermediary -- it enables these companies to conduct prohibited  business deals.    At the moment, Iran has a contract with Russia to construct  a  nuclear power plant (the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled  power reactor] type). Russia is also apparently considering  whether to complete the half-built (and partly bombed) power  plant in Bushehr that had to be abandoned by Siemens. According  to Skoda Deputy Director Frantisek Svitak, the Plzen company is  interested in participating in -- to say the least -- the first  order as a general supplier via Russia. The point of view of  the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is  unequivocal: A project of this size will give the Iranians  considerable experience in reactor engineering and operations.  It will be essential to train local experts and to permit the  operation of test reactors that, in the long-term perspective,  will support the state's nuclear program. Moreover, if Tehran  obtains the VVER reactor, this will provide it with enough of an  excuse to submit orders for more nuclear technology.    The equally unequivocal point of view of Skoda's senior  management stands in opposition to all of this. Spokesman  Jaroslav Hudec formulated it as follows in the December issue of  the enterprise's magazine SKODOVAK: "Whether people like it or  not, our enterprise will not allow itself to be dictated to by  anyone who feels entitled to do so. We have our own way of  thinking and our own plans for achieving prosperity."</p>

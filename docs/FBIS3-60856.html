INTERFAX learned this from the director of the  ministry's Press and Information Department, Grigoriy Karasin.    According to him, every possible channel has been used for  contacts with the Iranian authorities. "For example, the  ministry's note will be forwarded not only to Iran's Foreign  Ministry, but also to the Iranian ambassadors in Moscow and  Baku," he said.</p>

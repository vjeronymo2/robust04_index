			<p>BFN     [Text] The state delegation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, led by  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, has returned to Sarajevo after  extensive work at the Vienna and Geneva talks. Haris Silajdzic  said the following about their activities and the results  achieved in Vienna where the Bosnian delegation held talks with  a Croat delegation; and in Geneva, where a ministerial  conference of the international Contact Group for  Bosnia-Herzegovina was held:    [Begin Silajdzic recording] Regarding the implementation of  the [Bosnian-Croat] agreement, I believe collective efforts have  to be made; this cannot be done only through work of the  government and a certain number of people. We all must  participate to neutralize the consequences of the conflict.  Most difficult will be returning people to their homes. I  repeat, a collective effort is needed to execute that part of  the job.    Regarding the [Geneva] communique I believe President  Izetbegovic has analyzed its positive and negative sides in  great detail. One could underline the problem of the  continuation of the talks and the problem of guarantees. I  think the international community has not committed itself  regarding the continuation of the talks and the guarantees. It  did set up some coordinates and a basic concept, but the  obligations stemming from all this for the international  community are not clear. The communique contains general  clauses saying UN Security Council resolution should be  respected. This is clear without the communique, but they are  not being respected.    The main question is: How will this round of negotiations,  which we are entering with best intentions and a desire to  resolve the question peacefully, differ from the previous one?  What are we talking about here? Agreements have been reached  before, but there were no instruments to implement them [words  indistinct]    We ask the question: If the aggressor does not join the  talks  -- they are now making it conditional on the lifting of the  sanctions -- what will the international community do if they  stick to this position? We cannot allow the status quo to  continue -- which is what the aggressor wants to achieve -- on  the territories conquered by force. The international community  still does not have answers to this, nor adequate measures. And  another question is: What happens if we reach an agreement, but  the aggressor does not want to observe it? What happens then?  There is no answer to this either.    The third question is the question of guarantees we had  raised before, in particular at assembly sessions. What  guarantees do we have that Bosnia-Herzegovina will not again  become the victim of aggression, an invasion from Serbia and  Montenegro? That Bosnia-Herzegovina will not again be a scene  of new confrontations? We want international guarantees  regarding this issue. There is no answer to any of this. We  have their assurances, but no guarantees. The problem is in the  credibility of the international community, the credibility  whose roots have been to a large extent damaged. The question  now arises: If the international community cannot resolve the  question of respecting the Gorazde 3 km exclusion zone, how can  it then resolve the global question of Bosnia-Herzegovina? We  have not got an answer to this. We have been told the  international community is working on it. Talks about this are  under way, but no decision on this has yet been made. [end  recording]</p>

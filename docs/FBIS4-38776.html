			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev [no date as received] -- Speaking at a  plenary session of Ukraine's Supreme Council today, President  Leonid Kravchuk emphasized an urgent need to resolve the  situation in Crimea, describing it as a matter of peace on the  European continent. [passage omitted]    Leonid Kravchuk stressed that peace on the peninsula can be  achieved only by placing Crimea in the framework of Ukraine's  Constitution and laws. He said that the Crimean leaders'  references to the agreement between Tatarstan and the Russian  Federation as an example are misplaced since they cite an  agreement between a federation and its part which clearly  defines the federation's supremacy.    Leonid Kravchuk described the actions of the Crimean  leadership as destructive to Ukraine's sovereignty. He said  Ukraine's Government has always met Crimea halfway, which is  obvious from the laws on the delimitation of powers between the  state authorities of Ukraine and Crimea and on the open economic  system in Crimea that enables the republic to function in a wide  legal range. The Government of Ukraine also accepts Crimea's  proposals of wide- ranging budgetary freedom. But Crimea is not  living up to its budgetary obligations.    Leonid Kravchuk also pointed out Crimea's tendency to  attract  specialists from Russia which reveals a disregard for local  personnel and, in the president's view, violates the law of  Ukraine on citizenship. [passage omitted]    Leonid Kravchuk stressed that stabilization in Crimea will  facilitate completion of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia  on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the deployment of the  two fleets from separate bases, a definition of the status of  the Crimea-based Russian fleet, payment of compensation for the  ships which Ukraine is giving up as redundant, the division of  the marine infantry, and so on.    Leonid Kravchuk proposed a draft resolution to be passed by  Ukraine's Supreme Council "On Implementation of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council Resolution of 20 May 1994 on Suspension of the  Law of the Crimean Republic on the Restoration of the  Constitutional Foundations of the Crimean Republic." It  proposes to form a Ukrainian constitutional court with  decision-making powers, instruct the Ukrainian Supreme Council  chairman to ask the Constitutional Court to decide whether the  Crimean republic's law "On the Restoration of the Constitutional  Foundations of the Crimean Republic" accords with the  Constitution and laws of Ukraine, advise the Supreme Council of  Crimea to reconsider bringing the autonomy's Constitution in  line with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine, and establish  that the Ukrainian Supreme Council resolution of 20 May 1994  remains valid pending a relevant judgement by the Constitutional  Court of Ukraine.    A total of 58 people's deputies of Ukraine signed up to  speak  in the debate. In their speeches, deputies are calling for  dissolution of the Crimean Supreme Council and suspension of its  activities (Ivan Zayets, Vasyl Kornelyuk, Andriy Mostytskyy) and  the introduction of direct presidential rule. Some suggest  forming a delegation of deputies to go to Crimea to study all  aspects of the problem, and considering interstate agreements  between Ukraine and Russia on the inadmissibility of  infringement of territorial integrity (Ruslan Bodelan).    The debate continues.</p>

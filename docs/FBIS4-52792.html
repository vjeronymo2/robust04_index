			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Vice Premier Nguyen Khanh this week left for an  official visit to Syria and Egypt. Meanwhile, Vice President  Nguyen Thi Binh has been in South Africa to attend the  swearing-in ceremony of the new South African president, Nelson  Mandela. These diplomatic activities show relations between  Vietnam and countries in Africa and the Middle East are  developing positively. Here is our comments on these events:    Due to geographic difficulties, relations between Vietnam  and  countries in Africa and the Middle East have not developed,  though the peoples in that region offered support towards the  national liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people in the  past as well as in national construction at present. Those  geographical obstacles are now less difficult. Many countries  in that region have invited Vietnamese leaders to pay working  visits. In response to their warm sentiments, in March Vice  President Nguyen Thi Binh led a Vietnamese delegation to visit  Algeria, Guinea, and Mali. Vietnam signed with those three  countries agreements on economic, cultural, scientific and  technological, and trade cooperation. At the end of last week,  Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh left for South Africa to attend  the swearing-in ceremony of President Nelson Mandela. There,  she met leaders of African countries and affirmed Vietnam's  determination to strengthen cooperative ties with them,  particularly with the new South Africa.    In the Middle East, with the current visit by Vice Premier  Nguyen Khanh to Syria and Egypt, new prospects in cooperation  have been opened up. Trade agreements have been signed between  Vietnam and Syria and Egypt. Vietnam now has expanded its  relations with all regions in the world. It has genuinely  integrated into the international community. Vietnam's foreign  policy to befriend all countries in the world and its  achievement in the current economic renovation are keys to  Vietnam's successes.</p>

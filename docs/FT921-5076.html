			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hopewell climbs to HKDollars 700m HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled by local entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 94 per cent rise in earnings to HKDollars 700m (USDollars 90.9m) in the half-year to December 1991, from HKDollars 361m in the corresponding period of 1990. The half-year profit figure included a HKDollars 285m exceptional gain from the disposal of a partial interest in a Hong Kong property development. Turnover was down 19.5 per cent to HKDollars 600m from HKDollars 716.9m Adjusted for a one-for-one rights issue last June, Hopewell's earning per share fell to 19 cents from 22 cents. Directors declared an interim dividend of 14 cents a share, up from 11 cents for the previous period. They said they expected to achieve 'encouraging results' this year. Directors said that good progress had been made during the half-year on the construction of a super highway linking Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, with the special economic zones of Shenzhen and Zhuhai. Detailed design work was underway on plans it has to build an elevated road and rail system in Bangkok, together with associated property development. Initial site work will start this month, and full-scale construction is planned for later in the year. The company's power stations in Guangdong are currently supplying 12 per cent of total electricity consumed in the province. A preliminary agreement has been signed with the Guangdong government to construct a third power station. The company is now in negotiations with suppliers. Its power plant in Luzon, the Philippines, is operating well and it is planning another to feed into the Luzon grid.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average loses 1.9 per cent on arbitrage selling SHARE prices lost ground in light trading and the Nikkei average, which rose initially on the stronger yen, finally declined by 1.9 per cent on arbitrage-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed down 343.64 at 18,004.11, after a high of 18,502.61 and a low of 18,003.31. The yen's strength and higher bond prices encouraged a rise in the stock futures market, but the Nikkei plunged on arbitrage unwinding in the afternoon. Volume fell to 180m shares from 240m. Traders said institutions, which believe that the Nikkei will fall to the 17,000 level again, are unwilling to chase share prices up at the higher levels. Declines led advances by 650 to 303 with 161 unchanged and the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 15.78 to 1,360.54; in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.04 to 1,077.37. The Bank of Japan continued its dollar selling intervention in the foreign exchange market, and the US currency closed down Y1.55 against the yen, falling below Y127 for the first time since February. The strength in the yen boosted hopes of lower interest rates, encouraging buying in the stock futures market. However, market participants, unwilling to hold long positions ahead of next week's June futures expiry unwound positions. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel added that the cash market failed to react to the yen's strength, as currency moves were already discounted into share prices last week. Bio-technology related, speculative issues rose on short-term dealer trading. Nippon Mining, the most active issue of the day, rose Y9 to Y478 and Meiji Milk Products advanced Y1 to Y913. Housing companies gained on the rise in April housing starts, the first year-on-year rise in 18 months. Taisei Prefab gained Y30 to Y2,400 and National House Industrial rose Y30 to Y1,690. Steel companies were hit by poor earnings results and weak forecasts for the current year. The top five steel makers posted double digit declines in pre-tax profits for the past fiscal year, and expect current year pre-tax profits to decline sharply due to weak demand and higher production costs. Nippon Steel fell Y4 to Y299 and NKK dropped Y1 to Y284. Car companies were also sold on earnings concerns. Nissan Motor, which announced a 47 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March, lost Y15 to Y617, and Toyota Motor fell Y10 to Y1,500. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 45.50 to 20,832.38 in volume of 14.3m shares. Roundup THE fall on Toyko had a negative impact on most of the region yesterday. New Zealand was closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG saw early gains eroded by selling of blue chips in the afternoon and the Hang Seng index closed 24.15 lower at 6,056.00. Turnover was HKDollars 5.1bn. Cheung Kong was the most active stock, gaining 50 cents at HKDollars 27.20 while Hutchison Whampoa put on 10 cents to HKDollars 20.00. SEOUL weakened on selling of bank and securities shares. The composite index shed 5.01 to 569.19 in turnover of Won240.5bn. Shares in Hyundai companies fell to their lower limits. TAIWAN lost ground in thin trade as sentiment was upset by worries that the central bank may tighten money market liquidity. The weighted index fell 39.73 to 4,456.85 in turnover of TDollars 16.6bn. KUALA LUMPUR declined in the absence of fresh news. The composite index shed 3.76 to 585.33. Tenaga lost 25 cents to MDollars 8.25 while Malaysian Airline declined 15 cents to MDollars 5.65 after last week's announcement of a rights issue. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index closed 3.9 lower at 1,674.4 in turnover of ADollars 169.8m. Banks continued to weaken after recent poor results: Westpac slipped 4 cents to ADollars 3.46 while ANZ lost 8 cents to ADollars 4.17 as investors reacted to its exposure to India's securities market scandal. BANGKOK improved on reports that an interim prime minister will be appointed soon to oversee constitutional amendments. The SET Index closed up 10.06 at 698.90 in turnover of Bt3.2bn. MANILA slipped back with the composite index closing down 11.53 to 1,387.92 in combined turnover of 187.3m pesos. SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 14.17 to 1,510.52 in turnover of SDollars 101m. BOMBAY recovered from early weakness, amid rumours that more banks face trouble in the current securities scandal, to end mixed on institutional buying. After going as low as 2,928 the BSE index closed only 5 lower at 3,001.</p>

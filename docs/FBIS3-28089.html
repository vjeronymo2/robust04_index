			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The Finance Ministry on  Thursday announced a two-stage plan to ease foreign exchange  controls during the first half of the year. In the first stage  starting in late January, the ceiling on an individual's foreign  exchange holdings overseas will be raised from the current 2,000  U.S. dollars to 20,000 dollars.    Corporations' qualifications for holding and using foreign  exchange overseas will be relaxed by reducing the minimum  requirement for an annual two-way trade achievement from 100  million dollars to 10 million dollars to increase the number of  qualified firms from the current 136 to 1,304. The ceiling on  these firms' foreign exchange holdings abroad will also be  raised from 10 percent of the trade achievement or 100 million  dollars to 30 percent or 300 million dollars, whichever is  larger. But to prevent inflows of hot money, individuals  receiving an unrequited remittance of more than 20,000 dollars  from abroad will face restrictions when they convert it into  won. These restrictions are not yet known.    Those with an unrequited receipt of more than 50,000 dollars  in foreign exchange a year will be referred to tax collectors  for possible taxation.    Conversion of foreign exchange into won by non-residents  (foreigners) will be limited to 20,000 dollars a month when the  conversion has nothing to do with authorized payment in won for  their business in the country.    The scope of foreign securities investment will be expanded:  Securities houses, investment trust companies and insurance  firms will be free to invest as much as they want in foreign  securities markets, as banks now are, while pension funds and  other investment funds and short-term finance firms will be  allowed to invest as much as 100 million dollars, instead of the  current limit of 50 million dollars, in overseas securities  markets.    In the second quarter, individual investors will be allowed  to invest in foreign securities.    As insurance firms now do, banks, securities houses,  investment trust firms, short-term finance houses, pension funds  and general trading companies will be permitted to invest in  real estate abroad, while foreign direct investment will be  liberalized except in industries where restrictions on Korean  investment are deemed necessary.    Under the second stage to be implemented during the second  quarter, the number of current transactions of goods and  services requiring a bank's approval for settlement of accounts  in foreign exchange will be reduced from 109 to 39 to 49. Those  still requiring a bank's approval are transactions considered to  be of an anti-social nature, such as payment for capital flight  or that related to gambling and drugs.    The classification of foreign exchange banks into A and B  classes will be scrapped.</p>

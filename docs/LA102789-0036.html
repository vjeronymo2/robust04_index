			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COUNTING HEADS  </P> <P> More folks than ever went to the opera in the United States last year. The  Central Opera Service, a research department of the Metropolitan Opera, says  that 1988-89 attendance was up 21% over 1987-88, with a record 21.4 million  people attending a performance. That figure continued a growth that's been  going on for 30 years, but it broke the pattern by doubling any earlier  one-year increase. The report lists 1,285 opera-producing organizations in the  United States (same as 1987-88) but performances rose from 21,197, to 24,923.  The most performed works: Seymour Barab's "Little Red Riding Hood" (733  performances) and Gian Carlo Menotti's "Amahl and the Night Visitors" (563  performances). Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" was the most frequent standard  with 279 performances. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

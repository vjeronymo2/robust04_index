			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Howard Smith profits slide HOWARD Smith, the Sydney-based shipping and engineering group, felt the sting of the Australian recession in the first half to December with a 75 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 25.67m (USDollars 19.74m) from ADollars 104.07m a year earlier, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The decline was in spite of a 7.6 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 352.2m from ADollars 327.25m. The interim dividend is being held at 10 cents a share. A key factor in the result was a reduction from ADollars 15.8m to ADollars 6.9m in interest revenue following payment last year of a ADollars 140.1m special dividend and capital return. This payout capped a turbulent period for the company as it battled to throw off effective control by the Adelaide Steamship group, then headed by entrepreneur Mr John Spalvins. Howard Smith directors said the company had suffered from recession in Australia and the UK, where it controls the Medway towage and salvage group.</p>

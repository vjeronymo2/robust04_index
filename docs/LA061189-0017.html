			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SMORGASBORD OF 'PHANTOM' LETTERS  </P> <P> I usually agree with Martin Bernheimer -- or as much as anyone can with any  critic who offers his opinion in "I have spoken" terms -- but not in his  denigration of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work ("A Smorgasbord of Mush," June 4).  </P> <P> It seems to be chic to extol Stephen Sondheim (yet if asked what he wrote, all  anyone can mention is "Send In the Clowns") to the belittlement of Lloyd  Webber, whose entire score of "Evita" is brilliant, whose song from "Cats,"  "Memory," must be one of the most beautiful ever written.  </P> <P> Lloyd Webber is the great composer of popular music. I too have spoken.  </P> <P> JACK P. GABRIEL  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

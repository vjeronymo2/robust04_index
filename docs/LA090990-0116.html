			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAXMAN DENIES REDISTRICTING PLOY  </P> <P> In your Aug. 26 edition you report that I would redistrict Rep. Anthony C.  Beilenson's seat so as to turn it Republican.  </P> <P> This contention is totally false. While I may or may not have some input, I  most certainly will not use what ever influence I may have to destroy the  career of a fellow Democrat.  </P> <P> Rep. Beilenson and I have been friends and colleagues for two decades. Had your  reporter checked with me, he would have learned that I have no desire to bring  about such a change.  </P> <P> REP. HENRY WAXMAN  </P> <P> 24th Congressional District  </P></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Ofwat critical of bigger suppliers Three of the 10 big water and sewerage companies fell short of the level of service customers could reasonably expect in at least one of seven areas measured by Ofwat, the industry regulator said yesterday. Of the three  - Anglian, Thames and Yorkshire  - Thames's performance was the poorest, scoring 'good' marks in only one area of service where the companies were directly comparable and 'below' or 'well below' average in the other three. Ofwat's findings are likely to stoke criticism of the big water and sewerage concerns, privatised in 1989. Virtually all have since been pilloried for their high profits and the big salary increases awarded to senior executives. Ofwat said smaller water companies, particularly those concentrating on drinking water, had the highest standards of service in 1993-94. The highest accolades went to South Staffordshire and York Waterworks, two 'water only' groups. Both performed particularly well in the four measures of service where the companies were directly comparable. Five companies  - Southern, Bristol, Hartlepool, Mid Southern, and Sutton District, performed well. All except Southern are 'water only' concerns.</p>

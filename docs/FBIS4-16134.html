			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 477] </F>   [Text] VILNIUS, April 13, ELTA -- "The new Lithuanian  foreign policy in solving problems between Lithuania and Russia  presents danger for Lithuania," the former Defence Minister  Audrius Butkevicius said.    Butkevicius said that "Lithuania has never had any  obligations to Russia as far as the withdrawal of Russian army  is concerned."    Meanwhile, Lithuanian Government and General Prosecutor's  Office publicized a joint statement which said that "Lithuania  has carried out all the obligations to Russia by building houses  for Russian officers in Kaliningrad enclave." According to  Butkevicius, the houses in Kaliningrad enclave were built by the  firm which had been chosen by Russian Defence Ministry and  Baltic Military Navy. Butkevicius noted that it made possible to  avoid the obligations to Russia.</p>

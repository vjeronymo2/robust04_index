			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Bidders still in the dark over mines privatisation: Vital questions remain about the British Coal sell-off MR Tim Eggar, the energy minister, was being studiously vague yesterday about his plans to privatise British Coal. Officially this is because details will have to await the Queen's speech in November, but many sensitive questions remain to be answered. Chief among these is just how much of the company will be left to privatise. In order to achieve a successful sale, British Coal will almost certainly have to close more of its marginal deep pits, bringing the operating total down from 30 to as few as 15. The precise number will depend on how much additional coal the two large power generators, National Power and PowerGen, will be willing to buy, over and above their existing five-year contracts. However, they have huge stocks  -33m tonnes at the latest count - and will be reluctant to buy more than token amounts. So privatisation will mean further pit closures. The government could help British Coal by requiring generators to hold larger stocks, and by offering subsidies for additional coal sales. But details of those plans have yet to emerge. Mr Eggar was also vague about the kind of criteria he would use to decide the winning bidders in next year's sale. Will they be strictly commercial criteria, or would a commitment to save jobs earn a bidder extra brownie points? 'We will look at bids on their merits and make a judgment about those issues,' he said. 'Our aim is to achieve the largest economically viable coalmining industry in the longer term.' This may not be enough to satisfy potential bidders. 'I'd like to learn a lot more about what type of evaluations they will apply,' said Mr Crispian Hotson, chief executive of Ryan International, one of the private-sector mining companies expected to make an offer. Another unresolved question surrounds the extent of the liabilities that purchasers would have to take on. It is expected that British Coal's past liabilities - for example for subsidence - will be assumed by the government, along with commitments to protect pensions and miners' rights to free coal. Successful bidders would take on new liabilities. Mr Eggar declined to give any numbers yesterday. However, the uncertainties are not likely to dampen the appetite of potential bidders. Apart from Ryan, these will include Coal Investments, a new company set up by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of British Coal, and RJB Mining, recently floated on the Stock Exchange. A number of management buy-outs are also being prepared, including those led by trade unions such as the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and BACM, the mine managers' union. Some of them, such as BACM, will want to bid for all five parcels on offer, believing that a large company stands the strongest chance of success. Others will only bid selectively. Parcels containing a mix of deep and open-cast mines are likely to be most attractive because open-cast provides cleaner coal and lower costs. The Yorkshire area is likely to be the least attractive because of its dominance by Mr Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers.</p>

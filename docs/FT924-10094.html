			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Turkmenistan gas pipeline deal A US-Turkish consortium has signed an agreement with the government of Turkmenistan which officials say paves the way for the group to build a natural gas pipeline to Europe, a deal worth an estimated Dollars 4bn. The consortium, led by Emron and Wing Merril of the US, together with the local Turkish group Gama Guris, signed an accord with President Saparmurad Niyazov during the summit of Turkic leaders in Ankara at the weekend. The accord envisages a feasibility study of the six possible routes to export the gas from the landlocked Central Asian republic. Officials said Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, was being approached to organise the financing. The deal ends months of anxiety that Turkmenistan would seek to export its gas via Iran. The consortium confirmed yesterday that Botas, Turkey's state-owned pipeline company, would be asked to join. Botas has proposed the pipeline run under the Caspian sea to Baku in Azerbaijan, and from there through the Caucasus to Turkey, where it would pick up the existing gas pipeline to Europe. For hydraulics and technical reasons, engineers at Botas have identified a route passing along the Araz river on Armenia's southern border with Iran. The consortium is understood to be in direct negotiations with Armenia, though Turkey does not have full relations with Yerevan. Turkmenistan produces about 86bn cubic metres of gas a year, of which 8bn is consumed domestically. Reserves are estimated at around 13 trillion cu m of gas in its Sovyetabad field. Botas says Uzbekistan might be able to feed its own smaller production into the pipeline. Turkey itself imports 5bn cu m of gas every year, much of it from Russia. Construction is almost complete for a 2bn cu m capacity gas terminal near Istanbul to receive Algerian gas. Negotiations are also under way to receive Qatar and Libyan gas. But much of the Turkmen exports would be destined to pass through Thrace to European markets.</p>

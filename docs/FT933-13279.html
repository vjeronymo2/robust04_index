			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Trinity pays Pounds 23m for 26 Argus titles TRINITY International, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, has reached agreement to buy the 26 local newspapers of the Argus Press in a deal worth Pounds 23m. The agreement, which is subject to contract, due diligence and the permission of the Department of Trade and Industry, takes Trinity into the south of England newspaper market for the first time. The Chester-based publisher owns local and regional newspapers in north-west England, North Wales, Canada and the US and a year ago bought Scottish and Universal Newspapers from Lonrho for Pounds 45m. The purchase of the Argus titles, which includes newspapers such as the South London Press and the Surrey Comet, will extend Trinity's geographical spread. The Argus Press was owned by BET until 1988 when it formed part of a Pounds 206m management buy-out. There was intense competition for the papers and it is believed that a consortium of Reed International and Emap may have bid more. The Trinity bid was apparently preferred because it is much more likely to get clearance under monopoly regulations. In the 12 months to December 26 Trinity reported pre-tax profits ahead 27 per cent to Pounds 16.9m. The company, which is planning to become one of the leading publishers of local newspapers in the UK, has been turning itself into a more concentrated media company. Last year it sold its paper and packaging division for Pounds 27m.</p>

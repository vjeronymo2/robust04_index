			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU generics at a disadvantage Sir, In his article, 'Price wars over name-dropping' (May 18), Daniel Green points out that this year's expiry of US patents on many branded pharmaceuticals will result in a rapid increase in the supply of generic medicines. While this is good news for US-based pharmaceutical companies supplying generics, it brings no joy to EU-based generic companies which operate under more restrictive patent laws. Under US law, generic companies can develop and register their products in advance of patent expiry and thus put their products on the market the day after patent expiry. Generic companies operating under EU laws are usually only allowed to begin product development or authorisation procedures after patent expiry (see my letter published in the FT, October 18 1993). This restriction not only limits EU generic manufacturers from competing equally with US companies in the US market but also ensures that in the European pharmaceutical market, generic competition will not be anywhere as intense as Daniel Green depicted for the US market.

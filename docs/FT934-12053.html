			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Cleveland Trust gets Pounds 12.6m price tag CLEVELAND TRUST, which dates back to 1891, has become the first new property company to seek a listing since the bottom fell out of the market in 1989. The company, which specialises in investing in modern industrial units, has placed through UBS 10m ordinary shares at a price of 100p, raising Pounds 9.6m net of expenses. The issue is understood to have been well received. After the placing there will be 12.56m shares in issue, giving the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 12.6m. Net asset value per share will be 96.3p. The directors intend to recommend a final dividend of 2.2p for the year ending March 1994. This gives a notional net dividend of 5.28p. The notional gross prospective yield at the placing price is 6.6 per cent. Mr David Heynes, chairman, said yesterday that the company would use Pounds 1.5m of the cash to buy two further properties, at Aberdeen and Flint, North Wales, with a gross yield of 13.3 per cent. The remaining Pounds 8m would be spent in expanding the group 'as quickly as we reasonably can.' He said that throughout the recession net asset value per share had risen from 72p in September 1990 to 97p at the end of September this year. Cleveland Trust was primarily a residential landlord based in Middlesbrough until Mr Heynes and his partner, Mr Nicholas Ridley, took a 26 per cent holding in 1987. The two bought the entire company in 1991, and have turned it into a purely industrial property company. Trading is expected to begin on November 2.</p>

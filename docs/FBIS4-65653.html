			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to introduce the </F> government democratization and restructuring plan, in Ankara --  live]    [Text] My dear colleagues and valued representatives from  our press and television. I respectfully greet you all.    The coalition governments established by the two big central  right parties and the central left party following the 1991  elections made a great promise to our people. This was a  promise of democratization and restructuring. The activities  undertaken by the 49th government on this issue have now  achieved a comprehensive entirety and a concrete essence as a  result of the democratization and restructuring plan the 50th  government is announcing today.    Our world will enter a new century in six years. It is  natural and necessary for Turkey, which experienced a great leap  in the 20th century with a lot of effort and unfaltering  conviction, to get ready for a new leap. Turkey will have  another encounter with history. Since the establishment of our  republic we have made achievements in all fields of our social  life of which we can really be proud. We have achieved great  developments. No one can deny this. I would like to state with  gratitude and appreciation that all previous governments have  exerted efforts and have a share in these developments. Our  world, however, is rapidly changing and being restructured.  Turkey, on the other hand, needs to change at a faster pace.  Naturally, our people's expectations have increased. When we  come to think of it, we were a nation of 13 million, most of  whom were living in villages and rural areas with little  involvement in world developments. Now our population exceeds  60 million. Most of our citizens live in cities and urban  areas. Our youth are especially well aware of world  developments. They aspire for the same rights and opportunities  granted to the people of the contemporary world. They,  therefore, have expectations and rightfully so. It is not  possible nor is it right to keep our people within narrow  confines. From time to time there are calls for advancement  from all sectors of our community and from all parts of our  country. A new leap is needed in Turkey. We should be entering  the 21st century as a contemporary and productive country with  an equitable distribution of wealth and in which human rights  and democratic freedoms are being fully exercised.    The economic stability and restructuring program which we  announced on 5 April might well be the most comprehensive in our  country's history. We are implementing the 5 April decisions  with strong convictions and determination. We will not allow  for any deviations. The current passing difficulties should not  discourage anyone. The economic measures we have taken are,  step by step, reaching their goals. By the end of the first  three-month implementation period everyone will realize that  better results will be achieved.    The aim of the 18 May decisions, which we are announcing  today, is to provide a brand new structural framework for Turkey  -- politically, administratively, and socially. The two main  approaches that will be used to bring about this process are:  first, amendments to the Constitution and its laws; second, the  seventh five-year development plan for 1995-1999 to which we  attach great importance.    I would like to discuss first the Constitution and then the  envisaged amendments to the laws. The government will support  removing all constitutional, legislative, or de facto deterrents  to freedom of thought and expression in our country. We want  all of these obstacles and difficulties eliminated. We think  that this is an essential element of a democratic society that  respects its people.    We cannot ignore Turkey's Constitution during the process of  democratization. We are all aware that the Turkish Republic was  guided by three different constitutions over 70 years. Today,  the Constitution of 1982 lags behind the process of  democratization and restructuring. For this reason, we need a  new constitution to meet the expectations and ideals of a  democratic civilian society; a constitution that will include  the characteristics of democratic institutions found in the  Western world and that will also provide for the participation  of its citizens. This constitution, by recognizing and  determining basic rights and freedoms, has to be based on a  democratic framework.    For these reasons, we believe that we have to start our  democratization program with a new constitution. Experts from  the two parties that are partners in the coalition government  worked intensively on the problems involved in creating a new  draft constitution and they will continue to do so. During the  next three months, we will hold discussions with the other  political parties on the draft constitution and the discussions  will be open to the public. Following these assessments, the  new draft constitution will be submitted to the Turkish Grand  National Assembly [TGNA].    I call on all political parties and public institutions to  cooperate in drawing up a civil and democratic constitution.    Honorable members of the press, undoubtedly preparing a new  constitution will take time. We propose the following:    Regarding Article 67 of the Constitution -- already existing  and approved by the TGNA -- on the right to vote, to be elected,  and to conduct political activities, we propose the right to  vote and participate in a referendum for all Turkish citizens  who are 18 and older and the right to vote for Turkish citizens  living abroad.    Regarding Article 68 on political party legislation, we  propose reducing the membership age for political parties from  21 to 18 and that permission be granted to establish auxiliary  organizations such as women's or youth groups to encourage a  participatory and pluralistic democracy.    In Article 69, on the principles by which political parties  have to be governed, we propose eliminating all restrictions on  cooperation and relationships between political parties and  trade unions, professional organizations, syndicates, waqf's,  corporations, and public institutions.    As to Article 76, on the requirements for running for the  post of deputy, we propose reducing the minimum age to be  elected deputy from 30 to 25.    We want these amendments to take effect as soon as possible.  Work is under way to achieve this.    In addition, in Article 82, we think that the ban on  deputies' not being able to serve in professional organizations  and trade unions should be removed. We also envisage eliminating  the restrictions in Article 84 regarding the resignations of  TGNA members.    Regarding Article 135, we believe in removing the laws which  foresee the abolition of professional establishments on the  contention that they are politically active.    It is necessary to eliminate the existing bans in Article 51  of the Constitution on the right to establish unions and in  Article 52 on union activities.    Work on these issues will be completed as soon as possible.  These amendments to the Constitution will assist Turkey in  making great leaps forward toward democratization. When these  amendments are made, 7 million young people will, for the first  time, vote and thus play a role in determining the fate of our  country. Out of 2.5 million citizens who live abroad, 1.4  million will have the right to vote from their place of  residence. In the 1991 elections, only 46,000 citizens could  vote by personally arriving at the border gates. This  modification will eliminate our citizens from feeling alien and  will give them the right to have their say in governing their  countries.    Unions, syndicates, and trade unions, as an organized power  in our society, will be able to increase their participation and  effectiveness in the political life of Turkey.    Lowering the eligible age to be elected deputy to 25 will  increase the voice of the younger generation in our parliament  and will encourage the youth to be more responsive to the  country's problems. With this modification, in the 1996  elections, approximately 6 million young people will have the  right to be elected and enter the parliament. This kind of  participation will give the Turkish parliament a new force and  dynamism.    These amendments will also eliminate a great number of  restrictions which do not meet the principles of  democratization. For these reasons, we give great importance to  these changes in the Constitution. We believe these changes are  the stepping stones toward democratization and reconstruction.    In addition to these modifications, valuable experts from  both parties have worked intensively on other articles in the  Constitution. Assessing these works, we are going to propose  other amendments to the Constitution.    Undoubtedly, there is a need for conciliation and  cooperation  with the political parties represented in the assembly in order  to initiate the changes in the Constitution. Our government is  ready to fulfill all the duties that fall on it to facilitate  this cooperation and conciliation.    In addition to the changes in the Constitution, we foresee  60  new draft bills within the framework of the democratization and  reconstruction program. We decided that 20 of the planned 60  draft bills have high priority. After the 20 draft bills with  high priority are passed we will submit the rest to the Assembly.    In the report that we have distributed to you, there is a  list of all the proposed draft bills.    Dear friends, with your permission, I would like to explain  the reconstruction process. We see the reconstruction process  embodying all political, legal, economic, administrative, and  social arrangements envisaged by the democratization process.    Reconstruction has both internal and external dimensions.  Our government believes that Turkey should integrate with the  civilized world. Turkey has made its choice to become a member  of the European Union. We will also achieve a uniform customs  arrangement. Communication and flow of information with the rest  of the world is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are  going to increase the channels of communication and information  and if necessary we are going to institutionalize them.    The reconstruction process aims to use the seventh  development plan as its main mean in attaining the hoped for  ends. Turkey, up to now, has survived six different development  plans. We are integrating with the world and we have to offer a  new strategy in the seventh development plan. We will provide  this strategy. This development plan is different than its  predecessors; it will provide for Turkey's reconstruction and  integration into the civilized world and include the necessary  principles and measures toward that end.    There are differences in the development levels of various  regions in our country at the socioeconomic level. The  differences are especially obvious in the east, southeast, and  Black Sea regions. All the former governments exerted great  efforts to eradicate these differences. One of the most  important examples of these efforts is the GAP [Southeast  Anatolia Project]. Our government sees the eradication of the  developmental differences between the regions as the most  important and basic need of a social state. It is essential to  provide minimum living conditions for everybody in the country,  for all the citizens of our country. The state will continue to  have a leading role in the regions which have priority regarding  development plans. Industry will have priority until it reaches  a certain level. New centers will be established in the pilot  regions to make them more attractive. Regional development  projects will be implemented.    The seventh five-year plan will make use of regional and  physical techniques. GAP, which is the largest integrated  regional development project, will be serve as an example for  other regions. Regional development plans will also be  implemented for the Black Sea town of Zonguldak. One of the  main prerequisites for the development of our undeveloped  regions is to provide security. For this reason, before  everything else, we are determined to bring peace and  tranquillity to these regions.    Valued members of the press, the Turkish Republic is a  undivided state. As we have announced in our government  program, we will not allow any behavior that will harm the  structure of this undivided state. We are going to handle all  social issues within this framework. As indicated in the  government protocol; any physical or legal shortcomings,  hindrances, or limitations in the protection, free expression,  or development of our citizens' cultural, linguistic, or ethnic  identities will be handled within a national unity framework and  eradicated. The important point here is that all citizens, who  are faithfully tied to the Turkish Republic by their  citizenship, should continue to profit equally from their rights  as citizens and individuals, without discrimination, and this  guarantee should be strengthened.    Another aspect of the restructuring and democratization  process is to provide Turkey with an up-to-date understanding of  a centralized administrative structure. Our plan has the  characteristics of reform. We had the following determination  when we started our work, that today a centralized structure is  not possible anymore and that today it is impossible to govern  Turkey from Ankara. For this reason, we are determined to hand  over to provincial administrations a great number of services  which are conducted by the central government. Provincial  administrations will be responsible for the development and  progress of their own regions in cooperation with the  municipalities. These provincial administrations will not only  play a leading role in developing their regions but will also  have full authority -- in cooperation with the municipalities --  over their area in the construction, maintenance, and management  of villages; roads, drinking water installations, electricity,  mosques and schools, social and administrative installations,  small industry centers, organized industrial areas, cultural  centers, sports installations, health centers, and hospitals.    The basis of this structure we developed for the provincial  administrations and municipalities is that these establishments  will have the authority to collect and impose taxes in their  regions by councils appointed through elections.    Valuable press members, in conclusion I would like to point  out the following: Obviously, democratization and restructuring  is a process. We cannot belittle the great steps taken toward  this end since the establishment of our republic.    Today when we are on the threshold of the 21st century, our  government is determined to overcome all obstacles in the way of  democratization and contemporary values. Our government sees as  its historical duty the opening of the horizons of our people by  establishing a pluralistic and participatory democratic system  based on tolerance and conciliation. Turkey, which is part of  the changing world, will enter the new century as an exemplary  and leading country on the one hand -- without losing its  identity and national values -- and on the other, as a country  which embraces universal values.    Our government, with the belief that the state exists to  serve its people, has announced this democratization and  restructuring implementation plan fully aware of its  responsibilities. We call on all our political parties,  democratic organizations, and each and every one of our people  to cooperate in the application of this package.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Arts: Some Singing Blood Heidi Thomas's latest new play is a weird brew of the louche, the lapidary and the loquacious. The situation is of the louchest: from Blackpool, a bereaved young daughter brings her father's ashes in a biscuit-tin to scatter them at the Zimbabwe retreat of an old Army friend, who proves to have been his lover in Korea - and whom she then decides to marry. (Little crunches are to punctuate the evening as the cinders get trodden underfoot.) Her mother arrives from her dress-shop in tepid pursuit, with a crisp wedding-gown and a limp uncle in tow. Mostly they deliver themselves in archly compacted phrases. Describing her (transvestite) father's terminal decline, Alison remarks: 'Empathy became a habit to us'. Later, her unlikely fiance tells her 'You have laid waste the map'; and widowed Iris declares that 'Disasters run piggyback through my life'. But often the laconic sentences come in long paragraphs: sooner or later even the most tight-lipped characters - Anton Rodgers' impeccably curdled old lover, Gary McDonald's gentle, sullen Man Friday-figure - get their arias and duets, visionary, reminiscent and/or confessional. As with Christopher Fry and Joe Orton, the verbal high-wire exercises are very nearly the substance of this piece. Indeed, a side revelation of Ms Thomas's play is how much Fry's manners and Orton's have in common. Julia Ford's Alison, frail and plucky, speaks like a younger sister to the Fry lady who was not for burning; yet when Prunella Scales' Iris arrives with the comic relief (absurd stiletto heels in the bush), we slip into Orton territory without any gear-change in the diction. Everybody is wryly, articulately self-aware. That has its drawbacks. For one thing Iris, who irresistibly dominates the play, has to invite regular laughs at her sub-middle-class gentility, but is so sharp and knowing that we cannot credit her fussy pretensions (though Miss Scales straddles her split character with delicious aplomb, and Christopher Ettridge's Uncle Dermot makes an amiable foil). For another, the trajectory of the story prescribes a hard, gory end, and the hyperconscious language is not up to sustaining that. The operatic final turns reveal secrets disappointingly less lurid than the original situation, and they cut no believable dramatic ice. Jules Wright has directed the whole affair with close sympathy, and if the play has precious little to do with real-life Africa, Fotini Dimou has still devised a fine, weather-beaten bush-cottage to set it in. Next time Ms Thomas must find herself a less exacerbated, inflammatory story, one where her artful language can stand up to carrying the dramatic crises.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Zhebin, Far East Institute of the </F> Academy of Sciences: "North and South Korea Should Resolve Their  Problems Themselves: Compromise Between the Ruling Elites Is  Necessary"]    [Text] Seoul-Moscow--Paradoxical though it may sound,  Pyongyang was actually compelled to use the nuclear card in its  struggle to survive. Forced into a corner, the DPRK realized in  time that the opportunities of the 20th century were giving it a  chance to alter the playing conditions and offer its enemy the  following choice: either exist together or perish together.    International inspection teams from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) were called upon to clarify the nature of  North Korea's nuclear program. However, the experience of such  inspections in Iraq and the Republic of South Africa show that  the methods used by the IAEA are not always effective. The  increased attention devoted by the international community to  nuclear facilities in Yongbyon seems excessive if only for the  reason that these facilities are located on the Earth's surface.  The maniacal secrecy used by the North Koreans to surround far  less important defense programs enables us to assume that the  nuclear program, if one exists, is being carried out in a deep  underground location, inaccessible to satellite observation.    It cannot be ruled out that several nuclear devices, even of  unpurified uranium, the manufacture of which does not require  application of refined technologies, are already being stored  somewhere in the womb of one or several of the numerous  mountains covering northern Korea.    The facilities at Yongbyon constitute probably the second,  or  even third phase of North Korea's nuclear program. At present,  this program probably envisages, first of all, the accumulation  of stores of plutonium to build not bombs, but rather more  compact nuclear warheads for missiles. Secondly, it is designed  to compel the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea to  be more tractable.    It appears the North does not have suicidal plans to use  such  a weapon--if one has already been built--to attack the South. At  the same time, we can be equally assured that the Kim clan will  resort to every means available to avoid a repetition of the  fate that befell the Ceausescu and Honecker families. The North  has sent a clear signal to the South, and to the West at the  same time: Leave us alone--we will not permit you to act this  way with our leaders.    It is apparent that in order to peacefully resolve the  problem, historical compromise must be achieved between the  ruling elites of the two portions of the country. If this takes  place, inspections between the Koreas might prove effective.    A second objective of Pyongyang's use of the nuclear card is  to obtain diplomatic recognition by the United States and other  Western countries and ensure access to new sources of capital  and technologies.    Pyongyang understands that in order to legitimize the Korean  model of socialism, it must be made economically viable, or at  least appear economically viable. These new sources can be found  only in the West. But it is clear that the West will not embark  upon the development of trade and economic relations with the  DPRK without U.S. permission.    For North Korea, diplomatic relations with the United States  will be valuable only to the extent that they contribute towards  the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea.    The U.S. military presence is seen in Pyongyang as the major  obstacle to realization of its plans to reunite the country. The  first phase of this concept envisages the organization of an  "insurrection" by South Koreans against the "puppet clique"; the  second phase consists of the rendering of "assistance" to the  rebels by the North, "at their request" of course.    Meanwhile, there is growing discontent in Seoul with the  fact  that the Republic of Korea finds itself pushed aside from the  solution to a problem of such vital importance to it as the  nuclear issue. Seoul is also clearly irritated by the artificial  excitation of tension surrounding the nuclear problem. The  United States is particularly guilty of this and has been forced  to publicly explain to the American people, including from the  highest level, that the threat of attack by North Korea against  the South, or of the emergence of military conflict for other  reasons, is not very likely at present.    There are those who lean towards transferring the nuclear  problem to the United Nations Security Council for its  examination and subjecting North Korea to sanctions. Statements  also resound regarding the possibility of a military strike. The  logical conclusion of any sanctions could be a second Korean  War. Taking into consideration the revolution in armaments  following the Korean War of the 1950's, the consequences of new  military actions on the peninsula would be catastrophic for  Korea, and perhaps for its neighbors as well.    Will China, Russia, and even Japan permit the construction  of  another Chernobyl in direct proximity to their borders?    It is not very likely that the People's Republic of China  would agree to the formation of a united Korea under the  dominant political and economic influence of its traditional  enemies--the United States and Japan. Especially now--with a  socialist regime being maintained in the PRC and the Communist  Party in power. But that is exactly what will happen if the DPRK  swiftly collapses.    For China, handing the DPRK over to the "imperialists" would  mean the undermining of its confidence and prestige in Asia,  which Chinese political figures have fought for centuries to  achieve. It would be far more advantageous to Beijing if the  little North Korean bear cub continued to rather insolently pull  on the whiskers of the huge tiger across the ocean, as if to  convince the entire world, first of all, that the famous Chinese  proverb about the paper tiger is correct and, secondly, that  even a small Asian country--if it is an ally of China, of  course, or under China's patronage--may feel a sense of relative  security even in the face of threats from such a superpower as  the United States.    This is especially true in view of the fact that now, thanks  to United States interest in getting assistance from the PRC to  resolve the nuclear problem, Beijing has managed to force  Washington to tone down its rhetoric on an issue most sensitive  to China--the human rights question.    In the light of China's position, the idea of convening an  international conference on the nuclear problem raises certain  questions. Does it make any sense for China to publicly unite  with Russia and the United States in exerting pressure on its  ally? Beijing has always preferred to act alone and behind the  scenes. Will the DPRK, like any other country, agree to  participate in a forum which threatens to turn into a trial of  one of the participants by the others? In addition, North Korea  is categorically opposed to the presence here of its former  mother-state, Japan. Finally, no matter how deplorable it may  be, not the United States nor Japan, not even China, has any  burning desire to help Russia get more of a say in the matter of  a Korean settlement or with respect to the Asia-Pacific region  overall.    In this regard, it seems absolutely necessary for Russia to  operationally distance itself from the politics of other states  on the nuclear problem and to develop its own approach with  respect to both this issue and the Korean problem overall, an  approach which would take into account to the greatest extent  Russia's national interests in this region.</p>

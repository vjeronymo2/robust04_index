			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Why quartz came in the nick of time - Quality Watches TEN YEARS ago, few would have believed that the onslaught of the quartz watch would be the salvation of the mechanical movement. By that I mean the mechanical watch at the highest level: technically brilliant and loaded with complicated indications on the dial. Those who appreciate - and can afford - the finest watches are alienated by the mass-produced nature of quartz and prefer the hand-finished product of the traditional mechanical movement. Push that to the limits of the watchmaker's technical ability, with as many as 700 parts in a watch, and you have a refined market of low-number production pieces of irresistible appeal to the collector. Such complicated pieces take a long time to make: Time Products, distributors of Audemars Piguet, are still awaiting delivery of some orders they took at the Basle Fair in April 1992. However, the UK is comparatively well served: of the five examples of Audemars' Pounds 240,800 Triple Complication watch made last year, two were consigned to London - not bad in a world market deemed dominated by the Japanese, Italians and Americans. The annual Basle watch and jewellery fair in April is the industry's showcase, at which Audemars this year seem to have received the most acclaim from retailers for what is described as a stunning new collection of diamond and coloured stone-set ladies watches. Blancpain has just launched an adaptable ladies' watch with interchangeable stone-set or plain bezels and coloured straps to match. Rene Boivin, the Paris-based firm, too, has turned its attention to ladies' watches. The Chrysallis case has sliding sections which either reveal or conceal stone settings, providing a dual purpose watch for evening or day wear. Another watch house of Parisian origin but using the best of modern Swiss watch technology is Breguet, originally founded by a watchmaker of genius over 200 years ago. Until recently linked to the troubled Parisian jewellery house of Chaumet, its new owner since 1987, the Arab-financed Investcorp, has separated the two companies and is preparing a floatation of Breguet on the Paris stock market. Unlike a quartz watch, a mechanical movement and escapement will keep a slightly different 'rate' depending on what position it is held in, for example face-up or face-down. To compensate for this Breguet invented in the 1790s the tourbillon, or revolving escapement carriage, a device eminently suited to wristwatches, which are waved about far more than a pocket watch. In spite of being devilishly difficult to fit within a wristwatch case, a tourbillon is becoming the sine qua non for the retail collectors' market. Vacheron &amp; Constantin is planning a matching pair, in emeralds and rubies, of tourbillon pocket watches using the last of the movements it has of its 1954 production. For next year Jaeger-LeCoultre plans a limited edition of 'Reverso' tourbillon watches in pink gold, of which 15 are promised for the UK. Garrard's 150th anniversary as Crown Jewellers is being marked by a limited edition of 150 Patek Philippe watches in pink gold with crystal back revealing the self-winding movement, to sell at Pounds 7,950. While Patek intends this to be the last watch to be made by them for a particular retailer, it has been looking at its own range and has identified a gap between its Pounds 7,000 automatic calendar watch and the top of the range perpetual calendar wristwatch at around Pounds 28,000. The company is now planning an intermediate model. It is typical of the Swiss watch industry that while some companies, such as Blancpain, have been bought by large concerns (in this instance SMH, the makers of Omega) no company has actually gone under. The clue to this survival rate is based on buoyant sales for top-quality watches. So popular, for example, are Rolex's macho productions, in particular the Submariner and Daytona models, that demand constantly exceeds supply.</p>

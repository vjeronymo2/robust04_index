			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Since most institutional investors will never have had anything repossessed in their lives, the notion of Hell's Angels beating down front doors to grab family televisions doubtless occasions some alarm. That is the lurid vision raised by reports that Thorn EMI's US subsidiary, Rent-A-Center, has been using strong-arm tactics to reclaim goods and charging excessive interest rates. Yet it is the knock to Thorn's strategy that will keep fund managers awake at night. The company has made much of its determined focus on rental and music in recent times. Recently, however, the warning that the defence business would make no profits postponed the day when shareholders reap the rewards of patience. Now one of its core businesses has taken a knock. Always supposing that the aggressive reclamation tactics are not widespread, the fuss will probably die down reasonably quickly. It is particularly unfortunate for Thorn, however, that the row should surface when margins in the US rent-to-buy business are under scrutiny by Congress. As most individual states have decided that rent-to-buy arrangements are not credit agreements, and thus not subject to interest rate limits, it might be surprising if Washington took action. Even if curbs are enacted, there are plenty of ways Thorn could respond without damaging earnings badly. Rather it is the delay, continued uncertainty, and worry that the strategy is not entirely under control that will hold back the shares. This is all the more so since the short-term earnings outlook is little more than dull.</p>

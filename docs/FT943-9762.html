			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: WMC forecasts ADollars 125m profit Western Mining Corporation, the Australian mining group, yesterday forecast that its after-tax profit on an equity basis and after abnormal items would be about ADollars 125m (USDollars 92.7m) for the year to the end of June. On a consolidated basis, the figure would be ADollars 132m. In 1993-94, WMC - one of the country's largest mining companies - saw group equity profit before abnormal items reach ADollars 165.9m. However, it incurred a ADollars 113.3m abnormal charge, reflecting a mixture of additional amortisation for assets, a writedown in the value of some assets and some heavy legal costs. WMC made the forecast in a prospectus, lodged with the Australian Securities Commission yesterday, for its ADollars 720m rights issue. The company announced the cash-call last month in the context of a plan to buy into the international bauxite and alumina-related interests of Alcoa, the US group. The deal is complex, but essentially WMC would reduce its stake in Alcoa of Australia to 39.25 per cent from 48.25 per cent, by passing a 9 per cent interest to Alcoa of the US. (Alcoa, the US parent, currently owns 51 per cent.) WMC then proposes to pay an additional cash sum to Alcoa of the US, for a similar 40 per cent in the remaining assets (with the US company holding the remaining 60 per cent). Originally, the cash amount was put at USDollars 360m; yesterday, WMC said that it was more likely to be USDollars 348.5m and could be as low as USDollars 296m, depending upon which - if any - of Alcoa's Brazilian assets were included in the package. WMC added that the Alcoa deal should have 'minimal impact on WMC's equity profit after tax in 1994-5', although it reconfirmed that earnings per share for that year would be diluted. In years ahead, the transaction should 'enhance growth prospects'.</p>

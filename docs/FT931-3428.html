			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Argos closes its first diversification ARGOS, the catalogue showroom retailer, is closing its four Chesterman furniture stores less than a year after they opened, due to disappointing sales. Chesterman was Argos's first diversification away from its traditional catalogue business since its demerger from BAT Industries in 1990, writes Neil Buckley. The retailer said the economic climate had changed since the stores were conceived, and Chesterman's sales of only Pounds 3m in the trading year to January 2 were 'significantly below expectations'. Start-up costs and operating losses for last year were Pounds 6.2m, while the stores had incurred an operating loss in the trading year to date of Pounds 1.5m. The closure costs, estimated at Pounds 12.7m, will be taken as a charge in the full-year results.</p>

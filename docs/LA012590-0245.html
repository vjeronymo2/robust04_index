			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOHN WATERS' 'HAIRSPRAY' TO BE RESTYLED AS MUSICAL  </P> <P> John Waters on Broadway?  </P> <P> Waters' last project, "Hairspray," may yet squirt into another life form,  having already logged time as a hit feature film, videocassette and record  album.  </P> <P> The film has been optioned as a Broadway musical.  </P> <P> For an undisclosed sum, Hollywood producer Scott Rudin has obtained the rights  to develop the film into a stage show, according to Robert Shaye, the president  of New Line Cinema, which released the film. Plans are under way to put  together a writing team. No opening date has been projected.  </P> <P> "I think it's great," Waters said from the Los Angeles sound stage where he is  supervising the mix on his new film "Cry-Baby," readying it for April release.  "This has been in the works for a long time, and I think it has all the  elements for a great musical. What we need is a 15-year-old Ethel Merman to  play the lead."  </P> <P> Waters also said he thinks a woman should play the part originated on screen by  the late Divine, the immense cross-dressing actor whose presence was a hallmark  in the director's films over the years.  </P> <P> "There's only one Divine," Waters said.  </P> <P> Released in February, 1988, "Hairspray" earned $7 million at the box office and  won wide-spread critical acclaim.  </P> <P> The movie, set in the Baltimore of 1962, followed as a plump teen-ager --  played by Ricki Lake -- tried to find a place on a TV dance show. From there it  segued into a meditation on the sometimes sharp differences between attractive  people and unattractive people and used that as a platform to explore racial  prejudice.  </P></p>

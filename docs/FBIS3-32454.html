			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 2 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The opposition minority in  the Peruvian Congress criticized the ruling majority today for  attempting to impose a dictatorship in Congress and hindering  the legislature's supervision.    Six of the nongovernment parties and political groups  represented in Congress characterized the approval of new  commission staffs for the 1994 legislative period as arbitrary  and antidemocratic.    The ruling Change 90/New Majority Movement Coalition on 1  February modified most of the 16 commissions, 13 of which will  be chaired by the ruling coalition, two by groups allied with  the government, and one by the opposition.    The removal of Roger Caceres, former Human Rights Commission  chairman, and his replacement by progovernment Congressman  Carlos Blanco prompted angry protests and a walk-out by  opposition deputies.    According to critics, the ruling majority "will have in its  hands another mechanism with which to continue covering up"  violations of human rights in which "the state apparatus is  presumably involved."    They mentioned as an example the disappearance of nine  students and one professor from "La Cantuta" Teachers School in  southeastern Lima following a military incursion on 18 July 1992  by perpetrators who have not yet been punished.    "The year has opened with evidence that the ruling coalition  will impose a dictatorship in Congress and will not listen to  the opposition's proposals or their demands for participation in  legislative and supervisory efforts," an opposition statement  read.    The Moralizing Independent Front (Fim), Peasants and Workers  National Front (FNTC), Democratic Left Movement (MDI),  Independent Agrarian Movement (MIA), Democratic Coordinating  Group (Code) and Popular Christian Party (PPC) have said the  ruling coalition is trying to control the supervisory  commissions.    Coalition Deputy Victor Joy Way, who has coordinated the  preparation of the commission staffs, maintains the productivity  and punctuality of its members were considered.    The MDI's Julio Castro Gomez said congressional regulations  do not establish that every year the commission staffs must be  modified, adding that every change requires two thirds of all  the votes for approval.    The formation of the new commissions was only approved by 39  of 80 members of the so-called Democratic Constituent Congress  (CCD).    CCD President Jaime Yoshiyama said the staff of the ordinary  commissions can be modified with the agreement of all the  members of the working groups.    Yoshiyama expressed regret over the withdrawal of the  opposition congressmen, and he announced the ruling majority is  seriously working on the preparation of its own draft bills.    Joy Way, the CCD's second vice president, established a  72-hour deadline for the opposition to present, by consensus,  any changes of its representatives in the congressional  commissions.    The ruling coalition controls the following commissions:  constitution, supervision, production, justice, environment,  human rights, decentralization and local governments, foreign  relations, defense, health, budget, energy and economy.    Carlos Torres, who will continue at the head of the  Constitution Commission, announced the work groups will be  installed during the week, thereby dismissing the possibility of  the modifications the opposition is demanding.    Torres said the Change 90/New Majority Movement Coalition  has  every right to renew the chairman of the Human Rights  Commission, and he acknowledged the work of Caceres, a member of  the FNTC.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A former professional football player who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of  spousal abuse in the 1988 kidnaping of his then-wife was fined Tuesday and  placed on probation.  </P> <P> Irvin Jerome Phillips, 30, of San Diego claims he kidnaped his wife in order to  deprogram her from the influences of a religious cult.  </P> <P> He was ordered to pay the county for the cost of his defense lawyer, a public  defender, and was fined $500.  </P> <P> Phillips, who once played for the San Diego Chargers and two other teams,  originally was charged with kidnaping his wife, Helen Phillips, 28, on June 2,  1988, from a Rancho Penasquitos supermarket parking lot.  </P> <P> In a news conference five days later, the couple appeared and she said she had  been "rescued" from the influences of a religious cult through the help of  deprogrammer Ted Patrick.  </P> <P> At the same televised news conference, Helen Phillips' father burst in and hit  his son-in-law in the jaw.  </P> <P> The couple have since divorced.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Helen Phillips told Superior Court Judge William Mudd that she did  not want her ex-husband to go to jail.  </P> <P> "He has made a big mistake, but he has learned from it," she said, adding that  her ex-husband is still supporting their three young boys, who "need their  father right now."  </P> <P> Mudd gave Phillips credit for nine days in jail already served in 1988, and  placed him on three years' probation. The prosecutor made no recommendation in  court.  </P> <P> Phillips' attorney, Bill Youmans, told the court the offense was committed "for  love of his wife and family . . . from what he perceived was a danger."  </P> <P> Phillips now works in the insurance business, Youmans said.  </P></p>

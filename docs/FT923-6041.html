			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Durable goods orders fall NEW orders for manufactured durable goods, a key indicator of the US economy's health, fell 3.4 per cent last month, the US Commerce Department reported yesterday, Nancy Dunne writes in Washington. The fall, the biggest since December, was mainly due to a big drop in demand for transport equipment, especially aircraft, after a revised rise of 2.8 per cent for June, previously estimated at 2.7 per cent. The one strength in the new figures was a 2.7 per cent increase in electronic and electrical equipment orders, with a 3.9 per cent rise in shipments. The 10 domestic US automakers reported that, despite a 31 per cent surge in truck sales, car sales had dipped 0.2 per cent for the month.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Veterans replace rookies to polish up industry's image: Sales agents are being put through gruelling training courses It is 5pm on a sunny spring day, the classroom is stuffy and Mr Keith Burden is getting tired. 'When's the next train out of here?' he groaned. Mr Burden is in a group of 10 salespeople working for Allied Dunbar, one of Britain's biggest insurers, who yesterday finished a gruelling introductory training course. Although new to Allied Dunbar, all have several years' experience with other insurance companies. They are keen to deny suggestions that insurance and pensions agents are out to trick people into buying inappropriate products. The industry has been under the spotlight in the past few months, partly as a result of a series of fines handed out to big companies by Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life industry. Largely as a result of tighter Lautro regulations, the number licensed by this body to sell life products has been roughly halved since 1990 to about 100,000, with roughly 2,500 a month still leaving the sector. 'In any profession, you get dodgy people,' said Mr Burden, who has been in the industry 14 years and whose previous employers were Abbey Life and United Friendly. 'But if your dentist gives you poor treatment, you don't stop going to the dentist - you shop around.' Some of those on the Allied Dunbar course, displaying the legendary ability of salespeople to turn negatives into positives, think the controversy about the industry's prac-tices may work in their favour. 'If you are a professional, you can say to customers you are doing the job better than the ones being booted out of the industry,' said Mr David Freeman, who previously worked for Cornhill. The nine men and one woman on the course, held at Allied Dunbar's Pounds 20m training centre in rolling countryside near Swindon, Wiltshire, are among about 6,000 of the company's salespeople and managers likely to spend some time at the centre this year. Like many companies in the industry, Allied Dunbar is trying to recruit more experienced salespeople to reduce possible mis-selling. While last year the novices taken on by Allied Dunbar outnumbered the veterans by nearly 10 to one, this year the company has trained roughly four times as many veterans as newcomers. All recruits get an initial two weeks' training at Swindon, followed by further training of several weeks during their first two years with the company. The two-week course for industry 'vets' at Swindon is especially rigorous, covering 14 different types of Allied Dunbar product including pension and life plans, endowments and health insurance. The veterans have to pass 20 45-minute examinations to gain their full complement of Lautro licences allowing them to sell. Of the 10 on this course, half are agents who will be paid by commission, while the others will work for Allied Dunbar on salaries as branch managers, each in charge of about 15 agents. Mr Martin Tranter, a form er life-products salesman who is the trainer in charge of the course, stresses ethical issues. He nods approvingly when his charges give the correct answer to a trick question about pension transfers and calms the fears of one trainee, Ms Ros Morris, about the degree of form-filling to meet new Lautro requirements on keeping records. The stars of the course are Mr Robert Milton, an extravert Scot who is to become an Allied Dunbar manager in Liverpool, and the professorial Mr Bill Lee, whose last employer was Equitable Life. Mr Lee is quicker than most of his colleagues in answering questions and is good at catchy sales lines. He advises saying products are 'good value' rather than 'cheap'. When Mr Tranter asks for volunteers to demonstrate their favourite sales approach, Mr Marc Turner, a salesman at Allied Dunbar's Manchester office, draws a sketch of two people, both supposed to be in their 60s and with umbrellas. The first, who has a personal pension, is lying on a sunbed sipping a drink; the other, who relies on the state scheme, is trudging in the rain towards a post office. Mr Turner advises completing the drawing and then asking the customer: 'Which umbrella do you want?' Apparently the technique has a fair chance of success. The other trainees smother Mr Turner with compliments and take one further step towards completing their tuition.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 3: New openings for finance - Tracy Corrigan looks at funding UK CORPORATES have traditionally relied heavily for funding on the well-developed UK stock market. When stock market conditions prove unfavourable, as they have recently, or when companies want to borrow long-term funds for capital investment, the options available may prove rather narrow. Unlike some other markets, there is not a developed UK domestic corporate bond market. While there is a small, expensive but accessible market for very long-dated secured funding, unsecured funds must generally be raised in the international capital markets or from banks. Only the largest, top-rated companies can be sure of accessing the international bond markets when they need funds. They do not depend on the health of any single market, since their credits are acceptable in a wide range of currencies, and they can then swap the proceeds into the currency required. Bond financings ran at record levels for the first half of this year. In the past few years, bond markets have mostly flourished, allowing companies, especially in the US, to refinance expensive debt acquired during the 1980s, often through takeover activity. But the collapse of European bond markets following the Danish rejection of Maastricht in the June referendum prompted a change of sentiment among investors. Subsequently, the availability of investment funds for corporate bonds has come under further threat. Heavy losses in the foreign exchange market in September by central banks attempting to prop up their currencies has left a number of European sovereign borrowers with higher funding needs. These sovereign borrowers could squeeze out corporate borrowers, which are normally weaker credits. The expectation of higher volume has already caused yield spreads for sovereign paper to widen, relative to the comparative government bond market. This has also pushed out corporate bond yields. Corporate borrowers are finding new opportunities, however, in the Euro medium-term note (MTN) market, which is expanding rapidly. Outstanding paper in the Euro MTN market rose from Dollars 13bn at the end of 1990 to Dollars 28bn at the end of 1991, according to Webster's Database. By the end of this year, it could reach Dollars 50bn. The flexibility of the MTN market - which works on a principle of matching issuers' and investors' needs - has proved appealing to corporate borrowers. Although they still make up a relatively small part of the market, they are a key target for banks keen to increase the size of the market. The borderline between Eurobonds and Euro MTNs has become increasingly vague, as more borrowers set up Euro MTN programmes under which bonds and notes can be issued. The advantage for the borrower is that such a structure creates substantial cost savings. For weaker credits, the stringent demands for strong ratings in public bond markets have edged some borrowers to the private placement market. While interest from Japanese leasing companies, the mainstay of the market in the 1980s, has dried up due to the problems in the Japanese financial system, interest from US institutions has grown. An increasing number of UK companies have issued debt in the US market under the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission's rule 144a, which allows unlisted securities to be traded by authorised institutions such as insurance companies. These institutional investors are hungry for high-yielding corporate paper, as a result of the demise of the US junk bond market combined with the climate of low US interest rates. After a strong start to the year, allowing companies an opportunity to rebuild their capital base, equity markets have also become more difficult to access, again, especially for weaker credits. For example, GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group, was forced to cancel its Dollars 800m international equity offering, when it became clear that there was insufficient investor demand, due to concerns about the company's future. Some large, successful deals, such as Wellcome's sale of 288m shares, absorbed surplus demand, leaving weaker names to struggle. The syndicated loans market is in a period of long-term decline. The volume of syndicated loans in the first half of the year amounted to Dollars 164bn in the first six months, 32 per cent down on the first half of 1991, according to Euromoney. Banks are under pressure to conserve capital to meet new capital adequacy requirements under the Basle accord, which come into force in January 1993. The nature of the capital requirements, which gives a zero-risk weighting to sovereign debt, has further discouraged corporate lending. A number of recent bad experiences have made banks increasingly wary of lending to companies which could face financial difficulties. Companies themselves are increasingly wary of taking on too much short-term bank debt, having seen the fate of a number of companies which relied too heavily on short-term financing. In addition, more expensive pricing has deterred companies from setting up large facilities which they may not need to use. Many companies are not renewing cheap Multi-Option Facilities (MOFs) set up in the mid-1980s, since pricing has become prohibitive. However, in some cases syndicated transactions are being replaced by bilateral agreements (direct lending by a single bank to a company). This trend has been exaggerated by a growing desire among companies to create stronger banking relationships. The general rule seems to be that plenty of financing is available to those borrowers who do not need it. The lack of a domestic corporate bond market allowing smaller or weaker credits to raise funds from domestic institutions, and of a credible banking market, means that many companies have to rely on expensive and uncertain short-term financing.</p>

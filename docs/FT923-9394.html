			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: Coppelia - Ballet WE LOVE Coppelia for the marvel of Delibes' score; for the sweetness of the pastoral world it evokes; for a cunning mixture of classic solos with dashing folk dance; above all, for a sense of happy rightness - as in the best folk tales - to its story. And, whatever else may change, Coppelia proposes certain rules of dance behaviour that have a joyous certainty. Some ballet companies ignore it - to their own, and their audiences' loss. Some ballerinas look down on it, as not offering sufficient challenge to whatever gifts they may believe they possess. Wise artists, great artists - like the glorious Alexandra Danilova - have known that Swanilda is a marvellous role, as rewarding as it is taxing in style and step. We love Coppelia , too, because of its mysteries. Under its lightness and peasant merriment, something serious is happening. Indeed, two very serious themes are the armature of its action: we see a girl and a boy learning about true love and learning to love each other; and we see real tragedy in the failure of Coppelius' wild alchemical dreams of creating life. English National Ballet is playing Coppelia this week on the South Bank. Ronald Hynd, as producer, has loved the ballet from his schooldays. Like him, I fell under the spell of Pamela May, that most adorable and elegant Swanilda, and of Fonteyn, then of Nerina and Beriosova, and of Annette Page and Maryon Lane, and how many other apprentice ballerinas whose debuts were at one time so delightful a feature of Saturday matinees. Hynd's staging is rooted in our best Coppelia, and therein is its security. Yet I do not think that ENB's cast on Monday night were as convinced as I was of the importance of the task on hand. The national dances lacked brio, and for anyone reared on the score as it sounded when Constant Lambert used to treasure every phrase, and spark every rhythm into life, the orchestral peformance was sober-sided. Renata Calderini was a Swanilda more conscientious than witty, but Jose Manuel Carreno has the charm - and the luscious physical prowess - that are exactly right for Frantz. I liked, too, Philippa Arrona's Coppelius, who may dodder, but whose sincerity as the supposed doll comes to life was as genuinely moving as Delibes' score at this most touching moment in the ballet. * * * There is an exhibition on the South Bank which ballet-lovers should not miss. Leslie Hurry's designs for Robert Helpmann's 1942 Hamlet remain among the greatest decorations ever made for ballet in this country. All the costume designs - thrilling in their imaginative intensity as in their command of detail - are on view in the Olivier foyer of the Royal National Theatre until September 6. The vivid life of the ballet, as of Hurry's astonishing sensibility to its drama, blazes with undiminished force. It is a tremendous display of design mastery - and was Hurry's first commission for the theatre. English National Ballet presents Coppelia all this week at the Royal Festival Hall</p>

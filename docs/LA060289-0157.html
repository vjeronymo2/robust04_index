			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> CLASS COMMERCIALS GET POOR RECEPTION  </P> <P> State schools Supt. Bill Honig issued a negative report card last week to  Channel One, a controversial, satellite-delivered television show that  introduces commercials to the classroom.  </P> <P> "Our students' minds aren't for sale," Honig said in Anaheim as he announced  that public schools would not be allowed to collect state money for time that  students spend watching the program.  </P> <P> In March, Tennessee-based Whittle Communications introduced Channel One's pilot  project in five high schools and one junior high throughout the nation,  including Gahr High School in Cerritos. The five-week program ended last month.  Whittle planned to expand the program to 8,000 schools nationally if it proved  successful.  </P> <P> Honig said, however, that his department has examined the legal and ethical  merits of Channel One and decided that it constitutes "forced commercialization  in school."  </P> <P> He said Channel One does not qualify as an "educational activity" and therefore  is inconsistent "with the purpose for which schools are established."  </P> <P> "On the whole, it's a bad deal for kids, a bad deal for education, and it sets  a terrible precedent," Honig said.  </P> <P> If California public schools choose to take the program, Honig said, they would  be docked state money commensurate with the total number of hours that students  view the show.  </P> <P> Whittle Communications' 12-minute program, viewed daily in the pilot project,  was an international news show with enthusiastic young announcers. It was the  two minutes of commercials -- for products such as Snickers candy bars, Levi's  jeans and Gillette razors -- that concerned educators. MARIA NEWMAN Times staff  writer  </P></p>

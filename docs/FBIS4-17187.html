			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol, 21 Apr -- Talks began in Sevastopol this  afternoon between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers,  Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy. They are meeting to agree  questions connected with the implementation of the agreement on  the Black Sea Fleet, signed in Moscow on 15 April by Boris  Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk. Before the talks started, the two  defense ministers held a private conversation.    During the morning, Pavel Grachev met with Black Sea  sailors.  He said "the Black Sea fleet was, is, and will remain our  national pride and glory and it must be retained for Russia,"  stressing that he will do his utmost to ensure that "Sevastopol  becomes Russia's main base on the Black Sea." Pavel Grachev  thinks the fleet's problems must be resolved in the interests of  Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. "If we manage to agree to leave 85  percent of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia, it can be regarded as  a sensible compromise in the talks," the Russian defense  minister stressed.    Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov also thinks the Black Sea  Fleet ought to be Russian. On the eve of the talks in  Sevastopol, in which he is not taking part, he told journalists  he regarded the siting of the Ukrainian Navy headquarters on the  territory of the peninsula as inadmissible and that he intends  to ensure that the highest authorities in the Crimea give their  consent for any redeployment of military formations.    The Russian side is also represented at the talks in  Sevastopol by presidential envoy Yuriy Dubynin and Navy  Commander in Chief Feliks Gromov.</p>

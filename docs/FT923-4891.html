			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / OECD Economic Report: Greece urged to tighten up on its structural reform GREECE must apply its economic adjustment programme more rigorously if it is to close a widening gap with the rest of the European Community, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warns in its annual report on the Greek economy. Determination has been lacking in crucial areas of structural reform, such as curbing tax evasion, reducing over-staffing in the public sector and promoting competition, especially in the banking sector, the OECD says. 'The Greek government has to speed up the reform process and take firm action especially in its own domain - fiscal consolidation and public sector efficiency - where it has greater powers and responsibilities,' the report says. Greece last year launched a medium-term stabilisation programme aimed at cutting public borrowing to under five percentage points of gross domestic product, and trimming inflation to less than 10 per cent, enabling the drachma to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS. After falling behind target in 1991, largely because of unrealistically high revenue forecasts, the programme is being revamped to meet the Maastricht targets for European monetary union. The OECD predicts a short-term improvement in 1992-93 with inflation down to 14 per cent by the end of the year and Public Sector Borrowing Requirement declining to 11 per cent of GDP in 1993. However, its report was prepared before last month's launch of a revenue package expected to add 2-3 points to the yearly inflation rate. Growth in GDP is projected at 1.7 per cent this year, rising to 2.2 per cent in 1993. It will be driven by a substantial rise in public investment as big infrastructure projects get underway, with support from EC structural funds. The OECD notes that the government has taken 'courageous deregulation measures in many fields,' abolishing price controls on a wide range of products and services. It calls for a more effective competition policy, including reform of 'oligopolistic practices' in banking, where high borrowing costs and inefficient procedures act as a deterrent to growth.</p>

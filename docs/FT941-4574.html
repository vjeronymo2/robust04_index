			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us expansion lifts full-year income by 10% Toys 'R' Us, the US-based toy superstore group, yesterday announced its 15th consecutive year of earnings growth with a 10 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 483m for the year to January 29. Fourth-quarter income also rose by 10 per cent, from Dollars 339.7m to Dollars 374.6m. Most of Toys 'R' Us' profits come in its fourth quarter because this includes the Christmas season. Much of the growth was attributable to the company's continued expansion at home and overseas. During the year, it opened 41 stores in the US and 67 in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the UK. It also opened its first stores in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Portugal. However, the company said it also saw good growth from its existing stores, due to good inventory management and merchandising initiatives. Same store sales in the US rose 6.5 per cent in the quarter and 3.3 per cent in the year. Total sales in the fourth quarter rose by almost 15 per cent to Dollars 3.9bn, while earnings per share rose by 11.4 per cent to Dollars 1.27. For the year, sales were up 11 per cent at Dollars 7.9bn and earnings per share rose by 10.8 per cent to Dollars 1.63. In January Toys 'R' Us announced that its expansion would continue in 1994 with the opening of 45 more stores in the US and 70 stores internationally, including the first in Scandinavia. The current tally is 581 stores in the US and 234 internationally, plus 215 Kids 'R' Us children's clothing stores.</p>

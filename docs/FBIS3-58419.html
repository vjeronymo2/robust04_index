Lambeck: "Kohl: The Bundeswehr Will </F> Retain 370,000 Men"]    [Text] Bonn -- In view of the unstable situation in former  Yugoslavia and the uncertainty surrounding the Russian reform  process, Chancellor Kohl wants to maintain the Bundeswehr at its  current level of 370,000 men.    In an interview with the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG, Kohl  said  that what remained crucial for him was "that our armed forces  remain capable of discharging alliance responsibilities, are  prepared for action, equipped to modern standards, and that we  retain conscription." Freedom and peace could can still not be  obtained free of charge, as the example of Yugoslavia shows.  Setbacks in the reform process in Russia would have  "unforese+eable consequences." Kohl therefore rejected "rash  number games lacking sufficient thought" about the size of the  Bundeswehr.    In the Defense Ministry, Kohl's statements are being viewed  in the context of Finance Minister's Theo Waigel's (Christian  Social Union) announcement next week setting overall minimum  expenditure for individual budgets. It appears that the defense  budget is now taboo in the eyes of the chancellor.    In the Federal Chancellery, it is also being said that Kohl  is still convinced of the need for an effective military.  Nevertheless, that does not mean that Volker Ruehe will receive  more than the budget of 48.6 billion German marks [DM] that has  been allocated for this year.    However, according to information that DIE WELT has obtained  from the Defense Ministry, if the budget of DM48.6 billion is  not increased, the Bundeswehr will be reduced from 370,000 to  350,000 by the end of this year, because of a shortage of money.    A reduction of 20,000 from the level of 370,000 is the limit  for a "structurally neutral range" for the armed forces. What  that means is that a reduction of 20,000 can be absorbed without  having to change Bundeswehr structures or conscription being  jeopardized.</p>

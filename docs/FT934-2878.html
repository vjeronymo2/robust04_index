After a nine-day hearing the tribunal ruled it did not have jurisdiction because the three had been offered their jobs back. Arrowsmith had offered to re-employ the workers at their previous pay, but said it would no longer recognise the union. It had said it could not afford to meet the demand for a Pounds 6.50 a week pay rise and the workers were dismissed after taking industrial action. Mr John Price, GPMU branch officer, said yesterday that the picketing would continue while the situation was reassessed. 'Obviously we are disappointed we have lost the first round,' he said.

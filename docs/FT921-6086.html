			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Newall buys bigger stake in Lionheart THE NEWELL Company of the US, the world's largest paint brush maker, has paid Pounds 5.95m to buy the Hillsdown Group out of Lionheart, the restructured UK home improvement, housewares and DIY company, writes Ian Hamiliton Fazey. Newell, which paid Pounds 2.5m for a 5 per cent stake last November, is now Lionheart's largest shareholder with 13.5 per cent and has taken a seat on the board to advise on strategy. The Knutsford-based Lionheart was formed from the rescue of Spong by Hillsdown, ECI and Scimitar in 1989, when Hillsdown paid Pounds 3.4m for an 8.7 per cent stake. Mr Paul Lever was recruited as chairman from Crown Paints, where he was chief executive. Mr Lever said yesterday losses had been turned round and the company would be returning to the dividend list next month.</p>

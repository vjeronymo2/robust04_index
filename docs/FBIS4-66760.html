			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Nadia Shakkarah: "The Law of Supply and Demand </F> Lopsided in Our Markets"]    [Text] You hardly believe your eyes as you step with your  right foot (not the left one) into the area of 'Alawi Jamilah:  winding markets and plentiful supplies of various products and  foods. Let your eyes wander where they please (it costs nothing)  but don't touch because the high prices will burn you.    Prices rise daily in a wild constant climb. There is no  better proof of that than a simple comparison between the prices  shown here and their level by the time this newspaper reaches  you.  <H5>  Iraqis Dislike Baqla' [beans]? </H5>   As we wandered those markets in search of "Why" and "Who Is  Responsible," we attempted to get to know the wholesalers whose  stores were bursting with goods. We wanted to determine the  reason.    We began on the inside of a large store where 50-kilogram  sacks were stacked at the entrance. On examining their contents,  some of which were scattered on the floor, we found them to be  filled with Baqla'--rotten Baqla'.    The owner said: "They have spoiled after being held in  storage for a long time because they are hard to sell in our  markets. Iraqis do not like to eat Baqla' and I'll be forced to  sell it as animal fodder."    That was news to me! I must have outdated information on the  Iraqi's favorite dish, which is famous among the Arabs and the  rest of the world (Baqla' dishes with bread and butter, etc.).    "Why don't you admit that it is the high price that keeps  the  citizenry from buying?" The storekeeper vehemently objected: "I  sell it for 15 dinars [ID] a kilo, which is a fair price."    I interrupted: "But it is sold at retail for ID25 a kilo and  maybe even more!"    "I did not know that."    "Really?"    "Maybe I knew but that is the retailer's business. I sell to  both wholesalers and retailers and I don't tell what prices to  charge for what they buy from me."    "Is there great disparity between retail markups and yours?"    He responded after a period of silence: "That is why I quit  this business of selling basic foodstuffs such as rice and oils,  because it costs me too much. The price of the dollar is  inconstant, so I am engaged these days in trading red peppers  and cereals. I make a reasonable profit from selling peppers to  plants which make spices and seasonings!"    At that point his partner wondered when the banks would make  dollars available and said that he makes daily trips to  authorized banks in order to buy dollars.    We asked: "What do you want with dollars? You are now  trading  in cereals, which are locally produced, aren't they?"    The answer was: "True, but we need dollars to facilitate our  operations a bit."  <H5>  When the Eggs Hatch </H5>   You cannot see the market floor because of the egg crates  stacked on it. You practically trip on them! Most egg peddlers  are women. Asked the price of a carton of eggs today, they said:  "ID180. Would you like to buy one?"    "Maybe when the eggs hatch, God willing!"  <H5>  Al-Mawsil Merchants and Price-Fixing </H5>   Another fact emphasized by more than one wholesaler is that  Mosul is a center of foreign trade and a depository of goods  imported from Turkey and Jordan and prices are set by Mosul  merchants. Naturally, we must put up with the high prices in  hard currencies that Jordanian and Turkish merchants charge for  their goods, especially food. The lack of alternatives forces  the Iraqi merchant to pay up, and in hard currency!    For example, I was told by a store owner that he travels to  Mosul daily in order to buy starch and other materials. Fifty  kilos of starch goes for ID4,300. That means that he pays ID86  per kilo, but starch is sold here at ID107 for a single kilo,  spoilage and shipping costs notwithstanding! But retailers  charge ID250 dinars per kilo. What is the big secret?    Haj Khalaf Jabbar, a retailer, responds: "Not all retailers  realize exorbitant profits at the expense of the citizenry. It  is that patriotic feeling for the motherland's stifling economic  crisis. It is true that some people seek to exploit these  conditions for illicit gain, but they will inevitably fall in  their own trap and be outcast by society. I realize only a small  profit on what I buy from wholesalers. I have been a merchant  since 1980, and I used to own a sweet shop but blockade  conditions forced me to close the shop and turn to selling food  such as pickles and tomato paste."    "What is the price of tomato paste today?"    "We buy and sell it wholesale, ID930 for a case of Allen's  brand [as published], owned by Abu Jamal, and ID935 for the  product of Bayt Binyah. I also sell lentils supplied by  al-Haddad, a well-known wholesaler with a capital of ID10  million. A 25-kilogram sack of lentils is priced at ID1,850. I  sometimes travel to al-Mawsil to bring pickles, which I sell for  ID87."  <H5>  Wishful Thinking: Lentils for 100 Fils!! </H5>   'Ali al-Haj Hadi al-Haddad owns wholesale and retail stores.  I met him at his large warehouse, which was crammed with sacks  of lentils, peas, chickpeas, Baqla', etc. We learned that he has  links with overseas wholesalers and that he seeks a small profit  in view of the motherland's difficulties. He said: "I wish that  prices would return to their natural original levels and that  lentils, for example, would sell for 100 fils a kilo as they did  in the eighties. I am aware of the hardships that salaried  employees and retirees face in providing their families with  food and clothing when prices are so exorbitant, and I try to  moderate prices to the extent I can. The reason for high prices  is that Jordanian and Turkish traders charge in dollars. Tomato  paste, for instance, is $17.500 [as published] at a time when  the domestic exchange rate of the dollar is high because of its  scarcity and because its holders dictate their own price. Today,  thanks to intervention by the state and by our astute  leadership, we hope for a considerable change in dollar exchange  rates that may help bring prices down. A sack of lentils that  sold last month for ID1,500 now commands ID1,725 because demand  is high in the month of Ramadan. We sell it for ID1,725. I  expect a reduction in lentils' prices next month. We always sell  at ID10 to ID15 below market."    We asked: "But agents, meaning retailers, sell at high  prices  in the marketplace and the profit primarily goes to them. Do you  maintain agents or outlets to sell directly to consumers and  give them the benefit of such reductions in food prices?"    "No, although I do sell to all--merchants as well as  citizens. A retailer is supposed to be governed by his  professional conscience and should not realize exorbitant  profits at citizens' expense. I do sell to citizens also, and in  kilos (i.e., at retail) in order that they may benefit from my  reduced prices."    "What do you think is the cause of these daily price  escalations and fluctuations?"    "Some retailers raise their prices daily depending on dollar  exchange rates that day, even though the affected merchandize  has not moved. They do this in order to gain at the expense of  citizens. It makes no sense for prices to change daily, and that  is why some merchants hoard certain goods and seek to withdraw  them from the marketplace when they see that their prices are  stable on foreign markets. They do this in order to realize  outrageous profits, which is greed personified. A true merchant  is governed primarily by his morals in order to gain a good  reputation among people. He must sell existing inventory based  on the prices he paid without padding those prices, even if they  do go up. Quantities of essential foodstuffs sold to consumers  should be limited in order to ward off hoarding for personal  gain, and the same goes even for essential animal needs, in  order to make them readily available at reasonable prices.  <H5>  A Suggestion To Help Lower Prices </H5>   Merchant Khalil Hasan al-Sa'ydi owns a distribution bureau.  He is the only distributor of dry yeast in Iraq and he  distributes other foodstuffs as well. We asked him about the law  of supply and demand--the economic theory that seems to work  backwards in Iraq. The supply of any one good far exceeds  demand, especially since the purchasing power of citizens keeps  on diminishing. He answered me, emphasizing that the dollar, not  supply and demand, rules the market and controls prices. That is  the reason for escalating prices, despite weak demand. "We hope  that prices come down next month, now that the state has taken  control of sales of dollars and will subject it to certain  controls. I suggest that the Ministry of Trade should supervise  the distribution of goods imported by merchants to ward off  seepage into black markets. I propose that the manifests of  imported goods be submitted to the Ministry of Trade for  approval, then be presented to a bank that would dispense the  purchase amount in dollars. That would likely lower food prices  considerably, prevent the importation of nonessential luxury  goods, and conserve foreign exchange. The way it is dispensed  would serve the interests of citizens and their essential needs.  Oversight would ensure the goods reach consumers rather than  seep to other outlets."    We add our, "We wish!"</p>

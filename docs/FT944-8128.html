			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Capital spending in Germany set to rise West Germany's economic recovery will be given an extra push next year by the first increase in industrial capital spending since 1991, according to the Munich-based Ifo economics institute. Despite complaints yesterday from the BDI industry federation that results and order books were not yet strong enough to support fresh investment, the institute said corporate spending budgets would increase by a real 5 per cent to about DM78bn (Pounds 32bn). The BDI's latest economic report said although there was no doubt recovery was under way, weak consumer demand in the home market meant it lacked dynamism. It remained to be seen if the current export-led upswing would lead on to a dynamic investment cycle 'typical of Germany's most recent economic past'. Reporting on its regular autumn survey of more than 2,000 companies which account for almost half the region's total capital expenditure, Ifo said most impetus would come from a 25 per cent surge among machinery makers and 10 per cent more spending in the automotive industry. New cuts of up to 5 per cent were planned in aerospace, data processing, precision engineering and shipbuilding. Although the expected improvement reflected rising profits and confidence following the aggregate 30 per cent slump from the spending peak reached in the year after unification, the institute pointed out that most of the new investment was designated for restructuring, rationalisation and replacement of old plant. Only 16 per cent would be spent on increasing capacity, compared with 18 per cent last year and 27 per cent in 1991. Restructuring had been the main investment goal in the motor industry since the early 1980s, the institute said, and this would once again account for more than half the sector's budgets next year. However, it also suggested planned spending on expansion could rise in the light of rising orders and capacity utilisation. Ifo data also published yesterday showed manufacturing plant use continuing to rise rapidly during the second quarter of the year. From 82.3 per cent in June the average rate had increased to 83.7 per cent in September, and would have been higher but for a further fall in utilisation of plant used for making non-durable consumer goods. Meanwhile, rising factory-gate prices for products such as aluminium, steel, chemicals and other basic production goods, reported by the federal statistics office yesterday, provided further evidence of rising demand and economic revival. Even so, the producer price index rose only 0.2 per cent in October, and stood just 1 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p>

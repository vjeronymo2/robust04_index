			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Flurry in share price prompts TSB statement TSB Group last night indicated that it had abandoned attempts to sell its merchant banking and fund management subsidiary Hill Samuel after failing to attract the price which senior executives had required. TSB issued a statement saying that Hill Samuel was 'not for sale' after strong activity in its shares was prompted by a report that it intended to keep Hill Samuel, and separate speculation that it might become a takeover target. Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said Hill Samuel was 'an important part of the TSB Group, and we are investing in its future'. He said he had issued a statement to clarify the question of ownership after 'speculation in the press'. The activity came after a report in The Sunday Telegraph which said TSB had decided to hold on to Hill Samuel under its new management after unsuccessful discussions with potential purchasers held by its adviser Morgan Stanley. TSB never said publicly that Hill Samuel was for sale, but Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, indicated last year that it would accept an offer that benefited shareholders. The bank originally wanted to divest Hill Samuel, which made substantial losses from poor commercial lending in the 1980s, because of its strategy of concentrating on retail banking and insurance businesses. However, Hill Samuel is thought to have performed well this year after its poor loans were transferred to a separate 'loan administration unit' holding Pounds 1.6bn of net debt. Its continuing business made a Pounds 53m interim profit. Although TSB is thought to have considered selling the Hill Samuel Investment Management Group separately, executives were wary about allowing a buyer to take the more valuable parts of the business while rejecting others. TSB shares ended the day 7p higher at 257p. The statement was issued after the London market had closed. See Markets</p>

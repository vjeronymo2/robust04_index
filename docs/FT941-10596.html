			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Hosokawa finds a lot to be sorry about: Japan's political realities The chaotic events of the past six days have exposed the precarious tenure of Prime Minister Hosokawa and the strength of the finance ministry. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, scion of a famous Samurai clan, was yesterday reduced to apologising - at least six times during his half-hour press conference - for the abruptness with which he last week announced a Y6,000bn a year tax cut and the introduction of a 7 per cent 'welfare' tax. An exhausted looking Mr Hosokawa bowed yesterday, physically as well as symbolically, to the wishes of the Social Democratic party, the largest member of his seven-party coalition, which had threatened to leave the government over the welfare tax. Mr Hosokawa's decision to freeze the proposed new levy, which was to have replaced the present 3 per cent consumption tax, means the shaky loyalty of the Socialists has been assured - for a while. The income tax cut, meanwhile, is to be authorised for just one year, pending discussions on how to finance it, representing only a small concession from the finance ministry's fiscal conservatives. Mr Hosokawa's original tax plan, prepared by leaders of the centre-right Japan Renewal party and Clean Government party with the fin-ance ministry's advice, was rapidly withdrawn after other coalition members, including Mr Hosokawa's own Japan New party, were furious at not having been consulted. 'I apologise for giving the impression that the tax proposal was hastily put together or that it was done abruptly at a closed-door meeting,' Mr Hosokawa said yesterday. Decision-making in Japan's first coalition government was bound to be prone to 'a lot of trial and error'. He promised to make sure decisions were made 'more smoothly' and to consult coalition members in advance. 'Clearly, Mr Hosokawa is walking a tightrope,' said Mr Peter Tasker chief strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. 'He is swaying in the wind, has wobbled and just about regained his balance. He doesn't look strong.' What is certain is that Mr Hosokawa's high-handed tactics have caused his popularity to waver, down to 52.5 per cent according to yesterday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper, a drop of 12.2 points from its previous survey in December. The tax drama is a sharp reminder that for all the confrontations in Japanese politics since the coalition came to power six months ago, a traditional all-party consensus is still needed for some decisions. The government wrongly thought it could ram through the tax changes in the same way it had opened the rice market and reformed the electoral system, argues one political commentator. However, the rice agreement was inevitable, because of international pressure for a trade agreement, while the public was unconcerned about the fine details of the compromise on political reform. Mr Hosokawa again had to turn to the finance ministry to help prepare the final tax accord; a sign of the vacuum left by the collapse of the LDP's policy-making committees with its election defeat last July. The accord simply 'rubber-stamped the finance ministry's views', scoffed Mr Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general. Mr Hosokawa insisted yesterday that the ministry did not force its opinions on the government, contrary to several analysts' belief that the ministry is pursuing its own independent programme of fiscal conservatism, almost as if it were a political party. Finance minister Mr Hirohisa Fujii said his ministry's basic views were incorporated in the compromise since the possibility of raising the sales tax at a later date had not been excluded. The ministry, supported by Mr Ichiro Ozawa's JRP, has long wanted a rise in consumption tax to increase the proportion of government funding derived from indirect taxation so as to compensate for the fall in income tax revenue from a fast ageing population. Finance ministry officials concede they have been priming the public for economically sensible tax reform - and anecdotal evidence suggests that many ordinary Japanese believe consumption tax should rise. And of course those officials deny they have a hidden agenda.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (10): Transfer to pastoral setting - Profile of Fairey Hydraulics FAIREY HYDRAULICS, a division of the Fairey electronics and engineering group, has exchanged the obscure charms of Heston, near London's Heathrow airport, for a factory in Avon set beside a Georgian house with stone walls, primroses, and sheep and cows grazing in the surrounding fields. For a company making safety-critical controls systems for the aerospace and defence industries, it might seem a pastoral setting, although its site, on the edge of the village of Claverham, is within a few miles of Weston-super-Mare and even closer to the M5 motorway. Fairey Hydraulics completed its move just over a year ago as part of a group relocation from the 10-acre Heston site, where Fairey had been for some 40 years. 'The site was far too big for the situation facing the Fairey companies and we needed to move away,' says Simon Frost, managing director of Fairey Hydraulics. It was decided that the group headquarters would go to Egham in Surrey but the main relocation was of the hydraulics division to Claverham, where its research and development had been situated for 10 years. 'That was a hangover from the days when it was fashionable to have your R&amp;D somewhere in the country away from the rest of the company,' says Mr Frost. 'We did consider other areas but we felt relocating our key engineering personnel who were already at Claverham was unacceptable.' At the same time, it was decided to restructure the division. At Heston, there were about 400 staff; at Claverham today, there are 300. 'We were very fortunate that our strategy to consolidate in the west country and make the company a little smaller was slightly in advance of the reduction in the aerospace and defence industry,' says Mr Frost. In late 1989, a small pilot scheme was set up to test the local manufacturing skills in advance of the final decision. 'We were very satisfied. it really gave us confidence,' says Mr Frost, an engineer who joined Fairey that year from General Electric Company. The decision to go to Claverham and seek planning permission for a new factory was announced to the staff in summer 1990, some 15 months before it took effect. Mr Frost says: 'I did the initial announcement myself and then we set up counselling sessions so that everyone was seen individually within a week or so. 'I think people were very disappointed but we gave them a lot of notice which deadened the pain. We had to trust the workforce to keep supporting us during the relocation period, and they kept up manufacturing output right through the move.' He adds: 'By going public to the workforce, it made the whole thing very open and it did mean there were no rumours, everyone knew what was happening.' Fewer than half the staff were offered the chance to relocate. 'We were setting up a different organisation culturally. It was a reincarnation rather than a removal. We offered jobs to about 150 out of the 400 people at Heston. Any employee had to be capable of adapting to the new systems and practices of our reorganised company here. That was the criteria - was the person sufficiently adaptable and, was his job actually going to be relocated here?' The oldest employee to move is older than 60. Weekend visits to Avon were organised and about 100 families arrived by coach. 'To the average city dweller the thought of moving to the country isn't always as attractive as one might think,' Mr Frost says. Meetings were arranged with teachers from local schools and estate agents. 'A good incentive at the time was that value for money in housing was significantly better here than in west London.' More than half of the workforce did not wish to, or could not, move. 'We ended up relocating about 60 people. In terms of relocation we were very pleased. We were told to expect possibly 10 per cent acceptances, so our worst case was 15-20 employees and we trebled that.' For those who did not move, Fairey offered what it describes as an enhanced redundancy package - above the statutory requirements. The company then set about recruiting 200 people locally. Mr Frost says, 'We really are delighted with the attitudes, the capability and the interest of the new employees we recruited in the area.' At an early stage the consultants PE International were involved in the project management of the new building and advising on personnel matters. Bob Waghorn of PE acted as project manager - it was essential, says Mr Frost, to have someone who did not have a line management responsibility to supervise the move. The Heston site, with its factory in converted hangars, was sold for Pounds 9m. The Claverham site of about nine acres, once a medieval manorial estate, included listed buildings but had been used for some 200 years for industrial purposes, first as a leather tannery and then as a tobacco factory. Fairey consulted with the district council, Woodspring, over the planning application for the new factory of 60,000 sq ft. The boardroom is now in the Georgian house. Fairey was not eligible for any grant aid, but Mr Frost said it received support and encouragement from Woodspring marketing department and from Bristol city council's economic development office. Graham Turner, chief marketing officer of Woodspring, says the council had 'a good honest relationship' with Fairey. 'We've been delighted - it brought 200 new jobs to the district and safeguarded many existing jobs in the defence industry in the area.' For those employees who moved from Heston, Fairey offered a standard relocation package covering legal costs, estate agents' fees, and some help with accommodation while house-hunting. 'You have to be as flexible as you can to deal with each family's circumstances,' Mr Frost says. 'We evaluated using a relocation agency and decided in the end we could do it reasonably well ourselves.' The move coincided with the slump in the housing market which created its own problems. 'We provided many months of support for people travelling to and from west London. One or two are still letting their houses but the majority did manage to sell, although one or two are still commuting. Mr Frost comments: 'I think most of them are happy to have secured employment and many find they are experiencing a better quality of life. But quite a few have relatives back in London which puts a damper on things. Two or three of the 60 have decided to return to London.' The new factory started production in January 1992. 'We took the opportunity to build a factory in tune with the 1990s, a wonderful opportunity not to be missed when relocating. The most significant change was getting paperwork out of the system, using modern data recording techniques and computerised stores.' Fairey had been unionised at Heston, but at Claverham it set up an elected forum. 'There have been no labour relations problems. We have been very satisfied with the support our workforce has given us,' Mr Frost says. Of the relocation, he says, 'I have no reservations whatsoever. It was the right decision. But I wouldn't recommend it as a regular thing for a company. There is a great deal of work if you do it properly and that can make you take the eye off the business ball.' Speaking with hindsight, he says: 'I think we were lucky to hit on the right formula. It was important to have consultants in at the beginning who had seen other companies go through it. We should probably have allowed slightly more time for the final start-up operations. It worked but it was very tough.'</p>

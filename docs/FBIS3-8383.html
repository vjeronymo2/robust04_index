[Reporter] A meeting of the SLD-PSL coalition is over.  According to Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the coalition members  acquainted themselves with the sociopolitical situation in  Poland in the context of the spreading strike action by  Solidarity. The government's readiness for talks with  Solidarity has been reiterated. The SLD presented to Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak a proposal that the deputy prime  minister and finance minister portfolios be given to Dariusz  Rosati.    As Szmajdzinski put it, the prime minister received the  proposal in silence. It was agreed that, before the end of this  week, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will hold a longer  conversation with the candidate for deputy prime ministership.  During this conversation, Pawlak will agree on conditions for  cooperation with the new finance minister.    Journalists asked if the coalition members also discussed  clauses in the Budget Law that oblige the Ministry of National  Defense to purchase equipment only from Polish arms  manufacturers. Answering this question, Jerzy Szmajdzinski  stated that the SLD expects Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk to  indicate all of his reservations concerning the budget of his  ministry during the Senate debate on the budget.    During the evening meeting, the coalition members also  discussed sending the concordat to the Sejm.</p>

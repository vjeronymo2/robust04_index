			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks driven up by program buying Wall Street A wave of futures-related program buying swept US share prices sharply higher yesterday as investors welcomed a firming trend in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 25.89 ahead at 3,931.92, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.72 better at 472.77. The American SE composite improved 2.91 to 480.59 and the Nasdaq composite put on 3.83 at 786.53. New York SE volume, at 332.7m shares, remained heavy. Advances led declines by 1,274 to 844. After ignoring flagging bond prices in the previous session, equity investors were cheered by the Treasury market's surprising resilience ahead of a worrisome afternoon debt auction. Stocks, aided by computer buy programs, pushed ahead and never looked back. The Treasury sale later went off without a hitch. In late activity, the benchmark 30-year government bond was trading  7/16 higher at 97 13/16 . The firmer tone in the inflation-sensitive long bond was somewhat surprising in view of the release of January producer price data tomorrow. Observers predicted a sharp reaction in the financial markets if the index proved to be higher than expected. Cyclical issues - those most closely linked to broad economic trends - once again led equities. General Electric advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 . Goodyear Tire gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 48 1/8 on news of a 30 per cent increase in net earnings in the final three months of 1993. Strong fourth-quarter results lifted Allied Signal for the second day running. The issue climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 79 7/8 . Alcoa's plan to cut production continued to benefit the stock, which moved ahead Dollars 1 to a 52-week high of Dollars 80 3/8 , after Tuesday's Dollars 1 1/4 gain. A range of Big Board stocks also participated in the advance. Procter &amp; Gamble rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 , McDonald's Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/8 and Sears Roebuck Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49. Ford Motor was hit by profit-taking after its quarterly report produced no surprises. The stock sagged Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 1/2 . WMX Technologies fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 25 after the waste collection concern reported disappointing net earnings and Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft moved forward Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 80 after its chairman said the software supplier could double revenues by fiscal 1997. Canada Toronto saw bargain hunting and closed modestly higher after busy trading. The TSE 300 index rose 11 points to 4,463.2 and advances outnumbered declines by 424 to 358. Volume came to 81.3m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by real estate, up 1.3 per cent. The golds group put on 1.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Tracking device finds stolen crane A Pounds 60,000 motorway main-tenance crane stolen in East Sussex has been recovered by police who followed a hidden electronic tracking device fitted to the vehicle. The crane, traced to a yard in Reigate, Surrey, is the first heavy commercial vehicle to be recovered using the Tracker system, Subsequently five other stolen vehicles were discovered at the yard. Some 40 stolen cars fitted with Tracker have been recovered since installations of the system, manufactured by the US electronics company Motorola, began in the UK last year. Police and insurance companies, initially wary of the possible effectiveness of the system, now appear to regard it as the potentially definitive system for curbing car thefts estimated to number more than 1,000 a day. The UK sales subsidiaries of BMW and Saab have signed contracts with Tracker Network, the UK distributor, to fit it to new cars, with several other manufacturers preparing to follow suit. The Automobile Association is retailing the system to private motorists. It charges Pounds 160 for the equipment plus Pounds 60 annual subscription to the system, or a one-off fee of Pounds 350. Some 12,000 units have been fitted and Tracker Network said yesterday installations were running at 2,000 a month and 'rising steeply'.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS, OJAI BACK SALES TAX HIKE  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks and Ojai have joined eight other Ventura County cities in  supporting a ballot measure that would raise a local sales tax half a cent to  pay for road construction.  </P> <P> Both city councils voted unanimously Tuesday night to place the measure, which  would help the county take advantage of new gasoline taxes, before voters in  November.  </P> <P> The measure needs support from a majority of the county's 10 cities to qualify  for the ballot.  </P> <P> The issue now goes to the Board of Supervisors on July 2 for final approval.  </P> <P> According to officials, if voters approve the half-cent sales tax, the county  could receive $130 million for road work over the next 10 years. The county  would already receive $200 million of the $18.5 billion expected to be raised  under Proposition 111, a 9-cent-a-gallon gas tax approved by voters in June.  </P></p>

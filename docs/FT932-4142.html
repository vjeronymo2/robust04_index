			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rembrandt results show little change REMBRANDT Group, the South African tobacco-based conglomerate, produced earnings per share virtually unchanged at 182.1 cents for the year ended March as weak performances from industrial interests offset growth on the tobacco and banking side. The results were broadly in line with market expectations, although disappointing by the standards of Rembrandt - one of the largest and most successful companies in the country. Rembrandt is controlled by the Rupert family, which also controls the Swiss-based tobacco and luxury goods group Richemont. The group is stepping up its dividend by 11 per cent to 36.2 cents a share, against the 32.6 cents paid for 1991-92. Income before tax rose to R1.24bn (Dollars 269m) from R1.17bn. Tobacco, where the group has a market share of about 80 per cent, normally contributes about 40 per cent of bottom line earnings. Analysts believe that on the published figures, attributable income from tobacco probably rose by 14-15 per cent despite an estimated 3 per cent decline in volumes. Offsetting this werepoor figures from Huntcor, the industrial subsidiary with food and forestry interests. Huntcor's attributable profits fell by 65 per cent, mainly on account of a R77m loss at Rainbow Chickens. Metkor and Dorbyl, other industrial investments in the group, also performed poorly. Aside from tobacco, and industrial interests - which account for about 10 per cent - some 18 per cent of group earnings come from Genbeheer, the holding company of Gencor, in which Rembrandt has a 25.2 per cent stake. Earnings at ABSA, the country's largest banking group, which contributes about 7 per cent of Rembrandt's earnings, rose by 12 per cent.</p>

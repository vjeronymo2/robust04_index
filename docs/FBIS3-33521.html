			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dora Kramer] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The Lilian Ramos episode and President  Itamar Franco's remarks supporting Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso's presidential candidacy have provoked a reaction inside  the government, whose members decided to launch an offensive  with two clear objectives that will be implemented at different  times: The immediate goal will be to play all the government  cards in an effort to get the economic plan approved and later,  in the next stage, announce impact measures to show the public  that there is a government and that government members speak a  single language.    One of the measures proposed by some government officials,  but still not digested by the economic team, would be to convene  a meeting of economic interest group representatives to discuss  the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]. The issue will  be discussed with Minister Cardoso early next week, but one of  the ministers supporting the proposal thinks the moment is  excellent "to convene entrepreneurs and workers for a debate and  avoid negative reactions against any unpopular decision" such as  the adjustment of salaries by an average indicator, for instance.  <H5>  Repercussions </H5>   Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Federal  Administration Minister Romildo Canhim, Industry and Commerce  Minister Elcio Alvares, Labor Minister Walter Barelli, and Civil  Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves began articulating the first  lines of an action plan to guarantee governability and maintain  the government's credibility until the election. One of the  ministers confided that the negative repercussions [of the  latest incidents involving the president] were big and  unexpected and the government understood it needed to act  swiftly.    The key rule on 18 February was act to united until the  economic plan is approved. There were quiet meetings and  conversations all day. Canhim met Cardoso. Alvares and Barelli  talked personally more than once, and even Hargreaves, who was  being treated for a back problem, participated through the  telephone. All the ministers agreed that Franco's remarks during  an interview were an attempt to take the Lilian case out of the  headlines, although some of them also admitted that the tactic  used was not a very good one. That was the reason behind the  joint effort to help the finance minister.    The news that spread around Brasilia saying the finance  minister traveled to Juiz de Fora on the night of 17 February to  meet the president was not confirmed, but not a single minister  denied the meeting had actually occurred, either. One of them  only said that the minister had travelled, while another only  admitted knowing about Cardoso's temporary "disappearance,"  although accepting that no plan can be implemented without the  president's previous consent.  <H5>  `Tricked' </H5>   The first step is the immediate entry of all ministers in  the  battle for votes, to convince congressmen that the Lilian case  "is an incident lost on the horizon," and that the launching of  Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy has not really occurred.  The agreed-upon version will be that in both cases the president  was "tricked." At Carnival, by the model, and at the news  conference, by reporters, who did not understand what he really  meant. Besides, in the past couple of days important  congressional leaders, such as Senator Jarbas Passarinho and  Marco Maciel, were contacted with the purpose of creating an  environment favorable to the government, in the sense that there  is no way now to explain to the country a negative position on a  proposal that was approved when it was voted on in general terms.</p>

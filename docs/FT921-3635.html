			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recession in UK and US forces Evered down 39% TAXABLE PROFITS of Evered Bardon, which has grown dramatically to become one of the UK's biggest aggregates groups, fell by 39 per cent from Pounds 43.9m to Pounds 26.9m on turnover up from Pounds 253.1m to Pounds 334m in 1991. The fall was even greater if one allows for the distortion to profits and sales caused by the merger last year between Evered and Bardon. On a pro forma basis, pre-tax profits fell by 44 per cent from Pounds 47.7m while sales dipped by 10 per cent from Pounds 371.4m. The group's main markets - the UK and the US - have been hit badly by sharp falls in construction activity. As a result earnings per share fell from 12.7p to 5.1p. The directors, however, are proposing to pay a maintained final dividend of 3.66p, making an unchanged total of 5.595p. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said that the decision to maintain the dividend reflected the company's confidence in its future as well as the improvement in its balance sheet. Interest charges rose to Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 13.6m). Net debt however has been reduced since the autumn from a peak of Pounds 300m to Pounds 261.4m, equivalent to 71 per cent of shareholders' funds. achieved as a result of UK disposals, which by the end of this month are expected to have raised Pounds 36m. Currently up for sale are the group's Indiana, North Carolina and Arkansas businesses which are expected to fetch about Dollars 70m in the current year. Mr Tom said that the group's aim was to reduce gearing to at least 50 per cent. The group's remaining US businesses - in Maryland and Massachusetts - are facing mixed fortunes in the current year. The Massachusetts market is recovering after the ending of a moratorium on capital spending while a similar moratorium in Maryland is still in place. On a pro forma basis, US profits fell by a fifth last year to Pounds 20.9m. Crushed rock sales in Maryland fell by 36 per cent. Like-for-like UK profits fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 24.7m. This, according to Mr Tom, was despite an increase in market share. COMMENT Evered's acquisition trail has lost the company a lot of friends on the way. The failure of earnings per share to match the growth in market share and a sharp rise in debt have disenchanted investors. More recently, there have been signs that Mr Tom may have recovered a little ground as disposals have cut borrowings and an axe has been taken to US overheads. However, sentiment remains weak, as illustrated by a prospective p/e of more than 18, even on unchanged profits. The jury is still out but the shares are worth a buy at this price on asset value alone.</p>

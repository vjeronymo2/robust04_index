			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Piro Dishnica: "The </F> Introduction of Foreign Capital -- an Important Aspect of  Reviving the Economy"]    [Text] For Albania and its totally centralized economy,  the emergence from the autarkic system was accompanied by very  severe economic upheavals and disruptions. The admission and  recognition of the extremely complicated effects of the crisis  that started in the middle of the 1970's, the efforts to ensure  the survival of an additional 60,000 mouths to feed each year,  and administrative efforts to implement "new economic  mechanisms" further exacerbated economic difficulties and  brought them to the surface. The wages paid under conditions of  very low production levels and the granting of some limited  freedoms to state enterprises increased imports and caused a  significant increase in the budget deficit (15 percent of the  gross domestic product in 1990 and 25 percent in 1991).  Albania's involvement in currency transactions also led to the  creation of a foreign debt of $500 million, adding to the  country's isolation by cutting it off from the world's financial  institutions. After 1991, all means of obtaining foreign credit  were in practice closed. When the democratic government came to  power in April 1992, it immediately undertook a comprehensive  program guided by the policy of moving to a market economy. In  implementing this program, the government used all its  intellectual energies to stabilize all the necessary  macroeconomic indicators with its privatization and its legal  recognition of new allies in economic life: the struggle against  inflation, the control of the budget deficit, and the  establishment of a tax system based on the market economy. To  enforce this program, considerable help was secured from abroad  in many different ways, from the European Community and the  "Stand-By" agreement with the IMF, whose success made possible  in July 1993 the signing of an agreement in support of the  medium-term economic reform program, as well as a World Bank  loan. Besides this help, many other states also gave free help  with food, development plans, and technical assistance. Italy,  Greece, the United States, Germany, Turkey, and the other G-24  countries carried the main burden of this. At first, the  government concentrated on its policy of gradual macroeconomic  stabilization and of establishing control of the main financial  indicators as the sole way of promoting economic growth. Now  that the main part of the program has been implemented, visible  progress is evident in reaching its principal objectives. The  severe fall in production has been halted, mainly reflecting the  significant response of agriculture to price reforms and  privatization. Spiraling inflation has been reversed and the  government's budget deficit has been significantly reduced from  40 percent of the gross domestic product at the start of the  economic stabilization program to less than 10 percent in the  first half of 1993. This is the result of the enforcement of  strict discipline in expenditure, which shows that the process  of reducing the budget deficit is continuing, despite constant  demands for expenditure and to create and sustain a social  welfare network for those most affected by the transition  period. In greater detail, expenditure has been made in several  main directions:    1. The application of a social policy through an  institutional network and a range of economic and social  mechanisms, such as unemployment benefit, widening the basis of  welfare assistance, and increasing pay and pensions in education  and health.    2. Increasing budget expenditure for investments, including  a fund of 4 billion leks for the restructuring and support of  enterprises.    3. Price subsidies for a range of staple goods of household  consumption.    At the same time, monetary policy has been conducted in  accordance with the objectives of the general anti-inflation  program, the balance of payments, and development. The level of  inflation is now considered to be within the limits of the  program. From March this year, it has fluctuated around an  average of 0.5 percent a month, with the exception of July, when  an increase arose from the change in bread and flour prices, and  September when there was a relative rise because of the  administrative increase of some controlled prices. The rate of  money circulation rose from 1.7 in 1992 to 2.1 in 1993. The  reestablishment of control over the principal financial  indicators led to the stabilization of the lek, which, after its  fall in 1992 to 130 leks to the dollar, rose gradually to 85  leks to the dollar in August 1992. Since then, the lek has  declined gradually and is now stabilized at 99 leks to one U.S.  dollar.    The private sector's share of bank credit has grown from 12  percent in December 1992 to 30 percent. Nevertheless, this is a  relatively small proportion because of the institutional  shortcomings of the banks and the private sector credit network.    Significant advances have been made in the enforcement of  pricing policy and the reduction of budget subsidies. Wholesale  and retail prices have in general been freed. Nevertheless,  control is being maintained over 25 items, such as wheat, bread,  and certain non food-items, such as water, electricity, bus  transportation, and schoolbooks. Although the prices for these  latter items have risen several times, they still do not cover  costs. The policy of price rises aims to remove the obstacles  to increasing the production of goods that are currently  imported. A visible result of this policy has been the  reduction of price subsidies from 3.3 percent of the gross  domestic product in 1993 to 2.2 percent in 1992.    In agriculture, the government's attention has concentrated  on privatizating and restructuring the state farms, completing  the reform of the prices of agricultural products, repairing the  rural infrastructure, and privatizating the distribution and  processing enterprises. The World Rank and other donors have  closely collaborated in this reform. The priorities have been  to privatize and restructure the state farms and to increase the  prices of agricultural inputs approximately to the level of the  equivalent imports. I wish to emphasize here that the measures  to transform the Agricultural Development Bank into a new kind  of body entirely subject to the Bank Law are of particular  importance for the role this bank will play in supporting the  restructuring of agriculture.    Many enterprises remain in a difficult situation in an  industry dominated by state enterprises. Many of them are  closed or operating at below full productive capacity, incurring  major losses in almost all sectors. Lack of financial  discipline, failure to adapt to the market economy, and budget  restrictions led to an accumulation of debts between  enterprises. The life expectancy of several large sectors of  Albanian industry is uncertain without deep and painful  restructuring and an influx of foreign investment. For this  reason, the government created the Enterprise Restructuring  Agency, which has direct responsibility for about 30 key  enterprises that present the most serious problems, and of whom  the majority are loss-making. The goal of this agency is to  restructure these enterprises, enabling decisions to be made  concerning their future within one or two years, with the aim of  turning them into effective enterprises, later privatizing them,  liquidating them, or selling their assets.    Within financial constraints, the government's program  supports the infrastructure, on the basis of a general  assessment that the larger part of Albania's public  infrastructure will not suffice to develop a modern economy or  encourage investments in various branches of the economy.  Although the transportation system has been judged to be  adequately extensive, it falls far short of the necessary  quality standards and has deteriorated to a degree that it  hampers economic development. One of the government's  priorities is to repair the main roads and to extend roads in  mountainous areas. One positive indication of the fast  development of the transportation sector is the private sector's  domination of inter- urban and international passenger and  freight traffic.    Albania's telecommunication infrastructure is extremely  limited. As part of a master plan, it is forecast that a  $30-million program financed by the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, ltaly, Switzerland, and Austria  will be carried out, making it possible to restructure this  sector. It is planned to obtain resources to quickly introduce  modern telecommunications systems as a necessary precondition  for attracting investors and tourists.    There have been significant improvements in construction,  both in the towns and the countryside, mainly carried out by  private investors. In order to cover the shortage of housing  and to improve the existing housing stock, the government has  aimed to increase the role of the private sector and to reduce  costs. The law as approved has been implemented, leading to the  fast privatization of the housing stock. In order to encourage  private housing construction, the rents of recently constructed  dwellings have been deregulated. Work has resumed to complete  half-finished apartments, and 1,452 of these apartments have  been completed and handed over. During this period, investments  to the tune of 713 million leks have been made. Private  investors have constructed 8,401 dwellings amd 24,090 business  premises in the countryside, and many others are under way.    The privatization program has aimed to encourage private  initiative in two main directions: the creation of private  enterprise in all sectors of the economy, without restriction,  and the privatization of state property.    In the second field, besides the priority privatization of  the retail sector enterprises, handicrafts, road transportation,  construction, the food industry, and light industry, it was  planned that enterprises and plants in the industrial sector  (mainiy small- scale enterprises and production lines) would  also be privatized by the end of 1993. In the course of this  program, 25,432 privatization deals have now been concluded,  covering 9,000 retail stores, 4,500 service premises, 4,000  deals in transportation, 5,000 in agriculture, and 2,800 in  other sectors. More than 100,000 people are now employed in the  private sector.    The Privatization Law has been revised to accelerate the  process of privatization within the strategic framework. The  authorities directly involved in privatization have been  reorganized, and an incentive fiscal policy has been adopted.  The laws on the bankruptcy of enterprises and on the  restitution and compensation of property are expected to exert a  positive influence in this direction. Despite the objective  difficulties that are emerging, every effort is being made to  implement the compensation policy through compulsory orders and  to create opportunities for those benefiting to take part in the  privatization process.    Suitable legislation for a market economy is being passed  quickly. Parliament has approved a law on retail firms, a law  on the Albanian bank, a bankruptcy law, an accountancy law,  labor legislation, and a very liberal foreign investment law  that facilitates the registration procedure and, most  importantly, consistently refers disputes to international law.  The tax and customs laws have been entirely reformulated in  accordance with the principles of the market economy. The  increase of investments through the introduction of foreign  capital is one of the most important paths toward economic  revival. Despite the problems that have arisen, interest among  foreign firms and investors to come to Albania is visibly  growing. Estimates show that firms with an initial capital of  $50 million, and contracted capital of $100 million, have signed  contracts and begun work. Different firms making a total  investment of $70 million are also expected to begin work on the  basis of contracts that have been concluded.    The government is making increasing efforts to create an  attractive climate for foreign investors. Foreign investors are  not subject to capital controls and are free to transfer their  profits. Tax-free status for four years is also offered to all  investors in the productive sector, with extensions of this  period for firms that reinvest and those who invest in tourism.  Moreover, investors will benefit from liberal customs  concessions for those articles that will be used for investment  purposes. Foreigners may now lease land for 99 years at a very  favorable rate and may also buy this land for certain projects.  The imminent approval of the civil code will permit private  land ownership and the rights stemming from this ownership will  give fresh encouragement for foreign investors to come to  Albania.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / JCB intent on putting the skids under its rivals: The engineering group's hope for its new product IN AN industry which loves gossiping about rivals' product plans, it was an open secret that JC Bamford Excavators (JCB), the largest UK-owned earthmoving equipment maker, was about to enter a new product sector. The company, whose initials are a generic name for backhoe loaders - the big yellow machines with a loader bucket at the front and a small excavator in the rear - this week made its long-awaited entry into the fast-growing European market for skid-steer loaders. The launch of the innovatively-designed JCB Robot is an important step for Staffordshire-based JCB, one of the UK's most successful privately-held engineering groups. It is also a rare piece of good news in an industry which has yet to see any hard evidence of the recession lifting in the UK, and may face worsening conditions on the Continent. JCB said recently it was producing construction equipment at about one third of the rate of four years ago, when the UK market was booming. Skid-steer loaders are compact machines which can be used for anything from light civil engineering work to clearing out chicken coops. Their versatility, with the trend towards use of smaller machines, such as mini-excavators, in jobs where picks and shovels would have been used until recently, makes them relatively recession-proof. According to Mr David Phillips of the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group, sales in Europe have surged from 3,600 units in 1985 to about 10,000 last year and could rise to between 12,000 and 14,000 in five years. JCB is known to have been looking at the skid-steer market for a decade. Launching a new volume product in a relatively fast-growing sector, says Mr Phillips, is a much more realistic way for JCB to build sales than to attempt a 5 per cent increase in backhoe loaders, where it is European leader with a 40 per cent market share. JCB has spent three years and Pounds 4m developing the Robot, which will enter a market dominated by the Melroe Bobcat, produced by Clark Equipment of the US. JCB has set itself characteristically tough targets for the Robot. Mr John Bradley, JCB's marketing director, says the company aims to become the second-biggest supplier in the European skid-steer market in about three years, giving it about 10 per cent of the market. That could involve taking market share from Melroe, which has about 50 per cent of the market, and smaller suppliers such as Gehl of Germany and FAI of Italy. Mr Phillips says the entry of another internationally-known company alongside Melroe may expand the market. Additionally, JCB is pinning its hopes on winning customers by redrawing the conventional skid-steer design. The Robot's single boom allows the operator access through a side door, cutting out the risk of injury when clambering over or under the bucket to reach the driving seat.</p>

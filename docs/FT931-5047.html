			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / German Bonds: Prices soar on back of Bundesbank rate cut especially the German Bundesbank, which over the course of last week teased the markets with contradictory signals, but on Friday delivered a positive surprise. The market was disappointed that last Thursday's council meeting had closed without a cut in either the Lombard or discount rates - and then delighted when on Friday the Bundesbank announced a 24-basis point cut in its next 14-day repurchase agreement to 8.25 per cent, down from 8.49 per cent. The move was taken by the markets as final confirmation that the Bundesbank is embarked on a steady course of substantial cuts in short-term interest rates - and proof that the Bundesbank believes the downturn in the German economy will prove a better brake on inflation than high interest rates. It sent German government bond prices up to their highest level since the end of December 1988. The average daily yield on all government securities dropped by 10 basis points to 6.37 per cent, with the yield on 10-year benchmark bunds down to 6.5 per cent from 6.7 per cent at the beginning of the week and well below the average over the last 10 years. These price rises capped a glorious eight months for the German bund market. Yields on 10-year bunds have dropped from 8.28 per cent in July last year, buoyed by massive purchases by foreign investors. There are no figures yet available for foreigners' purchases in the first two months of the current year but over the whole of 1992 they spent DM135bn buying German government securities, more than twice the DM60bn invested in 1991. All but DM12.5bn of these purchases took place in the second half of the year, reflecting investors' confidence in the strength of the D-Mark amid the currency market turmoil. Foreign investors bought DM64bn of German bunds in the last quarter alone. Apart from the D-Mark's safe-haven status, investors were attracted by the prospect of decisive cuts in interest rates which - after a rather grudging start in mid-September with the half-point cut in the discount rate (to 8.25 per cent) and the quarter point off the Lombard (to 9.5 per cent) - gathered momentum with the rate cuts on February 4, when the Bundesbank trimmed the Lombard by 0.5 per cent and the discount rate to 8 per cent. Comments from Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, to the effect that the cut was not necessarily a prelude to further reductions in the discount and Lombard rates the next time the council meets on March 18, did nothing to stop excited speculation about the future course of interest rates. It is now widely expected that the 'official' Lombard and discount rates will fall by up to two more full basis points during the course of the next year. Mr Kermit Schoenholtz at Salomon Brothers predicts that call money will drop from its current level around the repo rate to 6.5 per cent by the end of this year and below 5 per cent in 1994. The question for investors is whether this scenario has already been reflected in the significant price rises of recent months - whether now is not the right time to sell bunds and buy the higher yielding fixed-income securities of France, the UK, or even Italy, where yields on 10-year benchmark bonds are respectively 81, 113 and 475 basis points higher than the equivalent bund. Mr Klaus Holschuh in Commerzbank's fixed-income research department believes that there is significant downside risk associated with holding 10-year bunds. He says that once foreign investors start to take their profits in any volume - perhaps after the Bundesbank does cut its official rates again - selling pressure could put yields on such long maturities back up to 7.3 to 7.5 per cent. These bunds are likely to be most vulnerable to worries about Germany's poor fundamentals on the inflation and budget deficit front. Mr Holschuh argues that bunds with intermediate maturities make a better investment for those investors not prepared to risk moving put of D-Mark assets at present. Yields on bunds with three, four and five-year maturities are around 6.2 per cent and could gain most as the shape of the still inverted yield curve normalises amid further interest rate easing. The danger of this strategy is that yields on 10-year bunds could after all climb still further, teased upwards by the Bundesbank's gradualist approach to rate cuts and the severity of the German recession.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: A library to listen to THE Christmas holidays are a good time for armchair travel, and what better than Mark Shand's account of his 1000-kilometre journey through India on an elephant, Travels On My Elephant, read with sympathetic enthusiasm by Paul Shelley (Chivers Audio Books CAB 756; 8 cassettes; 8 hours 15 minutes; unabridged). This is not your average elephant: this is Tara, whom the author has rescued from a life with professional beggars; for her new owner, the most satisfying of many adventures with her is the process of becoming her mahout. Ancient cities, some bawdy company, Tara's terrible hangover after a well-meant night-cap of two bottles of rum . . . All is colour and chaos - a lovely listen. From ancient-and-modern in India to a cloudy corner of Europe in an different age is the second of Mary Stewart's Arthurian masterpieces, The Hollow Hills (CAB 749; 12 cassettes; 15 hours 15 minutes; unabridged) is set in fifth-century Cornwall, Wales and Cumbria, where derelict Roman buildings are still commonplace and forests cover much of the land: a persuasive amalgam of history, myth and magic, the narrator is Prince Merlin, who is secretly bringing up the boy Arthur to take over the throne of Britain. In a spectacular ending Arthur takes his great sword from out of the fire and is acknowledged as his father's successor - the High King who will unite all the peoples of Britain. It is beautifully read by Stephen Thorne, who has already recorded the earlier part of Merlin's story, Mary Stewart's The Crystal Cave (CAB 676; 12 cassettes). As far from Arthurian - or indeed, any - idealism as it could be, Flashman (CAB 753; 8 cassettes; 10 hours 10 minutes; unabridged) is George MacDonald Fraser's novel of 1969, which takes up the story of Thomas Hughes's school bully after he has been expelled from Rugby in Tom Brown's Schooldays. Harry Flashman has been a soldier. He has even, unwillingly, seen action in the Afghan wars. Coward, liar, womaniser, self-seeking blackguard as he is, his chief preoccupation has been to survive, and in 1905 at the age of 80, he has written his memoires. The background to this irreverent and bawdy saga is some well-researched military history from the Raj of the mid-19th century, turning a blackish comedy into something special; a superb reading by Timothy West. For really black comedy in a modern setting, Nigel Williams's novel The Wimbledon Poisoner (CAB 750; 8 cassettes; 10 hours 5 minutes; unabridged), read by James Saxon, has a lot going for it. Henry Farr, bored City solicitor commuting from Wimbledon, decides to murder his wife, but that success eludes him. Other unintended successes crowd in on him, and there are some very funny passages until the end, when the tension is of a far less comic kind. Not a set to give to Aunt Edna: the F-word is in constant use. For a less burlesque view of contemporary English family life there is Family Money, Nina Bawden's novel of 1991, in a first-rate reading by Eleanor Bron (Sterling Audio Books SAB 031; 8 cassettes; 8 hours 19 minutes; unabridged). Fanny Pye is a comfortably-off widow living alone near the Regents Canal who is casually beaten up for intervening in a street fight, with consequences that last and last. From Random Rouse Audiobooks, there are two highly enjoyable abridged versions of recent best-sellers. Dick Francis's Driving Force went straight to the top of the lists, and this reading by Nigel Havers (RC 112; 2 cassettes; 3 hours; abridged) is pure pleasure. The hero, a retired National Hunt jockey, runs a fleet of horse-boxes and accidentally discovers that some of them are used to carry odd items in addition to the horses. The other good listen is Michael Caine's autobiography, What's It All About? (RC 111; 2 cassettes; 3 hours; abridged) read in laid-back style by the author. There is a good new abridgement of an old favourite, Conan Doyle's The Valley Of Fear published in 1915 (Listen for Pleasure LFP 7616; 2 cassettes; 2 hours 30 minutes; abridged). A mysterious killing in England, solved by Sherlock Holmes, receives an admirably strong reading from Martin Jarvis. Another ever-popular Sherlock Holmes story that has now been re-issued is The Hound of the Baskervilles (LFP 7607; 2 cassettes; 2 hours; abridged). The clipped style of the late Hugh Burden's reading catches all the tension and fear of this tale of the dreaded Hound. From Schiltron Audio Books come three impressive new single cassettes. Hunting Shadows (SPN 300-1; l hour) is Tom Gallacher's boyhood memories of 'old Dumbarton' in the 1930s, with Henry Hall on the wireless, full cinemas and the great merchant shipping fleet in the Clyde. Robert Trotter gives a delicious reading. A Wilderness Of Monkeys (SPN 825-2; 1 hour 16 minutes) and Every Inch A King (SPN 825-3; 1 hour 16 minutes) complete John Cargill Thompson's gossipy trilogy on the 18th-century theatre in Britain. The former is an account of his long life from the bawdy, brilliant, quarrelsome old Irish actor, Charles Macklin (played by Alec Monteath), the greatest Shylock of his generation, as he lies in his coffin in July 1797. Even David Garrick (played by John Shedden), who detested Macklin, gives an admiring analysis of that Shylock. Both these cassettes are vastly entertaining and full of information, as was the first of the trilogy, Uncorking Old Sherry (SPN 825-1; 1 cassette; 1 hour 25 minutes), performed by Martin Heller and issued two years ago. Raymond Briggs's new fable The Man (Random Century Tellastory TS 431; 1 cassette; 84 minutes) receives outstanding performances from Michael Palin as The Man and 12-year-old William Puttock as The Boy. A few companies are re-issuing their popular recordings in simplified packaging at bargain prices. Spoken Word never comes cheap, but these trim several pounds off earlier prices for the chosen sets. Among such sets offered by Isis Audio Books is Ellis Peters's Cornish mystery from the 1960s, A Nice Derangement Of Epitaphs (TE 463; 6 cassettes; 6 hours 48 minutes; unabridged). This ingenious tale might seem rather slight, were it not for the detailed portrait of a modern family in crisis: it is well for them that one of their new friends is Detective Inspector George Felse. Ian Ross gives an unhurried and intimate reading. Chivers Audio Books also has an excellent range of popular successes in similarly simplified packaging at reduced prices under the label Word For Word Audio Books. One of my own favourites is Maeve Binchy's Dublin 4 (WFW 103; 4 cassettes; 5 hours 15 minutes; unabridged), four penetrating short stories set in Dublin, with an enchanting reading by Kate Binchy. There is also Stephen Thorne reading Ellis Peters's first Brother Cadfael mystery, A Morbid Taste For Bones; Michael Bryant reading Ruth Rendell's Inspector Wexford mystery, An Unkindness Of Ravens - one of her best; and Jonathan Cecil's ineffable reading of PG Wodehouse's Right Ho, Jeeves.

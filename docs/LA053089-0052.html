			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A;  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL RACE: BERNARDI VS. HALL  </P> <P> Councilman Ernani Bernardi and challenger Lyle Hall are in the final stretch of  their runoff race for the northeast San Fernando Valley seat on the Los Angeles  City Council.  </P> <P> Voters will decide next Tuesday whether Bernardi, a 28-year council veteran,  will retain the 7th-District post for another four years.  </P> <P> His opponent, Hall, 49, a city Fire Department captain, placed second to  Bernardi out of a field of eight candidates in the April primary. His campaign  motto has been, "It's time for a change."  </P> <P> Bernardi, 77, has vowed that if reelected, he will retire after his next term.  Most of the candidates he and Hall topped in the primary have endorsed him; so  has a new coalition of Latino leaders. He has characterized Hall as a  "Johnny-come-lately."  </P> <P> The two have attended eight public forums since the primary. In interviews with  The Times, they were asked these questions:  </P> <P> Q What new ideas do you have to combat graffiti?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: We now have six sandblasters in my district, and I was involved  financially in four of them. I also provided the Sylmar Graffiti Busters $1,000  to hire professional help to train them. There's an ordinance of mine that  should be in committee soon that's going to place the responsibility on the  industrial and commercial property owners to notify us immediately when  graffiti appears on their facility. We'll take it off with the organizations  we've got, but those organizations will now be paid.  </P> <P> HALL: Generations of kids are being raised with no regard for the rights of  other people or responsibility for themselves. We've got to teach morality and  ethics in the schools right from the start. We need to educate people that kids  aren't allowed to have spray paint. We have developed with the Sylmar Graffiti  Busters a good program that should be replicated. The council office should be  identifying concerned citizens willing to start that kind of operation. We've  been getting a piecemeal approach: We're getting wet-blasters bought and put in  different areas, but without the program in place it's not successful.  </P> <P> Q How could the city's effort to remove abandoned cars from streets be  improved?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: The quickest way is to eliminate the 72 hours that we're required to  post before towing. If we start acting in a shorter time period, then these  people that park them on the street, and once they're tagged then move them to  the next block, that will stop. The Department of Transportation is improving  substantially, at least in my district, but we've got to get the people in the  city government tuned in with the public, that the public doesn't want to  tolerate this anymore.  </P> <P> HALL: If the city's program was working properly, then I wouldn't find them  when I was walking precincts. We could establish a bounty for each car that is  picked up. It could be used by the Boy Scouts, by the Rotary, the YMCA, the  different groups. If we had a more responsive council office, one call to the  council office would take care of those things. If there was an abandoned-auto  form that was given to any city employee that's going to be out driving around,  that could be a method of identifying more.  </P> <P> Q Drug dealing and gangs continue to be major problems in the northeast San  Fernando Valley. How can they be stemmed?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: Drugs and gangs are interlocked, no question about it. I know  everybody's first logical answer is that you've got to provide jobs, but first  you've got to take the profit out of the drug dealing. That means a more  aggressive effort's going to have to be made with respect to the customers.  We've been successful, in a limited length of time, by making our office budget  available to bring back police officers who are off duty because we won't pay  them overtime. But it's going to require more police officers, more  prosecutors, more courts and more jails.  </P> <P> HALL: Technology has made crack the fast-food drug of the '80s. Each and every  hoodlum out there can augment his or her income by selling this drug. I think  we have to reduce the demand for drugs. DARE is a super program, but DARE  starts in the fifth grade. By the fifth grade, we've lost many of them. It's  important to have athletic events, for teamwork and cooperation, but you've got  to couple that with education, a support system. It also takes more police. If  we took those double-officer cars and made one of them police reserves instead,  we would have a dramatic increase in the availability of police officers.  </P> <P> Q Residents frequently complain about police response time. How would you  improve that?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: You've got a territory up in the northeast Valley that's more than  60 square miles. When they make an arrest, then they're not available. We have  to improve the arrest techniques, requiring them to be involved in less paper  work. The formula for numbers of officers is predicated on the crimes --  they've also got to crank in the distance that officers have to travel. We  ought to also expand our one-man car program. For normal patrolling in the  neighborhood, a one-man car is enough.  </P> <P> HALL: The Foothill Division has made tremendous gains. They've reduced the  average hot call response time from 9 minutes to about 7 1/2. But if somebody's  pounding on your door, if somebody's breaking in, that's a long time to wait.  That can be minimized not only by adding the extra officers, but by bolstering  the reserve program and looking at the  </P> <P> deployment policies. Satellite offices also can be effective.  </P> <P> Q What should be done about the scores of substandard, illegal dwellings such  as garage conversions and add-ons -- throughout the northeast Valley?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: We have an ordinance that will deal with that, that will make money  available to people who are living under these unfortunate conditions, that  will impose heavy fines on the people who are feeding off them. At least we'll  give them enough money to try to find an apartment. We're trying to figure out  means of maybe upgrading the kind of housing that they're living in -- garages  and trailers.  </P> <P> HALL: The concept that was approved needs to be pushed. We need a task force of  building and safety, fire, health department, city attorney. We need to go  street by street through the community and make sure that people are living in  adequate and healthful surroundings. We've not been developing our housing  market. That's another criticism I have of Ernie: He came out with this blanket  ban on large apartment developments. The city of Los Angeles is so diverse you  can't come up with a policy that will be right in all instances.  </P> <P> Q The lack of affordable child care, especially in the northeast Valley, has  reached crisis proportions. What should the city do to help?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: Particularly in the low-income areas, child care is desperately  needed. There are other ways that the city can get involved. Recreation and  Parks is now starting a program that will take these youngsters after school.  If it requires more funds to expand that program, we ought to do it. Now we're  starting to use computer terminals so mothers can stay home with their  youngsters. I've been trying to get the city to embark on that program for  seven years, and now they're finally developing a pilot program.  </P> <P> HALL: There are at least 50,000 kids out there right now who are in need of  child care. The city of Los Angeles is a major employer, and it's disappointing  that until this past year the city didn't provide any kind of child-care  assistance for its people. The city needs to encourage through the business tax  and the licensing procedures a requirement that major employers include some  means of addressing the problem.  </P> <P> Q You both oppose keeping Lopez Canyon Landfill open beyond 1992. But what are  the alternatives? Would you push to close the dump immediately?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: The public ought to know what the alternatives are. There's strong  resentment of dumping rubbish in canyons, but if we don't want to use canyons,  then the additional cost could run in the millions of dollars. The other  alternatives are going to the canyons outside the city and recycling. There's  also the burning process, and we're going to have to utilize that. I sure would  like to close the dump immediately. But realistically, the other members of the  council know that as long as that's kept open, the heat's going to be off their  district. That's why we're facing a tough problem.  </P> <P> HALL: That dump should be shut down immediately. Instead of being the leader,  instead of setting an example for the private dumps, we broke the law. At least  two people were injured because of it, and local people are suffering. I  advocate expanding Sunshine Canyon Landfill. It will expand away from people,  into a new canyon that is geologically separated. It would give us 30 to 50  years of time to deal with our problem in a more substantive way.  </P> <P> Q What is the best route for light rail to take through the Valley? What other  solutions would you propose to Valley traffic congestion?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: What could serve the people who need it the most would be that line  that follows the Southern Pacific, from downtown all the way through Sun  Valley, Pacoima and San Fernando. But if we're going to have fixed rail, then  it ought to be subway. The best way to make public transit more available is to  expand the bus service and to reduce the fare. We have to do a better job of  balancing our growth, not permitting anymore development that goes beyond the  city's transportation system's ability to accommodate it.  </P> <P> HALL: The obvious best route is the east-west route that ties major employment  and commercial centers. It's going to have to be grade-separated -- raised or  lowered. But our whole transit policy is geared on the outdated premise that  everybody goes to a central point to work. We need a meaningful grid system so  public transportation goes somewhere near where you want to go. We need to do  more to encourage van-pooling and ride-sharing. We need to have a planning  policy that tries to match jobs and housing and commerce.  </P> <P> Q Many northeast Valley residents say they get the short end of city services.  Why do they feel that way? What can be done about it?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: When I first moved up there, nothing was being done about all the  graffiti, the cars on the street, the traffic lights that they badly needed and  stop signs. It's kind of a helter-skelter zoning. There's no question that they  were being shortchanged. There have been changes in that. We're getting more  stop signs, we're getting more traffic lights, we're getting streets paved,  we're getting graffiti removed, we're moving cars off the street much more  quickly. We've asked for a new community plan and they'll be starting on that  this summer.  </P> <P> HALL: The haphazard development of Foothill Boulevard, the Lopez Canyon  landfill, the potholes, the lack of tree-trimming, the abandoned cars -- all  point to neglect. We need to have a more responsive elected official and a  better-controlled staff. People say they call in, time and time again, and get  no relief. It's nice to trumpet the Band-Aid explanation that $50,000 was  donated by his office to the Police Department, but what that means is $50,000  in constituent services weren't delivered. That's at least two full-time staff  people who could be taking care of problems before they become problems.  </P> <P> Q What are major differences between you and your opponent?  </P> <P>  BERNARDI: My concern is with the people in the community. I've been  independent, recognized as an independent, and I'm going to maintain that. I'm  accessible. I go to the meetings. I have a record. All he has is promises.  </P> <P> HALL: I care about the district and its people on a much more emotional and  personal level. I'm a lot more aggressive in dealing with problems and their  resolutions. I'm a lot less confrontational, more willing to work with people  toward a solution and put aside my ego.  </P></p>

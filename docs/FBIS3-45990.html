			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "The Doors to Open Wider"] </F>   [Text] China will allow foreign financial institutions to  engage in renminbi business on an experimental basis, China's  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli announced yesterday in a joint  statement following the eighth session of the China-U.S. Joint  Economic Committee.    The committee was reopened yesterday in Beijing for the  first  time since 1987.    Meanwhile, China also plans to allow foreign financial  institutions to open branches in more major cities, according to  the joint statement.    Liu also said China intends to make renminbi an  internationally convertible currency when the time is ripe. As  the first step toward this goal, China has unified its  dual-track foreign exchange system.    In another development, Chen Yuan, Vice-Governor of the  People's Bank of China, told the committee China will allow  another one or two foreign insurance companies to enter the  domestic market.    Currently, the American International Group (AIG) is the  only  foreign insurer doing business in China.    He said it will take time for China to work out a plan to  allow foreign financial organizations to conduct renminbi  business.    However, Chen said this year's financial and fiscal reforms  will help promote the process.    In addition, he said other restrictions on foreign banks  will  also be relaxed with the unification of the tax system, adding  identical treatment for both domestic and overseas banks will  eventually be realized.    However, he said the time is still not ripe to open the  securities market to foreign companies as the market remains  small in scale and management and regulations have not yet been  perfected.    Chen said with the development of China's securities  industry  and the deepening reform of the financial and foreign exchange  systems, China will gradually open its securities market to  foreign companies.    He said regulations governing the management of foreign  financial organizations in China have been approved by the State  Council and are expected to be made public in the near future  after further revision.    Co-chairing the session with Liu, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen highlighted the U.S. interest in supporting  China's efforts to develop and reform its domestic capital  markets, including improving opportunities for the participation  of foreign financial institutions.    He said the United States supports a strong, stable,  prosperous and modern China.    Speaking highly of China's recent decisions to move forward  with market-oriented reforms of its monetary, banking, tax and  foreign exchange systems, Bentsen said the United States will  intensify its technical support for these reforms.    Meanwhile, he said the United States will continue its  staunch support for China's efforts to regain contracting party  status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) on  the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Market Access  signed by the two countries.    He welcomed China's decision to unify its exchange rates and  improve importers' access to foreign exchange as important steps  on the road to Gatt accession and to full convertibility of  renminbi.    The statement said the Chinese finance minister welcomes the  promise of expanded U.S. technical assistance for China's  reforms and appreciates the Unites States continued support for  China's reattainment of Gatt contracting party status.    However, Liu also said he hoped the U.S. would remove  obstacles to trade with China and further relax restrictions on  high technology exports to China.    To advance the bilateral dialogue on particular issues of  immediate interest, both of them agreed to establish initial  working groups in three important areas, including monetary and  banking issues, exchange system reform and investment and  economic co- operation.    The groups should meet at an interval of six months, or as  necessary, and report progress to the annual meeting of the  committee.</p>

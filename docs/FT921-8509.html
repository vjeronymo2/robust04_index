			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Government 'gave up' Pounds 2.3bn of water privatisation proceeds A NATIONAL Audit Office report on the privatisation of the 10 water companies in England and Wales sparked off a political row at the weekend. Labour claimed the report showed that, in its haste to sell off the companies, the government gave up Pounds 2.3bn of potential proceeds. Labour also demanded an explanation of apparent 'collusion' on the drafting of the report between the Department of the Environment and the Audit Office, the independent public-expenditure watchdog. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow environment minister, said the report showed 'water privatisation cost the taxpayer billions of pounds', and that that there was no proper planning or timetable. A Labour government would take the water industry back into public ownership, she added. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, agreed that the water privatisation had been hurried. That was 'because we were so keen to get the rising levels of investment and environmental enhancement that privatisation has produced'. The report showed that in mid 1989 the Department of the Environment was looking for net proceeds of Pounds 5.7bn from the water sale. But when the sale took place in December that year, it yielded net proceeds of only Pounds 3.6bn. The primary reason for this was that the government, having envisaged giving the companies a Pounds 435m cash injection, ultimately made one of Pounds 1.5bn. A decision to increase the sum was made after meetings between Mr Michael Howard, then an environment minister, and the company chairmen at the end of July. Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office, says in his report that the department's original calculations of the possible proceeds were based on 'hypothetical assumptions and were not seen as achievable in practice.' Mrs Taylor said she would be demanding an explanation about suggestions at the weekend that the Environment Department was closely involved in drafting the audit office's report. 'The audit office is a body which claims to be totally independent of government,' she said. 'The apparent collusion between the audit office and the government gives considerable cause for concern, which is further heightened by the release of the report on a Saturday, the first time ever the office has released a report on a weekend.'

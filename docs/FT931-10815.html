			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / US still doubtful on Bosnia peace plan PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he remains reluctant to back the Bosnian peace proposals of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, but asked for more time to formulate a new US policy for the war-torn region. 'The United States at the present time is reluctant to impose an agreement on the parties to which they do not agree, especially when the Bosnian Moslems might be left at a severe disadvantage if the agreement is not undertaken in good faith by the other parties and cannot be enforced externally,' Mr Clinton said in Washington yesterday. The new president and his foreign policy advisers promised to make Bosnia their highest priority when they took office two weeks ago, but they have since found it difficult to formulate a policy that lives up to Mr Clinton's promises to take a tougher line against Serbian aggression in Bosnia. US officials believe the Bosnian Moslem government will never accept the Vance-Owen plan, which would divide Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Critics of the Clinton position say the main reason they will not do so is because the US has led them to hope it will obtain a better deal for them. Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, suggested to Mr Clinton at the White House yesterday that the US could usefully back the 'hard and constructive work' of Mr Vance and Lord Owen while adding substantial improvements in the areas of human rights and war crimes. Also in Washington, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, added his voice to those suggesting to the US that the Vance-Owen plan, while not perfect, was 'the last chance we have of bringing about a solution by peaceful means'. Reuter adds: Fighting between Serbs, Moslems and Croats raged across Bosnia yesterday before 11th-hour peace talks were due to open at the United Nations. AP adds: German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday he favours lifting a UN weapons embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Le Roi malgre lui - Opera Emmanuel Chabrier's last opera ('King in spite of himself') was another opera-comique like his L'Etoile, but musically even richer. A broader dramatic range (since L'Etoile he had composed his 'serious' Saxon epic Gwendoline); splendid tunes, mostly of a quirkily original cut, and tingling orchestration; and a feast of adventurous harmony, which supplied Ravel with takeaways for several years. The reason why it is almost unknown - and Saturday's concert performance by the Chelsea Opera Group was doubly welcome - is not, I think, quite what the COG's commentary suggested: that the plot is hopelessly complicated. Many of Feydeau's farces would seem as baffling if recounted in detail, but like them most of Le Roi should be clear enough when played out in its audience's own language. The trouble is rather that the disguises and surprises are too arbitrary to generate enough comic tension. Furthermore, it needs so much spoken dialogue that the opera becomes unfeasibly long. Though the COG omitted that altogether, the music still filled two and a half hours (plus interval), with scarcely a number that one would sacrifice. Michael Lloyd conducted it with terrific style and energy: should anybody devise a stage-rescue for the piece, they should ring him at once. The COG orchestra played up exuberantly, failing only to make Chabrier's most elaborate tuttis shine as clearly as they might. Having nothing to do but sing, the cast were eager and willing, and two were outstanding. Elizabeth Gale's Minka (Polish mistress to the Comte de Nangis, whose mission is to ensure that the reluctant Henri de Valois accepts the Polish throne) grew ever brighter and more heartfelt. Geoffrey Dolton's wry Venetian Duke delivered his couplets, and everything else, with faultless, up-front panache: he is a gift to the French 19th-century repertoire, and should be exhibited in a lot more of it. Paul Napier-Burrows represented poor Henri mildly and pleasantly, but without much character - though Henri may be a hapless wimp, he is nonetheless the wimp in the middle. As his ex-mistress Alexina, the Venetian's wife, Anne Heath-Welch sang with gusto and a raw edge in her upper register; her machinating Polish uncle, Count Laski, was the sound, imperturbable Brian Bannatyne-Scott. If David Owen's forceful tenor gusto missed something of the Comte's disarming fecklessness, his lusty, hell-for-leather contribution to his final duet with Minka would surely have gladdened the composer's heart. Full of heart and wit as it is, Chabrier's music never forgets the loins either. And now: will somebody please mount a competition for a new Roi libretto? It would need to take careful account of the situations to which Chabrier's music answers so neatly - but those could be accommodated within a tighter story and terser dialogue. It would be essential to keep the period-feel: not the historical Henri's period (late 16th-century), but Chabrier's (Feydeau and Labiche). If done cleverly enough, that could reinstate this sunny masterpiece to the repertoire. COG season supported by Mobil North Sea Ltd. and McKenna &amp; Co.</p>

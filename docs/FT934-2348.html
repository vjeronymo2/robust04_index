			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks on European zinc output cuts 'encouraging' European zinc producers are still on course to implement a scheme to eliminate substantial over-capacity by the permanent closure of one or two smelters next year. The cost of the so-called 'shut-down' scheme would be met by the European industry as a whole. A weekend meeting between senior industry executives in Brussels made good progress, it was suggested yesterday. A draft agreement was discussed in detail and this set out the terms and obligations for each individual company taking part in the shut-down scheme, said Eurometaux, the European non-ferrous metals association. Discussions with the European Union authorities had also been 'encouraging'  -EU approval is needed before the proposals can be implemented. One industry executive said there was 'genuinely constructive discussion' during the weekend talks and the metals market had been wrong to assume that an instant decision would be possible. 'These things take time,' he said. The producers are to meet again in mid-January.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except those listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2), which have been declared to be free of both diseases. Section 94.12(a) of the regulations provides that SVD is considered to exist in all countries of the world except those listed in &sect;94.12(a), which have been declared to be free of SVD. We will consider declaring a country to be free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD if there have been no reported cases of the diseases in that country for at least the previous 1-year period and no vaccinations for rinderpest or FMD have been administered to swine or ruminants in that country for at least the previous 1-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last outbreak of rinderpest in Europe occurred prior to 1921. There have been no outbreaks of FMD in Austria since 1981, and there have been no vaccinations for FMD in Austria since that 1981 outbreak. There have been no outbreaks of SVD since 1979. Based on these considerations, the government of Austria has requested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) declare Austria to be free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reviewed the documentation submitted by the government of Austria in support of its request, and a team of APHIS officials traveled to Austria in October 1993 to conduct an on-site evaluation of the country's animal health program with regard to the rinderpest, FMD, and SVD situation in Austria. The evaluation consisted of a review of Austria's veterinary services, laboratory and diagnostic procedures, vaccination practices, and administration of laws and regulations intended to prevent the introduction of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD into Austria through the importation of animals, meat, or animal products. The APHIS officials conducting the on-site evaluation concluded that Austria is free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD. (Details concerning the on-site evaluation are available, upon written request, from the person listed under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the information discussed above, we are proposing to amend &sect;94.1(a)(2) by adding Austria to the list of countries declared to be free of both rinderpest and FMD. We are also proposing to amend &sect;94.12(a) by adding Austria to the list of countries declared to be free of SVD. These proposed actions would remove the prohibition on the importation, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, and would relieve restrictions on the importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants. However, because Austria has not been declared free of hog cholera, the importation into the United States, from Austria, of pork and pork products would continue to be restricted under &sect;94.9 of the regulations, and the importation of swine from Austria would continue to be prohibited under &sect;94.10. Similarly, for the reasons discussed below, we would make the importation of the meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine from Austria subject to the restrictions contained in &sect;&sect;94.11 and 94.13.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing to amend &sect;94.11(a) by adding Austria to the list of countries that have been declared free of rinderpest and FMD but from which the importation of meat and other animal products is restricted. Similarly, we are proposing to amend &sect;94.13(a) by adding Austria to the list of countries that have been declared free of SVD but from which the importation of pork and pork products is restricted. The countries listed in &sect;&sect;94.11(a) and 94.13(a) are subject to these restrictions because they: (1) Supplement their national meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants or swine from countries that are designated in &sect;94.1(a) as infected with rinderpest or FMD or in &sect;94.12 as infected with SVD; (2) have a common land border with countries designated as infected with rinderpest, FMD, or SVD; or (3) import ruminants or swine from countries designated as infected with rinderpest, FMD, or SVD under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Austria supplements its national meat supply by importing fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants and swine from countries designated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;94.1(a)(1) and 94.12(a) as countries in which rinderpest, FMD, or SVD exists. In addition, Austria has common land borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Those countries are designated in &sect;94.1(a)(1) as countries in which rinderpest or FMD exists and, except for Switzerland, are also designated in &sect;94.12(a) as countries where SVD exists. As a result, even though Austria appears to qualify for designation as a country free of rinderpest, FMD, and SVD, there is the potential for meat or other animal products produced in Austria to be commingled with the fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of animals from a country in which rinderpest, FMD, or SVD exists. This potential for commingling constitutes an undue risk of introducing rinderpest, FMD, or SVD into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we are proposing that meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine, as well as any ship's stores, airplane meals, or baggage containing such meat or other animal products, offered for importation into the United States from Austria be subject to the restrictions specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;94.11 and 94.13 of the regulations and to the applicable requirements contained in the regulations of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service at 9 CFR chapter III. Sections 94.11 and 94.13 generally require that the meat and other animal products of ruminants or swine be: (1) Prepared in an inspected establishment that is eligible to have its products imported into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act; and (2) accompanied by an additional certification from a full-time salaried veterinary official of the national government of the exporting country, stating that the meat or other animal product has not been commingled with or exposed to meat or other animal products originating in, imported from, or transported through a country infected with rinderpest, FMD, or SVD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

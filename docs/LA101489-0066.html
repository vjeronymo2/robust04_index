			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KITTY DUKAKIS ADVISES DOCTORS AGAINST DRUGS  </P> <P> Kitty Dukakis, describing herself as an alcoholic and drug addict, Friday urged  doctors at a World Congress of Psychiatry to avoid prescribing drugs that may  cause addiction.  </P> <P> "I urge you psychiatrists not to give in to our society's urge for a quick fix,  not to rush to identify drugs as the first solution to your patient's problem,"  said Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> Doctors' prescriptions often complicate an alcohol and drug abuse problem,  which addicts carefully hide from their doctors, she told the conference.  </P> <P> Dukakis said her long addiction to amphetamines relapsed to alcoholism after  her husband lost the presidential elections in 1988.  </P></p>

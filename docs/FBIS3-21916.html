She fined the man, Eric Moo Young, 30, nicknamed "Mr. Big,"  of 13 Merrivale Close, Kingston 8, the maximum of $115,000 and  sentenced him to a year's imprisonment but suspended the  sentence for 18 months.    The prosecution's case, as outlined by Mr. Martin Gayle,  Crown Counsel, was that on Sunday, October 31, a raiding party  from the Special Anti-Crime Task Force, led by Detective  Inspector Granville Gause, went to 25 Bronx Avenue, Barbican,  Kingston 8, where they saw Michelle Cassanova, 31, saleswoman,  and found 19 large cartons with 2,068 lbs (938.25 kilos) of  compressed ready-for-export ganja.    Cassanova was charged with possession of the ganja, dealing  in ganja and taking steps preparatory to exporting the weed.  Further investigations by Det. Insp. Gause led, the same day, to  the arrest of Moo Young, who said the ganja was his and he had  given it to Cassanova to store for him. He was charged jointly  with her and they were ordered remanded in custody. Ten days  later, they appeared before the St. Andrew Resident Magistrate's  Court at Half-Way-Tree before Her Hon. Mrs. Lewis and Cassanova  pleaded guilty to possession of the ganja. Mrs. Lewis fined her  $15,000 or six months' imprisonment. The Magistrate said the  ganja business was too prevalent, with the rich and poor alike  being involved.    It was time for a Drug Court to be established, she said, to  deal exclusively with offences of that nature. Also, the  Magistrate said fines for drug offences were too minimal and  anybody could pay them.    Moo Young pleaded guilty to all three charges and was  remanded in custody on December 17, for sentencing on December  22. Mr. Howard Hamilton, Q.C., who with Miss Norma Linton,  attorney-at-law, represented Moo Young, urged the court to show  mercy to him because he had not tried to absolve himself, but  had admitted it was his ganja, had not wasted the court's time,  and had faced harsh reality and pleaded guilty. Miss Linton said  Moo Young had been man enough to own up and pointed out that it  was his first offence. She asked the Magistrate not to  incarcerate him.    The Resident Magistrate imposed on Moo Young, maximum  sentences of a fine of $15,000 or six months for possession of  the ganja, $50,000 or 12 months for dealing in ganja, and  $50,000 or 12 months for taking steps preparatory to exporting  the ganja. In addition, on the charge of taking steps  preparatory to exporting the ganja, she sentenced Moo Young to  12 months' imprisonment but suspended the sentence for 18 months  and ordered that he undergo supervision by a probation officer.</p>

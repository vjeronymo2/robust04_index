			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consideration of legal authority of FDA and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to require specific packaging measures for foods and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its consideration of what action to take concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the packaging of iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure their safe use, FDA recognized that it must act within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits of its statutory authority and consider the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority of other government agencies. As noted above, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PPPA, CPSC has authority to regulate the packaging of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household substances. Under the PPPA, CPSC can establish special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging performance standards. Thus, by regulation, CPSC has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established special packaging standards and performance criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for special packaging, 16 CFR 1700.15 and 1700.20, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the PPPA specifically limits CPSC from establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that require specific packaging designs, product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content, and package quantity for household substances, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food and drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Packaging for iron-containing dietary supplements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> act provides FDA with broad authority to ensure that food is safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wholesome. In particular, the act prohibits the adulteration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of food in sections 301 and 402 (21 U.S.C. 331 and 342) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires, in sections 409(a) (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and 402(a)(2)(C),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all food additives be listed for use by FDA before they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to food.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section 409(a), the act deems a food additive to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsafe unless its use conforms to the conditions specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing regulation. These conditions include, but are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to, specifications as to the particular food or classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of food to which the additive may be added, as to the manner in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the additive may be added to such food, and any directions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed necessary to ensure the safety of such use (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 409(c)(1)(A) of the act. Thus, under the act, the agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized to specify packaging requirements for a food additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when it finds that use of such packaging is necessary to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safe use of the additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section 201(s), the act provides an exemption to the food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive definition for substances that are generally recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as safe (GRAS) under the conditions of their intended use. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has issued regulations delineating conditions under which use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain substances is GRAS. If the conditions of a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of a substance are not those that are generally recognized as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe, the use is not GRAS, but subject to regulation under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food additives provisions of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should FDA determine that a particular type of packaging is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to ensure the safe use of iron substances in dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements, either as GRAS substances or as listed food additives, then any use of iron substances in dietary supplements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that does not involve use of that type of packaging would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a use of an unapproved food additive and render the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dietary supplements adulterated under the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Packaging for iron-containing drug products.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 501(a)(2)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) states that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug shall be deemed to be adulterated if the methods used in, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packing, or holding do not conform to, or are not operated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered in conformity with, current good manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> act as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented to possess.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A drug product may be safe and effective as manufactured but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in an unsafe and ineffective manner. Current good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing practice is, to some extent, an evolving standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To remain ``current,'' a manufacturer must take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advances in technology as well as new information about the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the product including, but not limited to, information about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any dangers associated with use of the drug product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers must use this knowledge to alter, adapt, or change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their manufacturing procedures to ensure that all possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures have been implemented to eliminate known dangers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, advances in technology and new information about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dangers associated with a drug product can mean that further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps by the manufacturer are necessary to guard against such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreseeable dangers, in order to hold the drug product in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner that ensures its safety and, thus, comports with current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good manufacturing practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Reebok to sell Boston Whaler boat offshoot REEBOK International, the US footwear maker, is to sell its Boston Whaler unit to McAndrews &amp; Forbes, a boatbuilder and fishing sports company. McAndrews &amp; Forbes, the second-largest independent boatbuilder in the US, said Boston Whaler would become part of a newly-formed sports division, focusing on fishing, scuba diving and water-skiing. Reebok put Boston Whaler, which makes motor boats, up for sale last December. The unit earned revenues of around Dollars 45m last year, less than 2 per cent of Reebok's total of Dollars 3.02bn, but was not profitable. Mr Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman and chief executive, said the sale was part of a strategy to concentrate on the lucrative but fiercely competitive sports shoe market. 'It's the right time for Reebok to focus our energies on our core brands: Reebok, Rockport and Avia.' he said. Reebok has about 24 per cent of the US sport shoe market. Like Nike, the market leader, it has recently suffered from sluggish growth in the US retail sector. It also put its Ellesse USA footwear unit up for sale last December but has not found a buyer. The Boston Whaler sale will be complete by the end of July and will not affect second-quarter earnings.</p>

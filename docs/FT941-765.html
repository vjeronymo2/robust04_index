			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Swan Hunter deal nears Receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday they were 'very close' to a conditional agreement to sell Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, to French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. But the receivers denied a claim by Wallsend Labour MP Mr Steve Byers that CMN had now tabled a bid for Swan Hunter. The leader of CMN's bid team, Mr Fred Henderson, said he hoped a sale contract would be signed in about a fortnight. 'A formal bid as such has not been made. In the circumstances it probably never will be,' he said. 'We are in detailed negotiation on the contract.' The sale agreement will be conditional on Swan Hunter, which has been in receivership since last May, winning the 18-month refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. For Swans' tender to have a chance of success it must be underwritten by a prospective purchaser. The MoD plans to announce its decision on July 20. This poses a dilemma for Swan Hunter because its handover on May 12 of the frigate HMS Northumberland will leave insufficient work for the remaining 1,038 employees. Yesterday Mr Byers and Newcastle East Labour MP Mr Nick Brown launched a campaign to persuade the MoD to say before May 12 that it was 'minded' to award Bedivere to Swans, subject to satisfactory detailed negotiations. They hope this will avert 490 threatened redundancies. They also stressed Bedivere's importance to Swans' survival. Mr Brown said: 'No Sir Bedivere, no Swan Hunter.' Mr Henderson said an MoD announcement that it was minded to give Swans the order would be helpful, but CMN would need final confirmation before signing a purchase contract 'involving payment of several million pounds'. He declined to say how much CMN planned to pay for Swan Hunter.</p>

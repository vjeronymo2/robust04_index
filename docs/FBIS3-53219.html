			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Zionists Are Digging Their Own Grave!"] </F>   [Text] Israel has made new decisions on confronting the  Islamic forces in Gaza and Jericho and intends to arm 'Arafat's  forces so that they can carry out their mission of crushing the  intifadah and annihilating Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  as best as possible.    Parallel to this decision, the Zionist regime has taken the  unexpected step of calling on European countries to help  'Arafat's faction and the compromising PLO faction in crushing  the intifadah. Irrespective of all the objectives that Israel  expects this new plan to achieve, all facts show that the  situation in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza and  Jericho, are detrimental to both 'Arafat and Israel.    Under such conditions, arming 'Arafat's mercenaries to crush  the intifadah and Hamas is the biggest mistake that the enemy  has made. The Islamic forces will have more golden opportunities  to more easily acquire the arms that they need for their  anti-occupational operations.    The truth is that the Zionists have lost control of the  situation in occupied Palestine, and with their current action  they show how disappointed they are with their past efforts and  are even prepared to arm people who can easily change stances  and act against the Zionists. Even though having arms in the  occupied territories under the current conditions can solve many  of the Palestinians' complicated problems in their confrontation  with the occupying enemy, nevertheless the more major issue that  reveals the vulnerability of Israel and 'Arafat's compromising  faction is that even among his ranks there are many who are  dissatisfied with the situation and do not endorse the  continuous treacheries of 'Arafat and the other compromising  leaders of the PLO. Naturally, these people are waiting for  suitable opportunities to be able to avenge themselves and the  Palestinian people on occupying Israel.    It is precisely because of this that, despite 'Arafat's  treason and the concordance between some of the compromising  heads of the PLO and the Zionists, not a great deal has changed  in Israel's favor and developments in the occupied territories  leave much to be desired for the occupiers.    The Zionists are digging their own graves today and this  golden opportunity for the Palestinians to acquire arms can  herald a more bitter tomorrow for the occupiers.    This disgraceful game between Israel and 'Arafat is so  idiotic that it has been defeated and has disgraced the enemies  of Islam in dear Palestine even in its initial stage. Who  knows? Maybe it is written that the Zionists will be killed by  bullets that are fired from their own guns!</p>

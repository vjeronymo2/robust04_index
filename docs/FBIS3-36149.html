The foreign policy course  associated with the name of Andrey Kozyrev and broadly meeting  with the support of Boris Yeltsin has apparently acquired a  serious opponent in the shape of Viktor Chernomyrdin.    Until now the only foreign policy issue to which the head of  government has devoted attention has been the territorial  dispute with Japan. On Tuesday, to the surprise of many,  Chernomyrdin expressed his views on the situation in the former  Yugoslavia, stating that Russia is categorically against Western  air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. These words were  spoken several hours after a news conference given by Andrey  Kozyrev at which the minister did not rule out air strikes  against the Serbs, Croats, or Muslims, in the event of an attack  by them on the UN peacekeeping forces.    All the signs suggest that Chernomyrdin considered the  stance  of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs insufficiently  firm, and hastened to modify it. The foreign media reacted  immediately to the prime minister's words, devoting lengthy  commentaries to "the disagreements between Kozyrev and  Chernomyrdin."    Smolensk Square [site of RF Foreign Ministry] is not  inclined  to dramatize the situation. "I believe Chernomyrdin is not in  possession of detailed information. In opposing the bombing of  Serb positions he was evidently thinking of the `punitive  strikes' for which some politicians in the West are calling.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated its  negative attitude toward such plans. So there are no  fundamental disagreements between the prime minister and the  minister of foreign affairs," a high-ranking Russian diplomat  believes.    Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin's encroachment into the  diplomatic  sphere is an alarming signal for Andrey Kozyrev. It cannot be  ruled out that the prime minister is already thinking about the  1996 presidential elections, in the runup to which he must  present to voters not only an economic but also a foreign policy  program.    Since Chernomyrdin will most likely look to the conservative  part of the electorate, it is logical to assume that his remarks  will not infrequently differ from the views of the foreign  minister and approach the stances of the national-communist  majority in the Duma.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that China would like to cooperate with leading  international monetary and securities companies to strengthen  the development of industries in the fields of transportation,  energy and telecommunications.    Li made this remark while meeting with Sherman Lewis, Jr.,  vice-chairman of Lehman Brothers company of the United States.    The company is the fifth U.S. monetary and securities  company  whose representatives he has met recently, Li said.    "We appreciate the positive attitude U.S. monetary and  securities companies have taken to cooperate with China," he  said.    The Chinese Government is sparing no effort to improve the  development of China's transport, energy and telecommunications,  fields that have lagged behind the country's economic  development, and to gradually change the irrational industrial  structure, he said.    There are various ways to carry out cooperation with foreign  countries in these fields, such as through issuing stocks and  bonds and through capital loans, Li said.    Li added that China has adopted a careful approach to  issuing  stocks, which is the most difficult means of cooperation.  Listed Chinese companies must conform to international  standards in order to earn a good reputation in the world  monetary market.    He expressed his appreciation to Lehman for helping China's  Huaneng International Power Development Corporation to be listed  in New York.    The Huaneng Company is one of the five firms China's State  Council has approved to be listed in the U.S., and Lehman  Company is the global coordinator and leading manager of  Huaneng's equity offering in New York.    Lewis said that he has paid five visits to China this year  and made extensive contacts in the country while completing  background research for the Huaneng listing.    The Huaneng Company scored well in management, equipment,  technical personnel and efficiency, he said.</p>

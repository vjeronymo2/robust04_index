			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Setback for Cyprus solution United Nations efforts to end the 20-year-old division of Cyprus were dealt a further blow yesterday when Turkey endorsed a motion by the Turkish Cypriots formally abandoning the search for a federal solution. Already smarting at legal moves by the European Union to block the import of Turkish-Cypriot produce, and EU support for the Greek-Cypriot application to join the Union, the parliament of the self-declared Turkish-Cypriot republic passed a motion on Monday to co-ordinate foreign, defence and security policy with Ankara, in effect endorsing the fact of partition and supporting the aspiration of formal integration with Turkey. Turkish officials describe the motion as similar to existing security arrangements between Athens and the Greek Cypriots.</p>

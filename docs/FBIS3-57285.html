			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 419] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, 19 Jan -- A letter by Lithuanian Foreign  Minister Povilas Gylys was handed over to Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas  Januska visiting Greece.    Gylys stated in the letter that Lithuania called to start  the  negotiations on the associative agreement with the European  Union [EU].    It is noted in the letter that the dynamic development of  economic and political situation in Eastern and Central Europe  increases the necessity to create effective forms of integration  into the European Union for the Baltic States.    Lithuania expressed its wish that the future free trade  agreement with EU should comply with the commercial part of the  associative agreement.    Gylys urged the Council of Europe to adopt the decision  which  would allow to transform the free trade agreement between EU and  Lithuania into the associative agreement.    Greece presides in the Council of Europe during the first  half of the year.</p>

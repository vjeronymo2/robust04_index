			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIVER TOLLWAY: IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES  </P> <P> The planned tollway in the Santa Ana River is one of the most unfortunate  proposals to surface in a long time. This toll road would destroy open space in  that part of the county that is most in need of open space, and put in its  place a major smog-producing structure.  </P> <P> Further, it will destroy the character of the Santa Ana River trail. At present  this trail is a quiet place far removed from traffic.  </P> <P> Indeed, it is one of the few places in the county where one can ride a road  bicycle away from the noise and fumes created by automobiles. It is one of the  best bicycle trails in the nation and one of the most heavily used recreational  facilities in the county.  </P> <P> It should be treated like the national treasure that it is and should not be  turned into an unhealthful and almost unridable path bordering a toll road.  </P> <P> J. VINCENT BUCK  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

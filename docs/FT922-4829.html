			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bank will not censure BCCI case broker THE Bank of England has shrugged off concern expressed by a Commons' committee and decided it cannot discipline a firm of brokers who acted for the Western Isles Islands Council which lost Pounds 24m in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International collapse. A letter sent to the clerk of the Treasury committee says the Bank judges evidence on the role of R P Martin, 'still to be conflicting, and insufficient to find the allegations against R P Martin proven'. The Bank's comments follow a report by the committee last December, which said there was prima facie evidence to invalidate the Bank of England's initial conclusion - that there was no evidence of a breach by brokers of the code of practice for the City's wholesale financial markets. The Treasury select committee has not been set up since the general election but the Bank's letter will be made available to MPs. Some MPs may remain uneasy about the role of the brokers acting for local authorities investing in BCCI, Mr Terence Higgins, former chairman of the Treasury committee, yesterday welcomed revisions to the code that the Bank announced last week. The committee called in its report for the Bank to re-open investigations into R P Martin. In response, the Bank held further discussions with individuals at the broker's Edinburgh offices and with staff at the Western Isles Council. It found that the only area not disputed was the absence of taping of conversations in R P Martin's Edinburgh offices - but that did not amount to a breach, the Bank said. However, the new code 'strongly recommends' taping of dealers' conversations and the letter says Bank officials have discussed with R P Martin its policy on taping 'and will be asking for a review of this policy in the light of the revised code'. The committee's concerns over R P Martin centred on a trip to the Western Isles made by a BCCI representative with a representative of the brokers. The MPs said that, 'joint visits, however arranged, may be taken as an endorsement of the borrowing counterparty by the broker. While we completely accept that it is for depositing counterparties to assess creditworthiness, it is still important that brokers take no action which may be misunderstood.' In its letter to the committee, the Bank says such concerns have been reflected in the revised code.</p>

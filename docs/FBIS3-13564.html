Parliament speaker Tahir al-Masri met Defence Minister  Shaykh  Muhammad Bin-Rashid Al Maktum in Dubayy late Monday to convey  greetings from King Husayn and Crown Prince Hasan, the agency  said.    They discussed the Middle East peace process and other Arab  issues, it added without giving further details of the visit or  saying whether al-Masri would meet President Shaykh Zayid  Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan.    It was the first visit to the UAE by a senior Jordanian  official since Amman was ostracised by Gulf Arab states for its  alleged sympathy with the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Jordan  has denied such support and sought to mend fences with the Gulf  but has been rebuffed.    King Husayn tried to meet King Fahd of Saudi Arabia this  month during a pilgrimage to Mecca but was shunned.    However he has visited Oman and will go to Qatar. The two  countries are the only members of the six-nation Gulf  Cooperation Council (GCC) that have not severed ties with Amman.</p>

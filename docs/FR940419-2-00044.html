The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACYF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project requesting $600,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $200,000 (25 percent of the total project cost of $800,000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

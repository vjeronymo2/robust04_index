			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS AND BREAST-FEEDING  </P> <P> An article on a United Nations conference to promote breast-feeding (Aug. 6)  reported that "even mothers who have tested positive for the AIDS virus should  breast-feed."  </P> <P> This is appropriate advice for HIV-infected mothers in developing countries  where infant mortality is high and where breast milk is the only source of  uncontaminated food.  </P> <P> However, it does not represent current policy in countries where serious  illness associated with formula feeding is uncommon. In the U.S. and other  developed countries, any beneficial effects of breast-feeding are offset by the  possibility of transmission of HIV through milk. Two-thirds of babies born to  HIV-infected mothers will not be infected. The Centers for Disease Control has  recommended that HIV-infected women should be advised against breast-feeding.  </P> <P> JOSEPH A.

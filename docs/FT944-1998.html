			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Fears grow after US jets sabotaged Passenger aircraft operated by Tower Air, an international carrier flying daily to Europe and Israel, were sabotaged five times last month, the New-York based airline said yesterday. The development, coming after four fatal crashes involving domestic flights in the past six months, further heightened concern about air safety in the US. Tower Air confirmed a US press report that saboteurs had cut wires in its Boeing 747 jumbo aircraft while they were on the ground at John F Kennedy airport in New York. In all cases, the cuts were detected during pre-flight checks. The sabotage is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Separately American Eagle, the commuter airline division of American Airlines, grounded all flights out of Chicago and many flights out of New York after some pilots claimed they had insufficient training to fly in icy conditions. And Kiwi International, an independent carrier based in Newark, New Jersey, agreed to ground all 11 of its aircraft after the Federal Aviation Administration found fault with its record-keeping system for pilot training. Most US airline stocks, already depressed, edged further downwards yesterday amid fears that safety concerns could lead to a decline in passengers. On Wednesday, hours after an American Eagle commuter flight crashed in North Carolina with the loss of 15 lives, the US Department of Transport attempted to counter air travellers' worries by ordering an immediate safety audit of all the nation's airlines. Yesterday Tower Air said that it had heightened its security and pre-flight checking procedures in the wake of the attacks on its aircraft in November and that there had been no instances of sabotage in the past five weeks. Possible suspects could include disgruntled former employees, or terrorists motivated by Tower's frequent flights to Israel. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been called in. Yesterday's disruption at American Eagle followed last week's grounding of all the airline's Chicago-based ATR turbo-prop aircraft by the FAA because of suspicions that iced-up wings caused the crash of an American Eagle ATR aircraft in October. American Eagle transferred its ATRs to the warmer climate of the southern US and moved a fleet of Saab 340 turboprops to the north. The aircraft were grounded after some Saab pilots complained they had not had sufficient cold-weather training. Meanwhile Kiwi International, which operates a fleet of 11 Boeing 727 aircraft flown by former employees of the now-defunct Eastern and PanAm airlines, appeared to have fallen victim to the FAA's rigorous new safety audit. It said the grounding of its aircraft had nothing to do with its aircraft or pilot training. The decision was related only to record-keeping.</p>

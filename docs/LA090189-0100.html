			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT HEARS S. DAKOTA-INDIAN DISPUTE OVER JURISDICTION OF RESERVATION ROADS  </P> <P> Like many a traffic cop, Willard Bordeaux stopped a speeder the other day. But  what Bordeaux then reported to headquarters is anything but typical.  </P> <P> "Subject is a non-Indian," crackled the voice of the Bureau of Indian Affairs  patrolman over the police radio. "Released with a warning."  </P> <P> Bordeaux had no choice. The incident took place on U.S. 18 in the heart of the  Rosebud Sioux Indian reservation, a remote, barren expanse of stubby pastures  and ramshackle homes astride the Nebraska border. It is also one of the few  places in the nation where justice, by design, is not blind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jurisdiction Limited  </P> <P> Thanks to a complex legal thicket that envelopes the administration of Rosebud,  as well as many other Indian reservations around the country, the federal BIA  police are the law here but still have no jurisdiction over the nearly 1,000  whites who live on reservation land.  </P> <P> At the same time, the county sheriff and a local policeman in the reservation  town of Mission, both of whom are white, can not arrest or ticket Indians. And  the state highway patrol pretty much steers clear of roads in Rosebud  altogether.  </P> <P> Or at least it has up to now. In what could be a landmark legal battle pitting  safety concerns against Indian autonomy and dignity, South Dakota and tribal  officials are fighting in the federal courts over jurisdiction on the highways  at Rosebud and other reservations.  </P> <P> The state says it should have control and points to a serious alcohol problem  on the reservations that has led to an accident fatality rate at Rosebud three  times the statewide average. At the neighboring Pine Ridge reservation,  patrolled solely by an Oglala Sioux tribal police force, the highway death toll  is five times the South Dakota norm, according to state figures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen as Power Grab  </P> <P> But tribal leaders, who have vowed to keep state troopers off Pine Ridge and  Rosebud no matter what the courts decide, claim that the statistics are  misleading and that the state action is a thinly veiled attempt by hostile  whites to seize power over Indian land.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, there's still a cowboy and Indian mentality, a redneck  mentality, on the part of many (white) people out here," charged Cora Jones,  the BIA agency superintendent at Rosebud.  </P> <P> Viola Burnette, the attorney general of the Rosebud tribe, sees the highway  dispute as part of a much broader struggle with the state. "They're chipping  away at our jurisdiction," she said. "First they chip at the highways, then  they chip at hunting and fishing rights, then I don't know what. They'll  continue trying their best to get control of what happens on the reservations."  </P> <P> The state won the first round in the courts last March when U.S. District Judge  Donald J. Porter, acting in a suit initiated by the Rosebud tribe, said Indian  authorities must share jurisdiction over reservation traffic with South Dakota  police. Nevertheless, both sides insist they should have exclusive control and  have appealed Porter's ruling to a federal appellate panel in St. Paul, Minn.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. George S. Mickleson, a Republican, has ordered  state troopers to stay off Pine Ridge and Rosebud until some kind of  accommodation can be worked out with tribal leaders.  </P> <P> Reservations such as Rosebud are theoretically sovereign lands, little nations  within a nation guaranteed to the various tribes by treaties sometimes a  century or more old. Subsequent court decisions and acts of Congress, however,  have significantly diluted tribal powers and drastically reduced the original  size of many Indian homelands.  </P> <P> Still, individual reservations have their own governments and courts as well as  educational and law enforcement systems -- all largely paid for with federal  stipends. Indians who live on reservations are exempt from many state taxes and  laws, yet are considered state citizens.  </P> <P> Pummelled by decades of land grabs, slights, deceptions and out-and-out  harassment, many Indians are wary of any governmental actions perceived as  restricting an already diminished capacity to control their own destiny. On the  other hand, many whites resent the special privileges and legal status afforded  Indians and suggest the reservation bureaucracy itself is to blame for turning  Indian lands into bleak islands of poverty where joblessness can run as high as  90%.  </P> <P> Indeed, South Dakota Atty. Gen. Roger Tellinghuisen, a Republican, created an  uproar earlier this year when he publicly suggested that reservations were an  antiquated, "divisive form of government." In the wake of widespread criticism,  Tellinghuisen later apologized. But Indian leaders claim the remark reflects  the attitude of many whites in the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friction Evident  </P> <P> True or not, jurisdictional friction is evident on several fronts in South  Dakota. For example, Tellinghuisen's office has lent support to businessmen in  a lawsuit to block Rosebud's tribal government from regulating non-Indian owned  commercial enterprises on the reservation.  </P> <P> Several months ago, state officials suspended bids for state-funded road repair  projects at Rosebud when tribal officials demanded that disputes between  contractors and workers be mediated in tribal courts. There are also simmering  arguments over quality controls for water sources that cut across reservations,  as well as hunting and fishing rights for non-Indians on Indian land.  </P> <P> But for the moment, at least, the highway battle is at center stage. The  controversy has its roots in a 1953 federal law, passed in an era when Congress  was actively trying to integrate Indians into the mainstream of American  society, that granted outright authority over civil and criminal jurisdiction  in Indian country to certain states. Other states, including South Dakota, were  given the option of taking on such duties.  </P> <P> Over the years, South Dakota's response to that statute has been confusing and  contradictory. State lawmakers did, at one point, pass legislation to assume  traffic duty on reservations, but enforcement of the statute was effectively  blocked by a 1964 order of the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Made Informal Arrangements  </P> <P> Even so, state troopers worked out informal power-sharing arrangements with  officials on some reservations. Under an unwritten agreement, state highway  patrols have routinely cruised the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux  reservations in the northern part of the state and issued citations to Indians  which are recognized by tribal courts. Even at Rosebud, tribal officials  periodically ask troopers to enter the reservation to conduct safety  inspections of Indian school buses.  </P> <P> In 1986, however, the Rosebud tribe filed suit against the state after troopers  issued a handful of tickets to Indians on reservation land. Despite their  ongoing working relationship with the state, both the Cheyenne River and  Standing Rock tribes later joined in the legal action, as did the Oglala tribe  at Pine Ridge.  </P> <P> Ruling on the case last March, Judge Porter agreed with state arguments that a  highway patrol presence on reservation highways could reduce lawlessness and  drunk driving and save lives. And Porter, citing cost estimates for increased  patrols, rejected arguments that state officials were making a power grab to  snatch traffic ticket revenue from the tribes.  </P> <P> According to evidence provided to Porter by the state, the statewide highway  death toll averaged 2.98 fatalities for every 100 million miles driven between  1977 and 1986. During the same decade, the death rate at Rosebud was 10.25  fatalities per 100 million miles and at Pine Ridge it was a startling 17.01.  Tribal officials claim the numbers distort the problem, but offer little  evidence to explain why.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticizes Officials  </P> <P> Also buttressing the state's argument was an affidavit from a former officer on  the federal police force at Rosebud. He claimed that Rosebud officials  routinely used clout to thwart criminal prosecutions in the tribal court and  that Indian judges rarely, if ever, sentenced tribal members to jail for drunk  driving.  </P> <P> "When you get a pattern like this, it's just too much," argued John Guhin, the  deputy attorney general in charge of the highway case. " . . . A lot of these  (Indian) officers are good officers and they try hard, but we think we can do a  better job. We have to ask ourselves, can we just sit here and do nothing."  </P> <P> The answer from tribal leaders, of course, is "yes." They question whether  South Dakota taxpayers will be willing to spend hundreds of thousands of  dollars annually for increased traffic control on reservations. And they claim  that Indians, who frequently complain of being hassled by state troopers off  the reservation, will strongly resent a highway patrol presence on the  reservation.  </P></p>

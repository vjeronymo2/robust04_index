			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Equity Issues: Greece to sell 14% of telecoms company OTE, Greece's state-owned telecommunications company, is to offer 14 per cent of its equity to domestic and international investors in a partial privatisation. The offering, the largest so far in Greece, will include an international tranche of around 5 per cent. It will be aimed at investors in the US and Europe, according to the government's privatisation unit. The international tranche will be offered simultaneously with a domestic tranche of around 5 per cent. The other 4 per cent will be stripped out earlier and offered on preferential terms to OTE's 28,000 employees. The government will retain control of 51 per cent. The share issue will follow the sale of a 35 per cent stake in the company, together with management rights, to an int-ernational telecommunications operator. Thirteen groups are in line to bid, with the sale due for completion by July. The government has not set a price for OTE, one of the few profitable Greek state enterprises. Analysts have valued the 14 per cent stake at around Dr90bn (Dollars 409m). Last month, 24 international banks and security houses were invited to submit bids to act as global co-ordinator and lead manager. N M Rothschild, the government's privatisation adviser, is assisting in the selection process. Thailand is about to embark on its first privatisation with the flotation of PTT Exploration and Production, part of the state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand. The public offering of just under 40m shares at Baht 33 per share (Dollars 1.29) represents about 15 per cent of PTTEP's total capital.</p>

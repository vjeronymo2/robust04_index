			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The yen's rise could  undermine Japan's economy just as it is starting to show some  signs of a recovery, the head of a life insurers' association  said Friday [18 February].    "Sales declines (in such consumer fields as) automobiles,  department stores and life insurance policies have slowed  recently although uncertainties remain over whether these can be  judged as signs of a full-fledged (economic) recovery," Toshiomi  Uragami told a regular press meeting.    But the chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan  stressed, "the yen's appreciation will put a damper" on such  movements.    "We must take (the yen's rise) calmly instead of falling  into  confusion," added Uragami, head of an industry which is also  Japan's largest institutional investor.    The dollar plunged against the yen after Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to  reach agreement in so-called framework trade talks at their  weekend meeting in Washington.    Uragami said, "it's extremely regrettable," but the failure  was "inevitable" in the wake of the strong U.S. demand for  "numerical targets."    He reiterated that numerical targets lead to "managed  trade,"  and are especially inapplicable in the insurance field, as  opposed to government procurement.    The summit was intended to reach an agreement on three  priority fields -- insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and  government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment.    With the U.S. economy in recovery and the Japanese economy  remaining weak, "(the bilateral) trade imbalance was apt to  swell," Uragami said, adding that the situation is poised to  change with Japan's economy about to pick up.    He welcomed the government's latest economic measures,  including the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, income  tax cuts, and the economy-oriented budget for fiscal 1994.    Uragami gave a mark of 70 out of 100 to those measures, and  said he deducted 30 because more spending would be favorable to  "really jump-start" the economy.    Referring to plans by nonlife insurers to hold  business-level  discussions with the U.S. side, Uragami said his association  already has foreign-affiliated life insurers among its members,  and both informal and formal talks have been conducted.    In press remarks Thursday, Takashi Onoda, chairman of the  Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, said nonlife  insurers intend to hold top-level and other discussions to  deepen understanding.    Meanwhile, Uragami said the recent ongoing moves by life  insurers to lower their rates on insurance policies for the  second consecutive year are a decision "ultimately" reflecting  the interest gap with market rates.    He brushed aside any connection with nonperforming loans at  housing and other financial institutions related to life  insurers. He said, "there is no plan now" for pension  insurance, but it could be considered.</p>

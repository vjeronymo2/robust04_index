			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemeni oil industry enters a new era - A development that has increased the country's output by two thirds CANADIAN Occidental Petroleum yesterday boosted Yemen's oil production by 60 per cent with the opening of its new fields in Masila. Brought on stream after an accelerated programme of development, Canadian Oxy's 120,000 barrels a day will increase Yemen's total output to just over 300,000 b/d. But more importantly, the new fields may open the way to further discoveries in coming months. Yemen's oil was first discovered in 1984 by the Dallas-based Hunt Oil Company, with further finds in 1986 by the former Soviet company, Technoexport. Taken together, the two sets of finds suggested the presence of a north-south oil trend and prompted Canadian Occidental to bid for a concession of its own in 1987. Concentrating its exploration efforts in the north-west corner of its 37,200 sq km concession area, Canadian Oxy began drilling in September 1990 and struck oil with its first well in January 1991. By December 1991, the company had drilled 14 wells and declared commerciality with an estimated 235m barrels of recoverable oil. Since then it company has drilled another 37 wells and increased its estimate of recoverable reserves to 460m barrels. Following its declaration of commerciality, the company began an accelerated construction programme to develop its production and export facility. In addition to the 51 wells and 55km of oil-gathering pipelines, Canadian Oxy has now constructed a central processing facility to purify and blend the oil, a 138km pipeline to the Gulf of Aden and an export terminal at Ash-Shihr with a loading rate of 60,000 barrels an hour. According to the production sharing agreement, the Yemen government will take 70 per cent of the liftings and Canadian Oxy 30 per cent. That shareout will sharply increase the country's export earnings. Prior to the new production levels, the government was understood to receive about 90,000 b/d from the Hunt field, of which 65,000 were used for domestic consumption. Added to the remaining 25,000 b/d per day, the new production figures from the Canadian Oxy field should give the government roughly 109,000 b/d day for export. The increased production will be a boon to Yemen's sagging economy and political structure. Since the Gulf War unemployment has stood at 36 per cent and annual inflation at 100 per cent. In October 1991 and again in December 1992, there were protest riots which left over 100 dead and many more injured. To maintain optimism, the government has long played up news of the country's oil potential and Canadian Oxy production will provide some justification for the its claims. Apart from the immediate rise in production figures, however, the Canadian Oxy discoveries have created a sense of optimism about further oil potential in the country. So far the company has fully explored only about 20 per cent of its own concession area and has now stepped up the pace of exploration to the east and south of Wadi Masila. Mr Ray Irani, chairman of the boards of US and Canadian Occidental, has expressed optimism that more oil will be found in the concession area and in the country as a whole. 'With oil production now at 300,000 b/d and increasing in the future, the prospects for Yemen's hydrocarbons industry are bright,' Mr Irani said. That view is shared by other companies operating in the region, particularly Total, Clyde Petroleum, and Lasmo Oil (Aden), which hold concession areas adjacent to Canadian Oxy's. Indeed, Total's recent discovery of 12,000 b/d in block 10, just east of Wadi Masila, now suggests that there may be another trend running to the north-east through the Canadian Oxy concession into those of Clyde and Lasmo. Mr Rod Makin, Lasmo's general manager, confirms the possibility of such a trend and is cautiously optimistic about his company's prospects regarding it. 'We are very hopeful about our chances in the Hood block, which is on one of the oil pathways of Yemen. We think we are on a trend and it just depends how far the trend extends,' he says. Lasmo began drilling its first well on September 1 and preliminary results could be available within a few weeks. Mr Makin underlines the significance of the results with care. 'This well and our next could be the turning point by proving the extension of the trend into the north-east,' he says. Mr Peter Bradley, general manager of Clyde, could not agree more. 'Yes', he says, 'the big question now is how far the trend extends. In that regard the Lasmo wells are important and could be most encouraging for us. They would automatically tell us that similar structures are in our fields. We have our fingers crossed.' According to Mr Bradley, Clyde will begin its exploratory drilling on November 1 this year. 'Clyde is reasonably optimistic, but we don't want to overplay it,' he says. 'This still is the exploration business and the next six to nine months will be a very intersting time for us.' Exploring for oil in Yemen is indeed risky. Most production sharing agreements now call for the collection of seismic data from at least 1,000km of survey lines and the drilling of three exploratory wells, all within 30 months. Elsewhere, according to Mr Bradley, the time frame for exploration is normally three or four times as long. Thus, in Yemen, companies are under considerable pressure to produce quickly. That pressure is increased by the size of concession areas and the nature of their terrain. With concession areas ranging from 1,200 sq km to 37,200 sq km, the odds are very clearly against exploration teams finding anything at all. As Mr Bradley put it, 'no company can possibly cover its entire concession area'. Thus, companies have to select carefully even before undertaking their seismic surveys. Because of the difficulties of the terrain, such surveys themselves can be costly and the results hard to interpret. Clyde, Lasmo, and Canadian Occidental are all operating on a plateau deeply incised by meandering Wadis. That means seismic data must frequently be collected by specialised vehicles - often helicopters - which can send costs as high as USDollars 13,000 a kilometre. The variable nature of the terrain, moreover, can affect the direction of seismic vibrations and produce misleading data. And, with drilling rigs estimated to cost between USDollars 2m and USDollars 6m each, such mistakes can be very costly. The odds against discovering oil in Yemen are therefore high and, not surprisingly, the list of dry wells is growing. But the achievement of Canadian Oxy is undeniable and has turned the eyes of oil men in new directions. 'One thing is for sure', says Mr Bradley. 'From block 10 eastwards is now really wildcat country. It is so wide open.'</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TAKE TAPER-OFF APPROACH ON SMOKING  </P> <P> Leaders of the Los Angeles Unified School District voted Monday to implement a  tobacco-free policy in two phases, which will allow smokers to ease into  compliance.  </P> <P> The first phase will begin Nov. 15 -- Great American Smokeout Day -- and  establish designated outdoor smoking areas that will be off limits to students.  Smoking will be banned in all other areas, including school buildings, grounds  and district vehicles.  </P> <P> Student smoking has been prohibited and employee smoking restricted to certain  rooms and areas for several years.  </P> <P> The second phase, which will begin on an as-yet-unspecified date next year,  will prohibit smoking anywhere in the school system.  </P> <P> Beverly Martin, a school administrator who headed a committee that recommended  the two-step process, said the group wanted to avoid a "hard-handed approach."  </P> <P> "We recognize some people have strong feelings about smoking," Martin said.  </P> <P> The district will launch a program to educate school employees about the health  hazards of tobacco and refer smokers to community programs to help them quit.  The district also will sponsor stop-smoking clinics and start support groups.  </P> <P> The regulations will affect students, employees and visitors to any school and  those attending any school-sponsored activity, athletic event or meeting.  </P> <P> Board member Rita Walters cast the sole dissenting vote against the designated  smoking areas. She also voiced concern about a proposal that would allow school  employees to inform anonymously on those who violate the regulations.  </P> <P> "It smacks of totalitarianism . . . it's a big brother approach," Walters said.  </P> <P> The ban was initially proposed by a group of teachers and other employees and  representatives of the American Heart, Lung and Cancer associations who  persuaded board President Jackie Goldberg to sponsor the motion.  </P> <P> Teachers are expected to be hardest hit by the ban, but relatively little  protest has been registered either with the board or teachers union, officials  said.  </P> <P> Smoking bans have been implemented in school districts across the country with  little debate or opposition.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   No Majority Support for Bophuthatswana's Mangope -- "The  teargas billowing in the streets of Mmabatho and Mafikeng gives  the lie to President Lucas Mangope's claim of majority support  in Bophuthatswana," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 10 March. "His suggestion that the  homeland is financially self-sufficient is also absurd."  Mangope should do as the Transitional Executive Council (TEC)  requires and "allow free political activity in the homeland and  change his government's attitude from resistance to  co-operation. The final outcome is now inevitable, but the  Mangope government must ensure that it is reached without more  tears."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Housing Minister-TEC Confrontation -- Referring to the  confrontation between Housing Minister Louis Shill and the TEC  over Shill's "jumping the gun on the announcement of the R90  billion [rand] housing scheme," Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English on 10 March in a page-14 editorial says Shill has "shown  poor judgment in taking on the TEC, and he is compounding his  mistake by continuing to defy the council, whose legal position  may be stronger than Shill believes." "There is little doubt  that in announcing the housing programme, Shill was seeking to  win credit for the National Party. The TEC was thus quite within  its rights to rule his announcement an unfair electioneering  tactic."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Conservative Party Looking Vulnerable -- Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 4 March says in a page-8 editorial: "It is  becoming clearer that the ripples which followed the remarkable  Mandela-Buthelezi summit are only now beginning to make  themselves felt. Ironically, what happened between two black  leaders has thus far had its greatest impact on the lily-white  Conservative Party [CP]. There could hardly be a better example  of the irrelevance of the CP's whites-only politics. The fact  that Mr. Mandela was able to persuade Mr. Buthelezi to consider  registering provisionally for the election threw the Freedom  Alliance, and in particular the CP, off balance. Without the  IFP and Mr. Buthelezi who supported them in what they wanted to  achieve, the CP suddenly looks uncertain and vulnerable."  "Right-wingers are clearly beginning to realize in increasing  numbers that participation in elections is the essence of  politics. If it also means that the homeland ideal will be  striven for in an orderly, constitutional manner, then the  option becomes that much more attractive."    Viljoen Should Press Ahead Democratically -- "After three  painful humiliations, General Constand Viljoen ought to realize  that the radical elements in the right wing, who unfortunately  form the majority, want nothing to do with being reasonable,"  notes an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans  on 7 March. "They seek confrontation, and as a result they are  becoming an increasing danger to South Africa." "In the process  the hero of yesterday and the day before -- the Moses who was to  lead his people to freedom -- has become the 'traitor.' That is  how cruelly the right wing treats those who offer choices  different from the extremism of Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and Mr.  Eugene Terreblanche." "Gen. Viljoen must know that his entrance  into politics, which held so much expectation, has now been  virtually stripped of all credibility. He tried to use shuttle  diplomacy between the radicals and the moderates in the  Afrikaner National Front (AVF) as well as with the government  and the African National Congress (ANC), but he is being  increasingly rejected by his people." "Last Friday Gen. Viljoen  registered the Freedom Front political party with the aim of  participating in the election. There are indications that the  decision was thoroughly planned, and must have been the result  of strategic consideration, not a sudden impulse. We only hope  that Gen. Viljoen and his spiritual allies do not allow  themselves to be trampled by the AVF. We urge them to press on  with their plans to fight for their homeland in an orderly,  democratic manner."</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Moi spurns 'dictatorial' western donors KENYA'S President Daniel arap Moi yesterday threatened to suspend relations with western donors and said Kenya was on the brink of collapse. The president's move followed the refusal of donors to resume Dollars 40m a month aid payments amid fresh evidence of government backsliding on free market reforms and continued corruption by banks and businessmen. Bankers and donors said Mr Moi's statement would further destabilise the economy, fuel rapid depreciation of the Kenya shilling and boost inflation, which has already risen to around 50 per cent this year. Many observers fear the rapid price spiral will spark urban unrest among Kenya's impoverished people. President Moi said the government was reviewing relations with donors who were forcing 'dictatorial and suicidal' reforms on the country. Mr Moi singled out the International Monetary Fund for criticism, saying the reforms were unrealistic and were causing suffering to the Kenyan people. 'Kenya will no longer agree to policies which are economically suicidal,' he said. 'The government is to rethink the country's economic arrangements and take the necessary steps it deems fit to safeguard the welfare of the people.' For a month Kenya has tried to woo back badly needed balance of payments aid, which was suspended in 1991 because of corruption, mismanagement and political authoritarianism. The government has partly liberalised the foreign exchange market and made tentative steps to decontrol prices. But an IMF mission two weeks ago refused to approve the reforms until the government took further measures to reign in excessive liquidity by raising interest rates, cutting the bloated 270,000-strong civil service and taking bolder steps on price liberalisation. Donors who met in London last Monday refused to resume aid until the IMF conditions were met. In a move that seemed to meet some IMF demands on mopping up liquidity, the government yesterday issued Ksh5bn (Pounds 61m) worth of three-month Treasury Bills. Bankers who bid for the bills said the interest rate would be around 35 per cent - 10 points lower than the IMF's target. However, the move was overshadowed by evidence that the central bank this week released Ksh5.4bn through the controversial pre-export financing scheme to two banks - Trade Bank and Exchange Bank. The pre-export financing scheme has been criticised by donors as one of Kenya's worst corruption scandals, allowing politically connected companies and banks access to cheap Kenya shillings for conversion into foreign exchange and 'round tripping'. Last month Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, promised that the pre-export financing scheme had been shut down. Mr Robert Shaw, economic spokesman of the opposition Ford-Kenya, said: 'All the old scams are reappearing. Its back to business as usual.'</p>

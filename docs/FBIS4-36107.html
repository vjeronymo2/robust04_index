			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA)--The northern al-Jizah  Prosecution Office continued its interrogation of Muslim  Brotherhood General Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr today. After four  hours of questioning, the prosecution decided to resume the  interrogations Thursday.    Abu-al-Nasr told his interrogators that the Muslim  Brotherhood has had no official or structural organization since  the decision to dissolve it in 1954. He said he is assuming the  post of the group's general guide to shoulder his responsibility  in filing lawsuits demanding that the dissolution decision be  repealed. He noted that this is currently being examined by the  judiciary.    Abu-al-Nasr said that as a general guide he issues  statements  expressing the Muslim Brotherhood's views on various issues. He  stressed that he respects the Constitution and the laws and that  he expresses his opinion through legitimate means allowed by law.</p>

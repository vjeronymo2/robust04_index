			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN KILLED IN SHOOT-OUT AFTER OFFICER IS WOUNDED  </P> <P> A Placentia police officer was shot and wounded outside a bar by a woman's  outraged boyfriend, who was later cornered by police and killed in a gun battle  on a gravel vacant lot, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old officer, a five-year veteran whose name was being withheld by  authorities, was in stable condition at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana  after three hours of surgery for an abdominal wound.  </P> <P> Police said the Buena Park man suspected of shooting the officer late Thursday  night at The Railroad Inn was killed after a half-hour standoff with more than  a dozen officers from the Placentia and Anaheim police departments in a vacant  lot at Van Buren Street and Orangethorpe Avenue.  </P> <P> Dennis William Smith, 32, was killed by officers after he fired shots at them  shortly before midnight, said Sgt. Jay Fricke, a Placentia police spokesman.  </P> <P> "We're not sure how many shots were fired off," Fricke said. "One officer  estimated at least two gunshots were fired by the suspect" before officers  responded.  </P> <P> "It sounded like a war going off," said Martin Garcia, 20, a neighbor who was  walking back to his house when police opened fire. "It sounded like a  free-for-all."  </P> <P> Another witness, Bill Johns, 43, said police "blasted off about 50 shots" like  something "from the movies" before an officer yelled to cease fire.  </P> <P> Investigators from the Orange County district attorney's office combed the area  Friday morning, examining Smith's bullet-riddled car and picking up spent shell  casings and bullet fragments. A concrete wall that served as the backdrop for  the midnight drama was pockmarked with bullet holes that investigators circled  with yellow markers.  </P> <P> Authorities disclosed few details of the events that led to the shooting of the  officer, who has a pregnant wife and three children, or the gun battle in the  vacant lot, which is bordered on two sides by pastel, wood-frame houses.  </P> <P> "We've had a number of investigators out there since last night," said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Brian Brown, who is handling the shooting investigation. "It would  be premature for me to talk about anything we've learned at this point. We'll  try to get the investigation concluded as quickly as we can."  </P> <P> Police reported no other casualties besides Smith and the wounded officer.  </P> <P> Neighbors, however, said a resident of the area, Robert Rodriguez, 32, was  grazed on the lip by a stray bullet while he peeked from behind a concrete  block wall during the final shoot-out. His mother, who declined to give her  name, said Rodriguez was in good condition after being treated at the hospital  and was interviewed by police Friday.  </P> <P> Workers at The Railroad Inn, a Placentia restaurant and bar where Smith's  girlfriend worked as a bartender, said they were surprised by the events of  Thursday evening.  </P> <P> "Every time (Smith) came in, he seemed like a real nice guy," said Troy Cullen,  a waiter at the restaurant. "Quiet. Real low-key."  </P> <P> Smith, a painter, and the woman, who was not identified by police, dated for  about two months but did not live together, employees said. During their short  courtship, Smith showered the girlfriend with presents, among them numerous  gold rings, jewelry, necklaces and clothing, they said.  </P> <P> Employees said there was no clue that anything was amiss in the relationship  between the woman and Smith, a Texas native who served a stint in the Marines.  Smith preferred to drink coffee rather than alcohol when he stopped by the  tavern at the end of his girlfriend's shift, they said.  </P> <P> "He was usually very quiet," said Gary Farrinton, a cook at the restaurant. "I  never saw him out of line. . . . But he might have just wigged out."  </P> <P> Authorities said the episode unfolded about 11:15 p.m., when the officer went  to the restaurant in the 1200 block of East Orangethorpe Avenue in response to  a report of a fight between Smith and his girlfriend.  </P> <P> When the officer confronted Smith in the parking lot, which is shared by a  7-Eleven and other small shops that line the small commercial strip center, the  boyfriend shot him, authorities allege. Smith fled in his car as the officer  slumped to the ground, police said.  </P> <P> Another Placentia police officer arrived just as Smith drove away and was told  by his still-conscious colleague to pursue Smith, Fricke said.  </P> <P> After a short chase, Smith's car crashed through a light standard at a railroad  crossing about a mile away. His car came to rest in the vacant lot, and Smith  took cover behind the upraised engine hood as police closed in, Fricke said.  </P> <P> Officers had fanned out behind squad cars and the low concrete walls of nearby  houses, police said.  </P> <P> Several neighbors echoed police accounts of the final gun battle.  </P> <P> Garcia said he was at his house nearby getting ready to sleep when he heard "a  big bang" and ran out to find a man crouched behind a battered car, locked in a  standoff with police.  </P> <P> The stalemate lasted about 20 minutes, as officers used a loudspeaker to urge  the gun-wielding man to give up his weapon and come out peacefully, Garcia  said.  </P> <P> Johns, who lives directly across the vacant lot on Van Buren Street, said the  cornered man alternately pointed his handgun at police and then raised it to  his temple, as if preparing to commit suicide.  </P> <P> At about midnight, the gunman lowered his weapon and "threw a few shots" at the  officers, said Garcia, who watched the events with other neighbors from behind  a wall about 50 feet down the street. One police officer responded by firing a  shot back at the gunman, he said.  </P> <P> At that point, a Placentia policeman ran over to Garcia and other huddled  residents and ordered them to return home. A minute or two later, as the  residents were milling toward their houses, "we just heard gunshots going  wild," Garcia said.  </P> <P> "It sounded like, man, it sounded very awful," he said. "I never heard anything  like that."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Apr--Opposition chief Lim Kit Siang  recommended that the government appoint a chairman of the Public  Accounting Committee (PAC) from among opposition members of  Parliament to investigate recent Malaysian Central Bank (BNM)  losses in foreign currency exchange transactions.    He said such an appointment is necessary because the former  PAC chairman, Datuk Dr. Affifuddun, was recently appointed  parliamentary secretary for the Ministry of Finance.    Speaking in the discussion of an emergency motion this  evening, he said the appointment of a PAC chairman from among  opposition members of Parliament would mean that the government  is proving that it is sincere and serious.    He said that despite the losses suffered during two  successive years, the PAC has still been unable to act, because  it does not have a chairman.    "The government needs to prove it is serious by creating a  Royal Investigation Commission to investigate the financial  scandal," he said.    He said he feels that the foreign exchange losses recently  suffered by the Central Bank are the result of "gambling."    As an example, he cited the case of Mongolia, where two  former central bank governors and three of their employees were  prosecuted for negligence and exceeding their authority when  they gambled in the foreign currency market, producing losses of  $90 million.    In his lengthy discussion, Lim, who is a DAP member of  Parliament from Jelutong, took part in urging the government to  admit that it had injected 3 billion ringgit into the BNM's  account to resolve the problem of a net shortage of 2.01 billion  ringgit.    "The government was willing to do that in order to provide  enough capital funds for the BNM to operate and to restore the  power and image of the governor and other bank officials," he  declared.    He questioned the capability of the BNM, which has acted as  savior of financial institutions facing problems, because the  BNM itself is in a financial crisis.</p>

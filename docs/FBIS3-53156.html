			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Muscat: "Muscat: Al-Bishari Gives </F> Bin-'Alawi Letter from Libyan Leadership; Attempt To Restore  Diplomatic Relations Expected"]    [Text] Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mr.  Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah yesterday received Mr. Ibrahim  al-Bishari, Libya's Permanent Representative to the Arab League  and Coordinator of Relations with Egypt, who gave him a  handwritten letter from the Libyan Foreign Ministry.    Informed sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Bishari and the Omani  official discussed developments in the Lockerbie crisis between  Libya and Western countries, the current Arab situation, and  bilateral relations.    The sources noted that the Libyan visits and messages to  Muscat, which ceased about one year ago, had recently resumed  despite the limited relations between the two countries since  the Lockerbie crisis and Libya's quest for the mediation of  moderate Arab contries such as Oman, the Gulf states, and Egypt,  to avoid an unequal confrontation with Western countries and  reach a political solution to the crisis.    Although Oman has avoided commenting on the crisis itself,  it  has expressed, in a cautious and indirect manner, its  reservations about the sanctions imposed on the "Libyan people."  Mr. Yusuf Bin-'Alawi told AL-HAYAH, when the international  sanctions were first imposed on Libya, that it was the Libyan  people who would suffer from the boycott.    However, according to diplomatic sources in Muscat, Oman is  not expected to play an active role in mediation efforts between  Libyan and the West, not only because it may see a "realistic"  chance for solving the Lockerbie crisis only through acceptance  and implementation of the UN resolutions, but also because  bilateral relations with Libya remain limited, and were until  recently impaired by a certain distrust due to differing  political stances during the 1970's and 1980's.    These sources believe that the Libyan envoy, who was once  foreign minister, may have sought to move bilateral relations  towards the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two  countries. Libya is currently the only Arab country with which  Muscat does not have diplomatic relations.    Among the things the Omanis may be interested in knowing is  how far Libya would go in opposing the Palestinian-Israeli peace  agreement on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The Sultanate  enthusiastically supports the agreement and has sought to  support it both in the Gulf region and the Arab world, after  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Muscat directly  after the agreement was reached.    Diplomatic sources say that the message that Libya has  received from other Arab parties--that actual opposition engaged  in by the Libyan Government to obstruct the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement "could be an additional factor complicating chances to  solve the Lockerbie crisis politically, and exposing Libya to  new difficulties"--might be the same thing al-Bishari is hearing  in his meetings with Omani officials during his visit, which  ends today.    Unlike many subjects, Libya's and Oman's views on the  current  state of Arab relations are close. They both affirm the need for  starting a new chapter in these relations and getting out of the  rut of the Gulf crisis, including opening the door to Iraq's  return, as long as it obeys the UN resolutions.</p>

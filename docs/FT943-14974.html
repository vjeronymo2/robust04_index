			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Ukraine president beaten in poll: Links with Russia may grow  -Fears over nuclear disarmament Mr Leonid Kuchma, a former Soviet missile factory boss, won Ukraine's first presidential election since independence in 1991, defeating incumbent Leonid Kravchuk in an upset that could improve relations between Kiev and its former Soviet neighbours. His victory raises questions about the country's pledges to the west on nuclear disarmament and the fate of a troubled reform programme for its ailing economy. Mr Kuchma, 55, who campaigned to strengthen ties with Russia in order to revive Ukraine's economy, won 52 per cent of the vote compared with Mr Kravchuk's 45 per cent, a difference of about two million votes, according to the Central Election Commission's preliminary returns. The key to Mr Kuchma's victory was the unexpectedly high turnout of about 65 per cent in Ukraine's densely populated eastern regions, where residents are largely Russian speakers from working class backgrounds and where there are high concentrations of ethnic Russians. Mr Kuchma, who is expected to be sworn in as president on July 19, faces the task of reconciling his often contradictory campaign promises, which could be undermined by a potentially hostile parliament. Eastern Ukrainians and separatists on the Crimean peninsula, to whom he owes his victory, expect him to seek closer ties with Russia. However, Mr Kuchma, who insisted upon his Ukrainian patriotism in the campaign, must also assure nationalist western Ukrainians that he will preserve the country's independence. He appeared to have begun the process of reconciliation on his arrival in Kiev, saying: 'Everything that happened during the campaign was criminal in terms of confrontation between east and west . . . If we act intelligently, we can overcome this split.' On the economic front, Mr Kuchma must also appease warring constituencies. His aides have claimed that his pro-market campaign and support for liberalisation as prime minister in 1993 won the pro-reform vote. He has promised to include market reformers in his cabinet. However, communists from eastern Ukraine voted in the hope that Mr Kuchma would restore Soviet-style administrative controls over the economy. Western diplomats are concerned about the impact of Mr Kuchma on Ukraine's relationship with the west. Kiev received a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.56bn) boost at last week's G7 summit, but warm relations with the west depend on its promise last January to surrender its nuclear weapons. An anti-disarmament speech by Mr Kuchma last year, where he argued forcefully that Ukraine should retain its nuclear weapons, still troubles the west.

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Flagship Tory council sold homes for votes, says auditor Mr John Major was struggling to sustain his government's authority last night after his tottering 'back to basics' initiative was further undermined by official allegations that Westminster city council, a Tory 'flagship' borough, had manipulated its housing policy in an attempt to win votes. The report, believed to be the most comprehensive of its kind, alleges that Pounds 21.25m was wasted. Mr John Magill, Westminster's district auditor, says in provisional findings that six councillors and four council officials might be required to repay the money. Dame Shirley Porter, a leading Conservative politician and leader of the council until 1991, and Mr Barry Legg, MP for Milton Keynes SW since 1992, are among those named. Several sweeping allegations are made in the report, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times. However, the full 250-page report and an annex including about 500 pages of detailed documentation may not be published or quoted. It is a criminal offence to disclose information gained by a district auditor in the course of his duty. The central allegations made by Mr Magill paint an extraordinary picture of political manipulation centred on targeting sales of council houses - which would mostly be bought by likely Conservative voters - on eight 'key' marginal wards, and the rehousing of the resulting homeless families at the council's expense. Mr Magill says in his conclusions that: The council was engaged in 'gerrymandering', which Mr Magill described as 'a disgraceful and improper purpose, and not a purpose for which a local authority may act'. The number of homeless families who had to be put into temporary accommodation increased by 172 each year, at a cost to the council of Pounds 2m. Meanwhile, homes they could have occupied remained empty, awaiting new buyers. The council lost Pounds 13.3m by selling the properties at a discount to their open market values. Last night Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the report disclosed 'a devastating example of financial corruption and the abuse of power by senior members of the Conservative party'. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local-government spokesman, emphasised the close links between the council and the Conservative leadership and highlighted the publicity the party's campaigners gave the council during the 1990 election. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he would condemn the alleged activities 'unequivocally' if they turned out to be true. Mr David Weeks, one of the councillors named in the report and leader of Westminster council until last year, attacked the basis for the inquiry, in which he said the district auditor had acted as the 'prosecuting counsel, judge and jury'. He said the council's actions on housing policy had been approved as legal by Mr Jeremy Sullivan, a Queen's Counsel who specialises in local government, on three separate occasions. Mr Weeks, who is still a Westminster councillor and is a marketing executive at the Lovell construction group, said Mr Magill had taken a 'nave and dictatorial view' of how councils ran their housing policies. Other councillors named in the report made robust denials. They have the opportunity to make representations to Mr Magill on his provisional findings, which they must do no later than July 29. Dame Shirley, who was out of the country and could not be located, issued a stern denial of the charges through her solicitor. Her statement said she had received legal advice that the auditor's provisional view was 'neither correct in law nor in fact'. The statement continued: 'A leading firm of accountants have also advised her that Mr Magill's views about alleged losses are equally wrong and misconceived. She now, at last, has the opportunity to make representations and to defend herself.' Mr Legg said: 'I utterly refute any suggestion of impropriety. When the time comes for me to put my case I will be answering in full the matters raised in the report.' 'Various British political practices now being alleged or revealed would bring a blush to the cheeks of any honest Italian.

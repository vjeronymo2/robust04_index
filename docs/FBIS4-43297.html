			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] According to a Finnish News Service  report carried on page 7 of leading national daily Helsinki  HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 23 May, the organization representing  agricultural interests has decided not to support European Union  [EU] membership in the referendum to be held on 16 October. Esa  Harmala, chairman of the Farmers and Forest Owners' Federation  (MTK), announced this decision of the governing board in an  interview, asserting that the group would not "campaign for  membership under any circumstances." Depending on the outcome of  the ongoing argument over farm subsidies, however, the  organization in the future might adopt "a completely negative  position" or maintain this slightly more ambiguous stance of not  recommending how its constituency should vote. Harmala, who  prior to being elected to head the MTK in April, was chief  negotiator for farm issues at the Brussels talks on Finnish  entry terms. In the interview cited, Harmala accused the  government of having broken many of its promises made to farmers  about these same terms, especially relating to subsidy issues.    In contrast, Finland's largest labor union, the blue-collar  Finnish Confederation of Labor (SAK), decided to back EU  membership, as discussed by HELSINGIN SANOMAT reporter Jarmo  Aaltonen in a story on 29 May. SAK delegates voted 79 to 19,  with eight abstentions. In a second ballot demanded by an EU  opponent in which the proposition was given more negative  wording, the stand was confirmed by a 73-13 vote. Opposition was  mainly concentrated in the Left Alliance Party (VL) with  scattered support from Social Democratic ranks. Notable among  opponents were leaders of some constituent unions, including the  Merchant Seamen's Union (a Social Democrat) and the Electrical  Workers' Union (a Left Alliance member). Opponents charged that  membership would result in reducing the level of social  services, destroying worker security, cutting wages, weakening  the position of women in society, and ending Finnish  sovereignty. One VL delegate repeated the familiar assertion  that democracy would suffer when matters are settled in  Brussels.    The government's decision of 26 May to continue high farm  subsidies through a "domestic support package" over a five-year  transition to the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] was seen by  Aaltonen as having cost some loss of support for membership. The  SAK also adopted a "separate stand" on the agricultural package,  asserting that this would lead to: "an insupportable excess  production, and is an attempt by producers to preserve their  special privileges until the year 2000."    In the end, the SAK leadership carried the day in a  promembership resolution by asserting that the organization two  years ago had voted to join the EU pending a favorable outcome  in the entry talks, and that this had now been achieved.    In a Finish News Service report of 2 June on page 6, NTK  chief Harmala stated that the government's agriculture package  did not go far enough to justify a change of mind regarding the  body's attitude on membership. He now said the MTK would not  adopt a final position on the referendum until it received  assurance about the level of the the national subsidy package,  and that the EU Commission would approve it. Unless such  assurance is received in good time, he said, "...farmers and the  MTK will be forced into actively opposing membership. He  attacked the EU for rejecting Finland's demand in Brussels for  step-by-step adjustment to community food-price levels, and  doubted it would accept this arrangement now."</p>

January-November exports to the region of 4.49 billion U.S.  dollars were off 0.7 percent from the same period in 1992.    Exports, which rose between 20 percent and 50 percent a  month  in the first half except for March, dropped 9.2 percent in  August, 25.9 percent in September, 20.1 percent in October and  21.8 percent in November.    Exports to Latin America rose between 20 percent and 30  percent a year from 1987 and 72.4 percent in 1992.    The decline was attributed to economic recession in Brazil,  Chile and Mexico.    The Latin American countries lowered tariffs in trade with  the United States under bilateral agreements but raised tariffs  in trade with Asian countries to keep out low-priced Asian  products, officials said.    During the first half, Korean exports to Brazil rose more  than 200 percent a month, but the growth rate plummeted to  around 100 percent in the second half as Brazil tried to reduce  imports due to worsening inflation.    Exports to Chile dropped for four months in a row from  August  to November. Exports to Mexico declined due to economic  slackness and anti-dumping charges against Korean steel  products, officials said.</p>

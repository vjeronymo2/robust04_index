			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Televisa in US satellite expansion TELEVISA, Mexico's largest media group, has bought 50 per cent of PanAmSat LP, the privately-owned US satellite company, for Dollars 200m. The deal has received approval from the US Federal Communications Commission. PanAmSat operates one satellite for broadcasting over the Atlantic region. However, it plans to put into orbit another three covering the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans before 1996 which would make it the world's only private global satellite communications network. The purchase fits in with Televisa's strategy of becoming a global, vertically integrated media company. Televisa is a large producer of television programmes, and will now have full control of their distribution across the world. The acquisition will free it from Mexican government regulations on satellite broadcasting. The purchase is not expected to affect Televisa's earnings until 1996.</p>

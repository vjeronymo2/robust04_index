These are far from  unambiguous, which is quite natural since socioeconomic  developments always have positives and negatives. The final  balance and evaluation of the consequences of emergent  tendencies are important in this matter.    The process of overcoming the total statization of the  economy and creating diverse forms and types of economic  operation has continued and largely accelerated during the  period in question. The formation of an infrastructure of a  market economy and its characteristic mechanisms has begun; the  mechanism of supply and demand has begun operating, albeit with  disruptions; the first signs of competition have appeared. The  mentality of economic cadres who are adjusting to the conditions  of an emerging market economy is changing. A new generation of  managers--educated, energetic, and free of the baggage of old  dogmas and habits--is assuming management responsibilities at  various levels of economic operations. A stratum of  entrepreneurs has been gradually evolving.    While evaluating favorably the movement toward a market  economy which has gotten underway, we should nonetheless note  the continuously growing and largely excessive "price" which our  society has already paid and will be forced to pay for the  selected strategy and tactics of transition to a market economy.    The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a  result of "shock therapy" and its internal structure, is  affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly  painful manner and is fraught with the irreversible destruction  of the economic and scientific-technical potential of the  country.    In the last two years alone the fall in production on key  macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the  precrisis level, approximated 40 percent. It is important to  stress that, first, the drop in production is of a universal  rather than structural nature and second, it has affected the  most progressive and high-technology industries and types of  production to the greatest degree.    The ideologists of "shock treatment" view the consequences  of  the production slump quite flippantly; they believe it to be  temporary and easy to make up. To make this more convincing,  references are made to historical experience whereby the country  restored its past might within relatively short periods of time  following tremendous destruction and losses (as a result of the  civil war and the Great Patriotic War).    The following must be said in conjunction with this:    First. Under current conditions, declines in the  volume of production mean the loss of markets, and not only the  world market (for example, in the aerospace industry, in the  production of armaments, etc.) but also the domestic market.  There is no such thing as a vacuum in this area. Having once  yielded positions on the market, it is extremely difficult to  regain that niche. In other words, the process may turn out to  be irreversible.    Second. Historical analogies are hardly convincing  in this case. The time when it was possible to restore the  economy with the help of the shovel and the hoe, drawing on mass  enthusiasm or coercion of the population, is gone for good. In  the modern world, this may only be accomplished by drawing on  state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and organization of  production. Having missed this opportunity, the country could  inevitably be doomed to protracted or perhaps eternal  backwardness.    A slump in investment activity is the most profound and  dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the  last two years alone the volume of investment in the Russian  economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to  about 40 percent of the precrisis level.    Not only structural changes but even the elementary growth  of  production is impossible given this volume. However, the problem  is more profound and complex. The amortization of fixed  production assets has already come close to 60 percent, i.e.,  the threshold beyond which the physical destruction of the  production potential of the country begins. Our society has  become a witness to a growing danger of accidents and disasters.    The mounting crisis has affected the scientific sphere  (including basic and sectoral research, design and development  activities, and trial and experimental production). First-rate,  world-level collectives are falling apart before our eyes;  leadership status on a number of avenues for  scientific-technical progress is being lost; physical facilities  are becoming hopelessly obsolete.    The country is losing its intellectual potential, and  together with it--hope for the rebirth and prosperity of Russia.    Inconsistent and on occasion impulsive actions of the  government and the Central Bank of Russia, the absence of a  clear-cut and well-conceived financial strategy, and the  selection of financial stabilization measures which were not in  line with the actually emerging conditions have produced  extremely unfavorable results.    Disorganization of the financial system and loss of control  over monetary circulation is one of the results of the policy of  "shock therapy" and the methods of its implementation. In two  years there has been no success in normalizing the budget  system, despite attracting enormous credit from the Central Bank  and artificially withdrawing monies from the Pension Fund to  cover the deficit. The payments crisis which was caused by  ill-conceived actions and the inability to ensure the normal  intake of taxes merely undermined the revenue base of the budget  and caused a chronic budget deficit.    The financial system of the national economy as a whole is  facing the most difficult situation (including the financial  situation of enterprises and regions). Fixed assets are being  systematically "eaten away." Amortization has lost the feature  of being one of the most significant and most reliable sources  of investment and is not in a position to ensure even the simple  reproduction of fixed assets. The number of unprofitable  enterprises and those with slim profit margins is growing.    The payments crisis, or the breakdown of payments relations  on an unprecedented scale, began against the background of a  campaign to liberalize prices and tighten budgetary and credit  policies. Initially it was accompanied by reductions in the  volume of production; by the end of 1993 it had acquired new  features and manifested itself as a mass stoppage of enterprises  (including giant enterprises) which was not associated with the  bankruptcy procedure.    The government extensively used emission to carry out its  populist statements and as a drug of sorts for "emboldening"  production. During the last two years the government has been  the main borrower of funds from the Central Bank. The issuance  of state short-term bonds which got underway covers merely 2  percent of the deficit of the consolidated budget; the bulk of  the deficit is still financed out of Central Bank credit (at the  preferential rate of 10 percent).    The emission of cash increased from 1.5 trillion rubles [R]  in 1992 to R10.1 trillion in 1993, and its proportion in the  total money supply increased from 24 to 37 percent. Virtually  all cash put into circulation last year was retained by the  population or services the nonbank circulation of resources.    The disorganization of the financial system, the "war of the  budgets" between the center and many regions, the payments  crisis, and the uncontrolled emission all testify to the loss of  state control over monetary circulation.    The growth of inflation which was triggered by the  liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. In 1993  the average monthly rate of inflation was even higher than in  the previous year (if we omit the January "surge" in 1992). The  failure to combat inflation is explained by a failure to  understand its nature in the economy of Russia (underestimating  its highly monopolized structure, ignoring the factor of cost  inflation, and so on), and correspondingly opting for  inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of  demand constraints.    All of the above makes it possible to conclude that the hope  for financial stabilization without overcoming the slump in  production is turning out to be illusory and theoretically  unsound.    During the last two years, privatization has been the most  apparent sphere of institutional changes in the Russian economy.  It has been advanced the farthest in the trade sector, public  catering, and the service sector. By the end of 1993, nonstate  trade enterprises accounted for three-quarters of retail sales.  The process of "large-scale" privatization in industry has  begun. The reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has  virtually ended; companies of various types have been formed;  the farmer-owner sector has been emerging, albeit at a  decreasing rate.    The course and consequences of privatization have been far  from unambiguous. Its positives include first of all the  destruction of the total statization of the economy and the  emergence of a growing stratum of quite energetic real owners.  The value system and behavioral motivation of a significant  proportion of the population have been gradually changing with  the appearance of a securities market. At the same time,  privatization has not brought about the inflow of investment,  and has not noticeably influenced improvements in effectiveness.  In a number of cases, technological connections were disrupted  unnecessarily.    The unfavorable consequences were largely due to the failure  to think through privatization itself and haste in carrying it  out. Administrative pressure and the monotony of the forms of  privatization (orientation exclusively toward the creation of  publicly held joint-stock companies) have remained; no reliable  legal foundation has been laid. The issuance of vouchers did not  ensure the popular nature of privatization, as proclaimed by its  ideologists; a drop in the value of vouchers in real terms and  their concentration in a small number of investment funds are  fraught with not only the further stratification of society, but  also the growth of social tension. Warnings and recommendations  found in the previous report of the RAN [Russian Academy of  Sciences] Economics Division and the Reform International  Foundation have not been taken into account.    The concept of the abandonment of regulation of economic and  social processes by the state has led to the universal loss of  manageability. World experience in state regulation, especially  in countries with socially oriented market economies, has been  completely ignored. The special role of the state characteristic  of transitional stages of social development has not been taken  into account.    As a result, a vacuum of state regulation has developed,  which is being filled with increasing vigor through, on one  hand, the growth of narrow-group and regional-separatist  interests and the plain plundering of national wealth, and on  the other hand, the real and equally dangerous restoration of  authoritarianism camouflaged by pseudodemocratic slogans.    The breakdown of existing state government structures which  has far outstripped the creation of new, modern forms of  government and regulation has brought about the disruption of  vertical and horizontal economic relations and technological  interaction. Control has been lost over prices and incomes, and  the distribution and redistribution of material and financial  resources.    The results of the implementation of the monetarist policy  and the withdrawal of the state from regulating economic and  social processes as a component of this policy have indicated  the theoretical and practical unsoundness of the course chosen.    The depletion of social resources for the continuation of  "shock therapy" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of  this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the  population by a factor of more than two accompanied by a sharply  growing differentiation in incomes has aggravated the social  situation in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent  of the most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same  proportion of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10.  One-third of the population have an income below the official  subsistence minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about  15 million people, are below the threshold of physical survival.  This is a signal that society is entering a social conflict zone.    It should be stressed that this is not just about  quantitative indicators. Profound qualitative changes have  occurred in the last two years; trends have emerged which  indicate a looming threat to the genetic pool of Russian  society. The process of depopulation of the populace has begun,  with the growing death rate due to a considerable degree to  alcoholism, murder, and suicide. The population has been sharply  marginalized; the number of beggars, vagrants, alcoholics, and  drug addicts has been growing. The quality of the "human  material" is deteriorating at quite high rates (immunity against  mass diseases has been declining; prostitution, venereal  disease, and births of impaired children are on the rise).    The moral pillars of society, social values and ideals,  personal and family hopes which have always made it possible to  survive what appeared to be temporary adversity, are crumbling.  Crime is growing and becoming more arrogant; mafia groups  proliferate. Bribery, extortion, and embezzlement have become  massive and no longer cause protest or condemnation by the  government.    All the above makes it possible to say that the social price  paid by our society for "shock therapy" has exceeded the maximum  permissible limits.    The scale of the economic and social calamities that have  befallen Russia poses a real threat to its national security.  The country has ended up at a dangerous threshold, on crossing  which it may face the risk of forever losing the chance to be  reborn as a superpower.    Such is the outcome of the two years of the "shock therapy"  policy.    The most radical reformers justify in every way the  destruction and sacrifices as unavoidable costs associated with  fundamental changes in the existing political, social, and  economic system and the "return" of Russia to the ranks of  civilized countries. On the contrary, the RAN Economics Division  and the Reform International Foundation are convinced that:    --no objective, up to the promise of a new variant of "the  bright future," can justify the social sacrifices which Russian  society has made and to which it is inevitably doomed in the  event that the chosen course is continued. A different approach  is immoral and inhumane;    --the society that is actually emerging in Russia today is  far removed from the models existing in countries with highly  effective and socially oriented market economies. It amounts, to  a greater degree, to a society based on excessive  property-related stratification, corruption, organized crime,  and external dependency. From the socioeconomic standpoint, this  is not taking a step forward but rather setting the country back  two centuries, to the era of primitive, "barbaric" capitalism;    --all programs for the renewal of Russia and its  socioeconomic structure may have a chance at success only if  they take into account, along with worldwide tendencies, the  originality of Russia, the peculiarities of its history and  culture, the spiritual stance of the population, and the  requisite value system. Russia does not need to return to world  civilization--it has always belonged to it, and belongs to it  now as an irreproducible type of a structure of civilization.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   An analysis of the course of the reform and the outcome of  the socioeconomic development of Russia in the last two years  makes it possible to draw a number of conclusions.    First. A deep crisis and social calamities are not  the result of unsolved problems that had piled up in the past,  isolated miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative  forces (although all these have also occurred), but rather an  unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and  the methods used to carry it out.    Attempts to solve all problems with a "single leap" or a  "cavalry charge" were not dictated by sober scientific  calculations but rather by impatience and political ambitions.  Contrary to the assertions of its initiators, this course was  and is extremely idealized, and is being implemented by  neo-Bolshevik methods.    Second. Having experienced the failure of the  chosen course of economic policy at the very first steps of its  implementation, the originators of "shock therapy" did not learn  a lesson but continued to stubbornly insist on staying the  course. This only further exacerbated the situation and burdened  the population with new hardships.    To cover up their fiasco, the reformers who were in power  went about systematically misinforming the public and distorting  the picture of the genuine situation in the economy and the life  of the people.    Third. From the very beginning, an erroneous  orientation toward the decisive role of foreign aid was adopted,  and internal sources for stimulating business, especially  investment activities, were not put to use. It became clear  quite soon that this was a major miscalculation. Under no  circumstances can the meager amount of this continuously  promised aid seriously influence the results of transformations  in Russia. However, no major adjustments in the area of economic  policy were made after that, either.    Fourth. A claim to infallibility, to knowing the  absolute truth, has been at the root of many mistakes that have  been allowed to occur and the reluctance to change the course of  economic policy even after its complete unsoundness was  revealed. Hence the reluctance to heed criticism and the  aspiration to paint such criticism as allegedly originating from  the "enemies of reform." The notion of the absence of  alternatives to the strategy and tactics of reform  implementation chosen by the authors of "shock therapy," rather  than the reform as such, has been persistently foisted on public  opinion.    It appears strange, but it looks as though some political  leaders both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to  believe that any change in the chosen course of economic reform  means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system.  The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for  deliberately refusing to seek national accord.    Fifth. The unprofessionalism of the authors and  champions of the "shock therapy" course has now become obvious.  It is manifested in a lack of knowledge of the realities of  Russia and the mentality of the nations populating it, a choice  of reform methods which are not adequate for these conditions,  and egregious miscalculations in projecting the economic and  social consequences of the measures taken.    Society has encountered a new variety of subjective and  willful approaches to the development and implementation of  economic policy, and in the policy itself--clearly expressed  ideological attachments.    During the entire period the government has evaded a  discussion of the fundamental problems of socioeconomic policy  with leading Russian economic scientists and representatives of  progressive parties, movements, and public organizations.    The "shock therapy" course has always been criticized in a  sharp and well-argued manner. However, we must honestly admit  that for a long time this course enjoyed quite extensive support  from the population, which attached their hopes and expectations  to it.    However, a qualitative turnaround in public mood occurred at  the end of 1993. In the December elections, people resolutely  came out against experiments associated with "shock therapy."  Only 8 percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's  Choice bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and  champions of this course. To continue this course in the future  means to act against the clearly stated will of the people.    What could such attempts bring about? On one hand, they  could  bring about the further exacerbation of the economic crisis and  the worsening of social tensions in society. On the other hand,  nostalgia for "the good old times" and the restorationist mood,  which are quite dangerous for reforms in the Russian economy,  will mount.    The RAN Economics Division and the Reform International  Foundation believe that, in the name of rejuvenating Russia as a  superpower, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the past  two years critically and honestly and to work out a new strategy  for socioeconomic transformations.</p>

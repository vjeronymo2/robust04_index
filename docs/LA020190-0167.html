			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SHOE: REFLECTIONS ON A LEGEND;  </P> <P> OUT OF THE SADDLE BUT NOT OUT OF FRIENDS  </P> <P> What other jockeys say about Bill Shoemaker:  </P> <P> CHRIS McCARRON  </P> <P> "Everybody that has had the opportunity to ride with him for any length of time  is very lucky. He does some unbelievable things on a horse. The thing that  sticks out is how little he does on a horse and how much response he gets. He  sure can convince a rider who is more aggressive that a great deal of finesse  can win races, too.  </P> <P> "I was always impressed with the way he dealt with the public and the media.  The guy's always being bugged for interviews and always granting them and he's  always being asked for autographs and always giving them. He never tells  anybody to take a hike. Out and out, he's just a great asset for the sport.  </P> <P> "He's had to take an awful lot of grief and verbal abuse during various periods  of his career, but he's handled it with flying colors. It's taken an awful lot  of patience and self-control. I've learned a great deal from watching him. I  think he's going to do well as a trainer and I hope I can ride for him."  </P> <P> GARY STEVENS  </P> <P> "He's the kind of guy who could very easily be my dad. He's a super person. He  probably knows more than any jockey will ever know. In fact, he's probably  forgotten more than any jockey will ever know.  </P> <P> "His mental outlook is amazing. He's always the same, day in, day out, win or  lose. He's pretty happy-go-lucky and always on an even keel. I think he's going  to be a very successful trainer."  </P> <P> EDDIE DELAHOUSSAYE  </P> <P> "I don't think you'll get anyone to say a negative thing about Bill. He's a  great person and a gentleman wherever he goes. You couldn't ask for a nicer  fellow.  </P> <P> "He's always had a good attitude about everything and I don't think you'll ever  see another one like him. He was talented, smart and aggressive. He had good  hands, a good head and a tremendous feel for a horse. I've learned a lot  watching him the last 11 years. He's a remarkable man."  </P> <P> FERNANDO TORO  </P> <P> "Shoe's always been my idol and he still is. Before I left Chile and came to  the United States, I used to dream about riding next to him. When I was in  Florida in 1966, I was able to beat him in a race. I was so excited I ordered a  whole bunch of pictures and sent them back home.  </P> <P> "He's one of the greatest -- not just as a rider but as a person. The days he's  not going, in the (jockey's) room something's missing. It's going to be  different not having him around. He never changed and he never complained. He  had a great attitude and that made him a champion."  </P> <P> COREY BLACK  </P> <P> "He's a nice person and he definitely set the tone in the jockey's room. He  kept peace among the riders a lot of the time and the camaraderie we have now  is reflective of him and is the way it's supposed to be. He's a phenomenon."  </P> <P> ROBBIE DAVIS  </P> <P> "The first time I met Bill was when he came to New York and rode in the  Suburban Handicap. He came into the room and was right in my corner with the  same valet and I was thrilled to death.  </P> <P> "He had on sneakers, a pair of blue jeans and a Levi's jacket and I didn't know  for sure if it was him or not. From all you read about him, he was a living  legend, and, here he was, so down to earth. I'd never met him before, but he  shook my hand and said, 'Hi, Robbie, how you doing?' I thought, 'Wow! He even  knew my name.  </P> <P> "He was a super rider and I wish I could have ridden with him a little more.  Maybe I'll get to ride for him."  </P> <P> PAT VALENZUELA  </P> <P> "I've learned so much watching and talking to Bill. The way he could get horses  to relax, he was just a master. He was a master of riding and of life. He was a  super person, always so positive. He didn't let anything bother him and always  seemed like he was happy to be here. He's always been my idol and always will  be. Just watching him ride is an honor."  </P> <P> RAY SIBILLE  </P> <P> "He never lost his composure and stayed on an even keel all the time. His hands  were incredible and he had tremendous confidence. . . . If horses didn't win  for him, they couldn't win.  </P> <P> "You couldn't find a better guy. He could be with the President of the United  States, and if he saw you, he'll always say hello."  </P> <P> LAFFIT PINCAY  </P> <P> "All the riders respect him and that's the most important thing. He'll always  be remembered for his greatness and the way he conducted himself all through  his career."  </P></p>

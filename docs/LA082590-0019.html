			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SUDDENLY, DAVIS CAN SEE ENOUGH TO LEAD REDS  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Reds have waited all season for Eric Davis, their best hitter,  to start producing.  </P> <P> Just when it appeared he never would, the team decided to test his eyesight.  All it took to straighten out Davis was contact lenses.  </P> <P> In his third game with his new "batting" aid, Davis went four for four,  including a home run, and scored all the runs in the Reds' 4-3 victory over the  Pittsburgh Pirates Friday night at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Davis jumped on Pirate ace Doug Drabek. His 17th home run broke a 2-2 tie in  the sixth inning. The Pirates pulled even again on Jose Lind's single in the  seventh.  </P> <P> Davis, who went into the game batting .188 against the Pirates this season,  singled with one out in the eighth inning and scored on Paul O'Neill's double  to left-center.  </P> <P> The Reds, swept by Pittsburgh last week in Cincinnati, had lost five in a row  to the leaders of the National League East.  </P> <P> Before the eye test, which may be of considerable significance as the Reds try  to hold off the rest of the West, Davis, a lifetime .275 hitter, was batting  only .223. He had hit 15 home runs in 93 games.  </P> <P> With contact lenses, he has hit two home runs in three games.  </P> <P> "He's starting to swing the bat and that's what we need," Manager Lou Piniella  said of Davis. "He had a big night."  </P> <P> Drabek, who beat the Reds on Sunday, said he pitched Davis the same way.  </P> <P> "I'm just seeing the ball better," Davis said. "I was hitting the ball with  authority Thursday night. I just didn't have anything to show for it.  </P> <P> "It still makes you feel good, even if the knees aren't well. It's a lot better  than punching out four times. I feel more comfortable up there. I believe I'm  ready to help this team win the division."  </P> <P> Although he gave up the tying run, Ron Dibble pitched 2 1/3 innings for the  victory. Randy Myers pitched the last 1 2/3 innings to get his 25th save. He  struck out the last two batters with Barry Bonds on second.  </P> <P> San Francisco 13, Philadelphia 2 -- Kevin Mitchell's three-run double  highlighted an eight-run second inning as the Giants won at San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Giants pounded Phillies' starter Pat Combs (6-9), who had allowed only  seven earned runs in his previous five starts, for all eight runs in the  second.  </P> <P> Matt Williams walked, Gary Carter singled and Robby Thompson walked to load the  bases. Greg Litton singled to center for a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Pitcher Mike LaCoss reached safely when Combs fielded his bunt and threw late  trying to force Thompson at third, re-loading the bases. Brett Butler's  sacrifice fly scored Thompson and Dave Anderson's infield single scored Litton  for a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> After Will Clark's single reloaded the bases, Mitchell's double into the left  scored all three runners for a 7-0 lead. Williams' RBI single closed out the  inning as Combs saw his ERA jump from 3.75 to 4.28.  </P> <P> LaCoss (4-2) allowed nine hits in seven innings as he won for the first time  since April 21. It was his third start after spending 3 1/2 months on the  disabled list after knee surgery. He walked three and struck out four.  </P> <P> Atlanta 3, Chicago 0 -- Steve Avery, a 6-foot-4 left-hander, became the  youngest Brave to throw a shutout. Avery, 20, gave up six hits, struck out  eight and walked two at Atlanta to improve his record to 3-7.  </P> <P> "The difference between this game and my other games is that I had command of  my pitches," Avery said. "I was trying to move them in and out."  </P> <P> Manager Bobby Cox was ecstatic. "When you have a 20-year-old who changes  pitches like that, you've got something," Cox said. "He's going to be a lot of  fun for a lot of years. I wouldn't be surprised if he threw five more shutouts  in a row."  </P> <P> Greg Maddux (11-11), who is 5-2 lifetime against the Braves, pitched his sixth  complete game. He became the loser in the first inning when his balk moved  Oddibe McDowell to second and he scored on Tommy Gregg's single.  </P> <P> San Diego 2, Montreal 1 -- Andy Benes was a No. 1 draft selection by the Padres  in 1988. At that time he had a terrific fastball.  </P> <P> Tendinitis in his right elbow has taken some of the speed. Slowly, though,  Benes, 23, is learning to win without it.  </P> <P> In winning his third game in a row and improving his record to 10-8, Benes,  although he struck out only two, gave up three hits in 6 1/3 innings at  Montreal.  </P> <P> "Right now, his fastball doesn't have the zip it once had," Manager Greg  Riddoch said. "He's having to learn to pitch and he's doing that."  </P> <P> Stolen bases by Bip Roberts and Roberto Alomar set up the Padres' two runs off  Dennis Martinez (10-9).  </P> <P> The Expos scored on Tim Raines' seventh home run in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, Houston 2 -- Vince Coleman stole his 72nd base, but his single in  the 11th inning at Houston gave the Cardinals the victory.  </P> <P> Tom Pagnozzi opened the inning with a single and, when left fielder Mark  Davidson misplayed the ball, went on to second.  </P> <P> Pinch-runner Dave Collins was sacrificed to third and Coleman lined the single  to beat Dave Smith (4-5).  </P> <P> Coleman has stolen 13 bases in the last nine games. He needs 28 in 37 games to  reach 100. He has hit safely in nine games in a row. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

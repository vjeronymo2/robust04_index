			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- After a break on 11 May, the work of  the Crimean Supreme Council's session continued. Following  consultations with deputies' groups, Crimean Parliamentary  Speaker Serhiy Tsekov proposed that the candidacies of Oleksiy  Melnykov and Viktor Mezhak for the posts of Supreme Council  deputy chairmen be voted on for the second time. As a result of  the vote, Oleksiy Melnykov and Viktor Mezhak became Republic of  Crimea Supreme Council deputy chairmen.    Oleksiy Melnykov was born in Moscow and served in the  Pacific  Fleet and since 1986 in the Black Sea Fleet. He swore  allegiance to the Armed Forces of the USSR and intends to swear  no allegiance to anyone else. He was against Black Sea Fleet  sailors taking an oath of allegiance to the people of Ukraine.  In his words, there is no Black Sea Fleet problem as it was and  is Russian.    Viktor Mezhak was born in Crimea. His profession is building  engineer. He was elected as deputy of the City of Simferopol  and Crimean Oblast Councils of People's Deputies in 1990. He is  an activist of the Republican Movement of Crimea. He assumed  the leadership of the People's Party of Crimea in the fall of  1993.    Both deputy speakers represent the Russia bloc, as does the  speaker, Serhiy Tsekov.    Fears of "the Crimean president getting a `puppet'  parliament," expressed by Refat Chubarov, the leader of the  [Crimean Tartar people's] Kurultay deputies' group, are, in the  opinion of observers, proving true.    Parliamentary deputies then went on to address the question  of elections to permanent commissions. Voting resulted in the  finalization of their number. [There will be] 11 of them. [They  are the commissions for] credentials, deputies' ethics, and  Supreme Council work organization; legislation, legality and  order; state construction; economic policy, and budget and  financial matters; agrarian matters and food supply; ecology and  land matters; social matters and health protection; military  matters; education, science, culture and youth matters; mass  media and public relations; and deportees' matters.    Tsekov said at the parliamentary sitting that it was  possible  the third Supreme Council deputy chairman would be elected in a  while.    It has become known from sources close to government circles  that a Crimean Government delegation, to be led by Deputy Prime  Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, on 12 May is to fly to Moscow in  order to sign an agreement on economic cooperation between the  Republic of Crimea and Russia.</p>

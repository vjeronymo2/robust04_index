			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE MAY RACE IN MUD  </P> <P> Sunday Silence will try to end a 10-year drought of Triple Crown winners on a  track at Belmont Saturday that might be wet from several days of rain.  </P> <P> The forecast was for rain and thunderstorms to taper off by midnight tonight. A  chance of a shower and temperatures between 75 and 80 were predicted for  Saturday.  </P> <P> "If it stops by early morning, it would be a fast track by race time," Shug  McGaughey, who trains Easy Goer, said.  </P> <P> Post time for the 121st Belmont Stakes is about 2:30 p.m. PDT.  </P> <P> Easy Goer didn't like the mud at Churchill Downs when he finished second in the  Kentucky Derby, beaten by 2 1/2 lengths. Sunday Silence's winning margin over  Easy Goer was a nose on a fast track in the 1 3/16-mile Preakness.  </P></p>

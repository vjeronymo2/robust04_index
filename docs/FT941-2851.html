			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Learmonth &amp; Burchett's shares fall on warning Shares in Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Sys-tems, the USM-quoted computing services company, fell by 31 per cent from 140p to 96p on a warning that profits for the year to April 30 were likely to be well below expectations. The company also said it was unlikely to pay a final dividend. At the halfway stage, Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, had indicated pre-tax profits for the full year of about Pounds 1.8m. The source of the company's problems is poor trading in the UK, where customers have been slow to finalise orders. Mr Neil Davies, chief financial officer, said that full-year losses before tax of up to Pounds 1m could be expected if two or three of the company's larger customers failed to complete purchases. The company said that a reorganisation had been put in place, including the resignation in December of the director responsible for operations and a reduction of Pounds 2m in operating costs, but improved results from the UK business could not be expected before next year. At the halfway stage the shares lost a quarter of their value when the company reported pre-tax profits of only Pounds 210,000, 73 per cent lower than the Pounds 753,000 recorded the previous year. Turnover for the half year was Pounds 13.1m. LBMS develops large scale and expensive computer software which makes it easier for computer specialists to write programmes. The company now derives more than half its turnover from the US, where LBMS is growing at an average of 50 per cent a year.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Council tax valuations are issued IMPLEMENTATION of the council tax came a step closer yesterday with the release to councils of draft property valuations which will form the basis for government decisions about how much people will pay under the new system. More homes were in the lower bands of the eight-band system than expected, the Department of the Environment said. But officials denied this would inevitably mean higher bills for people in low-cost homes because the total number of properties was higher than expected. They emphasised that it would be impossible to estimate the size of next year's council-tax bills until the government had decided the scale and distribution of government grant and the transitional relief scheme. Figures produced by the department last year were based on 21m properties in Great Britain, but the draft valuations suggested that the total would be about 22m. Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, blamed falling house prices in the recession for pushing homes into lower bands, and warned that this would make the tax even more regressive, leaving those in the lower bands to pay proportionately larger amounts. Officials need the valuation figures, which enable estimates to be made of the tax base in each area, to prepare detailed proposals for ministers to consider. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has already made clear that he intends to use the increasingly strict regime for capping, or limiting, local authorities' budgets to prevent bills rising too steeply. In July he rejected outright the bid by the local authorities for Pounds 45.5bn total spending next year. Ministers face a sensitive choice in deciding how to divide the money available between grant - which would curtail the rises in the tax levels set by councils and affect how the new tax is perceived - and a transitional relief scheme, which would limit the real increase faced by any one household. Ministers have signalled that they do not feel obliged to meet the estimate of an average Pounds 400 bill for a band-D property (worth Pounds 68,000-Pounds 88,000 at April 1991) made last year. Some officials now predict that the average bill for a property in band D could be about Pounds 550.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Banks cut rates on savings more than mortgages MIDLAND Bank and Firstdirect, its telephone banking arm, have cut their savings rates by more than their mortgage rates following this week's 1-point base rate cut. Along with Lloyds Bank, both have also not passed on the full base-rate reduction to mortgage holders. The savings rate cuts are the first to be be announced by leading financial institutions since Tuesday's base rate change. Building societies have not yet announced new savings rates but have said they did not pass on the full 1-point cut to mortgage holders in order to protect savers. The new base rate is 6 per cent. Midland and Lloyds have set a mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent. This represents a drop of 0.56 of a point for Midland and of 0.61 of a point for Lloyds. Firstdirect has cut its rate by 0.54 of a point to 7.95 per cent. 'Our mortgage book was running at a loss when base rates were 15 per cent,' said Mr Brendan Le Morvan of Midland. 'Since then we have tried to restore the margins.' Its mortgage margin has widened from 0.4 point to 1.99 points. Midland is reducing almost all gross savings rates by 1 point, with a handful going down by 0.75 of a point and one by 1.25 points. At Lloyds, savings rates are being cut between 0.5 of a point and 1 point. Midland and Lloyds also announced a reduction in credit card and overdraft rates. The annual percentage rate on Midland's credit cards will drop to 23.1 per cent from 25.3 per cent from March 2. From Monday, rates will fall by 1.3 to 1.4 points for overdrafts.

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Saudi Arabian tanker caught in a storm in the southern Persian Gulf was left  ablaze in the Strait of Hormuz with eight of its crewmen missing, shipping  executives reported. They identified the vessel as the 36,904-ton Sagheera,  manned by a 34-member crew of Greek officers and Sri Lankan sailors. The Omani  navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats but eight remained unaccounted for,  the shipping officials said. It was not immediately known what started the fire  aboard the Sagheera or where the ship was headed. The storm was said to have  caused waves as high as 30 feet in the southern gulf and in the strait.  </P></p>

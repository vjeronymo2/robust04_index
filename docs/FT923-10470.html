			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Tokyo anxious as market falls to a fresh low THE Japanese government watched nervously yesterday as the Tokyo stock market average neared the 15,000 level, once viewed in Japan as the lower limit for a stock price fall that began two and half years ago. Finance ministry officials said there was 'nothing' it could do to prop up stock prices. The 'market must decide' whether the Nikkei average is to continue its fall. Yesterday, the Nikkei lost 330.69 to close at 15,095.99, the lowest level since April 1986. Early today, initial trading moved the index up slightly by some 150 points. The continuing lack of confidence prompted Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to call on ministries to speed preparations for a supplementary budget due next month. However, the Finance Ministry, responsible for the budget, said this would be difficult. The extent of the budget is still unclear, though estimates have ranged from Y5,000bn (Pounds 20bn) to Y8,000bn (Pounds 32.5bn). Most of the money will be used for infrastructure projects. The ministry also rejected a suggestion by Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister, that government organisations purchase land to bolster a still weakening property market. The government's main concern is the stock market, which failed to draw encouragement from a cut in official interest rates on Monday or a convincing performance by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Upper House elections on Sunday. Brokers said many feared the Nikkei average would drop sharply once the 15,000 level was passed, but financial institutions appeared to enter the market yesterday to try to keep it above that mark.

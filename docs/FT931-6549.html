			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Snow Orchid - Theatre Is it because of the greater influence of psychoanalysis there that the United States in this century has developed so much stronger a tradition of serious drama set in the family home than we have ever had in Britain? Joseph Pintauro's Snow Orchid presents an Italian-American family nucleus of mother, father, and two sons, and illumines the traumatic psychological damage effected by spouses/parents upon each other and their children. Every scene but the last occurs inside the family's tight little apartment. The only intruder is the elder son's boyfriend; and he doesn't stay long. Though Snow Orchid is sometimes funny and does not actually ring true at every moment, you can't miss how it addresses family matters in a psychologically serious way that our theatre has avoided. At the Gate, where it is having its British premiere performances, its intensity has terrific force. Rob Howell's designs turn the tiny space into the apartment's several rooms with wonderful detail; Tim Luscombe's direction has produced a kind of Italian-American detailed conviction of playing rare in our theatre. Snow Orchid is in no way radical today - it was probably not radical when written in 1979 - but over here it is still a shot in the arm, simply because of the nature of its realism. The painful recriminations between husband and wife, between father and elder son, between mother and younger son, and the wealth of detail that each such scene drags up: all is marvellously persuasive, even cathartic. The play's final scene is the wrong kind of catharsis - a touch of optimism that arrives too neatly, though staged at the Gate with a surprise scene change that is something of a coup de theatre. Details are thrown away too lightly, such as the father's admission that he not only never loved his wife, he never loved anyone - puzzling, since he demonstrates love for both sons. And, though it is presented here by the London Gay Theatre Company, its handling of gayness and gay issues is not its most central concern or successful achievement. Snow Orchid is ultimately about the claustrophobia of family life. The linchpin of the Gate staging is Paola Dionisotti as Filumena. Her Italian accent is flawless, even in its incipient Americanisms; and the aggressive fury that has always made her remarkable is given a fresh spark by enacting a Mediterranean temperament. Here, as in Vassa Zheleznova (same theatre, 1990), she is playing a minor latterday Clytemnestra; how about reviving Mourning becomes Electra for her? As her husband and two sons, Roger Lloyd Pack, Adam Magnani and Jude Law are excellent. The playing sags only twice; first, after the climax of Sebbie's tremendous bathroom scene with his father; second, in Blaise's too mild reproaches to his mother. These are brief lapses in a performance that holds its audience gripped from first to last. Gate Theatre, London W11, until March 27 (071 229 0706)</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon [18 April], the provincial  leading group for two-support work held its seventh plenary  meeting, at which it was stressed that it is necessary to offer  ever better leadership to the two-support work, continuously  strengthen the unity between the Army and the government and  between the Army and the people, and promote our province's  social stability and the development of its economic  construction.    In attendance at the meeting were Ruan Chongwu, secretary of  the provincial party committee, governor, and director of the  provincial leading group for two-support work;, Chen Suhou, vice  governor and deputy director of the leading group;, Zhou  Chuantong, political commissar of the Hainan Provincial Military  District and deputy director of the leading group; and Wu  Fenglong, deputy political commissar of the military district  and deputy director of the leading group.    As for two-support work in 1994, the meeting discussed such  issues as further enhancing understanding and offering better  leadership to two-support work, holding a meeting to name  provincial-level model cities and counties in two-support work,  and recommending national-level model cities and counties in  two-support work. The meeting stressed that party committees  and governments at all levels must attach importance to  two-support work from the heights of safeguarding political and  social stability, and must place it on the agenda. They must  genuinely ensure that they will take up the work personally,  personally solve difficult problems with the work, personally  examine and approve documents concerning the work, and try their  best to attend major activities involving Army and local  concerns. They must give wider publicity to the work and do a  good job in propaganda and education in the work using multiple  forms and channels. The meeting pointed out that this year's  two-support work must face the grass-roots units, lay stress on  practical results, open up more fields of endeavor, and enrich  the contents of the work so that it will become  institutionalized, standardized, and socialized.    Ruan Chongwu spoke at the meeting. He affirmed the  achievements scored last year in such areas of the province's  two-support work such as the Army, the police, and the people  taking an active part in joint defense, safeguarding social  stability, protecting military facilities, and rectifying  traffic order. He hoped that in the days to come, a good job in  the work regarding these aspects would continue to be done, that  practical results would be stressed, that more solid work would  be done, and that the province's two-support work would be  carried out in a down-to-earth manner.    In the course of its discussions, the meeting adopted  suggestions for Hainan Province's implementation of management  methods for naming model two-support cities and counties, and  for setting out the Hainan Province's standards for model  cities, counties, and districts in supporting the Army and  giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, as well  as supporting the government and cherishing the people. It also  held a by-election for a deputy director and a member of the  provincial leading group for two- support work.    The person in charge of the two-support work office reported  to the meeting on the spirit of the national work meeting of  two- support work office directors at the provincial level.</p>

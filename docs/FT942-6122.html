			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The battle for dividends Despite a widespread assumption to the contrary, Tory governments are not invariably on the side of big dividends. In the early 1970s, the Heath administration shocked the City by capping payments to shareholders while imposing a pay freeze. In a recent speech, the financial secretary to the Treasury, Mr Stephen Dorrell, made it clear that the present government would not repeat the mistake of intervening directly in fixing dividend levels. But he suggested that companies appeared to be over-distributing - a view shared by Labour - and that this could have an adverse impact on investment. The government's case has been vigorously attacked by fund managers, including Mr Paddy Linaker, managing director of the M &amp; G Group, in these pages. His views are widely shared by other institutions including the pension funds, which have been caught on a particularly raw nerve. The average British pension fund is now mature, with pensions being paid out of investment income rather than new cash flow from contributions. Pension fund managers are thus more sensitive to changes in investment income. And they have been stung by the reduction in tax relief on dividends introduced by former chancellor Mr Norman Lamont, who failed to see that taxing pension funds simply forces companies to raise pension contributions. In economic theory, investors should be indifferent to whether profits are distributed or reinvested. But statistical research by investment bankers BZW has shown that since 1918 two-thirds of the total UK equity return has come from income rather than capital. There is thus a natural tendency for British fund managers to pay particular attention to dividends. And since the growth of tax-exempt institutions has introduced a bias towards distribution into the corporation tax system, it is not surprising if dividend cover is on the low side by international standards. Reluctant buyers For pension funds approaching maturity the obvious step should be to increase holdings of gilt-edged. Yet British fund managers' memory of the destruction of fixed-interest values is too recent to make them other than reluctant buyers. Small wonder that they now want the equivalent of the commercial property landlord's upward-only rent review in equities. The question is whether this attempt to turn equity into a more stable, low-risk investment makes sense for companies and the wider financial system. Artificial boost There is anecdotal evidence that the recent reduction in dividend cover to historically low levels is partly a hangover from the 1980s contested takeover boom. Industrialists have no wish to alienate investors who may be the arbiters of their fate in a future bid battle. Yet some argue that a fall in dividend cover is appropriate in today's low-inflation environment, since historic cost accounting no longer provides such a big artificial boost to reported profits. And while research by academics at the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that the level of retentions does affect investment spending for a significant proportion of companies, the historical correlation between high payouts and high investment by industrial and commercial companies remains striking. CBI surveys suggest that industrialists are far more worried about inadequate returns on investment than shortage of finance. That, in turn, reinforces the suspicion that companies have been slow to reduce hurdle rates of return and payback periods in response to disinflation. This leads to two mutually contradictory possibilities. Either companies are reluctant to invest because they believe that inflation is set to rise again, in which case their hurdle rates of return are right and dividend cover is too thin on a historic cost basis. Or the constraint on investment that Mr Dorrell fears has nothing to do with low dividend cover and everything to do with management's failure to adjust hurdle rates to disinflation. The way to resolve this dilemma is not for the government to tinker with the tax system on the basis of inconclusive data. Time and market forces will anyway help bring about an adjustment. For their part, industrialists should recognise the legitimate income needs of the institutions, but be robust in defending their cash flow when prudence requires.</p>

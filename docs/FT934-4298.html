			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's hairshirt Masochism has been designated the English vice. Rightly so, it appears from the ecstatic reaction accorded to the second of two tough budgets in one year. Lashed by Mr Clarke, the financial markets, the pundits and Tory backbenchers have gone into paroxysms of delight. The joy of the gilts markets is understandable. Nothing is better designed to bring a smile to the lips of the nervous investor in long-term fixed income securities than the spectacle of depression in the economy and austerity in the budget. Austerity is what Messrs Lamont and Clarke have delivered. In 1996-97, taxes are to be Pounds 17bn (2.2 per cent of gross domestic product) higher than they would have been without the 1993 budgets. That is what the two chancellors would have obtained if they had raised the basic rate of tax to 34p in the pound. Meanwhile spending has been cut by Pounds 3bn (0.4 per cent of GDP) in 1996-97, over and above already tough plans. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies promptly pointed out, the government intends to allow non-cyclical public spending to rise by less than 4 per cent in real terms between 1992-93 and 1998-99, a third as fast as in the recovery phase of the last cycle under Mrs Thatcher. With Pounds 7bn of underfunding promised as well, it is hardly surprising that the redemption yield on a medium-term bond fell from 6.68 per cent on Monday to 6.46 per cent yesterday evening. This comes on top of an extended bull run, during which the yield has fallen from a peak of 12.7 per cent in April 1990. Optimism about inflation is understandable, but what about the soaring equity market? The FT-A 500 Index has gained 2.6 per cent since Monday night. Why should budgetary austerity deliver this, especially when the price-earnings ratio is already barely short of where it was before the October 1987 crash? Conventional wisdom is that low interest rates, particularly low short-term rates, have driven up prices of alternative investments, be they bonds or equities, because investors have nowhere else to put their money. If current equity valuations are to endure, however, investors must be right to believe in the government's rhetoric about the feasibility of sustained growth with low inflation. Triumph of hope This is the triumph of hope over repeated disappointment. But it is indeed what the chancellor is promising. Growth of real GDP is, says the Red Book, to accelerate smoothly from 2 1/4 per cent in 1994-95 to 3 per cent by 1996-97. Meanwhile, underlying retail price inflation is to fall from 3 1/4 per cent next year to 2 1/2 per cent in 1996-97 and 2 per cent thereafter. It looks too wonderful to be true. It is not that wonderful, since what is to deliver this happy combination of growth with falling inflation is persistent excess capacity. Unemployment is, for example, assumed to remain at 2.75m until 1996-97. But, given the relatively depressed starting point and the fiscal action that has now been taken, the forecast looks at the least feasible. Cost competitiveness, allowing for exchange rate changes, was 'probably 20 per cent better in the third quarter of 1993 than a year earlier and is forecast to remain at close to that level during 1994', says the Red Book. The current account deficit is now forecast, on imperfect figures, at only Pounds 9 1/2 bn (1 1/2 per cent of GDP) in 1993 and the same in 1994. If right, this suggests the first of the twin deficits is not going to be the problem some have feared, or at least not soon. As for the second of the twins, the fiscal deficit, that too now looks under control. Sadistic policies The interesting question is not whether markets are right to believe in the logic of the masochistic fiscal policy, but rather whether they should trust in the durability of its sadistic politics. One issue is whether the government can get away with freezing the public sector's wage bill in nominal terms for a period of three years. Earnings in the economy are bound to rise by about 10 per cent or so over the period. If earnings in the public sector were to rise pari passu, employment in the public sector would have to fall by half a million, which looks neither feasible, nor desirable. The policy would only be sustainable, without an explosion, if inflation were to fall even faster than forecast. This suggests slow declines in short-term interest rates. But this also means there would be the risk of only a gentle recovery and, given the fiscal squeeze, very slow rises indeed in real personal disposable incomes after tax for those in work. The Red Book says real personal disposable income could rise 1 per cent in 1994, the same as in 1993. It is unlikely to rise any more than that, on the government's forecasts, for many years thereafter. With the public sector possibly in turmoil and most voters not becoming noticeably better off during the recovery, it will take a great deal of nerve for the government to persist. Maybe Mr Clarke has the guts for the task. But does his party? Once markets begin to question the politics, for how long will they find Mr Clarke's hairshirt economics so delightful?</p>

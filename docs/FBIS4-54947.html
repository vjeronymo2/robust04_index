			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] believes that her party can improve its election results  if it forms a coalition with the other two conservative parties  and they renounce their votes in favor of the MDF. Speaking on  television's "Sunrise" [Napkelte] program, Krisztina Dobos said  they are now beginning to hold talks about this with the  Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. [FKGP Chairman] Jozsef  Torgyan does not consider such an agreement to be impossible.  According to the Smallholder chairman, as a matter of fact,  differences so far have been between the party leaderships not  the membership.    Bela Csepe, outgoing leader of the Christian Democrats  parliamentary group, said that if necessary the Christian  Democrats will step back in favor of the MDF.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / DTI ends electrical companies'cartel at exhibitions Department of Trade and Industry officials moved yesterday to end a monopoly enjoyed by five electrical companies which supply London exhibition halls. The decision, taken after a long delay by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister at the DTI, implements a recommendation first made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in a report in 1990. The MMC found that five electrical companies - Ecando Systems, Business Design Centre, Lightpower Exhibitions, S. Seymour (Electrics) and Johnson Smith and Company - were operating a complex monopoly which inhibited individual exhibitors from having any say in buying electrical services. The report concluded there was a direct tie between these electrical contractors and individual hall owners, including Earls Court, Olympia, Wembley, Novotel Hotels and the Barbican. These links were against the public interest, the MMC found, because, among other things, the payment of commission to hall owners and/or exhibition organisers distorted competition between electrical contractors. According to the 1990 report the five contractors had around three-quarters of the market for exhibition halls in London which in 1988 was worth Pounds 8.3m. The DTI yesterday said procedural difficulties accounted for the delay in implementing the MMC's report. A spokesman said it was only in March 1993 that Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, was invited by the DTI to negotiate voluntary undertakings from the five companies. But, undertakings to stop monopolistic practices have apparently been unforthcoming - forcing yesterday's DTI order. The order will: Make it unlawful for a hall owner to place limitations on the electrical contractors who may provide contracting services in their hall other than on objective safety grounds; Prohibit the payment of commission by any electrical contractor to a hall owner. In the case of exhibitions where an organiser and electrical contractor are part of the same corporate group as the hall owner, the order also prohibits the nomination of any person as an electrical contractor, unless the contractor has been selected by a competitive process as offering the lowest scheduled prices. Ms Caroline Moore, spokeswoman for P&amp;O Exhibition Services - the new name for Ecando Systems - said in response to the order: 'I cannot comment until we have a chance to study the minister's statement.' The conference business in London is worth about Pounds 250m.</p>

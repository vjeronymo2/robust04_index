			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: SELLERS SHOULD HONOR CONTRACT WITH FINE PRINT THEY  FAILED TO READ  </P> <P> QUESTION: We listed our home for sale with an excellent real estate agent who  put our home into the local multiple listing system. While our agent was on  vacation, an agent from another brokerage office obtained an offer to buy our  house. It was a full price, all-cash offer so we were very pleased.  </P> <P> I guess we were a little excited and we didn't read the fine print in the  offer. It says we, the sellers, are to pay the buyer's closing costs, including  loan fee. When our agent got back from vacation she was livid with rage at the  other agent who failed to explain to us that the closing costs, in addition to  the sales commission, will be about $6,500, which we weren't expecting to pay.  Must we honor this contract we didn't fully understand?  </P> <P> ANSWER: If it had been a mutual mistake by both parties to the contract,  contract law would allow you to rescind the agreement. However, it appears this  was a unilateral mistake by just you and not by the buyer. Under contract law,  a unilateral mistake is usually not grounds to cancel a contract unless the  other party knew or should have known about the mistake.  </P> <P> Although most real estate agents go over the details of a sales contract with  the sellers and buyers, it is not a requirement that every detail be explained.  If your agent had been present, she surely would have pointed out the unusual  clause asking you to pay all the buyer's closing costs.  </P> <P> But considering that you will be selling your home for the full asking price  and will receive all-cash without having to carry back any mortgage financing  for the buyer, if I were in your situation, I would go ahead with the sale.  </P> <P> If you try to back out, the buyer might sue you for specific performance of the  sales contract and tie up your home by recording a lis pendens, (which means  anyone buying the home takes it subject to the litigation results) to  effectively prevent you from selling it. Next time, read the fine print before  signing a contract.  </P> <P> Why Co-op Apartment Is Difficult to Sell  </P> <P> Q: I recently inherited a cooperative apartment in San Francisco from my late  aunt. I talked with several realty agents there and they tell me it can be very  difficult to sell a cooperative apartment, except at a much lower price than a  comparable condominium.  </P> <P> These agents tell me it is virtually impossible to finance a co-op apartment  sale unless I am willing to help finance it for the buyer because few banks  will make loans on co-ops. If this is true, what should I do?  </P> <P> A: The real estate agents gave you accurate information about cooperative  apartments. Because of the lack of financing, except in New York City and a few  other areas with large numbers of co-ops, many cooperatives have converted into  condominiums which can be financed with mortgages like single-family houses. To  sell your co-op you will probably have to finance the buyer's purchase.  </P> <P> Most cooperatives have one large mortgage on the entire building. As the  mortgage gets paid down, each owner's equity grows. The larger the equity, the  more difficult it can be to sell a co-op apartment because few prospective  buyers have enough cash to buy out the seller's entire equity. Since most banks  and S&amp;Ls won't loan on co-ops, the most practical alternative is for the  seller to finance the sale, secured by the co-op stock.  </P> <P> Another major drawback of co-ops is prospective buyers must be approved by the  board of directors. They can be very difficult and need not give any reason for  rejecting an applicant. Perhaps you recall a few years ago ex-President Nixon  was rejected when he applied to buy a New York City co-op.  </P> <P> Potential Pitfalls of a Land Contract  </P> <P> Q: Nineteen years ago we signed a land contract to buy our home and have been  faithfully making monthly payments to the bank which collects the payments for  the seller. Since we only have a few payments left, I stopped by the bank to  check on the exact balance owed and to find out how we will get the deed to our  house.  </P> <P> The collection officer said our monthly payments have been deposited to a  seller's savings account at the bank. He said the bank does not know the  whereabouts of our seller since her mail from the bank has been returned for  the last four years and there haven't been any withdrawals from the savings  account in over six years. How will we get the deed to our home when we make  our final payment?  </P> <P> A: Your situation is not unusual. Many property buyers faithfully make their  land contract payments, only to learn the seller is unable to deliver  marketable title.  </P> <P> For readers not familiar with land contracts, they also are called contracts  for deed, contracts of sale, agreements for deed, installment land sale  contracts and various other names in different states.  </P> <P> The idea is the seller retains the title until the buyer makes all or an agreed  number of payments. This method is often used when the buyer has little or no  cash for a down payment.  </P> <P> After you make your final land contract payment, if the bank which has been  collecting the payments is still unable to locate the seller, your legal  alternative is to bring a quiet-title lawsuit.  </P> <P> The seller can be served by publication of a notice in a local legal newspaper.  At the hearing the court can order title quieted in your name and the court  will issue a deed to you. Please consult a real estate attorney for details.  </P> <P> What Costs Can Home Seller Anticipate?  </P> <P> Q: We are selling our home without a real estate agent to a relative. Our  attorney will be handling the closing. Please give us a list of the sales costs  we can expect.  </P> <P> A: The major closing costs you may encounter include mortgage loan payoff  (unless the buyer assumes your existing mortgage), mortgage prepayment penalty,  legal or escrow fees. (By custom, in some communities these costs are split  between buyer and seller or paid by the buyer. Who pays these charges is  negotiable.)  </P> <P> Also, transfer tax, property tax and utility pro-rations, loan points if the  buyer is getting a new VA mortgage, title insurance fee (customarily paid by  the buyer in some areas) and miscellaneous charges, such as recording fee and  document preparation fee. To avoid surprises, a few days before the scheduled  closing date, ask for an itemized list of the charges you will be expected to  pay.  </P> <P> Why Does Board Make It Hard to Find Agent?  </P> <P> Q: I am preparing to put my house on the market and want three agents, as you  often suggest. Since I don't know any agents here, I called the local Board of  Realtors to get the names of their three most successful sales agents. The  nasty lady who answered the phone said that is confidential information.  </P> <P> Then I asked for the names of the three largest local brokerages and again she  refused to give me this information. Since realtors don't have the best  reputation to begin with, why does their organization go out of their way to be  uncooperative with home sellers?  </P> <P> A: The answer you received from your local Board of Realtors, unfortunately, is  typical of most local boards. You were wise to want to interview the most  successful agents in your community, but it is a shame the local board was so  uncooperative.  </P> <P> Such information is not confidential and there is no reason you should not have  been given the names of the top agents. If you watch the newspaper, you will  often find the top agents honored for their sales success, so there is no  reason not to give that information to prospective home sellers.  </P> <P> I fully agree sometimes the realtors are their own worst enemies. For an  industry that depends on favorable public relations, refusal to answer  reasonable requests from consumers does far more harm than good.  </P> <P> Reader Says Cancel Property Tax Impound  </P> <P> Q: For 12 years I had been paying one-twelfth of my property taxes each month  into an impound escrow account held by my lender. Last year my loan servicing  was transferred to an out-of-state lender who said I was short by about $600 in  my escrow impound account.  </P> <P> But I figured my monthly payment was about right. I got into a big hassle with  the lender over the correct amount to be paid each month. Then I got out my  loan papers and found out there was no requirement for me to have an impound  escrow account, so I canceled it.  </P> <P> The lender tried to tell me I couldn't cancel, but when I pointed out the  mortgage doesn't require it they reluctantly sent me a check for the balance in  my impound escrow account. Perhaps other readers who are having similar loan  service hassles can use this technique.  </P> <P> A: Lenders often try to over-collect on property tax and insurance impounds  because then the lenders have the cost-free use of that money until the  payments must be made to the tax collector and insurance agent. The only loans  which usually require escrow impounds are VA, FHA and PMI (private mortgage  insurance) loans. Most other conventional loan borrowers are not required to  have escrow impounds, but many have them for convenience.  </P> <P> Rent Value Formula No Longer Applies  </P> <P> Q: We are moving away for about two years and plan to rent our home to tenants  while we are gone. A friend told me we should ask for monthly rent about 1% of  our home's market value. We estimate our home is worth around $175,000. But  $1,750 monthly rent seems pretty high. Is there a formula for home rentals?  </P> <P> A: The formula used to be that single-family houses should rent for 1% per  month of their fair market value. However, this formula is outdated because in  most towns it is not possible to get that much rent for all except the  lowest-priced homes.  </P> <P> A better alternative is to check the newspaper classified ads of houses for  rent in your neighborhood. Phone a few advertisers to learn if the features of  their homes are comparable to yours. You will soon have a feel for how much  rent you can get for your home.  </P> <P> Earnest Money Shows Buyer Is Serious  </P> <P> Q: I went to a real estate lecture about buying a home. The speaker, an  attorney, said it really isn't necessary to make a large earnest money deposit  to buy a home. He said all that is necessary is for the buyer and seller to  sign the sales contract. I recall when we sold our home many years ago the  buyers made a $500 earnest money deposit. Has this custom changed?  </P> <P> A: No. But the attorney is correct. Legally, no earnest money deposit is  required to form a binding real estate sales contract. All that is needed for  consideration are the signatures of the buyer and seller on the sales contract.  Those signatures obligate both parties to perform the sales contract.  </P> <P> However, in the real world, very few home sellers will accept a buyer's  purchase offer without an earnest money deposit. The larger the earnest money  deposit, the less chance the buyer will default and not complete the home  purchase as agreed. If the buyer isn't willing to put up an earnest money  deposit, that buyer probably isn't serious.  </P> <P> Charity Can Provide Housing for Donor  </P> <P> Q: A friend told me she recently gave her home to a charity in return for a  monthly payment as long as she lives. She can continue living in her home too.  Does this sound like a good deal?  </P> <P> A: Many colleges, churches and other charitable groups such as the Salvation  Army welcome real estate donations in return for lifetime income paid to the  donor. The monthly payment depends on the property's appraised market value and  the life expectancy of the donor.  </P> <P> Although many charities have lifetime annuity plans, most prefer cash  donations. Only a few accept property donations and allow the donor to retain a  life estate in the property. If such an arrangement meets the donors needs, it  is probably a "good deal."  </P> <P> Unrecorded Deed May Be Perfectly Valid  </P> <P> Q: Recently my husband died. He handled all our financial affairs. When I went  to our safe deposit box to see what was in it I found the deed to our home. The  attorney says it has never been recorded.  </P> <P> We bought the house about 14 years ago. I don't understand how this could have  happened. We bought the house from a friend who carried the mortgage. The  friend died a few years ago and we make the mortgage payments to his daughter.  Do you think this deed is good?  </P> <P> A: An unrecorded deed may be perfectly valid. Although recording gives  constructive notice of the document's contents, an unrecorded deed is effective  between the grantor and the grantee. Your attorney should be able to advise you  how to have the title status checked and how to obtain title insurance, which  would be a very good idea.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J.

However, he has never  before touched his ally's most sensitive nerve -- namely, his  broadcasting empire -- so closely and, moreover, riding one of  Forza Italia's own white horses. In fact, speaking in the town  of Varese, the League leader said: "I will be very interested  to see how the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] -- who speaks so  much of liberalism -- reacts to what we will be saying about  antitrust measures, when the League addresses the problem of  competition. Liberalism," Bossi went on to explain, "cannot  entail dominant economic positions, and therefore I will be  interested to hear what Berlusconi has to say when we call his  TV networks into question."    In his Varese speech, however, Bossi did not limit himself  to  attacking Berlusconi's "treasures." He also accused Forza  Italia, once again, of being an instrument created by the  establishment to try to weaken the League. Despite this, Bossi  did not seem to be afraid of contradicting himself by asserting  that "if Forza Italia does not betray us in any way, we will  make room for freedom even in a Catholic-communist country such  as Italy, where liberalism has never before taken root."    In any case, the Senator [Bossi nickname] is convinced that  the League will be successful within the liberal-democratic  coalition. Therefore "Forza Italia," he said, "which was  launched by the DC [Former Christian Democratic Party] to  destroy the League, is being used by us to destroy what is left  of the old Catholic party." "This is why we entered into an  agreement, but this agreement is only an electoral one."    In order to permit his supporters to swallow the pill of  being asked to vote indiscriminately for all the "liberty"  lists, including Forza Italia, Bossi explained that, in  single-member constituencies, where the choice is  "unfortunately" compulsory, 70 percent of the candidates will,  in any case, belong to the Bandwagon [League nickname], and only  30 percent will be Berlusconi's associates. "However, in the  proportional vote," the Lombard leader emphasized, "you will be  able to choose your political force, namely the League, and will  not be forced to vote for Forza Italia, which was set up to  rescue the establishment."</p>

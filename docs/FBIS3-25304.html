			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "PM News Wrap" program, presented by Dennis </F> O'Donnell -- live]    [Text] [O'Donnell] The rebel right-wing parliament decided  at its first meeting today not to participate in the April  election. This was announced by the leader of the Conservative  Party, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg. On the line now we have Amanda  Visser. Good afternoon to you, Amanda.    [Visser] Good afternoon.    [O'Donnell] What reasons were given for this decision?    [Visser] Well, Dr. Hartzenberg said that they have  negotiated  with the ANC [African National Congress] and the government,  they have given their final demands. Those demands were not  met, and they still don't have self-determination, and because  they don't have self-determination they are not prepared to go  into a government that will be, as they put it, a communist  parliament and a communist government.    [O'Donnell] So what are their plans now, then?    [Visser] Well, they said that they are going to put pressure  on the elections, as they can. What they mean by that is not  quite clear, but they say that they are going to start at the  local level. They are not going to participate in the 50-50  [proposed 50 percent white, 50 percent black local councils];  they are going to get their own burger [citizen] councils which  they are going to get in place, and they are going to put  whatever kind of pressure they can to stop this election.    [O'Donnell] And does this decision from the right-wing  parliament include the other members of the Freedom Alliance?  People like the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], Bophuthatswana, and  so on?    [Visser] Well, they were not here today, apparently, but it  seems as if they will also not participate, because they said  that if the Swazis can have their own territory, Inkatha must  have their own territory, the Boer volk [nation] must have their  own territory, and that is the kind of demands that the IFP  made, as well. Those demands were not met, so they will not  particpate.</p>

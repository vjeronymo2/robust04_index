			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 11 SAPA -- Six Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] members were  sentenced to death on Wednesday for the murder of black people  at an illegal roadblock on the West Rand last year.    They were sentenced in the Rand Supreme Court on four counts  of murder each, and to an effective 18 years' imprisonment on  charges including attempted murder, assault and possession of  unlicensed firearms, SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] radio reported.    Passing judgment, Mr Justice Marais said the sentences  should  act as a deterrent to those intent on taking the law into their  own hands. Those sentenced to death are Petrus Matthews,  Marthinus van der Schyff, Frederik Badenhorst, Marius Visser,  Karel Meiring and Andre Visser.    A seventh accused, Gerhardus Diederichs, was sentenced to  seven years in prison for each of the four murder charges, to  run concurrently, and an effective additional ten years  imprisonment on a range of other charges.</p>

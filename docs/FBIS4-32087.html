			<p>BFN     [Text] General Marinus Wilmink, commander of Allied NATO  Land Forces in Central Europe, ended his four-day official visit  to Slovakia with talks in the Defense Ministry in Bratislava.  He also met with journalists at a brief news conference.  Bernard Roztecky has the details:    [Roztecky] After his talks with Andrej Sabol, state  secretary  in the Slovak Defense Ministry, Gen. Marinus Wilmink assessed  his first official visit to Slovakia as very valuable. He  appreciated the mutual understanding as well as the sharing of  views on some military issues. He pointed out that future  cooperation will benefit from such trust.    According to General Julius Humaj, Slovak Army commander in  chief, who was present at the concluding talks, cooperation will  take place in three main areas: the development of new  organizational structures in our Army--that is, a transition to  the system of army corps and brigades similar to that of NATO.  The other areas cover the introduction of logistics systems in  army units and simulated training and other training for battle,  areas in which NATO has rich experience.    State Secretary Andrej Sabol also assessed the political  aspect of the talks, especially in relation to our participation  in the Partnership for Peace program. He recalled that our  initiative to set up a NATO consultation center in Bratislava  met with Gen. Wilmink's understanding. The general appreciated  the need for more intensive sharing of experience.    The commander of NATO land forces in Central Europe will  leave for NATO headquarters in Germany this afternoon.</p>

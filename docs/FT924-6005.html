			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / BBC green paper expected today THE delayed green paper on the BBC is expected to be published today. The discussion document will be mainly in the form of options, although there will be a presumption that the BBC's licence could continue in return for maximum efficiency. The main area of controversy is likely to surround a suggestion that licence fee funds might be made more generally available to those making public-service programmes, not just the BBC. Mr Chris Hopson, in a paper for the European Policy Forum think tank, said that would be a Trojan horse for those who wanted to dismantle the corporation.</p>

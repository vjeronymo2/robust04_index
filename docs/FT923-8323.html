			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Forex dealers can buy time - James Blitz looks at computer trading When it comes to dealing in the foreign exchange markets, every second counts. Now, thanks to new technology, the time it takes to make a deal will be even more precious. A group of computer trading systems developed by Reuters, Quotron Systems and the Japanese telecommunications company, KDD, could accelerate the already furious speed at which currency deals are transacted. These systems will provide automated brokerage matching buyers and sellers electronically in the time it takes to blink. 'It will change the way currency dealers look at the world,' says Mr Chris Deuters, managing director of global foreign exchange at Lehman Bros in London. 'In particular, it will increase the pace of trading at moments of crisis in the market.' Automatic brokerage sys-tems aim to increase the speed at which a trader can find a buyer. Currently, a trader contacts a known counterparty via computer or telephone, makes an offer and waits for confirmation. Alternatively, he contacts a currency broker who can match the offer with another bank's bid. Using automated brokerage, a dealer can type on to his computer screen the price at which he is willing to sell his currency, and the system will match him automatically with an anonymous buyer. The Reuters Dealing 2000-2 system has been operational since April and is used by about 30 banks. Quotron's Electronic Brokerage System, backed by 10 leading banks is due to become operational early next year. The systems may have a number of effects on currency trading: The volatility of the market could grow, increasing volumes and sharpening foreign exchange peaks and troughs. Mr Ian Doull, project director of the Quotron system, says electronic brokerage may increase volatilities hour-by-hour or day-by-day. Liquidity will increase. The dealing systems will reduce the commissions that banks pay to brokerage firms. The project directors of the Reuters 2000-2 system say they will charge about half of a broker's current commission for each trade. Some foreign exchange traders are pessimistic about the future of electronic broking. The systems are technically complex, and several forex heads in London who have purchased the Dealing 2000-2 system say it is used for only a small percentage of business. There are several reasons for caution. All the systems face the problem of ensuring the creditworthiness of counterparties. Under conversational dealing, a trader knows from the outset whether his counterparty is an acceptable credit risk. Using electronic brokerage he cannot be so sure. The trader may conclude a deal, only to be told moments later that his counterparty has insufficient credit. 'Relationships are very important in the market and traders will always need to get the feel for what is happening that a machine cannot provide,' Mr Doull said. Dealers may take time to learn the new techniques. 'Currency traders will be uncertain about handling the new systems in periods of heavy volume, and, until they learn how to use them, their impact on the market will be limited,' said Mr Deuters. In the immediate future, electronic broking will complement existing dealing methods without superseding them. The longer term impact is less predictable. 'We don't know what impact these systems will have. We are all going into uncharted waters,' said Mr Doull.</p>

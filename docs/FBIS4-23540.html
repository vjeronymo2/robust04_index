			<p>BFN     [Text] A powerful task force comprising the communications,  statistics and economic research arms of Government has been set  up from President Nelson Mandela's office to drive the  Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP).    The National Intelligence Service (NIS) is also set for a  revamp and will be administered by Deputy President F.W. de  Klerk, according to Government sources. A major announcement  will be made next week about the NIS's new image, and changes to  its senior management.    The two moves are the latest in a series of shake-ups of  ministries and State departments as the multiparty Government  shifts gear to tackle unemployment and poverty, and to address  backlogs in education, health and other services.    Reliable sources say the SA Communication Service (SACS),  Central Statical Service (CSS) and Central Economic Advisory  Service (CEAS) are in the process of being placed under Minister  Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The former labour leader, who is  responsible for co- ordinating the RDP from the President's  Office, has already approached the three organisations to set up  working relationships.    The CSS and the CEAS will play the role of a think-tank to  focus the RDP into disadvantaged and under-funded sectors,  while, at the same time, monitoring progress and checking  wasteful spending. The CEAS has already begun preparing a  White Paper describing the nuts and bolts of the plan outlined  by President Mandela in Parliament last months, according to CEA  chief Jan Dreyer.    Dreyer pledged his service's support for Naidoo, saying he  had already begun working closely with the Minister.    There is now a major shift in attitude towards addressing  development and priorities, he said. An important party of  CEAS's job would be to maintain fiscal discipline.    The full extent of the CSS's involvement in the RDP has not  yet been spelt out but Naidoo has held discussions with its  management and indicated it will fall under his jurisdiction,  said highly placed CSS sources. The CSS would throw its weight  behind the RDP but wanted to ensure that it could still perform  its function at a professional level and protect the credibility  of its data.    The CSS wanted to continue providing information to the  private sector. "Where we can play a significant role is in  monitoring the implementation of the RDP. The results should be  quantifiable," the source said.    The SACS has also not yet been officially informed of its  future position but its placement in the President's Office is  being considered. One of its main jobs will be to report on the  RDP's progress.    The SACS is currently under Constitutional Minister Roelf  Meyer. This suited it during the transition, said a spokesman,  but it would be beneficial now for it to fall under the  President's Office. "Effective communication would be critical  to the [process of reconciliation.    "We are always operating on behalf of other ministries but  it  would not be like that under the President because the SACS  would not be easily annexed by one department alone," he said.    Another option on the table was for SACS to be taken over by  Foreign Affairs, but this was less likely to happen.    The prevailing feeling was that most developed countries can  target communication exclusively outward, but in a country like  South Africa it should be mainly inward, the spokesman said.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONTROLLED EFFORT LEADS CANYONS BY OXNARD, 4-2  </P> <P> Jeff Frith-Smith of College of the Canyons has struggled to hang onto his spot  in the pitching rotation this season. And when he's struggled, wildness often  has been the culprit.  </P> <P> But Frith-Smith had little trouble with his control Thursday, pitching 8 2/3  innings in Canyons' 4-2 Western State Conference win over host Oxnard.  </P> <P> The change couldn't have been more timely.  </P> <P> "It was a great time for him to get his control back," Canyons Coach Len Mohney  said. "He was getting ahead (in the count) early today and he had better  consistency on his breaking ball."  </P> <P> But while the victory, Canyons' fourth in a row, may have provided Frith-Smith  with a confidence boost, Mohney said his pitcher's performance could provide an  even bigger boost down the stretch.  </P> <P> "It's important for us to have a three-man rotation and we need Frith-Smith for  that," he said.  </P> <P> Don Pedersen triggered the Cougar offense with a two-run home run over the  right-center field fence in the fourth inning. Randy Cooper hit a bloop single  to center and scored on Cooper's home run to give Canyons a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Frith-Smith (6-4) and freshman right-hander John Stuart of Oxnard were locked  in a duel until Pedersen's homer.  </P> <P> "Stuart can beat anybody in this league, but we just didn't score for him,"  Oxnard Coach George Peraza said. "Both guys pitched really well."  </P> <P> Oxnard threatened in the second inning when Tim Bohling doubled and advanced to  third on a ground out, but Frith-Smith pitched out of trouble.  </P> <P> The Condors cut the deficit to 2-1 in the fourth on Steve Cerio's single to  right and Gil Valencia's run-scoring double.  </P> <P> Canyons (19-12, 12-4 in conference play) added a run in the sixth when Adam  Grant doubled to right, advanced to third on Cooper's sacrifice bunt and scored  on Ernie Perez's ground out to Stuart. The lead expanded to 4-1 in the ninth  when Chris Joy singled to drive in pinch-runner Ross Linstrom.  </P> <P> Oxnard (13-13, 8-8) threatened again in its final at-bat.  </P> <P> Aaron Marcarelli and Juan Cuellar each singled and moved up a base on a wild  pitch. But when Marcarelli scored on Vince Ebarb's ground out, it proved to be  Oxnard's last run.  </P></p>

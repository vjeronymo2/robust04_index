			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Hotel group restructures as prelude to flotation Inter-Continental Hotels, owned by the Japanese Saison group, is to split its management oper-ations and property activities into two companies at the start of next year. The move, which follows a similar restructuring by Marriott, the US hotel chain, is a prelude to the possible flotation of a minority of the shares in the property business in about three years' time. Mr Gavin Simonds, until recently a director of Kleinwort Benson, and Mr Robert Collier, president of Inter-Continental group services, have been named joint managing directors of the two companies. Mr Simonds, who will be mainly responsible for the property business, expected the two companies to have 'a very close relationship'. He added that the new structure would focus management resources more effectively. 'It will make the operating company a clear vehicle for winning new business and earning a profit by managing hotels,' he said. 'The future for Inter-Continental lies in using the power of its brand, its reservations system and other intangible assets.' The chain operates 121 hotels in 50 countries, most of which it does not own. Mr Simonds said that unlike Marriott, which made large profits from property development until the market collapsed in the late 1980s, Inter-Continental had not traded actively in property. Saison acquired Inter-Continental from Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks and food company, for Dollars 2.2bn in 1988.</p>

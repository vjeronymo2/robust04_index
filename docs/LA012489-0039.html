			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Treasury sold $7.2 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount  rate of 8.26%, down from 8.30% last week. Another $7.2 billion of new six-month  bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.31%, down from 8.35% last week.  The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 8.24% on Jan. 3 and  six-month bills averaged 8.29% on Dec. 19. The new discount rates understate  the actual return to investors -- 8.55% for three-month bills, with a $10,000  bill selling for $9,791.20, and 8.79% for six-month bills selling for  $9,579.90. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when  government securities are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

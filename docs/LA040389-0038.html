			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CHAMBER VIRTUOSI SERIES' FINAL CONCERT OF SEASON  </P> <P> Henri Temianka's California Chamber Virtuosi series at Pepperdine University,  Malibu, ended its latest season Saturday night with adept musicianship and  programming. The concert offered three substantial French pieces from the late  Romantic era in celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution.  </P> <P> Surrounded by the red, white and blue flags of both the United States and  France, Temianka announced the program from the stage, giving lengthy  descriptions of Paris and the close circle of composers there. His sweeping  opinions sometimes startled. Less often, spurious information tended to detract  from Temianka's charm, which otherwise helped to hold the audience's interest.  </P> <P> Violinist Sergiu Schwartz and pianist Steven Gayer highlighted the evening with  a mesmerizing performance of Cesar Franck's Violin Sonata. Phrases were  carefully wrought and delivered with delicacy and warmth.  </P> <P> In Franck's Piano Quintet, Michael Markman, violin; Donald McInnes, viola, and  Timothy Landauer, cello, joined Schwartz and Mayer in a deft performance that  romped fittingly. An equally fine performance of Debussy's Violin Sonata  completed the program. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

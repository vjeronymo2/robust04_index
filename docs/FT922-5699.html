			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Storehouse Yesterday's announcement from Storehouse confirms that the group is toughening its attitude towards underperforming assets. The appointment of Habitat's finance director as divisional chairman and chief executive probably implies the imminent closure of the loss-making US operation. The French stores have been alone in making a consistent success of the Habitat concept, so Storehouse would doubtless smile on any bid from its French management to take control of the rest of the division. If the shares failed to react, it was doubtless because they are already discounting rather more than this tinkering at the edges.</p>

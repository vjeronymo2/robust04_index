			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Analysis sets back understanding of growth in unemployment Sir, I have carefully argued that the steep rise in the 'tax wedge' between the employer's labour cost per worker and the employee's after-tax wage is a major source of the climb in the natural rate of unemployment in western economies over the 1970s and 1980s, especially in continental Europe where this rise was generally steepest. Alas, the acute analysis by Samuel Brittan (' 'Wedge' versus 'social wage' ', July 21) will be seen by many readers as refuting that contention, and thus setting back markedly our understanding of the secular elevation of unemployment. He is right that popular expositions fail to clarify why the hated payroll tax is damaging for the natural rate, and likewise personal income tax, while the admired VAT is not. Right, too, about the necessity to leave room for other factors. But wrong to reason that, since the popular treatments are inadequate, there can be nothing in the idea. The whole difficulty stems from the unfortunate premise in popular treatments - a crude version of real wage rigidity: nothing will induce workers to accept a reduced real wage at a given unemployment rate. (Only an increase of unemployment can wring a cut in the real wage.) 'If workers have the market power to make employers recoup in higher pay the burden of payroll taxes, they also have the power to recoup other taxes levied directly on their incomes or expenditures', says Samuel Brittan. On this premise, it is true that a shift from payroll taxes to VAT would not lower the natural rate. The workers would require the same net wage from companies, and the government the same tax, so the unemployment rate would not be affected. The contrasting premise of my Structural Slumps (Harvard, February 1994) is that the real wage required at a given unemployment rate to mollify the workers - to keep at cost-effective levels their propensities to quit, shirk and strike - is a function of the non-wage resources the workers can fall back on: the real income from their private wealth and from their so-called social capital consisting of welfare entitlements and ties to family and friends. On this improved premise, the theory implies that value-added taxation, unaccompanied by exemptions, is theoretically neutral for the natural rate. It lowers the real value of workers' non-wage incomes as much as it lowers the real value of the wage their employer can afford to pay them. As a result, the real wage required for cost-effective worker performance falls, and by enough to accommodate the reduced real wage that employers can afford. The trouble with the payroll tax is that, since it does not reduce workers' real non-wage resources, it does nothing to reduce the real wage required for cost-effective worker performance. Thus the reduction caused in the wage that companies can afford to pay is not accommodated by a real-wage cut. An increase in the natural unemployment rate is the result. All of this is supported by the econometric findings. Edmund S Phelps, McVickar professor of political economy, Columbia University, New York NY 10128, US</p>

He is  chairman of the parliamentary Commission for National Security,  Defense, and Prevention of Crime. [video shows Hryb talking to  correspondent]    [Hryb] I am very confident that without unity and  consolidation of all the forces, especially between the Supreme  Soviet Presidium and the Supreme Soviet itself, we shall find it  very difficult to get out of the present economic crisis. We  should seriously address the problems of our economy and the  questions of strengthening our economic ties with the Russian  Federation.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOYNER COULD RETURN TO LINEUP TODAY  </P> <P> Wally Joyner's knee injury kept the Angel first baseman out of Sunday's game  against the New York Yankees, although he was available for pinch-hitting duty  and could have played in an emergency, according to Manager Doug Rader.  </P> <P> "He could've played today," Rader said. "But I'm not going to send a guy out  there with a swollen knee. If he goes out there and plays and it swells up  more, then we're looking at (him missing) five to 10 days."  </P> <P> Joyner hurt his left knee after a collision at first base with New York pitcher  Greg Cadaret Saturday night and had to been taken from the field on a  stretcher. X-rays proved negative and the injury was diagnosed as a contusion  of the knee.  </P> <P> Jim Eppard played in place of Joyner Sunday and could be back in the lineup  again today. Rader said he would prefer to rest Joyner until the team returns  home on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "With that kind of injury, it usually takes 48 hours after it happens for the  internal bleeding to stop," Rader said. "That's basically what it is -- a  bruise. After 48 hours, if it's no worse, the measurable risk is much less.  </P> <P> "We'll have to wait and see how stiff and swollen the knee is (today). If it's  practical that he can play, he will. If not, he won't." MIKE PENNER  </P></p>

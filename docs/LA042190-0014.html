			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSESSING A 'FOR ADULTS ONLY' RATING PROPOSAL FOR MOVIES  </P> <P> It takes very little talent for a writer (sic) to script a scene of  fornication.  </P> <P> There is no dialogue, only sound and loose bedding.  </P> <P> "Driving Miss Daisy," without so much as a "damn," wins several Oscars. "My  Left Foot" and "Field of Dreams" -- how could such pleasant films succeed in a  time that Mathews finds so inhibiting?  </P> <P> What happens in film happens not because (as we are constantly told) the  "public demands" it but because greedy, pimp-like producers are after the  voyeurs' money!  </P> <P> DEAN M. NORTON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

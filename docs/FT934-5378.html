			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis accounts change just a 'storm in a teacup' Chrysalis, the music and media group, is to amend the treatment of one of the companies in which it owns shares following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. The company is to change the 1992 figures in its reserve notes for the treatment of its associated undertaking in Metro Radio, in which it held an 18.7 per cent stake. The accounts show that it wrote off Pounds 3.94m in goodwill against reserves after purchasing 3.18m Metro shares for Pounds 4.99m. However, it then revalued the investment to its original cost by an amount equal to the write-off, which the panel ruled to be contrary to SSAP 1, the accounting standard on associated companies. The treatment was highlighted in the 1992 accounts, which stated it was 'not in accordance with accounting standards'. No such statement had been made in the 1991 accounts after the shares were first acquired. Neither Stoy Hayward, the auditor in 1991, nor KPMG Peat Marwick, which replaced it in 1992, had qualified the accounts to draw attention to the treatment. Mr Nigel Butterfield, group finance director, said: 'I would like to say it's a storm in a teacup, but it's not much of a storm. It's irritating. We wasted a lot of time and professional fees on it.' The directors maintain that they are justified in showing the aggregate value of their investment in Metro, and will achieve this by attributing the fair value to the company's intangible assets - its radio licences. They will also provide a more detailed explanation, and amend the reserves to add back a Pounds 3.94m write-off to the profit and loss account reserve and deduct it from the revaluation reserve.</p>

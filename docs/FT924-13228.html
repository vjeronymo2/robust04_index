			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Tory MPs join forces under the rebels' banner EVEN in Slough, deep in the Tory Home Counties and far from any colliery, the cuts at British Coal have already prompted 20 telephone calls to the local Conservative association. Mr John Watts, the town's Tory MP and a senior backbencher - he is chairman of the all-party Treasury committee - is rarely disruptive. But he says he would ask some pretty tough questions if parliament were sitting. 'I would certainly want to have proved to me that the government had examined all the options,' he says. He is one of the Tories whose anxiety is only partly buried because the Commons is in recess. That anxiety is likely to surface with force when MPs return on Monday as the debate over the pit closures is becoming part of the wider concern over the government's handling of the economy, increasing the pressure on ministers. Sir Michael Grylls, chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee, says: 'There is anxiety because it is a very difficult moment. We are not yet out of the recession.' He adds, however: 'But we are on our way out.' The government whips will have their work cut out next week to stop a revolt which could threaten the government's slender majority of 21. On the face of it, the Conservatives have little emotional attachment to the coal industry, and Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, is not likely to win any friends on the Tory benches. Apart from four of the 32 constituencies with pits, most mining seats are held with thumping majorities by Labour members - six have worked down mines  -who form a tightly knit and vociferous but often unheard coal lobby at Westminster. But Conservative MPs are not immune from the industry's woes. Two constituencies in mining areas were lost to Labour in the April general election. Many Tory-held constituencies are near mining constituencies, and two are held by junior trade and industry ministers Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horncastle) and Mr Neil Hamilton (Tatton). Mr James Lester, Conservative MP for Broxtowe, which had three mines when he first won the seat, says that Tory local campaigning has been set back 'by 10 years' in Nottinghamshire. 'The ordinary fellow not only supports the miners but has a feeling for the Union of Democratic Mineworkers who withstood the coal strike,' he says, although he believes there is a 'grim inevitability' about the announcement. Home secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke, the son of a miner and MP for the mining area of Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, admitted on BBC radio that 'it was a very critical time' for the county. Mr William Cash, a fierce opponent of Maastricht and Tory MP for Stafford, says the decision is a 'kick in the teeth' for miners at the Silverdale and Trentham mines, near his constituency, who, he says, broke the 1984-85 strike. 'It is an absolute disgrace both in the manner in which it was done and the absurdity of closing down national assets which cannot be revived once the decision has been implemented . . . the bottom line is that British miners are being thrown on the slagheap for the preservation of German coal-mining jobs.' Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP for Macclesfield, has added to the flurry of letters of protest sent to Mr John Major and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. 'It is vital that we use our indigenous energy resources such as coal and that we don't squander gas,' he says. Mr Cash and Mr Winterton are regular rebels. However, other less predictable rebels are emerging from the Tory ranks. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, from the Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, and Mr Winston Churchill, from Davyhulme in Greater Manchester, were among the first to appear on television. 'I'm all in favour of free markets but the government should not let a strategic industry die,' Mrs Peacock said. 'The government must encourage, and if necessary intervene, in the dispute on the coal price between British Coal and the electricity companies.' Even among Tories who believe that closures were necessary, there is alarm at the speed at which they have been implemented - betraying a wider fear at the pace at which the recession is spreading. 'The whole thing should not have been as abrupt, but should have been spread over a longer period because of the impact on human beings,' says Mr David Knox, MP for Staffordshire Moorlands - not far from the Staffordshire pits. Mr Michael Fabricant, Tory MP for Mid-Staffordshire, is prepared to support the government, arguing that coal is 'not the energy of the future' and that to insist on power stations using coal 'is like saying that the railways should use steam trains'. But he calls for help for other industries to weather the recession. 'It is ludicrous to say that we won't support industries which our competitors are supporting. That means an industrial strategy. Sure it means getting inflation down, sure it means getting interest rates down but it still won't be enough.' Mr John Biffen, Tory MP for Shropshire north and a former cabinet minister, is prepared to let economic arguments rule but says the pace at which change was brought about needed 'caution rather than self-confidence'. From his constituency, which once included a mining community, he hints that he believes the government has tripped badly, quoting Browning: 'Never glad confident morning again]'</p>

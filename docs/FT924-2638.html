			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK electricity National Power and PowerGen must be starting to sweat. Professor Littlechild's exoneration of the regional electricity companies for buying gas-fired power is not bad news in itself. Those most involved in the dash for gas, notably Southern Electric and Norweb, will doubtless be relieved. The generators are big enough to stand the competition. They can, however, hardly be pleased to find the regulator digging deeper to see whether the coal-fired contracts which they offered as an alternative to gas fairly reflected costs. In one respect the generators - and the coal lobby for that matter - might justifiably feel hard done by. In looking at coal-fired power contracts covering peak demand against gas-fired contracts covering only basic demand, the regulator is not comparing like with like. One can only trust the full report promised by the end of January takes this point on board. Regardless of the arithmetic, though, Professor Littlechild appears set on a collision course with the generators. Since the generators enjoy freedom from price-based regulation, the market is right to be nervous. The results of an investigation into the electricity pool price are already due before Christmas. Yesterday's missive opens a second front. If National Power or PowerGen are found to be overcharging through either contracts or the pool, Professor Littlechild will have little choice but to act. At best that means intervention on prices, at worst a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

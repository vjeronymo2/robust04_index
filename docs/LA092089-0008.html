			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING HAND FOR HOUSING  </P> <P> Neighborhood groups are learning to build affordable housing that Washington  once paid for. But it takes more than 2-by-4s, nails and stucco. Novices need  to know the housing business from the ground up. A nonprofit organization, best  known for raising private capital to finance low-income housing, is beginning  to help there as well, with technical training designed to teach the novices  how to think like developers.  </P> <P> The Local Initiatives Support Corp. teaches participants during four weeklong  training sessions spread over a year how to acquire a building site, get into  escrow, find financing, review construction budgets and close deals. Step by  step, neighborhood groups learn from start to finish what it takes to put up  housing. They also are taught never to lose sight of the people who will live  in the new apartments, so that they build housing that poor people can be proud  of.  </P> <P> The first training program, which ended last week, cost $250,000 and was  underwritten by the ARCO Foundation, the California Community Foundation, the  James Irvine Foundation and the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. The Los Angeles  Community Design Center provided technicalassistance. The 14 participants also  received grants of $12,500 to help with start-up costs.  </P> <P> Ten graduates are already putting their new skills to work in South-Central Los  Angeles, East Los Angeles, Little Tokyo, San Pedro, the Westside and Skid Row.  They are starting to develop apartments for poor families, group housing for  mentally ill adults, single-room occupancy hotels for homeless men and women  and senior citizens' housing. The 455 new units are expected to provide homes  for about 1,500 low-income people.  </P> <P> The new housing, although a drop in the bucket compared to the region's needs,  is essential because of federal indifference to the housing needs of poor  Americans. The massive housing cutbacks during the Reagan Administration  demonstrated a contempt for poor Americans who are ill-housed or homeless.  </P> <P> Community organizations can't singlehandedlyfill the housing gap in Los  Angeles, where an estimated 500,000 families need better and more affordable  housing. But at least local organizations, with training and encouragement from  the Local Initiatives Support Corp., can make the affordable housing picture  less bleak than it is today.  </P></p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Bosnian peace talks resume with ultimatum THE Bosnian peace talks finally resumed again in Geneva yesterday, amid a Croat ultimatum that the Bosnian Moslems must accept proposed maps on the republic's ethnic division or face more war. Mr Mate Boban, the Croat leader, said: 'Any party that attempts to make fundamental changes to the map we have negotiated so far does not want a peace agreement, but wants delays and war instead.' The remarks appeared to be a thinly veiled criticism of Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem leader, and reflect mounting pressure from Croat and Serb leaders on Mr Izetbegovic to accept a peace settlement based on military gains made during the war. Mr Izetbegovic has not so far submitted his proposal for the borders of the future 'union' of the three ethnic republics. His bitter opposition to an ethnic devision of Bosnia had previously been one of the many sticking points in the negotiations. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, last week confirmed that the Bosnian delegation has not actively participated in talks on the territorial division. Instead, he has stressed that any agreement will be void without 'fair maps'. These must guarantee a viable state which comprises at least 40 per cent of Bosnian territory and provides access to the Adriatic Sea and the northern River Sava. At last evening's all-party session, the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, intended to 'resolve outstanding areas of the maps', said Mr John Mills, their spokesman. Just minutes after the talks got underway, Mr Mills said all three parties had agreed that 'UN military observers will be free to go everywhere in the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. Most previous agreements were immediately violated. Mr Izetbegovic said earlier that he would insist during the current talks that Serb forces lift their siege of Sarajevo. However, Commander Barry Frewer, Sarajevo spokesman for UN forces, yesterday said that following the Serb withdrawal from strategic mountain heights around the city this weekend, Sarajevo no longer faced a classic siege. But although the UN yesterday said that the area around Sarajevo was now quiet, the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) yesterday said that central Bosnia remained very volatile, with fighting continuing between Moslem and Croat forces. Croat military leaders in Mostar, south-west Bosnia, were reported to be still holding about 2,000 Moslem prisoners at a local airfield. They were using some of their captives as forced labourers to dig trenches on the frontlines, said relief officials. Earlier in the day Croat leaders had threatened to boycott talks in Geneva unless their Moslem enemies allowed relief convoys to cross frontlines to an isolated town in central Bosnia.</p>

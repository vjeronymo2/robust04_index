			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Businesses seek easier financing A 20-POINT programme to make it easier for small and medium-sized companies to obtain finance during the hoped-for economic recovery will be unveiled to the Treasury this week by the Association of Independent Businesses, a lobby group. The ideas from the association, representing about 12,000 companies, will feed into a six-month study by the Treasury into whether 'market imperfections' distort the flow of cash into industry and so impede growth. The suggestions include putting greater pressure on banks to fund small companies, and tax changes to release more cash for industrial investment. They will be relayed at a meeting on Wednesday between the association and Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. Mr Dorrell is expected to discuss the proposals with Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, who is in charge of the funding inquiry. Mr Toby Aykroyd, director of operations at the association, welcomed the Treasury study. He said it was important to lay the ground for 'medium-term reforms' in the financing of small companies. He said new ideas to help the sector might be needed, especially during the expected upturn over the next year or so. The meeting with Mr Dorrell was set up before last week's announcement of the Treasury study, which will be based on a series of visits by Mr Nelson to small companies around Britain. Mr Nelson will also talk to City institutions and banks to discuss funding problems. Proposals from the association include: Persuading banks to give more information about their loans to small companies, including those made under the government's loan guarantee scheme, so that lobbying groups can better assess the banks' record in this area. Revamping of the business expansion scheme to provide tax advantages for companies and individuals when investing in small companies. Extra capital allowances to enable small companies to claim tax relief against investments. Increased grants to reduce burden of business rates. Extensions in schemes to enable small companies to offset financial losses against tax on later profits. The study by Mr Nelson follows efforts by the Treasury over the past year to form a better understanding of business issues. The inquiry was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors. Mr Stan Mendham, founder of the 21,000-member Forum of Private Businesses, said funding of small companies was 'monumentally important' to the UK's economic health.</p>

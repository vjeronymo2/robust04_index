			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Is there life after Deng?: Chinese wonder what will follow leader's demise CHINA'S ailing paramount leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping, celebrated his 89th birthday yesterday - out of sight but not out mind for millions of Chinese who fear his departure from the scene may usher in instability. While few newspapers referred to his birthday, most continued serialising a lengthy book about his early life by his daughter, entitled My Father, Deng Xiaoping. Publishing houses are also churning out millions of copies of earnest works about his contribution to the country, including a mammoth tome detailing his thoughts on 'building socialism with Chinese characeristics'. People's Daily reported that no fewer than 56 books about Mr Deng's life and times have been published or are in the works. As the end draws near for China's supreme leader, his associates are ensuring the historical record is complete. Chinese newspapers gave front-page prominence to the exploits of Mr Jiang Zemin, the Communist party boss, who has himself in recent months commanded enormous media space, as if party propagandists have heightened preparations for a transition from one generation of leaders to the next. Mr Deng's advancing years, the continuing absence of Mr Li Peng, the prime minister, from active duty with a heart condition, and doubts about the ability of a collective leadership to impose discipline on the party and the country in the post-Deng era are adding to nervousness about the future. Among indications of concern about life after Deng is the fact that rumours about his deteriorating health, and even death, regularly sweep larger Chinese cities, where speculation about the future is intense among the urban elite. Beijing was awash with reports over the weekend that China's supreme leader had died. Mr Deng was last seen in public in January in Shanghai. He has made few appearances in recent years and on each occasion has been frailer. Worries about his deteriorating health, and uncertainty about the leadership chosen to succeed him, coincide with an uncertain phase in the country's economic reforms. Efforts to bring the runaway economy under control are exposing many problems, including corruption among officials.</p>

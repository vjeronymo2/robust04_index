			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Democratic </F> Alliance presidential candidate, by unidentified reporters at  Democratic Alliance headquarters in Panama City on 8 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Moscoso] We have just seen on television the  results announced by the Electoral Tribunal [TE], but we still  have to wait for the figures from the National Vote-Counting  Board. However, I have noticed -- as I mentioned on several  occasions -- that polarization has occurred between the  Arnulfista Party [PA] and the Democratic Revolutionary Party  [PRD]. The data we are seeing tonight confirms this once more.  The data likewise confirms that the fake polls that were being  announced were in fact rigged, and that they were aimed at  building up two candidates. We can see whose figures are very  low, while the PA figures are competing with the PRD figures.    [Reporter] Do you believe the PA is going to win?    [Moscoso] Of course we are going to win.    [Reporter] If you lose, will you concede defeat?    [Moscoso] Pardon me?    [Reporter] If the PRD happens to win, will you concede  defeat?    [Moscoso] First, I believe that I am going to win. If such a  possibility exists, however, what we want is a calm and peaceful  country. I believe that Panama experienced 21 years of  uncertainty, so if the PRD wins -- if the TE and the National  Vote-Counting Board confirm this -- we will recognize its  victory.    [Reporter] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] candidate  has  conceded defeat.    [Moscoso] He already has?    [Reporter] Yes.    [Moscoso] I had not heard that, but I think that it is still  too early to recognize the victory of another candidate.    [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya. If you win the elections, what would  be your government's number one priority?    [Moscoso] I have already said that if an announcement is  made  tonight that we have won the elections I will call for national  reconciliation by all Panamanians, all political parties,  including the PRD, the good people who are in the PRD too. This  would be my priority.    [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya: According to the figures being  provided by the TE, the PRD is currently in the lead. On what  do you base your optimism? How do you plan to take the lead?    [Moscoso] There are many votes still left to be counted,  especially votes from the interior of the Republic, and I am  leading there, in the interior.    [Reporter] There is a forecast of [words indistinct].    [Moscoso] No, not yet. I think that should be left up to the  TE.    [Reporter] The TE maintains its ban on mobilizations and  demonstrations until the final official returns are in.  Regarding the activities under way by both the PRD and the PA,  isn't this a violation of the TE rules?    [Moscoso] No. I think they are doing the right thing. If  results are announced now by anyone other than the TE, it would  be premature. People would take to the streets. We have to  wait for the results to be announced by the National  Vote-Counting Board. If the results that are announced now are  not the same as those that are going to be announced by the  National Vote-Counting Board we might find ourselves in a huge  bind. I think it is best for us to wait. I agree with this.    [Reporter] Due to the heated emotions of both PRD and PA  sympathizers, don't you think this is inadvisable? As the  evening wears on, people get more keyed up. In the event of a  defeat, wouldn't these people take to the streets denouncing an  alleged fraud?    [Moscoso] For the first time in many years, we have a TE  that  everyone knows is made up of very honorable persons. I believe  that now in Panama no one is going to scream fraud. We are not  going to do this. I don't know if the PRD would scream fraud if  they were to lose. Perhaps so, but there is not going to be a  fraud. These elections have been clean, honest, and whoever  wins will be the president of Panama. It is true that right now  our fellow party members are there, downstairs, but they are  dancing, they are calm. Instead of taking to the streets, I  would rather they stay here than go out on the streets late at  night. That would be dangerous.</p>

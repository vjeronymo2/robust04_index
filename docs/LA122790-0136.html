			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> STATE DEADLINE JAN. 1 FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> Owners of assault weapons such as AKs and Uzis must register them with the  California Department of Justice before Jan. 1, according to the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The three sheriff's stations in the county -- Ventura, Camarillo and Thousand  Oaks -- have registration cards and instructions.  </P> <P> The state registration fee is $20 per weapon. Also required is a thumbprint,  which the Sheriff's Department will take for a $3 fee.  </P> <P> "People must take this responsibility seriously or they run the risk of  imprisonment, a fine and the loss of the weapon," Assistant Sheriff Oscar  Fuller said.  </P> <P> Fuller said there are no statistics available on how many assault weapons are  in the county, "but there are over 300,000 in the state, and I would expect  that we have a share of those."  </P> <P> Anyone who wants to turn in an assault weapon rather than register it may  transfer it to a licensed gun dealer or contact a local law enforcement agency  for instructions.  </P> <P> "We would appreciate no unexpected arrivals at police headquarters. We prefer  they would call ahead," Fuller said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (EFE) -- The official GRANMA  newspaper today responded to rumors of a Fidel Castro illness in  a brief note stating that the Cuban leader on Tuesday met with  Mexican Fausto Alzati, director general of the National Council  for Science and Technology (Conacyt).    A diplomat of the Mexican Embassy in Cuba who attended the  meeting told EFE that he saw Castro "in perfect condition, as  always. He even cracked jokes."    Sergio Tobar, scientific attache of the Mexican diplomatic  mission, added that the meeting took place at the office of the  Cuban leader and lasted about one hour.    The source said Castro and Alzati later went to the Mexican  ambassador's residence in Havana to attend a reception, at which  Castro stayed for 30 minutes.    This is the first time, since 2 April, that GRANMA has  reported on an activity involving Castro, while the Cuban  Foreign Relations Ministry yesterday denied he suffered a heart  attack or a stroke.    A spokesman for the Foreign Relations Ministry said that  Castro "is not scheduled" to attend the Conference on the Nation  and Emigration, which will start tomorrow, but Castro will  attend a special session of the National Assembly on 1 May.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1518 GMT carries a related 250-word  Havana-datelined report quoting Sergio Tobar as stating Cuban  President Fidel Castro is "in a perfect state of health," adding  that "we saw him and he looked as usual, very spirited; he may  have the flu [gripe]." The report adds that Castro later  attended a cocktail party at the Mexican ambassador's residence,  where he chatted with guests for 20 minutes.]</p>

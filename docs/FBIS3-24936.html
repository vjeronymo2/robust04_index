In an address to Durban businessmen, Mr Buthelezi stressed  constitutional issues surrounding regional powers were crucial  for the IFP's participation in the poll. "Even if the  government and the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance do relent on  this issue of the double ballot, the double ballot by itself is  quite meaningless if regions do not have the autonomy which  cannot be interfered with by the constituent assembly," Mr  Buthelezi said in a speech for delivery.    The ANC has reportedly agreed to separate votes for regional  and national parliaments, a major stumbling block in protracted  talks between the ANC, government and Freedom Alliance aimed at  getting the alliance, including the IFP, to participate in the  poll.    Mr Buthelezi had recently said this was one of the biggest  reason for staying out of the election. But, the IFP leader  said on Thursday regional powers outlined in the interim  constitution were unacceptable. "The...constitution affords to  the provinces less powers than under the present unitary  dispensation.... No independent political expression is  possible at the provincial level."    Mr Buthelezi said the constitution did not allow regional  parliaments to collect their own taxes, and suggested this would  enable the national parliament to manipulate the regions through  their budgets.    He cited recent efforts by the Transitional Executive  Council  to replace the kwaZulu Police with the SA Police.    Mr Buthelezi rejected the argument that kwaZulu/Natal was  too  poor to go it alone in a federal dispensation. He said an  equalisation fund, normal among federations around the world,  would be used to give the region required money.    Mr Buthelezi further reiterated the need for a constitution  recognising Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. "As the traditional  prime minister to the king, there can therefore be no question  of myself accepting a cabinet position in a constitutional  set-up which excludes my king."</p>

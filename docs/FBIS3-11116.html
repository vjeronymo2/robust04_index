Robaina arrived in Rangoon today, the third leg of his tour  of seven Asian nations that he began in Indonensia then  continued to Laos. After a two-day visit in Myanmar, he will  travel to Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.    During the meeting, both sides reviewed relations, which  were  described as good, between the two states and projects of common  interest, which they agreed will require further study.    Ohn Gyaw expressed interest in the possibility of hiring  Cuban health specialists, as well as in a project to develop  tourism in this country.    Ohn Gyaw also voiced his admiration for Cuba, which he  visited last year to explore areas of cooperation, praising the  social achievements of the past three decades.    Robaina's visit is viewed as a reaffirmation of the friendly  relations between Havana and Rangoon, despite the distance  separating both countries.    Robaina's agenda includes several meetings with top  government leaders. Prior to his departure to Cambodia on 14  March, he is scheduled to meet Vice Admiral Maung Maung Khin,  prime minister of Myanmar [title as received].    Before traveling to this capital, Robaina met in Vientiane  with Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan, Foreign Minister  Somsavat Lengsavat, the ministers of trade, nutrition, finance,  and other personalities.    Following a very tight agenda, Robaina has tried to  accomplish the objective of his tour to southeast Asia: to  promote closer relations with the region and make known the  Cuban reality.</p>

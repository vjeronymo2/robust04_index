			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SKATEBOARD WIZARDRY IN 'GLEAMING'  </P> <P> There's a genuine attempt in "Gleaming the Cube" (citywide) to deal with the  impact the loss of a brother has upon a likable, footloose teen-ager.  Unfortunately, the conventions of the action-adventure/youth-flick genres  prevail. The result is an exploitation picture with a little something extra --  lots of awesome skateboard wizardry, culminating in a speed-of-lightning chase  sequence, in which skateboards are pitted against cars.  </P> <P> The film is geared ruthlessly to teen audiences. In fact, how many people  beyond their teens know that its title refers to that exalted state a  skateboarder attains at the top of his form?  </P> <P> Christian Slater stars as Orange County teen Brian Kelly, spiky-haired and  sloppy, for whom skateboarding has a far greater priority than his studies. But  no problem: He has an adopted Vietnamese brother named Vinh (Art Chudabala), a  studious and orderly youth, who'll do his homework for him. Then, shockingly,  Vinh is found hanged to death in a motel room.  </P> <P> Incredibly, only Brian suspects murder. He does get a local cop (Steven Bauer)  to listen, but after a series of contrived macho clashes between the two, Brian  takes matters into his own hands.  </P> <P> "Gleaming the Cube" is not the first movie to be set in part against Orange  County's large Southeast Asian community. However, as in "Steele Justice," the  film makers are interested in it primarily as an exotic backdrop for crime and  violence. Surely, the majority of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees building  new lives in America are not involved in gang warfare and other illicit  ventures, but that's not the impression you get here.  </P> <P> Writer Michael Tolkin provides only Slater with a role of much dimension, and  this nervy, bright young actor, who played Jeff Bridges' eldest son in "Tucker"  and Sean Connery's apprentice in "The Name of the Rose," involves us in Brian  and his quest. Slater shows us Brian discovering how much brotherly love he  actually felt for Vinh, love that had been repressed by resentment.  </P> <P> We get precious few glimpses of Brian's parents (Ed Lauter, Nicole Mercurio) --  why, for example, wouldn't they have also suspected foul play in Vinh's death?  Slater and Lauter have one good scene in which the father admits he failed to  realize the impact upon Brian of his efforts to make his adopted son feel  special. There's also an initially wary friendship between Vinh's demure  girlfriend (Min Luong) and Brian, but action is the main attraction in this  fantasy.  </P> <P> Director Graeme Clifford gets full value from the script (which allows Bauer  and others little latitude). The action sequences do dazzle, and Clifford makes  the most of the few quieter moments. The film's flashy finish smashes  credibility to smithereens, but "Gleaming the Cube" (rated PG-13 for violence)  has the feel of a film that turned out exactly as intended. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

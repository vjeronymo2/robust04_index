			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Shares rise despite 30% drop for Hornby TRADITIONAL toys fought a rearguard action last Christmas against their high-tech rivals like gameboy and his ilk, Hornby, the games, trains and boat maker, said yesterday as it reported a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year. Buoyed by the relatively optimistic outcome of Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 2.09m) in the face of such competition, the shares closed up 21p at 164p. The group said the results were satisfactory given the competing disadvantages of last year's craze for computer games and consumers' reluctance to spend until a month before Christmas. Turnover declined to Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 32m) and operating expenses were inflated by the launch of the new Cassy doll which led to costs 'approaching Pounds 500,000'. Net interest costs were higher at Pounds 364,000 compared with Pounds 199,000. The board proposes a maintained dividend of 9p, payable from lower earnings per share of 11.5p (15.4p). Mr Jack Strowger, above, group chairman, announced his intention to retire at the next annual general meeting after 12 years in the post. He is 77. He will be succeeded by Mr Malcolm Thomas, the deputy chairman. The company's shares trade on the USM.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Argentine Ambassador to the United States </F> Raul Granillo Ocampo by Sergio Crivelli; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Crivelli] What is Argentina's real place on the  United States' international agenda?    [Granillo Ocampo] The importance of the Argentine role is  increasing. In the reformulation of the international scenario  and in President Clinton's concept, Latin America is beginning  to occupy a more important place, because it is growing as a  trade partner. Latin America is the region where U.S. exports  are increasing faster, nearly 18 percent per year, while in  other areas they are paralyzed or decreasing. We must add to  that the fact that principles supported by the U.S.  Administration, such as democracy, the market economy, and the  peaceful solution of conflicts, are becoming stronger here.    The U.S. people are very sparing in their praise. This is  why if they say that the Argentine transition process is taking  place very quickly, and that its results are spectacular, it is  because they believe this to be the case. Our bilateral  relations are also improving as a result of the fundamental  objectives shared by the two countries: respect for democratic  institutions, environmental protection, defense of human rights,  and the peace and security concept defended by the United  Nations.    [Crivelli] For decades Brazil played the role of a  preferential U.S. partner in this region, but recently a  deterioration has been noticed in Brasilia-Washington ties.  Could Argentina take the place left vacant by the Brazilians?    [Granillo Ocampo] It definitely already is taking it.    [Crivelli] You have traveled with U.S. Vice President Al  Gore. Before his arrival in our country there was information  that his agenda included, among other issues, corruption and  drug trafficking. Were the problems encountered by U.S.  companies in participating in the privatizations discussed?    [Granillo Ocampo] It would be appropriate to make clear that  there was a real agenda -- following talks between the two sides  -- and another agenda concocted by the press on the basis of  isolated reports. The issues of corruption, drug trafficking,  or independent courts were never included in the real agenda.  These issues were also not discussed during the two visits that  Gore paid to President Menem. It is true that there are some  companies that complain about problems in entering our country  over what we may describe as the practice of corruption, but  this does not seem to be the rule. During the past two years  almost all the privatizations have been awarded to U.S.  companies. If they were not successful bidders during the first  two years it was because they did not participate. During that  period, they actually did not believe in the privatization  process.    [Crivelli] There is one inevitable issue, either on the real  agenda or on that of the newspapers: the patents law. Does it  have a deadline? Is it 30 April? What is the situation right  now?    [Granillo Ocampo] From the correct perspective, the issue is  like this: We made an international commitment, the GATT  agreement, and therefore we must at least promulgate a law. In  addition to that, there is a commitment marked by our interest  in joining NAFTA. If we want to harmonize our policy with the  United States in that field, it is necessary to accept some  rules. It is not a question of giving in to a big stick policy.    The members of NAFTA -- Mexico, Canada, and the United  States  -- have defined a minimum level for the patents law, and this is  what is being negotiated. What would be best for us, reject  NAFTA and not have a patents law, or have a patents law with  some limitations and join NAFTA? President Carlos Menem decided  for the second option. There is a 1 May deadline to prepare a  report on the countries with which there is an interest in  starting negotiations. Based on that report the president will  submit his final proposal to Congress on 1 July indicating the  countries with which it is suggested that negotiations be  started.    [Crivelli] Will Senate approval be enough to avoid a  conflict, or will it be necessary to have the approval of both  chambers?    [Granillo Ocampo] I don't believe it will be necessary to  have the approval of both chambers. They know it involves  different powers, and what must be shown is progress in the  right direction.    [Crivelli] The Whitewater affair affecting President Clinton  had wide press coverage in Argentina. What is its real impact  on the American people?    [Granillo Ocampo] This affair is obviously overblown. The  latest U.S. poll shows that 16 percent of the American people  believe the president could have done something wrong, and 84  percent believe he did not. Also, there is nothing against  Clinton. No accusation against him has been made, and he is not  under investigation. The accusations published by the press are  only possibilities, and have been greatly exaggerated.    [Crivelli] What is the objective of the summit of presidents  to be held in December in Miami?    [Granillo Ocampo] The objective is to prepare a work agenda  for the region, including issues that interest President Clinton  and the Latin American presidents. In other words, the  definition of regional policies is a multilateral issue; it will  emerge from the talks among all parties involved. The idea is  also to emphasize the importance of Latin America for the  Democratic administration. The meeting could also be  interpreted as an equivalent to the Americas Initiative of the  Republican administration. Argentina is an important spokesman  for the region. We have been previously consulted, and helped  create the idea, the agenda, and the site for the summit.</p>

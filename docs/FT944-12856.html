			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Ballot initiatives stir up the voters - The midterm polls' crop of state referendums Voter turnout in the US midterm polls on November 8 is expected to be low, in the absence of a high-profile presidential election, but in some states controversial referendum proposals on the ballot paper are expected to lure people to vote. Most controversial of all is California's Proposition 187, which would ban illegal immigrants from receiving public education or social services. The proposal, which Justice Department officials say they believe to be unconstitutional, has sharply divided the candidates in California's elections. More people say they are being drawn to the ballot box primarily by Proposition 187 than by the elections for governor and senator combined. But California's anti-immigration measure is a rarity among the proposals on the ballot in the 24 states that allow legislation by plebiscite. Topping the ballot paper in other states are traditional measures on taxation, term limits and gambling. In the tax field, Florida, Missouri, Montana and Oregon are proposing to follow the example of Colorado and require voter approval for all future tax increases. Voters in all of these except Missouri will also decide on a separate measure requiring a two thirds majority vote for tax increases, as will Nevada voters. Oregon also has a sweeping proposal on the ballot which would repeal most state and local taxes, including the state income tax and local property taxes, and replace them with a 2 per cent 'equal tax' similar to a value added tax. Standard &amp; Poors, the credit rating agency, said it would have to review Oregon's debt if the measure passes. Massachusetts, meanwhile, will vote on an alteration to the state constitution that would permit a graduated income tax. California proposes an additional tax of 4 cents a gallon on petrol, while South Dakota will vote on a measure slashing property taxes, similar to California's Proposition 13 in 1978. California also has a number of tax measures, among them a payroll tax and a tobacco tax, included in a proposal to set up a statewide single payer health system similar to Canada's. But after the defeat of the Clinton administration's efforts to carry out less radical reform of the health care system at the national level, the measure is expected to be heavily defeated. But higher tobacco taxes to fund additional health services are thought to stand a better chance in Arizona and Colorado. California will take a different approach to smoking in Proposition 188, which was put on the ballot by a group called Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions. Despite its name, this group is heavily financed by Philip Morris, the tobacco company. The proposal would, in fact, abolish the many tough anti-smoking ordinances passed by local governments in California and replace them with much weaker statewide controls. Also attracting considerable attention is Arizona's Proposition 300, which would require the state to assess the costs to the private sector of any regulation it imposed. Supporters say the measure merely implements the guarantee in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution that private property may not be taken by the government without compensation. But it is hotly opposed by environmentalists, which fear it will help lawsuits against environmental regulations. Limits on the number of terms elected politicians may serve remain a popular ballot initiative, appearing in at least eight states. In Colorado, voters will get a second bite at the cherry with a proposal to halve the number of consecutive terms a member of the US House of Representatives could serve from six to three. Term limits on federal office-holders, however, remain under a constitutional cloud. The US Supreme Court is due to decide on their legality this session. Proposals to authorise gambling are another staple of the ballot initiative process. This time, voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and New Mexico will get a chance to approve state lotteries. In Florida, Arkansas, Rhode Island and Wyoming, casinos will be up for approval. Missouri, which already allows river-boat gambling on games of skill, is asking voters whether to allow games of chance, which would open up the lucrative slot machine market. In Colorado, a measure to allow slot machines at airports is on the ballot, while Minnesota is asking for approval of off track betting on horse races. Crime is a popular ballot measure this year, with proposals mandating long prison sentences up for approval in Oregon and Colorado, and a victims' rights measure in Alaska. Georgia voters will consider a constitutional amendment providing mandatory life sentences for a second violent felony, while Californians will vote on a 'three strikes and out' proposal imposing mandatory life sentences for a third violent felony. The proposal largely duplicates an existing law passed by the state legislature, but if approved by voters on November 8 it will be much harder to repeal in the future.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: CME designs new currency swaps - Derivatives Ever since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange first launched foreign currency futures in 1972 it has been trying to find ways to bring a larger portion of the interbank foreign exchange trade on to its dealing floor. The interbank market, with some Dollars 1,000bn in daily turnover, is a fat target for any of the world's exchanges, but a difficult one. The interbank market is highly liquid, pricing is straightforward, default rates are remarkably low, and longstanding credit lines back up trading relationships. In designing its new Currency Forward Contracts, the exchange has drawn on its experience with its very successful eurodollar futures and options contracts. 'Currency Forwards have the potential to become a primary swap pricing mechanism like eurodollars have become,' says Mr Clifford Besser, a former options trader who has spent the past year making markets in the CME's Rolling Spot pit. Noting that forward swaps (usually a spread with one leg in the spot market and one on a forward date) comprise about 40 per cent of all foreign exchange transactions, the CME hopes its version of forwards will offer enough incentives that they will eventually win over a substantial amount of interbank trade. Used in conjuction with the CME's year-old Rolling Spot contracts, the exchange products can replicate over-the-counter currency swaps. Those swaps typically are bets on the movement of the interest rate differentials between two currencies over time. The exchange says its forwards offer at least three distinct advantages: unlike interbank currency forwards, CME forwards don't tie up bank credit lines, and so are particularly attractive for locking in interest rate differentials between currencies for periods beyond one year; banks trading the exchange products do not have to be concerned with BIS capital adequacy requirements; and finally, credit risk is minimal because the CME clearing house acts as counterparty to each trade. The cost savings using the CME can be significant - in the interbank market, credit lines and capital charges can add up very quickly - but that feature may be lost on bank traders, who are not directly responsible for their transaction costs. For the CME products to have a chance at success, the exchange will have to attract and maintain sufficient liquidity to keep the nascent market going over the long period it will take to wean banks away from established practices. Mr Garret Glass, senior vice-president and head of market risk management at First National Bank of Chicago, notes that foreign exchange transaction costs are insignificant to banks on a trade-by-trade basis. However, he says: 'Over time, we've found that a bank would be better off using a clearing house for foreign exchange trades.' The CME launched its Currency Forwards on September 12 with a Dollars /D-Mark product, and intends to expand with Dollars /yen contracts if D-Marks are successful. The forwards are valued at Dollars 250,000 each, trade in one-quarter point 'pips', or increments, and settle, in an unusual twist, into the CME's Rolling Spot currency contracts. Unlike the CME's currency futures, Currency Forwards are quoted in European terms, making the product compatible with the OTC markets. The contracts are listed two years into the future and expire on a monthly basis. Currency Forwards, pitched to please the interbank market, do not have much to offer the typical CME floor trader. The potential market is huge, but particularly in the forward swaps arena, prices do not move much, and provide few short-term opportunities. This does not bother the exchange, which recognises that the Currency Forward and Rolling Spot contracts, properly nurtured, could transform the CME into the world's first forex clearing house. Rather than depend on local traders, the exchange is relying on member banks to quote both sides of the forward and rolling spot markets. 'Our big challenge is to overcome inertia,' says Mr. Besser. 'Bank traders aren't very adventurous. We have to get big institutional traders to try us out,' he said.</p>

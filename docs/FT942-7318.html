			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Gas regulator feels pressure: Why Clare Spottiswoode has fallen from favour among MPs The appearance yesterday by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general, before a parliamentary select committee came amid a smear campaign directed at her competence, the circumstances of her appointment and her personal life. Ms Spottiswoode adopted a conciliatory tone before the Commons environment committee when she spoke about the financing of the Energy Savings Trust, a key element of the government's environment policy. It contrasted sharply with an earlier appearance during which she bluntly rejected the idea of passing on the costs of energy efficincy projects to gas consumers. MPs say that earlier testimony infuriated Mr Robert Jones, the powerful Conservative committee chairman who has championed the scheme. And it was also at that appearance that she alleged that her predecessor, Sir James McKinnon, had acted illegally in connection with implementing the programme, a statement she yesterday withdrew 'unreservedly'. But it is not clear whether her change in tone will end the smear campaign, which culminated this week in allegations that Ms Spottiswoode had an affair with Mr John Michell, a senior official at the Department of Trade and Industry who was involved in her selection. The DTI said it found no substance to back the allegations, and Ofgas officials say they are in the dark as to who might be orchestrating the campaign. Many industry observers and politicians say her initial performance in front of the committee prompted MPs and others to question her effectiveness. They believe that other dissatisfied parties within the gas industry and government simply joined the campaign as it gained momentum. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, noted that 'MPs are an unforgiving bunch and have been reluctant to put her poor performance down to inexperience. Her problem is that she has not made enough friends on the way up.' One executive at an independent gas marketer noted that 'enraged Tory MPs don't like to be told what to do'. Her suggestion that her predecessor had acted illegally clearly angered Sir James. She is said to be deeply embarrassed by the incident, and the two are no longer on speaking terms. One gas industry executive says the present frosty relationship is similar to that between Baroness Thatcher and Sir Edward Heath. Changes made at Ofgas by Ms Spottiswoode may also have alienated some staff members who were particularly close to Sir James. Some DTI officials may also feel miffed that Ofgas is taking the lead role in de-regulation, although Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, is known to have expressed strong support for Ms Spottiswoode. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is said by some officials to be 'wishing that the whole thing would just go away'. There has been speculation that some members of the government believe gas liberalisation will prove to be such a politically explosive issue close to the next election that the process should be slowed. One way to do this would be to deflect criticism onto the regulator. But the government could simply stall the process by not putting forward the necessary legislation. Independent gas marketers believe British Gas may also be whipping up press scare stories about widespread price rises as a result of opening up the domestic market. There are even suggestions that members of the British Gas 'old guard' may be fighting a rearguard action against the introduction of competition. Industry and Ofgas officials are concerned that the persistence of the smear campaign could endanger the liberalisation process. But Ms Spottiswoode appears determined to ride out the storm, although officials worry that her propensity for plain speaking and clear aversion to the present financing of the Energy Savings Trust could lead to additional difficulties.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UAW, GM OPEN CONTRACT TALKS  </P> <P> A ceremonial handshake today on the fifth floor of the massive General Motors  Corp. building began a process that some observers predict may end in a strike  of at least one Big Three auto maker in September.  </P> <P> Negotiations between the giant auto maker and the United Auto Workers union for  a new national labor contract got under way after a 10-minute photo opportunity  in which GM Vice President Alfred S. Warren Jr. and UAW President Owen Bieber  reached across a table to shake hands.  </P> <P> UAW talks with Ford Motor Co. will begin Thursday, with Chrysler Corp.  negotiations to open Friday. The three contracts expire at midnight Sept. 14.  </P> <P> As negotiators smiled inside, about 2,000 demonstrators gathered outside to  demand increased cost-of-living allowances for UAW retirees. Union leaders  earlier rejected an effort to make such allowances a key issue of the talks.  </P> <P> The demonstrators today chanted "Millions for Roger; peanuts for us," referring  to GM Chairman Roger Smith's hefty retirement plan.  </P></p>

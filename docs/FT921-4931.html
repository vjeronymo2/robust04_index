			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Brittan replies to critics of hardline EC view on mergers SIR LEON Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, yesterday launched a strong counter-attack against his critics on two fronts - rejecting calls for an independent European merger authority, and warning against the creation of monopolistic 'Euro-champions' through mergers. In a speech to a mainly German audience at a competition symposium in Innsbruck, Austria, Sir Leon said that to wave through anti-competitive mergers would be to subject European industry to 'a cruel deception'. It was better to follow the Japanese example and encourage fierce competition on the domestic market, he added. Sir Leon's speech was partly aimed at his colleague Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, who is from Germany, and at Mr Wolfgang Kartte, head of the German cartel office, who represent the two sides of the debate on competition and industrial policy. Mr Bangemann - who hit out last month at the influence of competition 'ayatollahs' on EC policy - believes that Sir Leon should sometimes take a more lenient and less legalistic attitude to borderline merger cases. Mr Kartte, for his part, has attacked the Commission for not being rigorous enough. In a passage obviously aimed at Mr Bangemann, who is also responsible for the single market, Sir Leon said that the Commission's 17-month-old merger control task force would continue to examine takeovers according to the existing market situation. 'You cannot just assume, because we would wish it that way, that the whole of the European Community is the true market for a product,' he added. Mr Bangemann has criticised Sir Leon for recommending rejection of the proposed Franco-Italian takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, last October. The European Commission has asked the German government to come up with an urgent restructuring plan for the ailing east German shipbuilding industry, as a condition for lifting the EC's ceiling on state aid to the shipyards, writes Andrew Hill. Government grants to shipbuilders are covered by legislation that outlaws production aid worth more than 9 per cent of contract value.</p>

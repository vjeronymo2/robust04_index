			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Art-nouveau cabinet sells for a record Pounds 793,500 A writing cabinet designed in 1904 in art-nouveau style by Glasgow architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, sold for Pounds 793,500 at Christie's yesterday. It was much above its top estimate of Pounds 300,000, and set a record for Mackintosh and for any item of 20th-century furniture. The desk was the highlight of a collection of designs and furniture by Mackintosh assembled during the past 50 years by the architect Dr Thomas Howarth. The 143 lots totalled Pounds 2.27m as against a pre-sale estimate of about Pounds 1m. A high-back oak chair, probably designed about 1899 for Mackintosh's own use, sold for Pounds 309,500 (estimate Pounds 30,000-Pounds 40,000), and a large watercolour, 'The wassail', made Pounds 80,700. Two other collections were offered yesterday. Christie's South Kensington sold the archive of original art work for the comic postcards produced by Bamforth, the printers, for Pounds 88,000. The pre-sale estimate was Pounds 20,000 plus. Sotheby's raised Pounds 300,000 (estimate Pounds 200,000) from almost 1,500 items assembled as a modern 'cabinet of curiosities' by Lord McAlpine, the former Conservative party treasurer. The top price among the postcards was Pounds 3,850 (estimate Pounds 150-Pounds 250) paid for a lot of 11 items, including the art work for a card known as 'Hey Sonia]', showing a skater performing on the ice minus her underwear. It was Bamforth's most successful card. Among Lord McAlpine's curiosities, a late 18th-century painting of a Fijian sold for Pounds 4,600. More bizarre was the Pounds 2,530 given for a panther skeleton (estimate Pounds 300-Pounds 400). A group of seven pilgrim badges, bought as souvenirs in the Middle Ages by visitors to the shrine of a saint, also made Pounds 2,530.</p>

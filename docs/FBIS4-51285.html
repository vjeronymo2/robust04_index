			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 26 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton Thursday [26 May] announced his decision to renew  China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status and delink the  MFN renewal from human rights issues.    Meanwhile, he decided to ban imports of guns and ammunition  from China.    He also announced that the United States would maintain the  existing sanctions imposed on China since 1989, including the  denial of participation in the U.S. trade and development  assistance program, U.S. opposition to non-basic human needs  loans to China by the World Bank and suspension of weapons  deliveries.    Speaking at a White House press conference, Clinton said  that  extending MFN "will avoid isolating China and instead will  permit us to engage the Chinese with not only economic contacts  but with cultural, educational and other contacts." "We have to  see our relations with China within the broader context of our  policies within the Pacific-Asian region," he noted.</p>

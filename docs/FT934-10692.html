			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Sunday working more common ABOUT 40 per cent of the working population work on Sunday usually or sometimes, according to an analysis of the 1992 Labour Force Survey. About 3m people - 12 per cent of all people in employment - usually work on Sundays and 7m (28 per cent) sometimes do. Regular Sunday work is more common among the self-employed (22 per cent) than employees (11 per cent). Since 1985 about one in four people have worked on at least one Sunday in the previous four. Hotels and catering (34 per cent) and railways (30 per cent) had the highest proportion of regular Sunday working. Of staff in the retail sector, some 29 per cent of all employees sometimes or normally work on Sunday. Among employees not working on Sundays, attitudes towards doing so were almost equally divided: 43 per cent were in favour of doing so, while 48 per cent were opposed. Of those already usually or sometimes working on Sundays, 52 per cent were satisfied and 21 per cent dissatisfied. Only 13 per cent of employees who did not work on Sundays agreed with the statement: 'I have moral or religious beliefs which would stop me working on Sunday.'

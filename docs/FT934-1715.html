			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / People: Bond resigns from Arjo Wiggins Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, has dismayed UK institutions again with its announcement yesterday that the charismatic Gordon Bond, its American executive director, has resigned. Bond, who previously ran the US Appleton operations, was only appointed in January as chief executive of the company's printing and writings division, which included the European carbonless papers, fine papers and coated papers businesses, as well as Ceasa, the group's pulp mill in Spain. The move is a serious blow for AWA. Of the group's operational directors, Bond was undoubtedly the most successful and had the highest profile. AWA's shares closed down 23p to 226p. Although AWA would not say what had caused the boardroom bust-up, there appears to have been a personality clash between the strong-willed French chief executive Alain Soulas and Bond who was used to running his operations with considerable freedom. Behind the scenes AWA stressed the resignation had had nothing to do with any deterioration in the performance of Bond's division, nor any disagreement over the group's strategic direction, nor by any desire to relocate the group to France. The group has a substantial minority French shareholder.</p>

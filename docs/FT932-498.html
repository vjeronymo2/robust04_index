			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Bosnians seek to end deadlock MEMBERS of Bosnia's multi-ethnic presidency said in Geneva yesterday that they would be going to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, today to try to persuade its current head, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, to rejoin the peace negotiations. Mr Franjo Boras, Croat head of a seven-strong presidency delegation to the Geneva peace talks, said the Sarajevo meeting would be followed within a few days by a second session 'elsewhere in Bosnia'. Mr Izetbegovic, together with Mr Ejup Ganic, his vice-president, have so far boycotted the talks on the proposed division of the country into a confederation of three ethnic mini-states, which Mr Izetbegovic has condemned as tantamount to genocide for the Moslems. The international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, are hoping the new plan will at least guarantee the Moslems their own viable and secure geographical entity. It was not clear if the two mediators would attend the Sarajevo meeting, but diplomats said both were expected to travel to the Croatian capital, Zagreb, to be close at hand. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said yesterday that Serbs and Croats were close to an 'overall agreement' on Bosnia's ethnic division and urged Moslem leaders to return to the negotiating table. Speaking after talks with Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader. Mr Karadzic said the two sides had agreed on everything except a map of the three ethnic mini-states they are demanding. 'The only part that remained to be agreed is the map of the three republics and both Serbs and Croats are ready to form their own states,' he said. Earlier, Mr Karadzic had promised the Moslems nearly 30 per cent of Bosnia, but warned that Serbs and Croats would not hesitate to carve up the country between them if the Moslems did not negotiate. 'If they fail to do so, Bosnia will in effect be split into two parts. Some of the Moslems will remain with us, while the Croats will get the others,' he told the Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug.</p>

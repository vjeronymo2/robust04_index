			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Porsche to shed another 850 jobs as sales slide PORSCHE, Germany's fading star of the luxury sports car business, is to shed a further 850 jobs in the coming financial year. Together with other economies, including 'killing sacred cows' in management and production methods, the cuts will reduce operating costs by DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) in 1992-93, Mr Arno Bohn, chairman, said yesterday. The job losses, which will include 300 production workers and bring the workforce down to around 7,000, follow a cut of 950 in the year to July 1992. Despite the dire state of the international market for the group's cars and a 25 per cent drop in sales to DM2.5bn, Porsche will still show a profit for 1991-92, Mr Bohn said. Pre-tax earnings in the first half slumped 97 per cent to DM2m on sales of DM1.1bn. The company could break even on sales of 21,000 cars, Mr Bohn added. Deliveries in the current year totalled 22,000, compared with around 26,000 a year earlier and about 50,000 in the mid-1980s. Production was expected to fall 'slightly' next year. Production lines are currently working at just over 60 per cent of capacity. At present there were no real signs of improvement in international markets. 'The desire to buy luxury goods is not there,' Mr Bohn said. 'And there are problems with the social acceptability of cars costing DM100,000 or more.' The US, which once imported 30,000 Porsches a year, has taken just 4,000 this year, after 6,100 in 1990-91. Germany is now the mainstay of the business, with sales of 8,000 cars this year. In Britain, the figure is around 1,200 compared with 2,000. Sales in Japan have risen by about one-third to about 3,300. Meanwhile, Mr Bohn stressed that despite offers from Mercedes-Benz and others, the family-controlled company is still not for sale. 'The independence of Porsche is the central aim of the family and the board,' he said. More concerned with survival than bidding for glory, the company has no plans to re-enter Formula 1 racing from which it withdrew in 1989. Mr Bohn estimated racing at that level now costs DM250m a year 'without a driver'. Last year, Porsche spent less than DM20m on motor sport sponsorship.</p>

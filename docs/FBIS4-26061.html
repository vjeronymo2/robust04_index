			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China's largest  manufacturer of unmanned planes is working to expand its  overseas market.    Officials from the Aisheng group under Northwest Engineering  University said that in one or two years they plan to export two  new models of unmanned planes, which can be used in monitoring,  location and tracking of targets on the earth.    The group has already exported over 30 of its unmanned  planes  to South Asia, Africa and South America. The good performance  of these planes have been highly appreciated by the overseas  customers, said the officials.    Since 1958, the group in the capital of northwest China's  Shaanxi Province has produced more than 6,000 unmanned planes of  13 types, which have found a wide use in border patrols, the  anti-drug fight, aerial surveying and disaster observation.    The group's latest unmanned plane was developed last year.  The officials said its overall technical level is  state-of-the-art internationally.    Weighing less than 85 kg, the plane can fly as high as 5,000  m at 100 m per second. It has an optimum flight duration of one  hour or 40 km and is equipped with advanced electronic  instruments, said the officials.    The group has received many inquiries from overseas about  buying unmanned planes for various uses, the officials added.</p>

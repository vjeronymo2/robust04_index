			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Adams demand for talks strains peace initiative Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, yesterday put further strain on the Anglo-Irish peace initiative by calling for 'direct and unconditional dialogue' with the two governments. In his second statement in two days, Mr Adams criticised London and Dublin for 'contradictory statements' on the issue of self-determination. He said the peace process would be 'difficult, dangerous and protracted'. Downing Street brushed aside Mr Adams' demands, saying it would not 'enter into exchanges with Sinn Fein through the media'. Both British and Irish officials said Sinn Fein's inclusion in talks was 'predicated upon a true cessation of violence'. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist home affairs spokesman, described Mr Adams' comments as a 'cynical manoeuvre' to try to 'suck the government into direct negotiations while violence is continuing'. However, the gulf between the province's two unionist parties was reflected in a comment by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party. He accused the Ulster Unionist party of 'prostituting' itself by going along with the initiative. Mr Adams said Sinn Fein would not be 'intimidated by any threats'. But he expressed optimism that 'if properly managed' a process to bring lasting peace could be established. He said Sinn Fein wanted to make the Major-Reynolds declaration 'the beginning of the end'. Downing Street said there was 'no question' of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, attending talks that the British government has offered Sinn Fein within three months of an end to violence. Fifty-six per cent of people in Northern Ireland approve the joint declaration, according to an ITN poll released last night. However, twice as many nationalists (87 per cent) as unionists (43 per cent) give it their support. A total of 61 per cent said they would vote in a referendum for the province to remain in the UK, with 25 per cent supporting the idea of it becoming part of an all-Ireland republic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Arms Self-Sufficiency"] </F>   [Text] Since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979,  the superpowers have incessantly mobilized all their resources  to weaken and eventually, if possible, to help topple the  newly-born regime in Iran.    At first they used their local agents to disturb the peace  and tranquility in every corner of this country from Kordestan  to Gorgan and Khuzestan. Unable to use ethnic differences to  have them fight against one another because of their Islamic  sense of brotherhood and equality principle, in which all Muslim  Iranians believe regardless of their ethnic backgrounds, the  arrogant powers decided to arm to the teeth the Iraqi army for  their malicious purposes.    Despite the support provided by the West and the former East  as well as all the rich Arab shaykhdoms of the Persian Gulf, the  Iraqi regime failed to accomplish its mission. Eight years of  sacred defense and self-sacrifice by the Iranian combatants,  foiled the efforts of superpowers to overthrow the Islamic  regime.    Although their plots have been futile so far, however, the  arrogant powers' conspiracies have not ended and it does not  seem they will give up any time soon. Indeed, as the leader of  the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamene'i, said in his  Wednesday meeting with the commanders of the Army, Navy and the  Air Force, the Iranian armed forces should be alert and  vigilant, because the enemy is "wounded and dangerous".    If in 1980 Iraq's excuse for imposing war on Iran was its  sovereignty claim over Arvand River, who knows, may be one day  the arrogant powers decide to use the issue of the three Persian  Gulf islands as an excuse to meddle in the internal affairs of  the region's countries.    The Iraqi-imposed war taught us a lesson to remember. We  must break the chains of dependency on all fields, in  particular, in as far as the military technology and training  are concerned. While the former regime's armed forces heavily  depended on American and British military advisers and hardware,  the Islamic Republic Armed Forces are working to become  self-sufficient in all terms possible.    The Iranian news agency IRNA reported Friday that an Iranian  manufactured tank named Iran Leopard was combat-tested by the  Self-Sufficiency Jehad Department of the armed forces. The tank  has been designed in such a way so as to have more maneuvering  power than those employed by other countries' and costs one  third its foreign-made counterpart. The good news came at the  time that the Iranian armed forces are preparing to celebrate  the Army Day (Monday April 18.)    While other countries of the Middle East depend on foreign  military technology, Iranian armed forces, are doing their best  to design and manufacture a tank suitable for the country's  terrain and weather conditions. This is not only a big  achievement but also a major step forward toward improving  Iran's defense capabilities.</p>

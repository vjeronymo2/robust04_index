			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Wage rise rate eases fears on inflation The underlying rate of annual increase in average earnings was unchanged at 3.75 per cent in May, easing fears that rising wages would add to inflationary pres-sures. Average earnings growth started to increase late last year, with the underlying rate rising from 3 per cent in November to 4 per cent in March this year. But the annual rate fell to 3.75 per cent in April, where it has remained for three months. The Department of Employment said the main settlements announced in June were for agricultural workers, who received a 4.9 per cent rise, building and civil engineering workers at 2.4 per cent and British Rail drivers with 2.5 per cent. In the production and services sectors the annual rates of underlying average earnings growth were unchanged in June, at 4.25 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. In manufacturing the annual rate fell to 4.25 per cent, from a revised 4.5 per cent in May. Overall, the annual seasonally adjusted rate of earnings growth, which unlike the underlying rate does not exclude temporary factors such as the irregular timing of payments, fell to 3.6 per cent in June from 4.6 per cent in May. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'These figures are very encouraging and bear out our expectation that, unless pay settlements move up very sharply, and they show no sign of doing so, then underlying average earnings growth should remain at, or below, 4 per cent.' He added: 'There is absolutely nothing in these figures for the authorities to be worried about.' The Department of Employment said growth in unit labour costs - wages and salaries per unit of output - had slowed sharply. In the three months to June unit costs were just 0.1 per cent higher than in the same period last year, down from 1.3 per cent in the three months to May. Many analysts said they were pleased with the labour cost figures. Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'Sharp falls in manufacturing unit labour costs - by far the largest component of manufacturers' overall cost bill - should more than offset the impact of rising commodity prices.'</p>

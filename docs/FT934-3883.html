			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Granada's Weekend affair What Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, lacks in subtlety as a fighter he makes up with effective punching. Ever since it bought its stake in London Weekend Television, Granada has done little to hide its ambition to knock out LWT. The stake now looks like a cheap platform to fight the battle, while poor LWT finds most of its defences blocked. Its most direct way out - a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - would be difficult to organise. Shareholders might well look askance if such a move appeared to be a hurried poison pill defence. None of the other ITV companies is likely to top Granada's offer, and the possibility of a continental white knight may well prove a canard. LWT's chances of remaining independent rely on more subtle factors. Because Granada's cash alternative is 10 per cent below the share offer, the battle is essentially about paper and prospects. Granada's bid does look generous judged against this year's earnings, but shareholders also have to weigh the price at which they are prepared to sell scarce ITV licences. Network advertising revenues are likely to be depressed this year, so the bid is not as generous as it first appears. The lack of contiguous licence areas and combination of a weekend metropolitan operator with a seven-day northern franchise might trouble some. Yet LWT can hardly plead this in its own defence since it has formed a marketing alliance with Yorkshire. Both managements have done well in recent years, and Mr Robinson's argument that joint costs could be cut so that the deal would not dilute Granada's earnings deserves the benefit of the doubt. Under the rather arbitrary rules, the pull towards three large groups - Carlton/Central, Granada/LWT and Meridian/Anglia - is very strong. LWT will find that hard to shrug off. It may yet face a choice between going down fighting, or accepting a sweetened offer to take a dive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--The security agencies have  announced that the killing of a detective earlier today was  caused by indiscriminate gunfire resulting from a vendetta  between certain families. The gunfire occurred as voters were  going to cast their ballots in elections for the People's  Assembly members.    A security source stressed that at about 0820 today  Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Sulayman was driving in a government  vehicle belonging to the Housing Directorate accompanied by a  four-man force, a detective, and a sentry along the al-'Iqal  al-Bahri road. Another vehicle with an officer and four  soldiers happened to be driving behind the first vehicle. The  two cars came under indiscriminate gunfire, forcing the soldiers  in the back vehicle to return fire. The government vehicle  swerved and fell into a canal. Detective 'Atiyah was killed and  soldiers Jum'ah Makram Hasanayn, Muhammad Fathi Ahmad, Jamal  Makram Kamil, and sentry Muhammad Hasan Darwish were slightly  injured in the crash.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Having a correct understanding of the situation,  further achieving unity in thinking, and earnestly solving the  problems cropping up in the course of reform and development in  areas such as finance, agriculture, state-owned industrial  enterprises, taxation, and commodity prices were the major  contents of the important report Governor Chen Bangzhu delivered  at the meeting of prefectural commissioners and directors,  mayors, and county magistrates held yesterday.    Party, government, and Army leaders attending the meeting  were Chen Bangzhu, Yang Zhengwu, Liu Fusheng, Liu Zheng, Pang  Weiqiang, Hu Biao, Wu Xiangdong, Wang Keying, Shen Ruiting, (Yu  Haicaho), (Liu Yie), Zhu Dongyang, Zhou Bohua, Ban Guiyu, He  Wenbin, (Zhou Kanning), Long Yuxian, (He Xiaoqin), and (Xu  Jinfu).    At the meeting, Governor Chen Bangzhu delivered a  comprehensive work report. First, he said: In the first  quarter of this year, our province's situation was fine on the  whole. The key to consolidating and developing the fine  situation lies in having a firm grasp of the overall situation  of seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider the  outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability.  Particular efforts should be made to correctly handle the  relationship between reform, development, and stability.    When discussing the issue of state-owned industrial  enterprises in the course of reform and development, Governor  Chen said: Invigorating state-owned industrial enterprises is  the greatest difficulty in the current economy. Turning losses  into profits is the outstanding problem in current industrial  production. The provincial authorities are responsible for  helping 100 major enterprises turn their losses into profits and  must complete their objective.    On the agricultural issue, Governor Chen stressed: The  province's goal of striving for 76 million mu of land sown to  grain crops and a total grain output of over 50 billion jin for  this year must be attained. We should strive for 6 million dan  of cotton. While doing a good job of production, all localities  must attach importance to grain and cotton purchases. While  doing a good job of grain and cotton production, they must pay  keen attention to readjusting the structure of agricultural  production, further develop the secondary and tertiary  industries in the rural areas, and ensure that all peasants will  have an additional income of 100 yuan this year.    The governor also urged that banks in all localities should  put stress on deposits and continue to rectify the financial  order. Financial departments should open more sources of revenue  and pay close attention to revenues, and all localities should  work hard to develop the "shopping market" and "rice bag"  projects in the urban areas and the supply of capital goods in  the rural areas, and stabilize the market and commodity prices.    At the meeting, Yang Zhengwu, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee, delivered an important report on the  issues of social and political stability and structural reform.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [State of the Nation Address by President Carlos Roberto </F> Reina in Tegucigalpa on 8 March -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow countrymen: Thirty nine days ago I promised I  would carry out the moral revolution. The moral revolution has  begun in Honduras. Without any sort of experience, we have  taken the moral revolution's first and most important step: We  inaugurated a new style of government. As we said in our  campaign, we shall tell the people the truth about the country's  reality. Throughout the history of our country, politicians,  using demagogic phrases to reach power, have convinced the  people with pledges, only to govern against the country's  interests.    When I became president, I found an economy in crisis and  worse still, a people who are tired of deceptions and  unfulfilled promises. We found a huge foreign debt and a  gigantic social debt. In the new style of government, we will  call a spade a spade. No more hiding the truth from the  country; no more mirages to disguise sacrifices. The state of  the nation is worse than what we believed it to be before taking  office. Our resolve, however, is firm in the face of the great  task the people have entrusted to us.    First, we were told the fiscal deficit would be 3 percent of  the GNP; later, the previous administration confessed it was 5  percent. Now, we discover it is more than 10 percent. In the  old style of government, tough decisions were put off. Certain  points of elusive popularity were exchanged for those of lasting  sacrifices by the people -- the current electricity deficit is  just one example -- because proper measures were not taken;  technicians' recommendations were not heeded at the right time,  and today we are suffering unavoidable power blackouts because  of the need to ration electricity.    In the old style of government, Cold War tensions took  precedence over feelings of fatherland and sovereignty. In the  old style of government, the ideology of state affairs was above  respect for human rights. In that old style of government,  economic policies reflected more what foreign organizations  wanted than the [word indistinct] interests of the majority of  our people. In the old style of government, laws were bent when  they blocked powerful interests or when it was suitable to carry  out urgent business with quick profits. In the old style of  government, a few were awarded privileges at the expense of the  majority. In a nutshell, the old style took into account the  next election while forgetting the next generation by disguising  problems and putting off decisions. It submitted to foreign  demands; at home, it was corrupt; it purchased more than it  produced; it favored a few people while crushing many.    The truth that was hidden in the past now appears with its  load of problems -- all urgent and distressing -- but we are  ready to face them and begin to solve them. In the new style of  government, there will be no putting off difficult decisions; no  more giving in to inappropriate pressures; no more inequities in  the distribution and sacrifice of benefits; no more disregarding  the human factor when dealing with the economy.    As president of all Hondurans, I appear before the nation to  seriously and responsibly explain the country's difficult  situation and the measures to be taken.    It is necessary to point out that just when the new  government began its term, the inflationary pressures that had  been removed during 1993 flared up. During the first two months  of the current year, the estimated yearly inflation rate  skyrocketed to more than 24 percent. This means the price of  goods in the basic consumer basket has increased. The increase  was mainly sparked by the fact that prices, which the recent  past government had frozen by executive decree, were released at  the beginning of February and took an upward trend. Another  reason for the increase is the speculation carried out by  unscrupulous merchants.    Furthermore, [words indistinct] unwarranted measures that  did  not conform to the 1993 budget norms, prompted an increase of  expenses, subsidies, and investments. Such measures were so  detrimental that the former government's expenses exceeded its  revenues by 2.3 billion lempiras, which is more than 10 percent  of the GNP and five times the country's deficit. The former  government should have acted with fiscal responsibility and,  instead of thinking about electoral results, should have taken  into account that their actions would have adverse consequences  for most people.    Another element that contributed to this inflation is the  reasonable uncertainty about the transition period to the new  government. However, in this case, the situation was magnified  by concern over how the moral revolution government would react  to such a difficult economic situation.    I address all the sectors in the country -- workers,  peasants, professionals, and businessmen -- to say that the  government over which I preside will act with responsibility and  will work with the necessary seriousness and diligence, to  correct the serious imbalance in our public finances. To  further this end, we have instructed the Central Bank to prepare  a monetary program that agrees with the economic situation. We  have also taken measures which, despite the minor margins in the  available options, have already allowed us to rescue Honduras'  credibility and obtain the necessary support from abroad to  finance our commercial imbalance, which amounted to 2.18 billion  lempiras in 1993.    As president of Honduras, I have begun a fraternal  rapprochement with Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria  Figueres. We have agreed that Honduras and Costa Rica will  prepare joint platforms to resolve our respective problems,  especially those related to foreign relations, foreign  financing, and the defense of democracy. This agreement  anticipates excellent possibilities in the immediate future.    The actions we have carried out up to now have generated a  climate of prevailing trust and certitude. We no longer have  room for speculation. Thus, we expect those who use such  practices against society to abandon them immediately for the  benefit of their own peace of mind and to further the superior  interests of the majority.    I hereby reiterate to the Honduran people what they already  know from personal experience because they have suffered it  during the past four years at the hands of the dehumanized  neoliberals. I refer to the skyrocketing inflation rate, which  reached an annual average of 19 percent in the past four years.  True salaries have been reduced both in rural areas and cities.  All of this has contributed to impoverishing the Honduran  people even further, affecting mostly the middle and low-income  classes. It should not be necessary for me to expand on what  the people have already suffered. Inflation is the heaviest  burden that any government could impose on a nation. Consistent  with this, my government is determined to reduce the price hike  rate. We will offer to the great majorities the enormous social  benefit we have in store for them: prices in accordance with  their true salaries.    We will now discuss anti-inflation measures and the fiscal  deficit. To counter this inflation process in the short term,  we intend to reduce the fiscal deficit because, if public  expenditures continue to be managed in the same way or in much  the same way as the previous government managed them, the fiscal  deficit would amount to 2.7 billion lempiras in 1994. With this  in mind, and regarding expenditures, we have started a fiscal  year of austerity by reducing the central government's  expenditures by 10 percent. Apart from autonomous institutions,  this reduction will not affect priority social sectors.  Consistent with this goal, we are reprogramming public sector  investment by establishing an order of priorities.  Consequently, all the projects that have to be regarded as  unpostponable because of their importance as economic and/or  social development factors will be provided with the required  funds. The highway network's permanent maintenance and expansion  is one of these priorities. We will continue to allocate 35  percent of the country's budget to support social development  programs and to combat poverty.    There will be no more irregular subsidies, and we will only  keep those we can afford, according to the law and our financial  capability. The subsidy to the transportation sector is one of  them. Regarding revenues, we will implement the following  actions:    We will send to the National Congress the tax code bill the  implementation of which will allow us to improve the collection  of taxes and their management. This tax code will include  severe punishment for tax evaders and defrauders. Regarding  this same topic, we will send the National Congress an  initiative to increase the number of taxable products without  altering the 7-percent sales tax currently in effect. As far as  income tax is concerned, we will increase the minimum tax-exempt  income to compensate the inflationary effect and we will abolish  the 10-percent and 15-percent surcharge, to reduce that tax's  marginal rate to 35 percent.    We will endorse reforms to the provisional import law, and  we  will review public services tariffs according to the changes in  their costs. With these measures, we hope to reduce the fiscal  deficit, which, if we had continued to handle things the way the  previous government did, would have amounted to 11.2 [unit of  measurement not given] of the GDP for 1994. In this way we will  avoid having to finance the deficit with disproportionate  inflationary effects. Our efforts clearly show that, contrary to  the course of the recent past, the government will be the entity  that will have to sacrifice the most in correcting the fiscal  imbalance, with the austerity program implemented.    We will refer to the balance of payments. The balance of  payments deficit is structural. It constitutes one of the most  serious problems that we face. To solve it, therefore, requires  time. It mainly deals with strengthening and increasing  national production. In the short-term, the qualitative and  quantitative improvement of the production sector requires  foreign aid. In the medium-term, we propose to establish the  necessary mechanisms and instruments to increase credit offers  and improve technological conditions and marketing practices.    We have a medium-term financial plan of approximately $700  million with rapidly disbursed external funds to support the  balance of payments. The disbursement of these resources began  in 1994, and we expect to cover the financial gap to prevent  speculation with the foreign exchange rate. This will allow us  to attain relative stability with the foreign exchange rate and  protect the capability of our exports to compete.    We must now refer to two critical problems which afflict the  country and which we are looking into on a priority basis. One  of them is the grievous food problem that afflicts the majority  of the Honduran people. The government's action in the short  term will concentrate on the availability of and access to  credit for the agricultural production sector; organizing the  marketing of these products; and granting technical aid to small  and medium- level producers.    We will have tariffs to protect production of basic grains,  to render their price profitable for the producer and accessible  to the consumer. We will provide a weekly report on the status  of these prices. We will establish, according to our potential,  a credit fund in commercial banks to provide financing for the  production of these grains. We will establish rural savings and  credit funds and 60 percent of the Banadesa [National Bank for  Agricultural Development] credit line will be committed to  supporting agricultural production activities. We will maintain  a strategic reserve to prevent shortages.    The other critical problem is the electricity sector crisis.  We are aware of the vital importance of solving this complex  problem so we have issued the necessary instructions. As a  result of this, I can report that the 70-megawatt deficit we  inherited will be reduced to 62 megawatts in April and 13  megawatts in May; and the generation of electricity in December  will be equal to the demand. I assure my fellow citizens my  government is adopting the adequate measures to prevent this  deficit situation from recurring. As a result of this decision,  my government will provide sustained support to the private  production of electricity. We intend to establish a legal and  administrative framework that facilitates the necessary  procedures to render viable the private sector's participation  in the production of electricity.    We will also expedite the collection of accrued ENEE  [National Enterprise for Electric Power] bills -- 190 million  lempiras for the private sector only, as of 31 December. The  government and the ENEE will maintain the compensation mechanism  between that enterprise's debt and the government's energy  consumption.    Given its importance to the creation of jobs and its role in  the construction industry, my government will adopt the  necessary measures to guarantee a sufficient and timely supply  of cement.    My government knows it cannot limit itself to short-term  actions once we have implemented the measures aimed at solving  the problems we have outlined, and once their main effects have  been countered. Instead, we must strive to achieve the country's  overall development with realistic plans and programs, and the  creation of a general strategy that renders coherent the public  and private sectors' actions. A basic principle of our strategy  is to fulfill social needs and drastically reduce extreme  poverty before the 21st century begins.    It has been proven throughout history that the general  benefits of economic growth never extend automatically or  spontaneously to poor sectors. That alleged spilling over of  the benefits of growth also does not occur in the short term.  This is why the state is duty-bound to exercise its function of  maintaining a balance and of promoting the common good. We view  this social development policy as part of the overall  development strategy because it integrates the social and  economic sectors, consolidating the democratic process and  justifying the governments that emerge from it.    On the basis of these guidelines, my government has decided  to issue measures to immediately improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of the social policies and expenditures through  adequate coordination and technical management.    The poorest sectors will have priority in these actions. It  will promote access to employment through policies that lead to  the massive creation of jobs in keeping with the best traditions  of liberal governments.    We are reviewing labor laws to make them compatible with the  current demands of workers and businessmen, within the framework  of a policy of equitable, dynamic, sustained, and highly  competitive economic growth.    We will support the national action plan for development,  especially for human development, for children and youths,  giving priority to the establishment of conditions that offer  equal opportunities to women in all sectors of the nation's life.    Honduras' educational problem has its roots in the historic  negligence of governments. After the reform promoted by Ramon  Rosa [19th century liberal politician], no government has viewed  education as a true national priority. That grave historic  error explains why in our country we have a shameful illiteracy  rate while 5,000 teachers are unemployed. I promise to correct  this situation in my administration, which will allocate to the  education sector greater resources every year. I will  immediately instruct the Education Ministry to incorporate into  the education programs as soon as possible the civic,  democratic, and patriotic dimension that should be taught to all  Hondurans. In fulfillment of the commitment that I consider my  most important campaign promise, I have issued instructions to  the Education Ministry to begin a massive literacy program that  will make sure that the next century will find Honduras without  a single illiterate person. In this great task, we will  incorporate all sectors of society, including the Armed Forces.  I think all Hondurans have an unpostponable duty to be aware  that the eradication of illiteracy in our country is the most  honorable and productive goal we can establish. We must admit  that illiterate persons are the victim of social indifference  and that illiteracy is an affront to and a burden on all  society. The moral revolution pledges to foster the spirit that  will awaken consciences and instill determination to achieve  such a beautiful goal.    With strict observance of university autonomy ordered by the  Constitution, my government will give special attention to  higher education, aimed at improving its  scientific-technological quality and thus incorporating it into  the social production process.    In the health sector, we aim to achieve the following:  reduce  infant, prenatal, and maternal mortality 26-30 percent with  regard to the numbers registered in 1992. Likewise, we will  reduce severe malnutrition in children under five and the number  of infants with low birth weight. With the cooperation of  friendly nations, we have undertaken the task of resolving the  serious situation we found in the public hospitals. An order has  been issued for the immediate supply of medicines,  medical-surgical equipment, and all the supplies necessary for  these hospitals to fulfill their humanitarian tasks in an  appropriate and timely fashion.    In the environmental cleanup sector for the 90's, we have  adopted the goal established by the United Nations on a global  level for the previous decade. That is, provide water and  environmental cleanup projects for 50 percent of the population.  With the fraternal aid of some nations, we will take the  necessary steps to supply potable water to 2 million Hondurans  in the mid-term. To achieve this, a dynamic and sustained growth  process in production and jobs should be initiated as soon as  possible.    The government commits to reaching the goal of 5 percent  true  growth rate annually beginning in 1995. This would then  generate a true increase in per capita income by 2.2 percent. To  achieve these growth targets, substantially larger levels of  private investment and local savings than those obtained so far  are required.    During the past four years, investment opportunities have  been offered to private capital, however, the response to local  investment has been very poor. This indicates that the private  sector has not made the effort expected. We invite local and  foreign investors to participate in the development of Honduras  by increasing their investments in the sectors they are  interested in. Consequently, we are offering to achieve and  maintain a stable macroeconomics framework and a transparent and  fair system of laws, as well as attractive returns, particularly  in those sectors where Honduras has comparative advantages. One  of these is the manufacturing sector, particularly the  industrial processing zones. In less than four years, private  investment can generate up to 100,000 jobs. In all areas of  investment, my government will offer appropriate incentives,  particularly in tourism, mining, forest exploitation services,  and the export of traditional and nontraditional agricultural  products.    With the participation of the private sectors, we are  certain  we will achieve our goal of constructing 50,000 housing units in  the next four years. We have already begun negotiating with  construction and financing companies. We will promote and  stimulate the private sector to revitalize the industrial  sector, and we will support worker training programs.    Because of its great importance, we reiterate that Honduras  will establish favorable conditions for private investment.  Those conditions will allow private investors to participate in  providing public services, such as electricity generation and  telecommunications.    Regarding Hondutel [Honduras Telecommunications Enterprise],  after we study all the possible forms of privatization, we will  try to reach agreements with all the sectors involved. Once  this has been done, we will make every effort to get the  required approval from the National Congress to carry out the  designated transaction. The privatization will be carried out in  an exemplary and faultless manner. It must provide the people  with clear benefits. Any way, most of the resources obtained  from this transaction will be assigned to pay the social debt,  which has been pending for such a long time.    In the context of our development policy, we will give the  necessary incentives to private investment so its contribution  can reach significant proportions. We will also encourage the  repatriation of capital, which is one of our basic goals. To  this end, we will implement mechanisms that will expedite  paperwork and offer investors' security. One of our medium-term  goals is to ensure that the flow of capital closes the balance  of payment gap, boosts international reserves, and contributes  to foreign exchange stability. In order to increase the volume  of investments the country needs, it is necessary to increase  our domestic savings capacity in addition to maintaining  currency exchange in stable condition. The government will  modernize the national financial system to ensure that  savings-account holders obtain a better yield. In this respect,  the government will propose two laws to the National Congress:  the National Banking and Insurance Commission Law and the  Financial Institutions Law. Later, we will reform the Central  Bank Law and the laws dealing with companies, insurances, and  others.    We will give equal or more importance to the modernization  of  the social welfare system, which can be a key factor in the  development of capital markets. Therefore, we want a system in  which each contributor can establish his pension fund according  to his means. We will also evaluate the benefits of giving the  management of those resources to the private sector. The  government, however, would still be responsible for establishing  minimum payments, providing savings incentives, and guaranteeing  their security.    The economic transformation of Honduras requires a modern  and  efficient government, one the people who save can have  confidence in. One that offers guarantees to investors, and in  general, offers security and equitable treatment to nationals  and foreigners. To this end, the government pledges to  immediately start reforming the public sector and will emphasize  the following programs to further its objective:    Public administration, controlling corruption, strengthening  the state of law and civilian society, and reforming the  judicial system. In addition, the government will continue its  policy of commercial openness, and, among other benefits, it  will promote the international investments we need to complement  our financial and technological resources.    The government will maintain its commitment to the Central  American integration process as a platform to achieve high  quality production. We will support initiatives to strengthen  regional infrastructures, and thereby facilitate cooperation  among Central American producers to face competition challenges  in both regional and world markets.    We will also support the harmonization of macroeconomics  policies and public service costs in the region so as not to  disadvantage Honduran businessmen with our neighbors. Already we  are working hard to gain access to NAFTA markets and thereby  multiply Honduras' attraction for foreign investments. My  government, together with other regional governments, will  encourage Central America's entry into NAFTA. We will continue  negotiating with Caribbean countries, Mexico, Venezuela, and  Colombia, and will give priority to trade with Europe and Japan.    Environmental protection is one of my government's  priorities. Therefore, our development policies will incorporate  the principles of sustained use of natural resources and  environmental protection. In order to counter the accelerated  and progressive deterioration of forests, we will give priority  to the development of massive conservation and reforestation  programs, as well as the implementation of the Rio Principles on  Environment and Development.    Given its special importance, I believe it is pertinent to  reiterate that we have already recovered the government's  credibility in all internal sectors. I reiterate, we will keep  that credibility intact. We have also recovered our credibility  in friendly countries and international organizations, which  have already given us their support. I must stress that in my  opinion the agenda of those international organizations for the  90's is very similar to my government's social agenda, which  gives priority to human development.    Compatriots, in order to reach our objectives in the areas  of  social and economic development, investment, and savings, we  need the commitment and consensus of all sectors. I will  dedicate my efforts in the next few weeks to this initiative.  The signing of a social pact among all Honduran sectors is  absolutely essential. The gist of that pact will be to defend  our national interests and improve the quality of our lives.    I take this opportunity to call a national forum in which we  will all sign a national agreement for stability and economic  growth with equity; a forum to reach a consensus and obtain the  fruits we need for the benefit of the people.    Compatriots, the old government style meant a setback for  Honduras. We will emphasize moral aspects in our government  style because without them corruption advances, the country  retrogresses, and democracy is endangered. The government of the  moral revolution thinks about the present and the next  generation. It works to give future generations a greater  fatherland.    We are aware of the need to affirm our sovereignty over the  territories recovered in Naguaterique, Dolores and other  regions. It is a national goal that cannot be postponed any  longer. Something that can never be forgiven is that as result  of indolence or clumsiness, we avoided our obligation to  consolidate our legal ownership and provide effective attention  to our compatriots along the border through positive actions  commemorating the judicial victory of The Hague.    We are also interested in our youth. We want to offer and  encourage the transition to a voluntary military service system.  While the National Congress, however, independently decides to  follow through with the required constitutional reform, we will  seek a mechanism whereby the service will also include a greater  educational content and the conscription process will not result  in the same traumas it has caused in the past.    I am aware that the next generation needs to feel proud of  its ancestors. The next generation also needs its ancestors'  names to be unblemished. It does not need its ill-gotten gains.  Carlos Roberto Reina's descendants will receive a spotless name.  The president of the republic will not intervene, in any way, in  any type of business transaction or private association. There  will no longer be any classified allotments in the presidential  office, nor will we allow any in the government sector.    My fellow countrymen, an investigation into corruption  charges has already been launched. In this respect, we have  appointed preliminary intervention commissions at the National  Supply Agency for Basic Products, the Central Penitentiary, the  National Social Welfare Board, as well as other public education  institutions. Per an executive decree, we have established the  Intervention and Supervision Commission [Commission Interventora  y Fiscalizadora] with ample resources to investigate  indictments, inquiries by private citizens, and commissions  appointed for this purpose. The Intervention and Supervision  Commission includes two government representatives, two COEP  [expansion unknown] members, one representative of the workers,  one representative of professional associations, one member of  the opposition party, and a representative of the media.    Following a 60-day period, beginning the day it is sworn-in,  the commission will present a report on all the cases where  there is evidence of corruption. Each case will be transferred  to the appropriate courts subject to whatever legal action it  may merit. These commissions are not instruments of  retaliation; they are not courts to carry out witch hunts  either. The commissions cannot and do not pretend to replace  the justice system. Their responsibility is to prove whether or  not there is sufficient evidence of corruption. Once this is  determined, it is up to the judges to send the embezzlers to  jail.    We are not looking for scapegoats. We are looking for the  real criminals who always hide in their mansions. In a legal  state, criminals end up in jail when society is able to prove  they have broken the law. We understand and share the  population's concern with respect to a timely end to impunity  and penalties for criminals. We are working hard to accomplish  this. We already have evidence leading to the people responsible  for certain crimes against the people and the national economy.  The penalties must be implemented in a serious and objective  manner as demanded by the law. One wrong or prejudiced step  could encourage excuses or legal maneuvers to cover up the crime.    Honduras' moral revolution will only be possible with your  cooperation, with the courageous participation of every citizen  who knows an official took or is taking money that belongs to  all Hondurans. In the next 30 days, we will send a draft code of  conduct for public officials to the National Congress so we can  institutionalize technical principles to regulate the behavior  of managers of the Republic.    Fellow citizens, my government is firmly determined to take  on the great deficits we inherited. Overall, the government has  a coherent economic and social policy. The government has a  clear vision and direction toward the future, but that decision,  those policies, that direction, and that vision can only become  a reality with the participation of all Hondurans. As a  candidate, I offer [pauses] offered to launch a great national  agreement. Today, as head of state, I propose the agenda for  that great agreement.    We need a meeting of and pledge from all active sectors in  Honduras in connection with the vast national goal. We need a  strong agreement, and that requires a strong civilian society, a  strong private sector, and an equally strong state. A strong  state is not a large state; it is a legal state, meaning a state  which relies on the respect and trust of its citizens rather  than weapons. A state that is sovereign rather than submissive  in its dialogue with other states and with multilateral  organizations. A strong state is the one which exercises strong  leadership, assumes responsibilities, establishes goals, and  achieves solutions.    To achieve this we will accelerate the state's  modernization.  I hope to see the leaders of every sector together at a work  table, reaching agreements on ways to sponsor the overall  development of our homeland; jointly establishing, with a lofty,  patriotic, and fraternal spirit, prices and salary levels with  the humane goal of allowing salaried Hondurans of enjoying a  better lifestyle; jointly establishing production and  productivity goals to increase our country's capability to  compete; and establishing fair and intelligent agreements on the  procedures that will allow us to increase the offer of export  products, both traditional and nontraditional.    I hope the renewed and renewing spirit of a moral revolution  imbues all Hondurans with a spirit that, like a votive candle,  keeps alive the faith, decision, and courage to struggle and  attain new levels of development, prosperity for all, and the  moralization of the state's actions.    All this can happen based on the firm conviction that only  if  we move forward, united, will we be able to overcome the  obstacles we face, and only if there is fraternal solidarity  will we be able to safeguard social peace and build a Honduras  where equity and justice serve as the basis for prosperity.    Fellow countrymen, this message to the Honduran people  discusses only big problems that we must tackle right now. I  will address the country again in a few months with regard to  other aspects of my administration. It is necessary for the  people to be constantly aware of the country's situation, its  direction, and the main problems to be resolved. Knowledgeable  people can better contribute to their own well-being.    We are concluding the preparation of a plan to modernize the  state and public administration. I will refer to this problem  another time. In the 39 days of my administration, the moral  revolution has been initiated. Positive steps, fundamental to  the country's development, have been taken. The Supreme Court of  Justice is composed of honest and competent professionals. The  appointment of the nation's prosecutor general was a big step  forward. The new style of governing has elicited respect in  Honduras and for Honduras.    It is possible to move forward and to improve; it is  possible  to produce more and sell more; it is possible to begin  eradicating hunger and illiteracy; it is possible to control  corruption despite its many disguises; it is possible to live  better.    All this is possible only if it is based on our own efforts  as the prime mover of development. I greet the future with  optimism. I am enjoying these first steps on our march toward a  promising development. I know the people of Honduras will not  fail. The president of Honduras will not fail either. Thank you.</p>

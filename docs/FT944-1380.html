			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rise in carmakers enlivens Frankfurt bourse Last Friday's surge in the Dow lifted bourses in the morning, but its subsidence yesterday left them subdued, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's Dax index came back from an intraday high of 2,092.17 to close just 5.88 up at 2,075.94. In the post bourse, it eased further to an Ibis-indicated 2,066.59. Turnover fell from DM8.6bn, inflated by Frankfurt's own triple-witching process, to DM5.2bn. Carmakers were the prime feature of the day, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen rising DM12 to DM760, DM10.50 to DM757.50 and DM4.90 to DM427.90 respectively on the session, and the first two retaining about half of their gains after hours. At James Capel, Mr Bob Barber noted that the sector, the best performer in Europe until the end of October, had underperformed both in November and in this month to date. It was too late, he added, for share prices to be responding to last week's sharp upturn in November's European car registrations; and BMW's supply deal with Rolls Royce was better for prestige than it was for profits of any scale. It looked, he concluded, as if a trader-oriented market was simply indulging in a little more sector rotation. AMSTERDAM, too, retreated from early gains, the AEX index adding 2.47 to 410.85 after an earlier high of 412.88. Paribas remarked in its latest perspective that it was shifting its stance toward a more defensive investment strategy and away from cyclicals. However, brokers noted some interest in the cyclical sector yesterday with Hoogovens adding Fl 1.60 to Fl 74.40 and DSM up Fl 1.10 to Fl 135.20. Fokker, which suffered heavy selling last week after it warned of heavier than expected losses in 1994, recovered 80 cents to Fl 12.00, after a high of Fl 12.40. MILAN saw the battered lira, near an all time low against the D-Mark, provoke bargain hunting, particularly among foreign investors. The Comit index rose 1.49 to 607.26, largely ignoring political developments which suggested that the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was limping towards a parliamentary vote of no confidence, later in the week. Blue chips led the gains with Fiat, which has been attracting positive comment from analysts, L88 higher at L5,795. Montedison rose L14 to L1,141 but Ferruzzi dipped L27 to L1,140 as it was penalised for writing off credits from its former holding company, Serafino Ferruzzi, which could result in extra losses of L250bn in the 1994 accounts. Credito Romagnolo picked up L32 to L18,916 as hopes appeared to fade that Credito Italiano would launch a counterbid to Cariplo's L21,500 a share offer, regarded as high by many analysts. Credito Italiano was L54 higher at L1,650. PARIS offered a minimal advance with the CAC-40 index 3.93 higher at 1,928.09. Turnover was low at around FFr2.5bn. Generale des Eaux, which went against the trend with a fall of FFr5 to FFr509, after an early high of FFr524, was upgraded to market performer by Goldman Sachs. The US investment bank said that it had based its re-rating on the group's potential for restructuring and refocusing under new management. In addition the stock had underperformed the CAC by some 16 per cent since the start of the year. ZURICH lost a fraction, the SMI index receding 4.0 to 2,600.7as the market waited for today's FOMC meeting in the US. US selling left Swiss Re SFr21 lower at SFr766 as investors decided that there was limited potential from further gains after the recent strong performance. UBS bearers fell SFr23 to SFr1,062, with the bank seen as a seller in its own shares. Second-tier shares saw Ascom SFr20 higher SFr1,300 as it benefited from the naming of a new chief executive. Georg Fischer rose SFr70 to SFr1,600 after the engineering group reiterated that it still expected 1994 group net profit to exceed SFr50m. BRUSSELS fell back slightly overall, while Union Miniere continued to attract interest. The Bel-20 slipped 0.69 to 1,393.75 as the shares of the metals group lost BFr20 to BFr2,490. Brokers commented that Union Miniere had been heavily traded on technical factors after the expiry of a warrant last Thursday. There was news that a 1.1 per cent stake in the company had been sold by SGB, off BFr5 at BFr2,185. MADRID's general index fell 1.58 to 296.37. Telefonica was a sizeable loser, closing Pta35, or 2.1 per cent down at Pta1,610. Dealers said that the market was unsettled by the appearance before a high court judge yesterday of Mr Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banesto, to testify in connection with alleged criminal acts that contributed to the banking group's crisis a year ago. COPENHAGEN was little changed, the KFX index edging 0.04 higher to 91.58 as Danisco rose DKr3 or 1.5 per cent to DKr206 on sharply better than expected first half results. TEL AVIV, following a 2.71 drop to 170.66 in the Mishtanim index on Sunday, speculated on possible changes in the upcoming capital gains tax on securities transaction profits, and took the index up 5.71, or 3 per cent to 175.87 at one point. However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, said in the afternoon that the tax was to be implemented as scheduled on January 1, and the Mishtanim dropped to close 1.13 lower at 169.53.

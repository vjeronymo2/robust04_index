			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, April 2, RIA -- The candidates standing for  uniting with Russia enjoy the greatest popularity in Ukraine.  On the eve of the second tour of the parliamentary elections,  48 percent of the constituents are ready to vote for them. Such  are the results of the public poll in Ukraine conducted by the  Democratic Initiatives Centre and the Institute of Sociology of  the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.    A fifth of the polled believe that Ukraine can get out of  the  crisis only in a close political and economic union with Russia.  Nearly every fourth Ukrainian thinks it necessary for the  republic to join the rouble zone.    Twelve percent of the voters pin hopes on the bloc of the  parties headed by ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and ex-Vice  Speaker of the Parliament Vladimir Grinev who advocate the  restoration of severed contacts with Russia.    Seventeen percent of the people do not believe anybody. The  parties and organisations of Ukrainian nationalists are  supported by only two percent of the voters.</p>

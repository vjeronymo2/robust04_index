			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Spectra-Physics to sell US subsidiary for Dollars 69m SWEDEN's Spectra-Physics AB is selling one of its US subsidiaries for Dollars 69m in a move aimed at reducing group borrowings and focusing more on core businesses. The purchaser of Spectra-Physics Analytical is the Massachusetts-based group, Thermo Instrument Systems, a specialist in making instruments which are used to detect and monitor air pollution, radioactivity and other substances. The sale comes two and a half years after Pharos, as Spectra-Physics was formerly known, acquired the US group Spectra-Physics and more than doubled its size. The group became heavily indebted following the purchase, and a big outstanding dollar loan has increased in krona terms following the Swedish currency's effective devaluation. Spectra-Physics, which is 80 per cent owned by Nobel Industries, specialises in laser technology, microwave technology and industrial measurements. The unit being sold manufactures and sells liquid chromatography analytical instruments and data systems used in quality testing and research laboratories.</p>

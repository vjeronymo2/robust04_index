But  it is far from likely that every inhabitant of the region could  say with certainty just what comprises the essence of the issue  and what it is that our neighbors on the other side of the Amur  are striving to attain. Naturally, quite a number of disputes  and various positions have emerged on the subject of border  demarcation. In this article Ivan Kandaurov, member of the Amur  Region Russian Geographic Society, expresses his point of  view.    A great quantity of material has been written on demarcation  of the Russian-Chinese border. But the individual, practical  aspects of demarcation remain a secret for inhabitants of the  Far East in general and the residents of Khabarovsk in  particular. Nor do regular public presentations by Genrikh  Vasilyevich Kireyev, special assignment ambassador of the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and head of the demarcation  effort, provide any clarification.    No one disputes that the Russian-Chinese border must be put  in order, because according to the Aygun (1858) and Beijing  (1860) Treaties, in the interests of China (against whom England  and France manifest aggression and there was danger that a unit  from a British-French squadron would envelop China's rear using  the Amur and Ussuri), the border was determined by the right  bank of the Amur and left bank of the Ussuri, i.e., the water  surface was controlled, and later assimilated, by the Russian  side. According to the present protocol, the border is to be  determined according to the generally recognized international  principle: on navigable rivers--along the centerline of the main  channel; on nonnavigable rivers--along the centerline of the  river or its main branch.    One would think such a formulation of the issue would suit  the Chinese--they would get about 2,000 square kilometers of  island territory in an entirely civilized resolution of the  problem. However, attempting to take advantage of the unstable  domestic situation in Russia, the Chinese desire to annex as  well the Tarabarovo-Ussuri island group, whose total area  amounts to about 30 square kilometers.    Mikhail Gorbachev and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh signed a treaty  on demarcation efforts (May 1991) at a time that was not the  most advantageous for the Soviet Union (Russia). They were  unable to secure a protocol on project implementation which  would incorporate the entire border trace without excluding  "certain sectors." Reaching agreement with the exception of  "certain sectors" owing to the unyielding demand of the Chinese,  our side found itself already in an unequal position, and the  apple of discord remained for future generations.    One of these exceptions is the section of border that runs  along the Kazakevichevo Channel near Khabarovsk. A half-and-half  decision in this instance is impermissible and fraught with the  prospect of further border complications that could have  unforeseen consequences. To facilitate the demarcation process,  the 4,300 kilometers of border were split up into 10 sectors.  There is a hidden danger here that efforts will be coordinated  by sector beforehand, causing the overall picture to become  fragmented and the problem of border sectors in dispute--the  Kazakevichevo Channel for example--to fade from memory. This  would clearly not be to Russia's advantage.    Quite some time prior to the time demarcation efforts were  begun, the Chinese had already decided the fate of the  Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands. Thus, page 72 of the atlas of  Heilongjiang Province, published back in 1986, shows the  Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands as Chinese territory (!). This atlas  is distributed at various international conferences, i.e., the  concept is being imbued in people of the Far East that the  Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands sooner or later will be transferred to  China. Moreover, in designating these islands as a part of their  territory, the Chinese have informed the entire world that the  islands belong to China but are (in fact) within Russia. In  other words, it happens that Russia is acting as the aggressor  in this instance, having occupied lands belonging to China, and  must therefore supposedly return them. The Chinese even invented  a name for this island group--the Fuyuang Triangle.    The Russians have repeatedly attempted to deepen the  Kazakevichevo Channel, to make it navigable and admit Chinese  river vessels from the Amur to the Ussuri through it, thereby  reducing the journey. But the Chinese categorically object,  believing that this is not a border channel, but a channel  belonging to territorial China. Therefore, Chinese ships pass  through at Chumka--precisely where our neighbors believe the  border should pass. In this regard, whereas previously Chinese  ships passing from the Amur to Amur Channel and back were  accompanied by the Russian border service, now the Chinese  exercise free reign.    We know from the history of Russian-Chinese relations that  these islands have belonged to Russia since the time of the  signing of the Aygun and Beijing Treaties. Moreover, Russia has  invested significant monetary and material resources in the  exploitation and development of arable land on these islands and  is utilizing them fairly actively to supply the people of  Khabarovsk with agricultural products. The islands are included  within the Khabarovsk Rural Rayon and belong chiefly to the  agricultural enterprise Zarya. Older residents of Khabarovsk  remember how some 20 or 30 years ago the waters of the Amur and  Amur Channel met in a powerful current at the Amur (Muravyev)  Cliffs. The flow velocity of the two currents was such that it  was difficult for a motorboat to travel against them. This no  longer happens, because the Amur has changed its course and now  flows into the Beshenaya and Penza Channels. While the Ussuri  islands are growing due to the formation of an ever enlarging  spit which can clearly be seen from the Amur Cliffs even when  the water is at mid-stage.    Ecology experts have determined that the Amur is changing  its  course not in spontaneous fashion, but singlemindedly in the  direction of the Russian shore under the influence of artful  hydrotechnical structures set up by the Chinese on their shores.    As a result, well known Damanskiy Island, in mid-stream of  the Ussuri River, has been turned into a peninsula by the  Chinese and taken away from Russia entirely apart from any  demarcation effort, with the silent consent of the Russian  leadership. The Chinese are going all out in the resolution of  all the border issues and, unfortunately, success is presently  accompanying them.    If at Khabarovsk the border passes along the Amur main  channel, and the Chinese consider that the Ussuri flows into the  Amur Channel not at the village of Kazakevichevo but merges with  the Amur at the Amur Cliffs, then as time passes Kabelnyy Island  and others will join with the Tarabarovo-Ussuri group. And this  is no fantasy. With such a solution to the problem, it may turn  out that the railroad bridge (and tunnel as well) at Khabarovsk  will pass through the territory of our adjacent state.    Count Muravyev-Amurskiy, who signed the Aygun Treaty and  prepared the signing of the Beijing Treaty, stated: "Russia's  presence here is firm and long-standing!" God willing, may his  prophecy come true.    Genrikh Kireyev, in Khabarovsk in March of 1993, conducted  several meetings with the leaders of Khabarovsk Kray in which he  told those present that border demarcation efforts should be  undertaken in a kind of semi-secret mode, without broad  participation on the part of the concerned populace.    L. Ivanyuta, former deputy head of administration of  Khabarovsk Kray, became a member of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs commission from Khabarovsk Kray on a purely formal  basis. While Vladimir Vasilyevich Simakhin, chief inspector for  geodesic oversight in the Far East (I note--in the entire Far  East), lives and works in Khabarovsk, is a professionally  trained specialist, and has an excellent understanding of the  issues related to the determination of land and sea borders. And  I believe his services would prove very useful to the commission  of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But Vladimir  Vasilyevich has been spending a great deal of time attempting on  his own to get into the commission of the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs on demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border. He  has traveled to Moscow repeatedly, but all in vain.    Taking advantage of an extremely favorable environment, the  Chinese are hastening to get the demarcation work done,  especially in those areas of the southern Maritime region where  the border runs along dry land. The situation may change sharply  for the Chinese if people accede to power in Russia who put  first emphasis on the question of fighting for the interests of  great Russia and its indigenous peoples who several centuries  ago assimilated this semi-desert territory and initiated  "Russian life on the Amur."    When Khabarovsk Kray head of administration V. Ishayev  stated  in one of his interviews--"We will never agree to hand over the  Great Ussuri and Tarabarovo Islands," the Chinese consulate in  Khabarovsk immediately requested clarification: Was this the  official position of the authorities or was the governor  speaking as a private citizen?    When Viktor Chernomyrdin was in Khabarovsk, he stated that  we  would not give up one inch of our land, including the islands  near Khabarovsk. He stated this clearly in Russian--directly,  openly, and firmly. But this is no consolation to the people of  Khabarovsk. The problem remains an open issue. At this same  conference, he also "removed" the problem of the Kuril Islands.  But the development of events has shown that the problem remains.    Territorial games have always concealed within themselves  danger and unforeseen consequences. I therefore consider it  necessary to petition the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  with a proposal to undertake measures and insert in the protocol  an additional point on completing work on the border section  which runs along the divide of the Kazakevichevo Channel (near  the disputed Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands). This matter must be  considered a vitally important issue for Khabarovsk Kray,  especially for future generations. The issue should be  officially presented before the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs regarding the inclusion of V. Simakhin, chief inspector  for geodesic oversight in the Far East, as a member of the  Commission on Demarcation of the Russian-Chinese Border.  Petition should also be made to include G. Levkin within the  joint Russian-Chinese working group for Khabarovsk Kray. Levkin  is a reserve colonel, a topographer with higher education, a  participant in the demarcation of the Russian-Mongolian border,  a historian, and a student of local folklore.    Until these questions are resolved, the work on demarcation  in Khabarovsk Kray should be halted.</p>

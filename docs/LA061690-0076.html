			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GANGS TARGETED IN FEDERAL SWEEP;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: MORE THAN 160 CRIPS AND BLOODS ARE ARRESTED IN 11 STATES.  EXPANDED DRUG DEALING PROMPTED THE TWO-DAY OPERATION, AGENTS SAY.  </P> <P> More than 160 suspected affiliates of the Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods  gangs were arrested in a novel two-day sweep by federal agents seeking to check  a national migration of the city's street violence, authorities announced  Friday.  </P> <P> In what they dubbed "Operation Streetsweep," agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms arrested 166 people in 11 states and seized an unspecified  amount of drugs, guns and cash. The raids began early Thursday and were not  expected to end until late Friday night, ATF officials said.  </P> <P> Agents said the sweep -- two years in preparation -- was prompted by the  budding expansion of the gangs' drug-dealing operations out of Southern  California and into other corners of the country. In recent years, members of  Crips, Bloods and other L.A. street gangs have been identified in scores of  cities across the country.  </P> <P> "The Crips and Bloods were targeted because their level of violence has spread  with the spread of drugs," ATF Special Agent Andrew Vita told a Los Angeles  press conference. "We have investigations going in 32 other states and 69 other  cities."  </P> <P> Vita said 135 gang members were arrested in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San  Bernardino and San Diego counties. Other arrests were scattered across Northern  California and 10 other states, including Louisiana, Oregon, Arizona, Missouri,  Oklahoma and Washington.  </P> <P> Another 100 were expected to be arrested later Friday and through the weekend.  </P> <P> "We managed to get about 75% to 80% of those we were looking for," Vita said.  "We hope to get the rest soon."  </P> <P> In San Diego County, five gang members have been arrested since the sweep  began, and more arrests are expected, according to a press release from the  local ATF office.  </P> <P> The county probation office assisted the sweep by providing the names of five  known gang members who are on probation in the area, said Tom Pautler, director  of special operations. Probation officials told the bureau whether the  condition of the gang members' probation allows searches of their residences  without warrants, Pautler said.  </P> <P> "We did not go out in the field on this," he said. "We strictly provided (the  ATF) information on probationers."  </P> <P> Neither San Diego city police nor the county Sheriff's Department was involved  in the sweep.  </P> <P> ATF agents said the gang members were arrested on a variety of federal gun and  drug charges. Arraignments began early Friday in U.S district courts around the  country for those apprehended, but by late afternoon none were believed to have  been released.  </P> <P> Officials said one motivation for Operation Streetsweep was that federal  sentencing laws generally are harsher than local statutes. The ATF's major  weapon is the federal Gun Control Act, which provides tough sentencing  provisions -- a minimum of five years in prison -- for use of firearms in drug  trafficking, regardless of the amount of narcotics involved.  </P> <P> "The local agencies can't get them into federal court without help from federal  agents," said Stephen E. Higgins, director of ATF, who appeared at the Los  Angeles press conference. "In federal court, many of those without felonies  will face a minimum of five years. Those with felonies are looking at 15 years  -- no probation, no parole."  </P> <P> At the same time, the operation -- not unlike many such law enforcement  "crackdowns" -- had the trappings of symbolic gesture, a characterization that  the agents permitted to flourish. On some of the raids in Los Angeles, for  example, television news crews were allowed to accompany law enforcement agents  to film the busts.  </P> <P> "We're trying to show that the gang problem is not just limited to Los  Angeles," said Vita, speaking on the steps of the Naval Training Center. "It's  a nationwide problem and we believe the federal government can have some  impact."  </P> <P> Added Higgins: "What began as a Los Angeles problem has now spread to a  national one. This is a significant step to our commitment attacking drugs" and  was "intended to send a message to violent street gangs."  </P> <P> Some local drug investigators around the country were a bit baffled by the  fanfare with which the arrests were announced. Oklahoma City Police Maj. Bob  Tayor said his department's involvement in Operation Streetsweep began when  federal agents "contacted us and said they wanted to do one (a raid) here."  </P> <P> Taylor said officers then led the federal agents on a raid of a local crack  house, where five local people were arrested for involvement with drugs  believed to have been supplied by an L.A. gang. Taylor described those arrested  as gang "wannabes."  </P> <P> In South Los Angeles, where many of the arrests occurred, some residents  contended that the agents' attempt at sending a message to gang members was  misguided.  </P> <P> "We must stop the source of drugs at the point of entry," said Chilton  Alphonse, founder of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, which  provides counseling to gang members. "Black children do not have the means --  the boats and the planes -- to be bringing drugs into this country. . . .  Government and law enforcement should be attacking the supply, those  individuals importing cocaine into the country."  </P> <P> Aside from being misdirected, said residents, such efforts are just plain  ineffective.  </P> <P> "The CRASH nights (sporadically scheduled sweeps by Los Angeles police  officers) caught some people by surprise," said a former gang member who  identified himself as Lil' Too Tall. "But people got used to them real fast. .  . . Dope sellers would just kick it (rest) and come out on nights the police  weren't around."  </P> <P> ATF officials said operations such as Streetsweep have potential as a weapon  against street gangs, and they said without elaboration that there would be  more in the future.  </P> <P> Agents said other law enforcement agencies were involved in Operation  Streetsweep, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department and the U.S. attorney's office.  </P> <P> In addition, the Air Force supplied a C-5A jet to ferry 22 federal agents to  Southern California Thursday to make -- and announce -- arrests. Air Force  pilots unloaded participating agents at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in  Orange County. It was the first time any military branch has joined domestic  drug-fighting efforts, they said.  </P> <P> "We needed the extra agents because we didn't have enough in our Los Angeles  district office alone," said Vita. "We knew this would be big, so we called for  added help."  </P> <P> Operation Streetsweep marked the culmination of two years of planning by the  law enforcement agencies, Higgins said. The original idea for the massive  crackdown began evolving from the federal government's ongoing battle with the  fierce Jamaican drug-dealing gangs, called "posses," that are terrorizing  several East Coast cities.  </P> <P> Alarmed by the spread of the posses and gangs, Higgins said, the U.S. Justice  Department recruited the ATF to stem the illegal gun-running that often goes  hand-in-hand with the drug trade.  </P> <P> "We saw that the posses were spreading, and what they are doing was similar to  what the gangs in Los Angeles are doing," said Higgins, whose agency has  monitored the national migration of Crips and Bloods for more than a year. "The  posses are spreading West and the Los Angeles gangs are going eastward."  </P> <P> ATF officials said that some illegal Jamaican immigrants were arrested during  Operation Streetsweep, but they were unsure if the nationals belong to any  posses. Still, authorities acknowledged that posses are active in Los Angeles  and a few even work in concert with the Crips and the Bloods.  </P> <P> Last spring, one agent from each of the ATF's 22 national offices flew into Los  Angeles for briefings on the gangs with the LAPD and the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department, Higgins said.  </P> <P> Operation Streetsweep began at dawn Thursday and many of the arrests were made  simultaneously across the country.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jim Carlton, John H. Lee, Paul Lieberman and Henry  Weinstein contributed to this report.  </P></p>

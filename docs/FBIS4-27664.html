			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 (YONHAP) -- North Korean Ambassador to  Austria Kim Kwang-sop visited the headquarters of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Thursday and conveyed  his country's official position on problems related to IAEA  inspections, it was reported here Friday.    In a dispatch from Vienna, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN said Kim had  formally handed a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement to top  IAEA officials.    Kim made it clear that Pyongyang will have no alternative  but  to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the  international community imposes economic sanctions, the  newspaper said.    Saying it was unusual for a North Korean ambassador to hold  talks with top IAEA officials, MAINICHI said some observers view  Pyongyang's move as an indication that it has begun efforts to  avoid a breakdown in IAEA inspections.    Meanwhile, Yun Ho-chin, councilor at the North Korean  Embassy  in Vienna, told MAINICHI Thursday that his country is in a  special position where it is suspending its decision to withdraw  from the NPT.    Yun said, "from a legal point of view, North Korea has  already left the treaty, but it is trying to resolve the nuclear  dispute politically within the NPT framework.    "That is why North Korea is allowing the IAEA to service  surveillance cameras in order to help maintain the continuity of  nuclear safeguards."    With regard to the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor in  Yongbyon, Yun claimed that North Korea's method of preserving  the spent fuel rods has been proven in earlier experiments to  allow for accurate checking later.    "When the IAEA insists on its own way of checking, it is the  same as trying to chase us out of the NPT," Yun said, hinting  that North Korea would even leave the regime completely if it  could not reach an inspection agreement with the IAEA.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International Company News: Axa to buy US space insurance specialist AXA, the large French insurance group, announced yesterday that it was acquiring privately-owned International Technology Underwriters (Intec), a Maryland-based company which specialises in arranging space insurance. No financial details for the deal were announced. Intec added that it had yet to be determined whether Axa would have 100 per cent ownership, although it confirmed that the French insurer would take a majority stake. Intec, which employs around 17 people and handles around 15 to 20 large policies a year, is essentially a managing general agent for space insurance on behalf of CIGNA, the US multi-line insurer. It said it expected this operational arrangement to be unaffected by Axa's involvement. News of the deal came mid-afternoon in New York, and there was no immediate comment from Axa. A spokesman for the French company, however, said that Mr Claude Bebear, Axa chairman, had long been interested in certain high-technology niche sectors of the insurance industry. Last year, Axa made its long-sought significant investment in the US when it injected Dollars 1bn into Equitable Life, the mutual life insurer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by The Chau] </F>   [Summary] What can be said about changes in the port city  of Haiphong in the 1991-93 three-year period? Before 1992,  Haiphong displayed four shortcomings, namely street litter,  insufficient power supply, serious budget deficit, and poor  public security and order maintenance.    The situation now has been improved. City streets are  cleaner thanks to more budget allocations to public sanitation  work. The application of resolute and uniform measures helped  reduce waste or theft of electricity. The situation concerning  public security and order maintenance has been markedly  improved. The budget deficit has also been significantly  reduced.    Noteworthy is the fact that Haiphong has scored fine  external  economic achievements. In 1991, the city had only two foreign  investment projects. Nowadays, as many as 27 joint ventures  valued at nearly 650 million dollars are being implemented.  Considerable progress has also been made by the  agro-forestry-fishery, trade, and service sectors.    "The concrete figures of the above-mentioned activities are  reflected in a report presented by the 10th Executive Committee  of the Haiphong City party organization at a recent midterm  party conference. Generally speaking, over the past three  years, far from lagging behind, Haiphong has made good progress  on the economic development front. Some areas of economic  activities have displayed fast growth rates and fulfilled or  overfulfilled many targets for the 1991-95 period. The external  economic sector has played an important role in overall local  economic life."    Nonetheless, based on the report of the city party  organization's executive committee as well as on the delegates'  views, there is still room for improvement. For example, the  value of 1993 industrial production reached only 211 billion  dong. A number of new products has already been marketed.  Nonetheless, the volume of products of high economic value  remains low and the export index is even lower. The volume of  export products in transit through Haiphong Port comes chiefly  from the northern provinces whereas that of the port city of  Haiphong itself only accounts for a modest percentage.  Haiphong's sea-based economy displays great potential, but the  actual performance ratio is very low.    Slow efforts have been made to effect economic restructuring  and job development to benefit the countryside. The ratio of  the city's participation in foreign-funded investment projects  is also low. The performance of the import-export and tourist  sectors is not on par with the city's advantages and potential.  Furthermore, the city still displays shortcomings on the  cultural and social fronts.    It could be said that Haiphong's most serious drawback rests  with its failure to formulate an effective human resources  development strategy. There is not enough cadres to meet the  requirements of the new situation and new mechanism, especially  to handle external economic affairs.    "Prompted by a positive attitude and spirit of  self-sufficiency and self-help, the Haiphong City party  organization set forth many major policies and solutions for the  period from now until the year 1995 as follows: It is necessary  to promote production, business, and service industries as well  as bring into full play the roles of different economic sectors.  Special efforts must be made to step up external economic  activities, build socioeconomic infrastructure, implement social  welfare programs, consolidate national defense and security  capabilities, renovate and revamp party organizations, enhance  the leadership skills of cadres and party members, and combine  the administrative reform program with the activities of mass  societies. Given the fact that Haiphong is an industrial center  with a large force of manual workers, special attention must be  paid to the role of trade-union organizations."    Based on past achievements and experiences, there is every  reason to believe that Haiphong will make the above-mentioned  goals come true. To this end, efforts must be made to define  practical tasks and work out harmonious and effective operating  procedures.</p>

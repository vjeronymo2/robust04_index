			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Geza </F> Jeszenszky by Grzegorz Lubczyk; place and date not given: "We  Can Accept the Arguments of the United States"]    [Text] [Lubczyk] What will Hungarian foreign policy be  like after the recent decisions at the NATO summit and the  Prague meeting of Visegrad Group leaders and U.S. President Bill  Clinton?    [Jeszenszky] It will not change. We have positively  accepted the decisions reached in Brussels and Prague. In the  Czech capital, we all agreed that the "Partnership for Peace"  plan began to become much more specific. This is not the  optimal situation for which Poland and Hungary have strived,  however, we are able to accept the U.S. arguments, in line with  which both Ukraine and Russia will be incorporated into the  process of shaping security and peace in Europe. Now our main  task will be to do as much as possible for the implementation of  the "Partnership for Peace" program, and to do this as quickly  as possible.    [Lubczyk] Is it already known what will be the order of  measures that Hungary is going to take?    [Jeszenszky] Very soon we will hold important talks. We  expect a U.S. military delegation to come to Hungary within two  weeks. It is then that we will discuss a strategy for future  activities.    [Lubczyk] Mr. Minister, President Clinton left Prague for  Kiev and Moscow. Do you not fear any possible U.S.-Ukrainian or  U.S.-Russian decisions that might threaten our regional  interests? Can we believe the Americans?    [Jeszenszky] In the 20th century, both our countries were  put to so many tests that it is really difficult to have any  faith left. However, I believe that in the past the United  States and the other NATO states proved that we should change  our attitude toward them. The present Western leaders are doing  a lot to prevent any doubts concerning the purity of their  intentions and declarations.    I think that they treated the Polish and Hungarians warnings  very seriously. I cannot even imagine that the United States  would sacrifice our countries for their joint interests with  Russia or Ukraine. In the past three or four years, we have  been making great efforts to make the West realize that we  cannot be left aside and that it is also in the interest of the  West to incorporate Central Europe into Western structures.    [Lubczyk] Should we still use the expression of the Visegrad  Group, after all the controversies among the states of our  region leading up to the Prague summit?    [Jeszenszky] "Visegrad" does not depend exclusively on the  words and actions of certain politicians. The Visegrad  agreement was the result of the geographical and historical  situation. Our countries, being in the same region of Europe,  can in fact achieve success together, or they can experience  failure together, either in the area of security or economics.  Therefore, I am an optimist. I believe that the framework of  cooperation that we have had so far will not only be maintained  -- I believe that it will be extended and strengthened, not for  a year or two, but for decades to come. I anticipate a  situation similar to the Benelux countries or in Scandinavia to  develop. I hope that our nations -- I am not referring solely  to the Poles and Hungarians -- will also achieve the level of  fraternity, similar to the Scandinavians, who used to wage wars  against each other, whereas today, when we speak about those  states, we just naturally list them all together.    [Lubczyk] What is the place of Poland in Hungarian foreign  policy?    [Jeszenszky] I have always been of the opinion that the  Polish-Hungarian friendship does not depend on our governments.  Of course, tradition still forms the basis of our relations.  However, we are linked not only by similar histories, but also  by similar mentalities in both societies. Hungary considers  Poland to be one of its most trusted partners, which has been  confirmed in many areas of the international activities of both  countries.    [Lubczyk] If, as you say, Poland means so much to Hungary,  then why is it so that we feel that more could be done in the  area of nonpolitical cooperation? Representatives of companies  trading with Hungary claim that Poles offer their Hungarian  partners better conditions than those offered to Poles by  Hungarians. Do you not think that this deadlock in the area of  economic cooperation should be broken?    [Jeszenszky] I could not agree with you more. I also think  that the degree of economic cooperation, for instance, is not  satisfactory. However, we should also bear in mind that  nowadays not everything depends on the will of governments.  Unfortunately, both our nations have the same weak spot: a  degree of snobbishness and excessive admiration of the West. I  think that this will change only when economies start to be  governed by real markets and market laws. If foreign investors  are operating very successfully, both in Poland and Hungary,  then it really means something, does it not? I wish our  entrepreneurs would draw conclusions from this. I believe that  the agreement on free trade will certainly expedite this process.    [Lubczyk] What is the main purpose of your visit to Warsaw?    [Jeszenszky] It is the result of bilateral agreements;  however, not only that. As a result of recent events, in short  referred to as "Brussels" and "Prague," many issues need to be  discussed jointly. Some of the initiatives that were launched  during the session of the Central European initiative in  Debrecin should be developed as well. The Warsaw talks will  definitely not be a waste of time.</p>

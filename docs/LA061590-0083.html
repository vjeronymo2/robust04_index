			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> $50,000 DONATION TO HELP PAY FOR BUS  </P> <P> Robbie Lee would seem an unlikely benefactor.  </P> <P> Lee is 27, single, has no children, never attended a school in the Saddleback  Valley and really, for the most part, would rather be surfing.  </P> <P> So why is this man giving $50,000 for a school bus for the Saddleback Valley  Unified School District?  </P> <P> "First of all, this area has been very good to me and to my business," Lee  said. "Secondly, I love kids. Lazy adults, stupid adults I have no patience  with. But kids I'll do anything for, any time."  </P> <P> Lee, the owner of the 13-store Video City chain, is donating all the receipts  from his Mission Viejo store for the month of June to the Saddleback Valley  Educational Foundation, a community support group for the school district.  That's the gross receipts, everything that walks in the door.  </P> <P> "It will be more than $50,000," Lee said.  </P> <P> Valmere Kranek, foundation president, said the group has "been in existence  since 1983 and gone through different growing pains and various levels of  involvement. But Robbie has given us a rebirth."  </P> <P> Lee's video career started three years ago in Upland when he put his savings,  $40,000, into a friend's video store. The partner could not make the store go,  so Lee repossessed it.  </P> <P> "I had to; it was all the money I had," he said.  </P> <P> Three years later he has a chain of stores stretching from Mission Viejo to  Bakersfield.  </P> <P> With Lee's money, the district hopes to pay for a large chunk of the $100,000  needed for a new bus. It will be used principally for field trips.  </P> <P> "I was shocked to learn that a district in this affluent area was having  trouble transporting kids on field trips," Lee said. "This is a beautiful area  to grow up in, but it's insulated. I think kids need to be exposed to all the  other things that are out there, and field trips can do that." LEN HALL  </P></p>

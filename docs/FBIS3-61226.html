The </F> Results of the Ashgabat Summit: `More Unanimous Than Ever  Before,' and, As Usual, Meaningless"]    [Text] Failure. Among the 14 conferences of heads of CIS  states held up to the present moment, the Ashgabat meeting  during 23-24 December was not the first that one can confidently  categorize as a failure for the Russian delegation.  Representatives of the Russian Federation completed their  mission quite ignominiously in all four major clubs whose  sessions make up the traditional program of such summits--the  councils of defense ministries, foreign affairs ministries,  government heads, and presidents.    There was no dearth of analytical developments, conclusions,  and recommendations prepared for the opening of the summit by  specialists from the government apparatus, the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, and the administration, who were well oriented  for the forthcoming discussion. And probably the simplest thing  would have been to explain our current failure by the  indisputable fact that Russian officials of the highest ranks  who represented the Russian Federation in negotiations with  their colleagues in the hateful Commonwealth again demonstrated  their deep scorn for the work of their own experts. Documented  results of the Ashgabat work of Boris Yeltsin, Viktor  Chernomyrdin, Andrey Kozyrev, and Pavel Grachev are filled with  the most impressive examples of that "impromptu diplomacy" whose  unpredictable rules the Russian leaders have been following  recently, unfortunately, not only in contacts with nearby  foreign countries. Here are just a couple of examples.    For Russian specialists who are reliably informed about the  political situation in the Central Asian region, there was no  secret about the completely pragmatic objectives pursued by  President of Turkmenistan Saparmurad Niyazov in arranging a  full-scale meeting with Boris Yeltsin.    The only political result of the widely advertised program  "Ten Years of Well-Being," which, according the author's  intention, was to have transformed the more backward Union  republics into a flourishing "second Kuwait," was the rapid  formation of a personality cult of the "father of all Turkmens."  The efforts of romantics who hoped at least to look beyond its  beggarly attributes to signs of an eastern autocratic tradition  consecrated over the centuries ended in failure. The failure of  the adventure with the hasty exchange of the ruble for the  "freely convertible" (in fact it seems to be convertible by  force and at an absurd artificial rate) manat only reinforced  observers in their conviction that they were dealing with the  remnants of an attempt to build socialism of the classical  Soviet type in one separate emirate. It is not surprising that  attempts by the political relic to establish contacts with the  civilized world evoked in democratic states a reaction that was  almost instinctual repulsion. The acquisition by Turkmenistan of  the status of a full-fledged partner of the Russian Federation  was intended above all to quell this reaction even though it  partially legitimized Niyazov's regime in the international  arena. Hence the persistent initiatives of the Ashgabat leader  to complete the bilateral Russian-Turmen summit meeting with the  signing of a large intergovernmental agreement.    When preparing for the visit, experts persistently  recommended to members of the official Russian delegation: A  firm condition for consent to the solicitation of the Turkmen  elite must be the presentation of reliable guarantees of  protection of the civil rights of the republic's  Russian-speaking population. The policy of planned pressure on  representatives of nonindigenous nationalities from the sphere  of state administration, industry, education, and the Army  leadership is just as typical of the Ashgabat regime as it is of  the majority of its neighbors. The only difference lies in the  much more skillful application of demagogic devices to mask  ethnic purges and in the reliable control of the press, which  could divulge cases of discrimination as well as the precise  nullification of the activity of foreign observation missions.  The flow of emigrants from Turkmenistan is steadily increasing  all the while.    In these conditions to agree to the use of pseudoscientific  euphemisms that distort the essence of the problem--such as  "regulation of migration flows" or "parity guarantees of  assistance to resettlers"--would mean to encourage the outflow  of the Russian population, forgiving in advance the future  transgressions of President Niyazov's regime. There is no  counterflow from Russia to Turkmenistan, and none is anticipated  in the foreseeable future, the experts reminded them--this has  to do with casting a policy of segregation in civilized form.    Nonetheless, the president of Russia, ignoring common sense,  agreed to sign an agreement on dual citizenship. And the public  exercise in a rare genre of political buffoonery--the ceremony  in which Boris Yeltsin was awarded a Turmen passport, ordained  "an honored citizen of Turkmenistan," and declared to be the  first possessor of dual citizenship--was the logical culmination  of the bilateral division of the Ashgabat program.    A similar motif promised to become central at the  multilateral summit. Specialists in the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs and the administration of the president of the Russian  Federation had prepared carefully for consultation on the draft  "Convention on Ensuring the Rights of Individuals Belonging to  National, Ethnic, Linguistic, Cultural, and Religious  Minorities." The list of agreements suggested for discussion at  the meeting, as usual, snowballed into almost 30 documents. But  the draft convention promised to be perhaps the only one for  which one could see a critical practical need and clear-cut  political meaning.    The briefcase of Andrey Kozyrev, who went to the  negotiations  within the framework of the first official meeting of the  Council of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the entire history of  the CIS, contained detailed comments on this draft. "Taking into  account the priority significance of this convention for  Russia," its authors pointed out, "it would be expedient to work  for its adoption with a maximum number of participants and to  have it signed even if other states object...." Objections could  be expected primarily from the delegations from Ukraine and  Uzbekistan, who spoke out especially actively against the  article of the draft according to which the agreeing parties  would make commitments to "adopt legislative, administrative,  and other necessary measures on their territory to prevent  attempts at assimilation of minorities against their will...."  Arguing this opinion in detail, the experts recommended  insisting on the fairness of the Russian position and, if  necessary, applying pressure to partners in the negotiations,  linking the fate of the national majorities to the prospects for  economic and military cooperation within the framework of the  CIS.    But the chief of Russian diplomacy was either not in the  mood  or not in his best form. Or perhaps he was too impressed by the  atmosphere of touchingly feigned hospitality created by the  summit officials for highly placed guests (as distinct from the  journalists, whose work was organized, let us note, in a simply  disgraceful way). In brief, the convention did not reach the  point of being discussed by the "presidential club." Mr. Kozyrev  allowed it to be sent "for further work to joint groups of  experts" for an indefinite period of time and with unclear  prospects.    Equally doubtful for the Russian side were the results of  negotiations on the economic and military sections of the  program.    After congratulating Turkmenistan on its full-fledged (and  not associated) membership in the economic alliance of the CIS,  Viktor Chernomyrdin essentially welcomed the expansion of the  group of contenders for a chunk of the meager pie of Russian  technical credit. And it would be interesting to know what other  result Russia could receive from an economic alliance with a  state whose leader announces without special embarrassment at a  press conference: "We have stood to gain from entering the CIS.  We understand. It is just that we would not want for it to be  mandatory for the country to carry out the decisions made  there...." Well, of course, that is it in a nutshell....    The diplomatic efforts of Pavel Grachev took an altogether  unexpected turn. For example, the discussion about protection of  Russian Army contingents in keeping with international norms and  about granting them the status of military bases on foreign  territory suddenly led to a point where Russia took over the  burdensome and dangerous duties of protecting the borders of  sovereign Turkmenistan. And the agreement of the minister of  defense of the Russian Federation to revise the Collective  Security Treaty at the insistence of the delegations from  Georgia and Azerbaijan will inevitably bring Russia one step  closer to direct participation in two open armed conflicts.    CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya, it seems, is  vigilantly keeping track of the adherence to the tradition  according to which at every press conference that is the  culmination of another summit they note the "warm atmosphere of  cooperation and mutual understanding" of the participants. And  neither did he fail to add the remark that in Ashgabat the  agreements were adopted "more unanimously than ever before" this  time. It seems that the Russian delegation was at great pains to  help the observers describe this conference following the canon  of the Bible story. If one wished, this form could even be  considered appropriate for Christmas. Not Catholic Christmas, of  course--it has nothing to do with this. In the capital of  Turkmenistan the two-year anniversary of the birth of the  Commonwealth, and, naturally, the breakup of the USSR, was  celebrated with pomp.    The fate of the CIS at the end of these two years is  unenviable. They are not being kind to the Commonwealth. They do  not even sympathize with it. They are laughing at it.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 660.111&blank;Agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter felt that the 41 statewide FH agreements currently in effect between the FHWA and the States (including Puerto Rico) should be updated and made into tri-party agreements with the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA. This would perpetuate the ``partnership'' spirit of the ISTEA and facilitate cooperation among the three agencies. It would also eliminate separate agreements between the FS and the SHA and between the FHWA and the SHA in each State. The wording of this section should be revised by inserting the words ``the Forest Service'' where necessary, such as after the word ``FHWA'' in paragraph (a), to include the FS as a signatory agency to the agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because there are some overall FH procedures that not only involve the SHAs, but the FS as well, tri-party agreements among the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA will be a requirement in the final rule. Because the FHWA and the FS already have separate two-party FH program agreements for all 40 States, plus Puerto Rico, and because the FHWA does not want to delay the FH program until all new tri-party agreements are executed, the first sentence of this section of the NPRM was revised to delete the phrase ``prior to the expenditure of any funds by the FHWA in the State.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 660.112&blank;Project Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that, in the first sentence of paragraph (a), the phrase ``or a public authority'' should be added after the words ``Projects will be administered by the FHWA.'' This would acknowledge that the FS may, in some cases, administer the design and construction of FH projects. The same commenter also suggested adding the phrase ``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' to the end of the sentence to allow for items included in statewide agreements to supplement Federal-aid procedures, where appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the FS wants to be able to administer FH projects, this sentence was reworded to add the words ``or the FS'' instead of ``or a public authority.'' Also, the phrase ``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' was added to the end of the sentence. This will allow the parties to determine the procedures to be followed in a State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 660.113&blank;Construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the words ``a public authority'' be substituted for ``cooperator'' in paragraph (b) of this section. This would allow the FS to perform construction, if appropriate. Cooperators would still be included since they are, by definition, a public authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because other public authorities that might potentially be involved in a project would also be cooperators, the word ``cooperator'' was kept in the sentence in paragraph (b). However, by adding the words ``the FS'' after FHWA, the FS will be explicitly allowed to perform construction, if appropriate. Also, paragraph (c), which deals with final acceptance of the project, was revised to clarify the intent. The word ``construction'' was retained in the language to differentiate acceptance of the construction work (for the purpose of releasing the contractor) from that of acceptance of the entire project, including any extra work required to resolve noncontractor-related matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 660.115&blank;Maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In dealing with the same issue discussed in the previous section, as to what constitutes final acceptance of a project, it was suggested by one commenter that the word ``construction'' be deleted to avoid confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``construction'' is not incorrect in the context of this paragraph, because it describes the type of acceptance being made. However, the entire sentence was reworded to clarify and minimize possible confusion. By referencing &sect;660.113(c), which includes the word ``construction,'' the meaning of the term ``construction acceptance'' was retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 660.117&blank;Funding, Records and Accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested deleting the phrase ``and the SHAs'' from paragraph (e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the term ``cooperators'' includes SHAs, the phrase was considered redundant and, therefore, deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested adding the word ``Generally'' at the beginning of the sentence in paragraph (f) to allow for those special cases where cash is not obtained in advance of construction procurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adding the word ``generally'' to the sentence makes the requirement too much less restrictive. Instead, the following phrase was added to the end of the last sentence: ``Unless otherwise specified in a project agreement.'' Also, the word ``shall'' was changed to ``should'' to allow more flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices; Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has determined that this action is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking would be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This rule merely requires the States and Federal agencies to conform to the requirements of the ISTEA. The requirements are basically incremental to what the States and Federal agencies are required to do under the new ISTEA provisions, such as incorporating new planning provisions, including metropolitan and statewide transportation plan requirements; and establishing management systems provisions, including highway safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway pavements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The revised regulation will not directly affect small businesses because the regulation applies only to Federal agency, State, and local government transportation programs. However, a minor positive secondary effect may result from the employment of small businesses, such as engineering consultant firms, to implement some of the planning and management systems required by the ISTEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities apply to this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The agency has analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and has determined that this action would not have any effect on the quality of the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY WORKERS TO GET A CHILLING WARNING THAT LAYOFFS MAY ARRIVE WITH SUMMER  </P> <P> Nine thousand city of San Diego employees will be notified Friday that "several  hundred" of them might be laid off this summer because of an impending  $60-million budget shortfall for fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> In a memo to be distributed in the paychecks of all full- and part-time  employees, City Manager John Lockwood warns that "the city may have to make  sharp cuts in some services due to a layoff of several hundred employees that  would be effective July 1."  </P> <P> Lockwood has also ordered a hiring freeze, effective today, and restricted most  transfers, promotions and demotions to prevent employees from "jockeying for  positions that might be safe" from the budget ax, he said.  </P> <P> "There is no way I can see that we're not going to severely impact the work  force," Lockwood said. "It's not thousands (of layoffs), but we are talking  about several hundred positions."  </P> <P> The layoffs would be the first since 1979, when passage of Proposition 13  resulted in trims, said Rich Snapper, city personnel director. In the  mid-1980's, loss of some federal funds prompted layoffs in one youth program,  he said.  </P> <P> Word of Lockwood's memo, and ongoing publicity about the council's budget  crunch, already has produced widespread concern among city workers, said a  representative of the city's largest labor union, the San Diego Municipal  Employees Assn.  </P> <P> "Last week, we started getting a lot of calls, once the City Council decided  not to place some of the suggested revenue-generating measures on the ballot,"  said Kathy Rollins, senior representative for the union, which represents about  3,500 professional, clerical, administrative and technical personnel.  </P> <P> But Harry Eastus, general manager of the San Diego Police Officers Assn., said  that "even if they send those (memos) to our people, we are not terribly  concerned at this time. I don't see them laying off any police officers"  because of the City Council's emphasis on public safety.  </P> <P> Acknowledging the anxiety his notice will create, Lockwood said he chose the  lesser of two evils by opting to create concern among his workers rather than  notify them later this spring, when layoff plans would be more specific but  employees would have less time to adjust.  </P> <P> "Worse, to me, is knowing that this is in the offing, to let people go along  thinking it will work out like it always does," Lockwood said. "This is not a  normal year. We are going to have to go to the layoff procedures here."  </P> <P> Lockwood has been warning the City Council since January that the city will be  $60 million short of the $492 million needed to keep services at current levels  when fiscal 1991 begins July 1.  </P> <P> But after four chaotic meetings last month on whether to place any new tax or  fee increases on the June 5 ballot, the council declined to propose any  measures to give Lockwood new revenue. In fact, they ordered him to prepare a  $432-million budget that would require sharp cuts in library hours, park and  recreation programs and the Planning Department staff, among other things.  </P> <P> While the council still has the option of enacting tax or fee increases itself  during budget deliberations that are scheduled to begin in May, Councilman  Bruce Henderson and other city officials have suggested that such action might  endanger voter approval June 5 of an increase in the city's spending ceiling  for fiscal years 1992-1995.  </P> <P> Henderson, who opposes new taxes or fees, said Thursday that the city can live  within a $432-million budget next year without laying off employees because the  sum is nearly 5% more than the city's current $414 million budget.  </P></p>

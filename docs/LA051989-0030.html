			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARDINAL MANNING HAS CANCER OF THE SPINE  </P> <P> Cardinal Timothy Manning, 79, who retired as Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles  four years ago, is suffering from cancer of the spine, it was announced  Thursday.  </P> <P> The wiry, soft-spoken prelate -- who presided over the Los Angeles Archdiocese  from 1970 to 1985 -- has been active in his retirement with no public hints of  illness.  </P> <P> Without identifying the ailment, the archdiocesan weekly newspaper told readers  in today's issue for the first time that Manning is undergoing medical  treatment and published a letter from Pope John Paul II extending his blessing.  </P> <P> "Having learned of your present illness, I wish to assure you of my spiritual  and affectionate union at this time," wrote the Pope in a letter dated April  24.  </P> <P> An archdiocesan spokesman said Manning has had at least 16 radiation treatments  for cancer in his spine. The cardinal had asked chancery officials not to make  an announcement before this week, said Bill Rivera, public affairs director.  </P> <P> Manning, who lives at the Holy Family parish rectory in South Pasadena, was not  available for interview late Thursday. But he acknowledged the concerns of  associates in a short letter published in today's Tidings, the archdiocese's  paper.  </P> <P> "I am aware of the gathering anxiety among those I have served and loved for  over a half century," Manning said, referring to his 55 years as a priest. "I  am under the expert care of physicians who encourage the continuation of my  ministry according to my abilities. I leave everything in the hands of the good  Lord."  </P> <P> Manning has frequently preached at clergy retreats and early this month  conducted one for the bishops of Michigan and Ohio. This Sunday, he is  scheduled to preside over the "Mary's Hour" devotional service in the Hollywood  Bowl and give the homily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prayers Offered  </P> <P> In calling on the archdiocese's estimated 3 million Catholics to keep the  Irish-born prelate in their prayers, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony said no other  priest or bishop has spanned as long a period of church growth in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Named an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles in 1946, Manning was part of a  chancery that rapidly expanded parishes and built schools in the post-World War  II population explosion.  </P> <P> Manning was appointed bishop of the Fresno diocese in 1967 but returned to Los  Angeles two years later as coadjutor archbishop to Cardinal James Francis  McIntyre. Manning succeeded the ultraconservative cardinal in January, 1970,  while disputes still flared between the chancery and Latino activists, and  reform-minded Catholic clergy, nuns and lay people were openly unhappy with the  slow implementation of Second Vatican Council policies.  </P> <P> In his 15-year tenure, Manning is credited with bringing a more open,  conciliatory approach to problems. Manning, who was named a cardinal in 1973,  submitted his resignation to the Pope before his 75th birthday on Oct. 15,  1984, in keeping with Vatican policies. His successor, Mahony, was named eight  months later.  </P></p>

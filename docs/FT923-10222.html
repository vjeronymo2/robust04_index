			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Tudjman reckons his war is won: Croatian president is already claiming victory in next Sunday's polls CROATIA'S president is already claiming victory in next Sunday's elections - the first test of his nationalist government since its fight for independence from Yugoslavia led to a bloody war with Serbia. Mr Franjo Tudjman, a 70-year-old former Communist army general, says the war is over as far as Croatia is concerned. 'It was won a long time ago. It was won when we prevented Yugoslav and Serb authorities from overthrowing the authorities in Croatia.' The opposition parties, however, dismiss this notion. They say the price of independence was the loss of 10,000 lives and control over a quarter of Croatian territory, now patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers. The country, which was recognised by the international community, is now providing refuge to some 700,000 people displaced by the war in Bosnia and Croatia. They also charge that the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (CDU), since coming to power in April 1990 on a vow to win independence, has failed to introduce democracy and monopolised the political agenda. The CDU has purged the press by sacking unsympathetic journalists and maintains an iron grip over Croatian television. Nonetheless, Mr Tudjman and his CDU look set to do well in Sunday's poll, which will elect both the president and the new parliament. This is partly because the war has been so painful that many Croatians fear further change, and partly because of the way the government has organised the elections. There are fears that the government's failure to announce the number of voters until tomorrow leaves open the possibility of election rigging. Mr Zarko Puhovski, a professor of political philosophy at Zagreb University, said: 'Elections cannot work in a state in which there is no way of knowing how many voters there are until the Saturday before the ballot.' It has not yet been announced whether polling booths will be open in the zones disputed with Serbia, which are under UN protection. Croatian voters abroad will be allowed to vote and the recent move to allow some 800,000 Bosnian Croats to have dual citizenship appears to indicate they, too, will be voting. They are expected to cast their ballot for Mr Tudjman or extreme nationalist parties, for their political and military support. The role of the UN peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) has been crucial in the election campaign. 'The bottom line on this issue with almost all opposition parties is that they say: we don't need UNPROFOR, it is partisan and favours the Serbs and we have to diminish its role if we can't throw it out all together,' explains Mr Puhovski. The war has given rise to ultranationalism throughout Croatia. Mr Dobrosav Paraga, leader of the Croat Party of Rights and the Croatian Defence Force, its military wing, has campaigned on the slogan 'UNPROFOR go home'. His party is expected to win support especially in the war-torn regions. He calls for Croatia to extend its borders east to the city limits of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. His fiery appeals to Croats to 'burn Serbian cities' will win him support among the more desperate section of the population. But Mr Tudjman is likely to ride high for having at least achieved independence for his country.</p>

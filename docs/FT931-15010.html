			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US tries to narrow differences - Outgoing team still hoping for Uruguay Round progress US TRADE officials in Geneva yesterday held out little prospect for an early conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks but said negotiations would continue in the hope of making progress by next Tuesday's stock-taking meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee. Trade negotiators will try to present the Clinton administration, which takes office the following day, with as few outstanding problems as possible, in the dwindling hope that a Uruguay Round accord can still be reached before the current US negotiators' authority expires on March 2. A senior US negotiator said a number of 'significant sticking points' remained in talks with the European Community on industrial tariffs, and there had been little progress in resolving issues of vital concern to Washington in separate discussions on the draft package of Uruguay Round rules. There were still differences between the US and EC over agriculture, the official added, despite the accord reached between the two sides last November. He said the EC's detailed offer on market access for farm products would, as it stands, reduce imports from current levels rather than increase them. Talks on the draft rules package between about 20 of the key traders taking part in the 108-nation round were reconvened late yesterday by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The US also gave the EC further details of what it is prepared to offer on reducing very high textiles tariffs, a key Community demand, in return for EC concessions on reducing or eliminating tariffs in other sectors, notably electronics.</p>

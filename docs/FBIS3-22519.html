Here is  journalist Guillermo Morales with exclusive details for this  newscast.    Morales: Manuel Santin, national director of  Hygiene and Epidemiology [name and title as heard] said these  people are asymptomatic and are back at their respective work  centers, where they worked before contracting the virus. He  explained:    (Santin): "These people had been maintaining their  work status; that is, the Cuban Government protects their right  to remain in their work groups. So, preferentially -- so long as  it does not constitute a health risk because of, say, the  intensity of the work or some potential danger inherent in the  work -- the person will continue doing the work he did in the  past. Where there may be limitations, where the type of work  might constitute a health risk to the person, proper adjustments  will be made -- with the technical committee and leadership at  his work center -- and alternatives will be sought for him."    Since 1983, when the AIDS monitoring and prevention program  began, Cuba has reported 987 HIV-positive people: 702 males and  285 females. Of these, 230 have developed AIDS, and 147 have  died to-date, according to latest statistics. This data speaks  for itself when worldwide, 4,500 people are infected with AIDS  every day.    Bear in mind that one HIV-positive person or AIDS patient  costs the nation some $42,000 per year, and that the new  outpatient system does not deprive those who are able and wish  to avail themselves of these possibilities from doing so. This  was made very clear by Manuel Santin, director of hygiene and  epidemiology in Cuba.    (Santin): "(The nation) is maintaining our  program of AIDS prevention and monitoring, giving it high  priority. These patients, carriers of the virus or suffering  from the disease, will continue to be attended to with the same  priority. This investment by the state, proof of its humanistic  policy and practice, will be maintained. At no time is it  contingent upon economic considerations.    "The resources for this, though limited because of the  nation's economy, are available, so these people will receive  the humane, just treatment they require."    Alarm, concern, surprise over incorporation of carriers of  the AIDS virus into your work centers? What if it were you? What  would you think?    In future broadcasts: What HIV-positive people and their  colleagues at their workplaces think. This is the national radio  newscast.</p>

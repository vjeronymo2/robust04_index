			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Non-life side helps boost Zurich Insurance Zurich Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance groups, has reported a 24.8 per cent jump in 1993 net income, to SFr613.2m (Dollars 434.9m). It attributed the advance to an improved result in non-life business and to buoyant investment income. The directors have proposed a 14 per cent rise in dividends, to SFr20 per share. Gross premium revenue was up 16 per cent to SFr24.9bn, with about half of the rise coming from acquisitions and the widening of the consolidation. Among the group's more important additions last year was the business of Municipal Mutual Insurance in the UK, and the purchase of the remaining minority interests in Bermuda-based Centre Reinsurance. Zurich said its expense ratio declined in both life and non-life sectors. There was a 'substantial increase' in investment income, and total investments stood at SFr78.6bn at the end of 1993, 18.9 per cent higher than a year earlier. Shareholders' equity at year-end, prior to the dividend payment, was SFr10.2bn, SFr1.5bn higher than at the end of 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev  have agreed to exchange information on Pyongyang's nuclear  weapons program in a joint effort to check a major threat to  world peace, sources at the South Korean Embassy here said  Wednesday.    During Yi's meeting with Grachev Saturday, the two ministers  shared the view that exchanging such information is essential to  maintain peace in Northeast Asia and on the Korean peninsula, a  senior official said.

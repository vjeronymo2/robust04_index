			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A special investigative and prosecutorial unit that will target gangs and  drug-related violent crime will be created with a $250,000 federal grant  awarded to the San Diego County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller said creation of the new unit, which will be called  the Urban Street Gang Drug Trafficking Enforcement Program, comes at a time  when gang- and drug-related violence is rising sharply in many parts of the  county, particularly in Southeast San Diego.  </P> <P> The new unit should be in place by mid-August, and Miller said its members will  include two prosecutors, two law enforcement officers and support personnel.  </P> <P> The team will construct detailed profiles of young gang leaders suspected of  drug trafficking, and rank them in order of law enforcement concern and danger  to society.  </P> <P> "We want to know the relative therapeutic impact on the community as each of  those criminals is taken off the street," Miller said.  </P></p>

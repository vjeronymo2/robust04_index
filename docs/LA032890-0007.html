			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> Your editorial "Barbarism in Iraq" (March 16) is excellent. Summary execution  of a journalist is certainly barbaric. However, we need to think about its  meaning in our own context.  </P> <P> How much worse is their action than are ours? The United States is almost the  only country in the industrialized world that still has the death penalty. Over  the years we have executed many innocent people. Far more blacks and other  minorities than whites receive the death penalty. Thus, the death penalty is in  fact a form of racial hatred. Executions serve no practical purpose. The data  shows that executions do not decrease the murder rate.  </P> <P> Soon our state will perform the first execution in many years. That will be a  dark day for all of us.  </P> <P> "Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord." Why do we subvert our religious heritage  by retaining useless capital punishment?  </P> <P> RICHARD FOY  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

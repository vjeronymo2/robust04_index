			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Alternative to pensions privatisation Sir, Philip Stephens is right to point out that the privatisation of pensions, floated by Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, raises as many questions as it answers ('The National Insurance fiction', November 11). Not least of these is the problem of one generation (probably mine) being asked to pay twice - for our parents and for ourselves. He does not, however, mention that reform is necessary now to prevent contributory benefits withering away. Today, only three out of every 10 jobless people actually receive unemployment benefit. A similar proportion of women receive the full national insurance pension on the basis of their own contributions. As the first in a series of 'issue papers' published by the Commission on Social Justice pointed out last week, the rigid structure of national insurance - based on a fiction about bread-winning fathers and caring mothers - is at odds with our flexible labour market and variegated family structure. The status quo is not an option. But privatisation is not the only alternative. Radical reform of National Insurance to preserve its ideals - security, universality, fairness - is possible, but only if we match the system more closely to the realities of economic and social life today. David Miliband, secretary, Commission on Social Justice, Institute for Public Policy Research, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA</p>

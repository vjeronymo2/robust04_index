			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank keeps investors guessing INVESTORS were cautious ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting tomorrow, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT turned lower as hopes that the Bundesbank would ease interest rates at its Thursday meeting began to fade. However, in the present mood of uncertainty and speculation, comments by one central bank member just before the close were interpreted by some that there was still room for manoeuvre. The DAX index responded by coming off the day's low of 1524.41 to finish down 8.72 at 1,533.77. Turnover was a moderate DM4.6bn after DM4.7bn. Schering made one of the day's biggest advances with a rise of DM21.50 or 3 per cent to DM698.00 on a buy recommendation from Nomura Research. Mr Harald Gruber, the analyst, said that 'the higher net interest income and a better pharmaceutical performance will more than offset any possible setbacks in agrochemical profits in 1993'. He forecast a 1993 EPS of DM46.70, after DM44.40 in 1991, rising to DM55.50 in 1994. Porsche performed even better, gaining 6.5 per cent, on an old rumour, later denied, that Volkswagen was interested in taking it over. The shares leapt DM30 to DM485 while Volkswagen slipped DM1.20 to DM270.70. Mannesmann fell back on a downgrade by James Capel, the shares finishing DM4.30 lower at DM215.00. The London broker said that it had lowered its forecast for 1992 and 1993 earnings because of the deterioration in European capital goods investment and reduced demand for steel. PARIS had another see-saw day, driven by arbitrageurs, and the CAC-40 index ended 3.74 higher at 1,774.48 in slim turnover of FFr1.9bn. There was little news around to give the market direction. Among individual stocks, Paribas dropped FFr12.50 or 3.6 per cent to FFr330.50 on news that it was lowering the sale price of Ciments Francais to Italcementi to compensate for the recent disclosure of losses. Ciments Francais dropped FFr29 or 9.1 per cent to FFr290 in very light volume on news that it expects a loss for 1992. Elsewhere, a stronger dollar helped Saint-Gobain to rise by FFr11 to FFr498 while Lafarge fell back FFr5.10 to FFr301 on profit-taking after its recent rise. Peugeot dropped FFr14 to FFr523 and there was a report of stock on offer in London. MILAN ended mixed as the market shook off most of its early losses. The Comit index eased 0.81 to 418.89 in turnover estimated at near Monday's L197.1bn. Trading was disrupted early on by a breakdown in the telematico screen trading system. Shares in the state food group Sme were suspended by Consob pending an announcement from the company regarding the recent market rumours that it was about to be privatised. News that Paribas and Italcementi had agreed that the Italian company would pay FFr500m less than originally agreed for a controlling stake in Ciments Francais sent shares in Italcementi and the holding company Italmobiliare higher. Italmobiliare had been fixed down L620 at L33,530 but reached L35,300 in after-hours trading. Italcementi rose L210 or 2.6 per cent to L8,200. Pastorino issued a buy note on Italmobiliare yesterday, saying that the value of its underlying assets were completely neglected by the market. AMSTERDAM edged higher on a firmer dollar and the CBS Tendency index rose 0.3 to 104.8. Fokker remained in focus in spite of a further delay in the announcement of takeover terms with DASA. The shares closed 60 cents up at Fl 18.80. Unilever advanced 90 cents to Fl 191.40 as the market anticipated good results next week, while DSM lost another 70 cents to Fl 84.70 ahead of tomorrow's third quarter figures. ZURICH was slightly easier as the market consolidated in the absence of fresh news. The SMI index lost 3.5 to 1,927.4 in light volume. UBS bearers were the most active on the day rising SFr2 to SFr835 while Volksbank shed some of the gains made on Monday with the cooperative shares slipping SFr35 to SFr770. BRUSSELS closed narrowly mixed, as the Bel-20 index eased 4.84 to 1,129.96. Among the day's gainers were retailers with Delhaize up BFr20 to BFr1,640, supported by the stronger dollar. MADRID eased in low volume with the general index closing down 1.28 at 198.74. Among the banks, Popular lost Pta80 to Pta9,620 while Santander went against the trend following its recent rise in interim earnings with a gain of Pta70 to Pta4,095. STOCKHOLM finished steady to higher in spite of firmer domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.9 to 724.8 in turnover of SKr402m after SKr357m. HELSINKI continued to rise as domestic interest rates eased further. The HEX index rose 6.8 to 716.4 in turnover of FM41.6m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 27                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1034.79   1033.35   1033.45   1036.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1095.57   1094.06   1093.48   1099.39  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.70   1039.88   1038.54   1038.79 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1101.37   1102.65   1102.55   1100.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 26    Oct 23    Oct 22    Oct 21    Oct 20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.16   1034.38   1021.53   1015.54   1021.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1104.46   1108.83   1095.16   1087.95   1090.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 -  1041.18; 200 -  1105.33 Low/day: 100 -  1033.05  200 -  1092.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

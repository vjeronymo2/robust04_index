			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Kamran Qurrah Daghi in London and AL-HAYAH </F> bureau in Ankara: "Ankara Opposes Kurdish Elections and Urges  Kurds To Have a Dialogue With Baghdad"]    [Excerpts] Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat  Ataman announced yesterday that Ankara told the Kurdish leaders  at a meeting held last week that it is opposed to new elections  in northern Iraq and stressed the need for dialogue with Baghdad.    Kurdish sources well-informed on the Silopi meeting,  however,  have stressed to AL-HAYAH that the question of elections was not  even discussed by the Turkish delegation and Kurdish leaders  Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. They added that the Kurdish  leadership itself has not yet decided whether or not to hold  early parliamentary elections. The current parliamentary term  ends on 1 May next year. [passage omitted]    The same Kurdish sources also told AL-HAYAH that the Turkish  delegation did not ask the Kurdish leaders to hold a dialogue  with Baghdad but rather "expressed its viewpoint" on that  matter. The Turkish side was of the opinion that the Kurds  "might be able to get more gains from Baghdad because of its  regime's weakness and isolation, and that, in this connection,  they should take advantage of the fact that they enjoy the  protection of the Western coalition and Turkey."    The sources also said that the Kurdish leaders affirmed that  "they did not at all reject the principle of dialogue but were  not willing to accept a solution at any price." They emphasized  that Baghdad is refusing to implement UN resolutions including  Resolution 688. The Kurdish leaders also reaffirmed that "the  Kurds are committed to consultation with all the allies who  provide protection for them, including the Turks." [passage  omitted]</p>

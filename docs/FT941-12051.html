			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: LVMH may seek control at Guerlain LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, is considering taking full control of Guerlain, one of France's most famous fragrance houses, according to Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman. Mr Arnault said in an interview with yesterday's Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that LVMH planned to increase its minority stake in Guerlain as part of its plans to expand its luxury interests following last month's deal to restructure its cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks group, LVMH, already one of the largest perfume companies with brands such as Christian Dior's Dune and Givenchy's Amarige, has held a 15 per cent stake in Guerlain since 1987. It is believed to have considered taking a larger holding at the time of the original acquisition, but finally decided against doing so. However, Mr Arnault said he wanted to be 'more than just a minority investor' in Guerlain. LVMH confirmed that the group did hope to raise its stake, but said it had not yet begun negotiations with the Guerlain family which controls the remaining 85 per cent of the business. Guerlain is one of France's oldest and most prestigious fragrance houses with annual sales of over FFr2bn (Dollars 330m). Its best known perfumes, Shalimar and Samsara, are among the top 20 best selling upmarket scents. The acquisition of Guerlain would make perfect sense for LVMH, which has thrived in the fragrance market by applying its marketing and distribution resources to a wide range of brand names.</p>

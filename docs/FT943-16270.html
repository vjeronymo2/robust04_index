			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Large transactions held in the wings A spate of new issues in Swiss francs and yen buoyed activity on an otherwise subdued day in the Eurobond market. But the yen deals were targeted at Japanese investors, while the Swiss franc issues were largely aimed at retail investors. In addition, ABN Amro Lease Holding launched a Fl 100m four-year deal, which was partly sold to institutions, but mainly aimed at retail investors, according to lead manager ABN Amro. No borrowers ventured to launch large offerings targeted primarily at institutional investors yesterday, due to the closure of the US market for the Independence Day holiday. A similar pattern is likely to continue for the rest of the week, as large transactions are held in the wings, while traders await the outcome of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting today and tomorrow, the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday and the latest US jobs figures on Friday. In addition, dealers are hoping that the dollar may stabilise, perhaps in the wake of the Group of Seven summit at the weekend, creating a more favourable environment for new offerings next week. Finland, which was last week rumoured to be planning a deal, yesterday awarded a mandate to Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to arrange a 10-year global bond offering, denominated in dollars. The size of the deal has not yet been set, but it is expected to total Dollars 1bn or more. Other deals likely to emerge next week are the global offerings for Fannie Mae and Italy, while there have been rumours that both Sweden and Spain are also eyeing the markets. The Kingdom of Spain has replaced its existing Dollars 500m eurocommercial paper programme with a Dollars 2bn programme, arranged by Lehman Brothers. The new programme allows paper to be issued in a broader range of currencies.</p>

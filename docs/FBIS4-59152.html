			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin: "Who Are Those Who </F> Neither See Nor Hear?"]    [Text] What a wonderful coincidence for us to see them  issue their leaflets on the day of overwhelming joy and noble  love!    What do the hostile leaflets say? Enemies and other  disappointed people have begun to use these leaflets after  failing to achieve their goals through other ways. They wonder  if we see and hear our people. We saw and heard them, and  obviously it is they who no longer hear or see as result of  their failure.    The child who called God during celebrations on the leader's  birthday asked me: Did they not hear me?    Did they really not hear her or see her? Did they not hear  the people declaring their love for and loyalty to the beloved  leader, as well as their wishes for his health and long life?  Did they not see the candles of joy flickering in the spring  breeze in every house, every shop, and every work site? Did  they not see how the elderly, the men, the women, and the  children made 28 April a personal festival, in addition to its  being a collective one?    God has blessed this love despite the well-known impact of  the unjust blockade on the people's lives and mood.    There is no doubt that they saw and heard all this but do  not  want to admit the reality because it hurts them and destroys  their interests.    They launched a third world war to destroy the vigor of this  impossible love.    By God they could not disturb him. So, how can they harm him  by issuing leaflets with ridiculous contents written in poor  style?    We cannot blame them, especially since there is nothing left  to them except nonsense. For our part, we will continue to live  with this noble love.</p>

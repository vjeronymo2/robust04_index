			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Hillsdown looks to be heading for a third consecutive annual decline in earnings per share. Judged by last night's 14 per cent yield on the shares - notwithstanding the promise of a maintained final - the market is clearly concerned that the rot will not stop there. Certainly the company looks to be locked into a dangerous game of spending heavily on rationalisation, without any clear sign of how and when the profits are set to bounce. The trading outlook is bleak in the short term, and the whole sector is nervous ahead of the crucial Christmas period. On top of that there are structural problems in fresh meat and poultry, largely responsible for yesterday's sharp reductions in forecasts. On the other hand, the eye-catching appearance on the balance sheet of Pounds 88m of previously factored debt should not be exaggerated. Worse types of black hole could be imagined, it should not happen again, and it emphasises the scope for improvement in Hillsdown's working capital management. Tough management words about imported French fowl admittedly need to be matched by action. But the market itself may be in danger of playing chicken.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil to launch Dollars 1.5bn farm credit package BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT Fernando Collor is expected to launch a new Dollars 1.5bn agricultural package tomorrow to provide credit for marketing the near record harvest expected. After its disastrous performance of 1990 Brazil's farm sector has seen an impressive turnround since government credits were finally released last October, just in time for planting. According to Mr Antonio Cabrera, the agriculture minister, this year's harvest will amount to 69.6m tonnes - the second highest total ever. The recent release of credits marks a radical reversal in thegovernment's policy. The strategy adopted by Ms Zelia Cardoso, the former economy minister, of scrapping subsidies and using imports to force down prices in the 1990-91 season, resulted in a 7m-tonne shortfall in food products and a foreign exchange loss through lost export earnings and increased imports that Banco do Brasil estimates at about Dollars 3.5bn. Moreover, the rise in wholesale food prices has been a major source of inflation, increasing 513 per cent compared with yearly inflation of 470 per cent. By contrast Ms Cardoso's successor, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, who took office last May, sees the recovery of the farm sector and a bumper harvest as crucial weapons in the fight to reduce the inflation rate and restimulate the economy in Brazil's interior. This year's increased output is mainly due to higher yields rather than increased acreage. The amount of land under cultivation has increased by only 2.6 per cent while the harvest is expected to be more than 20 per cent up. The director of a major food processing company explained 'although Zelia's policy was absurd and had no basis in reality it did have one positive result - the weeding out of inefficient farmers'. Tomorrow's 30-measure package will include the allocation of Cr300bn (Pounds 100m)in loans for marketing purposes, at real interest rates of 9 per cent a year for small- and medium-scale producers and 12 per cent for large producers. A further Cr650bn will be released to help finance the planting of the winter crops, particularly of wheat. The government is hoping to raise this year's wheat production to 4m tonnes from last year's 3m tonnes. Domestic consumption is about 7m tonnes. The remaining money will be for financing the purchase of farm machinery and soil nutrients. Mr Collor will also announce the creation of rural funds to attract foreign investment, hoping to capitalise on Dollars 1bn in foreign money which has entered the Brazilian bourse since it was opened up to foreigners last July. Analysts say, however, that they doubt the ability of the Brazilian agricultural sector to attract foreign investment. The package follows Dollars 100m in credit released last month to cocoa growers in the north-east to refinance debts, help combat witches broom disease and to diversify production, and Cr1,000bn made available in October in low interest credits, reduced from 18 to 9 per cent, and reduced tariffs for pesticides. Mr Cabrera now says that, apart from wheat, it will not be necessary to import basic foodstuffs in 1992. In a recent interview he defended the government's reversal in policy arguing, 'subsidies should be given for harvesting in as much as they guarantee domestic supply. The classic error of Brazilian agriculture in the past was to subsidise the intention to produce'.</p>

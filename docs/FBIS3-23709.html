			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Akimov: "VEB Will Carry Out State Tasks: </F> Vneshekonombank Reorganization Has Begun"]    [Text] It looks as though the Vneshekonombank [Bank  for Foreign Economic Activities] will finally acquire a clearly  defined status. Yesterday the bank received the Edict of the  President of Russia "On Issues Regarding the Activities of the  USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Relations," in keeping with which  it officially becomes a state financial institution specializing  exclusively in servicing the foreign debt and assets of the  former USSR (and in the future, of Russia as well), as well as  government credit lines. Actually, these are precisely the  functions Vneshekonombank continued to carry out during the  two-year period since its de facto bankruptcy.    Let us recall that the activities of the Vneshekonombank  (VEB) over the past two years were conducted on the basis of a  decree of the Russian Supreme Soviet Presidium dated 13 January  1992. In keeping with this decree, the charter, reserve, and  other funds, buildings, and other property were transferred to  the Central Bank, while the bank's current operations were  conducted by the Operational Management Committee. The  president's latest edict envisages transferring the  aforementioned funds and other property to Vneshekonombank's  full economic disposal, while the committee is to be liquidated.  The bank is headed by a chairman appointed for three years by  presidential edict, while it is managed collectively by the  board of directors (two deputy chairmen and six members of the  council); appointments to the board were approved by the  Government of Russia on 24 January. According to VEB's acting  chairman Anatoliy Nosko, separating the handling of state  functions from purely commercial operations is an absolutely  necessary measure. Otherwise, there is a great probability of  the situation that occurred in the bank in December 1991  developing. Therefore, over the past few years such functions of  the bank as servicing legal and physical entities, trade  operations clearing, and other area of activities typical of a  regular commercial bank have been dropped. At the same time, its  subsidiaries and branches abroad have been transferred to the  Vneshekonombank of Russia. Thus, the bank currently will  concentrate on carrying out five basic functions. First and  foremost, servicing Russia's foreign debt (including that of the  former USSR), as well as clearing and control operations related  to the government's centralized credits and financial  guarantees. Equally important functions that remain the  responsibility of the bank are servicing the bonds of the  domestic hard currency bond issue, repayment of debt to private  individuals, and conducting in-house trading operations.    The Vneshekonombank leadership has prepared a memorandum for  the government on the bank's conversion to joint-stock holding.  Its stockholders will be the Ministry of Finance, the Central  Bank, and the State Committee for the Administration of State  Property. A corresponding agreement has already been reached,  and after the final coordination of positions the government is  expected to approve the proposed draft. It is envisaged that  approximately in a month the stockholders will approve the  bank's new charter and determine their shares in the charter  capital. It will amount to a total of 30 billion rubles [R].  Taking into account that Vneshekonombank's charter capital is  R26 billion, practically no budget money will be required to  bring it to the required total.</p>

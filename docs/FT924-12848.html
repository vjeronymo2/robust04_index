			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (3): A stream of consolidation - Despite the downturn in US deals, there has been some activity 'FEAST AND famine' well describes the switch from the bid-heady days of the 1980s to the deal-starved climate of the 1990s. For the moment at least - and despite some optimistic noises by US investment bankers in the early summer - the dearth of deals continues. A few statistics tell the story bluntly. Since the start of 1992, only nine deals involving US targets and topping the Dollars 1bn-mark have been announced. In the third quarter alone, there were just two - namely the purchase of Fisher Controls International by Emerson Electric from Monsanto for Dollars 1.3bn, and Mellon Bank's acquisition of Boston Company from American Express's Shearson Lehman subsidiary for Dollars 1.45bn. More broadly, the dollar volume for merger-related activity involving US targets totalled just Dollars 127.8bn during the first nine months of 1992, according to Securities Data. This represented an 18 per cent fall from the already depressed figure seen in the same period of 1991. The decline in the US market was somewhat more pronounced than elsewhere: Securities Data calculates that global merger and acquisition activity over the same period reached 10,600 deals, with a value of Dollars 288.1bn. That was a 16 per cent decline from the Dollars 341.2bn-worth of the deals (11,725 separate transactions) seen in the first nine months of 1991. However, despite these generally depressed levels of merger activity, some trends have been discernible. The first, and most obvious, is the continued consolidation in certain specific industrial and commercial sectors. Perhaps this has been most visible in the commercial banking industry. On the one hand, many banks are still struggling under the weight of souring property-related investments and loans, and eager to prune costs via economies of scale. On the other, some relatively healthy institutions have taken advantage of their neighbours' misfortunes and are aggressively expanding. This has led to the creation of 'super-regional' banks - such as Banc One, the expansion-minded institution centred in Columbus, Ohio, and North Carolina-based Nationsbank - and spurred a multitude of deals. This year alone, for example, Banc One has announced plans to lap up the likes of First Community Bancorp, in a Dollars 125m stock swap deal, Key Centurian Bancshares of West Virginia for Dollars 536m, and Valley National Bank of Arizona for Dollars 1.2bn. But banking is by no means the only sector where consolidation has prompted an upturn in M&amp;A business. In the telecommunications field, for example, there has been a steady stream of tie-ups - thanks to technological and regulatory changes, and the pressures of international competition. The biggest deal proposed in the sector this year - in fact, the largest transaction announced in any sector in 1992 - has been the Dollars 2.85bn merger between Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telephone company, and Centel, a large Chicago-based local telephone operator. As Sprint's chairman was quick to point out, the resulting group would be the only US operator in all three major telecommunications markets - namely, long distance, local services and cellular communications. Foreigners have had a role in this process, too. In some industries, consolidation is a global phenomenon, rather than a domestic one. Accordingly, acquisition interest comes outside US shores as well as within them and - from time to time - raises issues of foreign ownership of key domestic assets. The airline sector is a case in point. Recession in the big domestic market, overcapacity and acute price competition between carriers have combined to create losses of around Dollars 7bn in the industry since 1990. This, in turn, has caused US airlines to focus on international expansion, while European carriers have realised that this is probably the last chance to grab a toehold the US market - unappealing at present, but hopefully profitable down the road. So the deal proposals have flowed. British Airways, for example, wants to invest Dollars 750m in USAir, the sixth largest US airline; Lufthansa, Air Canada and Scandinavian Air Systems (SAS) have all shown some interest in Continental Airlines; KLM wants to merge operationally with Northwest Airlines. All this has caused much angst over bilateral aviation arrangements, with the US airlines generally demanding 'open skies' as a pre-condition to allowing foreign operators into their home market. Whether the powerful US 'mega-carriers' get their way on this remains to be seen: the degree to which foreign investment will be permitted in the US airline sector remains extremely moot. In general, payment for acquisitions this year has come either from the cash resources of the purchaser, or via some form of share swap deal. Despite the relaxation of controls on 'highly leveraged transactions', bank finance and junk bond financing has played a minor role. One sizeable deal proved the exception. That was the purchase of American Re-Insurance Company by a management-led, investor group including New York's Kolhberg, Kravis, Roberts, from Aetna, the large US composite insurer. About three-quarters of the Dollars 1.43bn purchase price was raised through bank finance and the issuance of debt securities. Finally, if mergers and acquisitions have been on a declining trend, at least there has been some work in the 'demerger' area. Several large companies have seen the advantage of 'spinning off' laggardly subsidiaries to their shareholders as free-standing quoted entities, thus freeing up the remaining businesses. These have included Ralston Purina, the St Louis-based consumer products company, which has announced plans to shed its Continental Baking Company subsidiary in this manner; Union Carbide, with its industrial gases operations; and, most recently, Marriott, which plans to separate its property assets from its more buoyant hotel and lodging management business.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                     LARGEST ACQUISITIONS OF 1992  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Target                     Acquirer            Value  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Centel Corp                Sprint Corp         Dollars 2.85bn Gulf States Utilities      Entergy Corp        Dollars 2.28bn Boston Company             Mellon Bank         Dollars 1.45bn American Re-Insurance      American Re Corp    Dollars 1.43bn Fisher Controls            Emerson Electric    Dollars 1.27bn Valley National Corp       Bank One            Dollars 1.19bn Chevron PBC                Pennzoil            Dollars 1.17bn AFG Industries             Asahi Glass         Dollars 1.1bn Wetterau                   Super Valu          Dollars 1.08bn Puget Sound Bancorp        Keycorp             Dollars 889.8m  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

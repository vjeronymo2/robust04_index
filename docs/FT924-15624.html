			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Money Markets: New gloom on rates RATES in the sterling cash market firmed yesterday afternoon as the pound fell sharply against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. In the absence of a cut in German interest rates or any clear economic policy from the UK government, the pound lost nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark. Until yesterday, several money market dealers had been assuming that there could be another cut in UK base rates announced at next week's Conservative party conference to boost the government's fortunes. According to one discount house director, that cut seems less likely. 'The government has made a complete hash of it,' he said. 'If they had cut base rates earlier this week, sterling would not have suffered much. Now, the cost of a rate cut next week will be another big fall in the currency.' Even so, the impact on rates and prices was smaller than might have been expected. Three-month money in the sterling cash market rose to 9 1/16 per cent from a previous close of 9 per cent on Thursday night. The December short sterling contract closed down 13 basis points at 91.72, taking a less bullish view of a rate cut before the end of the year. The reaction to the Bundesbank council meeting across Europe was markedly different. Although there was no change in rates, dealers were encouraged by the central bank's decision to change the way it offers securities repurchase funds to the banking system by setting two-week tenders rather than the traditional one- or two-month pacts. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, also raised hopes of some change in the bank's policy on rates by saying that the recent currency intervention meant that German M3 money supply data were no longer as valid as they had been. The December Euro-Deutschmark contract rose 16 basis points to close at 91.70. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn and purchased Pounds 34m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 150m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.2bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 247m in Band 1, Pounds 416m in Band 2 at 8 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 140m in the 'repo.' Late assistance was Pounds 10m.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Water advances 4.2% Yorkshire Water said its non-regulated businesses made an small but encouraging contribution to pre-tax profits, which grew by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 74.8m in the six months to September 30, against Pounds 71.8m. The interim dividend is lifted 8 per cent to 7.6p (7.05p). The interim payment will exceptionally be made on April 6, to take advantage of the reduction in the rate of advance corporation tax effective from that date. Turnover rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 259.4m (Pounds 239.5m), in which there was an overall increase in main charges income from the core business of a little more than 5 per cent, and an increase of nearly 75 per cent from non-regulated activities. The downward trend in industrial and commercial water consumption continued and this seemed likely to be maintained as more customers sought economies. Investment in water services totalled Pounds 112m in the first six months, almost 20 per cent below last year's record level. Investment totalling Pounds 260m was planned for the full year, which Yorkshire said was sufficient to maintain progress towards compliance with the company's quality and environmental obligations. Non-regulated activities contributed Pounds 2.9m to operating profits of Pounds 83.8m. A further Pounds 63m was invested in the non-regulated activities during the period, including the purchasing of a third leasing company in July for Pounds 51m. The operating profits were evenly split between leasing, property and environmental activities. Net debt rose Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 225.9m, giving gearing of 18.3 per cent, up from 11.2 per cent. Earnings per share were 36.1p (34.4p). COMMENT Yorkshire's shares closed 25p higher at 585p, boosted partly by a rising market. However, the company helped give the whole sector a lift by talking again about the scope for reducing manning levels over the next five years, which will be speeded by a new management structure. The shares are on a prospective yield of about 5 per cent, which puts them in the middle of the pack. Yorkshire has done well on the costs front and seems to have chosen interesting areas for diversification, such as medical incineration. However, the shares are likely to drift, along with the rest of the sector, until the regulator gives a clearer indication in July of the pricing regime which will apply from 1995 onwards.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 14--A Parliamentary Standing  Committee of the Commerce Ministry has rejected the non-BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] opposition parties' view that India  should not hesitate to opt out of the ongoing Uruguay Round of  trade talks on Dunkel proposals. It was wrong to argue that  India's interest would be served best by giving up the GATT  membership, it said.    In its third report on Dunkel draft proposals, tabled in the  Rajya Sabha by its chairman, Mr. I.K. Gujral, the committee  admitted that the final outcome was not in the best interest of  India on every count. But, it argued, in multilateral  agreements, "it is always a question of give and take."    Stating that in today's world with increasing  inter-dependence of nations multilateral pacts with  Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) status were advantageous compared to  bilateral pacts, the committee cautioned that the country's  commercial interests would be ill-served by giving up the GATT  membership.    It asked the Government to actively negotiate to bring about  a more reasonable balance in the proposed agreement which  remains loaded against developing countries, and consider ways  to safeguard the sovereign economic rights of developing  countries by making common cause with other developing countries.    The committee said that with the ratification of the present  round of GATT negotiations, the option now available with the  United States to clamp Super 301 unilaterally against any  country should also cease. However, it urged Indian negotiations  to obtain specific clarifications to that effect.    Referring to individual issues that have a bearing on the  country's economic well-being, the committee said a witness  deposing before it stated he did not think that Indian  agriculture would gain the export market due to reduction in  subsidies made by the developed countries. This was because  liberalisation in agriculture would be limited and the  international support levels for their agricultural products  would be reduced by 20 per cent only. Besides, the witness  argued the Dunkel text provided for very strict phytosanitary  (plant related) standards to be observed for agricultural  exports. India and other developing countries would hardly be  able to meet these standards, resulting in rejection of their  exports.    The committee said the Dunkel proposals would discriminate  against Indian agriculture as the subsidies have to be limited  to an upper bound of 10 percent of the value of the output for  developing countries. This might have grave implications for the  poor resource farmers because with increasing cost of energy and  other inputs the sectorwise subsidy might exceed this limit.    The committee was of the opinion that contrary to the avowed  object of including agriculture in GATT, the result of complying  with the Dunkel draft proposal could enable the developed  countries to capture the food markets of developing countries  and also to control the gene sequences, microbiological  resources and genetic engineering.    Threat to PDS [public distribution system]: The  committee said if the Dunkel draft was accepted at its face  value, the public distribution system could come under severe  strain and jeopardy and as such a clear understanding must be  obtained from the GATT Secretariat that the country's PDS would  not be hit in any way now or in future.    Taking exception to the informality of the understanding  that  the traditional rights and practices of the Indian farmer for  preservation, sale and free exchange of seeds must remain  unaffected, the committee said this might not serve the purpose  in the days to come and wanted these safeguards given "specific  mention" in the GATT.    Referring to Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights  (TRIPS), the committee viewed with grave concern the impact the  proposed patent regime would have on India's drug prices. It was  of the view that specific instruments must be provided in the  TRIPS agreement to ensure that the patent holders did not use  their monopoly power to cause steep increase in the prices of  drugs and also to ensure that India's fast developing indigenous  drug industry was not "gobbled up" by the multinationals.    "The primacy of public interests over the rights of the  patent holders should be ensured," it added.    The committee said the Indian patent law had been rightly  emphasising patenting of the process and not the product and  this should be maintained.    Patent regime: The proposed extension of patent  from the current five to seven years to 20 years period  virtually discourages any research and development and this  should not be conceded, the committee said. It said India should  insist on grant of automatic licensing in certain circumstances  from the patent-holders in public interests. It said  micro-organism and biological process should be kept out of the  patent regime.    The committee said to sustain the ongoing modernisation of  the Indian industry, it was important that technology transfers  continued unimpaired. "The Dunkel draft on TRIPS militates  against GATT principles that countries at different stages of  development need to be treated differently in as much as the  interests of developing countries like India have been ignored  in favour of developed countries," the committee said.    On textiles and clothing, the committee said India should  explore possibilities to get reasonable improvement in the text  as this was one area where India's interest from a liberalised  trade was clearly visible and there should be efforts to ensure  that potential gains were realised.    On Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), the committee  noted the proposed TRIPS restricted the power of the Government  to regulate and control foreign investment. The provisions of  the Dunkel draft grant foreign investors advantageous position  vis-a-vis Indian investors.    Services sector: On services, the committee said  given the stage of India's development, "we should be wary in  accepting any binding commitments to open up our services sector  where we do not see any economic advantages and what may  militate against domestic enterprises."    The committee observed point-blank that no access should be  offered as a matter of right in spheres of banking, insurance  and telecommunication services. It also viewed with concern the  "unbalanced" nature of General Agreement on Trade in Services  (GATS), which while allowing for unrestrained flow of  capital-related services, said little about the labour-related  services.    The committee was also of the view the integrated dispute  settlement mechanism as provided in the Multilateral Trade  Organisation (MTO) was heavily loaded against developing  countries like India, as they could be easily subjected to  cross-retaliation.    Fresh discussion sought: Members in the Rajya  Sabha today demanded a fresh discussion on the Dunkel draft  proposals.    Drawing attention of the chairperson to the report, Mr.  Kamal  Morarka (Samajwadi Party) said during zero-hour that the tabling  of the report comes at a time when important talks are on  between the United States and European Community--the outcome of  which could have far-reaching implications for India.    Mr. Jaipal Reddy (Janata Dal) also supported the demand for  fresh discussion on the report.</p>

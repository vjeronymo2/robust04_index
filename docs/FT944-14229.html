			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hochtief builds case for Holzmann / A look at prospects for a ground-breaking merger The more Mr Lothar Mayer talks, the more he sounds like a man negotiating with a guillotine operator over the terms and conditions for a haircut. Mr Mayer, chairman of Philipp Holzmann, Germany's biggest construction concern, is proposing a little bit off the sides. But Mr Hans-Peter Keitel, chief of second-ranked Hochtief, seems to want his head. This lop-sided discussion started late last month, when Hochtief said it intended to increase its stake in Holzmann to about 30 per cent with the purchase of a 10 per cent holding owned by BfG Bank. While Mr Keitel claims he does not want a formal merger - saying the groups should remain as competitors, at least in the domestic market - he makes no bones about wanting to win control. For a start, he needs cartel office approval for his plan to take Hochtief's stake above 25 per cent. Then, he says, he wants to raise his holding to around 40 per cent. At this level he could dominate Holzmann's annual meetings, where it is rare for more than 80 per cent of the shares to be represented. The Hochtief initiative appears to have been prompted by Mr Mayer himself, who almost a year ago said Deutsche Bank was planning to reduce and eventually dispose of its 25.9 per cent stake in Holzmann. Although Deutsche made no comments at the time, a more recent leak that it planned to reduce its holding to 10 per cent effectively put Holzmann into play and forced Hochtief's hand. In Mr Keitel's words, his minority stake was 'taken out of the refrigerator' where it had been stored since 1981. Mr Keitel also revealed last week that his board had been carrying on hitherto fruitless negotiations with Holzmann executives for about a year. Now, however, confronted with Hochtief's ambitions, Mr Mayer seems eager to accept that the two groups can fruitfully 'co-operate' in their overseas operations, where there are no significant overlaps. It is even possible that they might fuse their operations in individual countries or regions, and pass control of the new entities to whichever of the partners has more experience in the particular area, he says. In the US, for example, Holzmann's Jones Group subsidiary would be the ideal leader for such a collaboration. However, there was absolutely no sense in merging German operations. This was a case in which two plus two made considerably less than four, said Mr Mayer. He was hawking a similar line at a meeting with analysts last week. He could well imagine co-operation abroad, 'but not at the price of our independence at home', he said. Mr Mayer also protests that Hochtief's approaches should be rejected on anti-trust grounds. Although the two companies account for only about 3 per cent of the German market - there are about 75,000 building companies in the whole country - Mr Mayer has taken considerable pains to point out that construction expertise within certain specialist sectors is already heavily concentrated in a few hands. These include power stations, underground railways and high-rise office buildings. He claims that the cartel office's timetable (it has given itself a full four months to investigate the deal) indicates that it intends to undertake a thorough probe of these niches. Speaking to journalists last week, Mr Mayer also pointed out that Holzmann had been prevented on anti-trust grounds from taking a 25 per cent stake in the Dywidag group. However, that was 10 years ago, before the awakening to the realities of global competition. Analysts suggest the German anti-trust authorities are nowadays more likely to be interested in possible dangers stemming from the lack of concentration in the German construction business. As the number of companies involved suggests, the industry is heavily influenced by the introspective Mittelstand mentality. The 30 biggest companies together account for less than 15 per cent of the entire market. Although big in German terms, the antagonists in the current affair are no giants in the international arena. Holzmann's DM12.5bn (Dollars 8bn) annual turnover is modest compared with the DM18bn sales at French group Bouygues, for example. Turnover at Hochtief is about DM8bn. Their non-domestic business interests - accounting for a third of sales at Holzmann and a quarter at Hochtief - are also modest by international standards. Analysts, who gave an almost unanimous welcome to the announcement of Hochtief's plans, say that more muscle together with more concentration of skills and financing power are needed if the leaders of the German building industry are to make their way in the world outside their stagnating domestic market. They see traditionalist Holzmann, with its shrinking foreign business, and aggressive Hochtief, with an impressive reputation in airport construction and a markedly better profits record, as the perfect test case of the industry's will and ability to consolidate and find a new way in the world. As one observer said, the idea that the Berlin cartel office should prevent merger or closer collaboration between the two on the grounds of excessive concentration in some domestic niche sector 'would take German provincialism to absurd extremes'.</p>

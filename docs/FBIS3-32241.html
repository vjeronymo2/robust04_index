During  their meeting they analyzed the evolution of the peace  negotiations between the PLO and Israel and Argentine support  for this process of understanding.    During a telephone conversation with CLARIN, Foreign  Minister  Di Tella gave details of his meeting with 'Arafat:    [J.C.] What was the purpose of your meeting with the  Palestinian leader?    [Di Tella] We want to adapt our position to the constant  changes in the world, and this process in the Middle East is an  example of these changes. Argentina acknowledges the peace  efforts of both the PLO and Israel, and now we have met with a  man who is currently handling the weapons of peace. 'Arafat took  our message of support for the peace process very positively.  This is our small contribution to a process that is so important  for the whole world.    [J.C.] Has 'Arafat been invited to visit Argentina?    [Di Tella] Yes; President Menem invited 'Arafat to come to  our country as a gesture of support for the peace process, and  'Arafat was pleased to accept the invitation. In the same way,  'Arafat invited Menem to visit Jericho in the future when the  Palestinian chief installs himself there.    [J.C.] Will Argentina support the Palestinian process of  autonomy diplomatically and materially?    [Di Tella] One of the things we offered them is the  construction of a school, a subject we are discussing with the  Israeli and Arab communities in our country, which might make  economic contributions.    [J.C.] What are the possibilities for the PLO to maintain  diplomatic representation in Buenos Aires?    [Di Tella] There already is a Palestinian delegation in our  country, and in order to make progress on this subject we must  observe the functioning of all these peace agreements and hold  talks with the Palestinians. It is still premature to speak  about this.    [J.C.] Why was the meeting with 'Arafat kept secret?    [Di Tella] Because of 'Arafat's constant movements and the  alternatives in the PLO-Israeli negotiations. The meeting could  not be confirmed until the last moment. Those were the reasons  why we did not want to release information about these talks.    [J.C.] Has there been any Israeli influence to prevent this  meeting with 'Arafat from being made public?    [Di Tella] Not in the least. The Israelis knew about this  meeting and did not object to it at all.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Olzhas Suleymenov by Mikhail Ambartsumyan; </F> date and place not given: "In International Kazakhstan People  Have More Things in Common Than They Have Differences...."]    [Text] Almaty-- The results of the elections to the  Supreme Council and the local representative authorities have  still to be discussed and analyzed. It has still to be learned  which political parties and public associations have won the  greater trust of the electorate and why, and which candidates  did not get elected to parliament and for what reasons. But it  may be said even today that Kazakhstanis link their hopes for a  better life with the new parliament.    His thoughts on the paths of development of sovereign  Kazakhstan, the political situation, and the unfolding  interethnic relations are shared today by People's Writer Olzhas  Suleymenov, chairman of the People's Congress of Kazakhstan  party. He was nominated for deputy of the Supreme Council on the  official slate for Semipalatinsk Oblast and has, according to  the preliminary data, been elected to the new parliament.    [Ambartsumyan] Olzhas Omarovich, the first question is  connected with the "comrade" form of address. As distinct from  many other representatives of your party, you have retained it.    [Suleymenov] It is what we acquired over many decades of  dealings with one another. The word "comrade" retains a particle  of the warmth of the soul of our fathers. And they are not to  blame for the fact that our Great History of what is now the  former Soviet Union bore within it the tragic element of the era  of "victorious socialism."    We must see realistically what has happened to us and draw  certain conclusions for the future, not wasting our acquired  values, but, on the contrary, multiplying them. Genuine  innovation does not cancel out all traditions but implies the  development of the best.    We have been accustomed to beginning each new stage of  history with a castigation of the past. This is why history as  such has not been preserved in our consciousness. The "accursed  past" the whole time. But there were in that past both joy and  great discoveries also. And the main discovery, which has been  called into question in recent years, unfortunately, is the  friendship of the peoples. We should not give it away to anyone.  To no independent orators and ranters, to no new careerist.    Internationalism is for this reason the firm foundation of  our party's political program. The vital need for such a  foundation is all the more obvious now, when some multinational  republics are before our eyes becoming tragically mononational.  In international Kazakhstan, people have more things in common  than they have differences.    When I visit the Kazakh villages and see under what  conditions people deprived of electricity, water, and telephones  are dragging out a "survival" existence, it is clear that this  problem will not be resolved by Kazakhs alone. The  Russian-speaking population in the overpopulated industrial  cities has its troubles also. The shortage of drinking water is  growing in Mangistau Oblast, for example. Were the  nuclear-powered desalination plant to be halted, the oblast  would be left without water, heating, and light. And Mangistau  means hundreds of thousands of people, oilfields, and a powerful  industry. The main reason for the trouble is the exodus of  specialists to Russia, to Ukraine. Why? Uncertainty as to the  future.    [Ambartsumyan] The period of formation of the sovereign  state  is complex and contradictory. We are now hearing the opinions of  many people, political scientists included, concerning the  possibility of the introduction of dual citizenship in the  republic.    [Suleymenov] The demand for second citizenship is the  effect,  and the cause is lack of confidence that the rights of certain  categories of citizens in the republic will not be infringed.  Language rights, primarily. If a person is persuaded that, on  account of his ignorance of Kazakh, neither he nor his children  have a future, he will, of course, look to where knowledge of  Russian secures for him a normal life. The Constitution  seemingly guarantees against persecution on a language basis,  but in reality everything is far more complicated. And if in the  name of the tranquillity of Kazakhstan and its 17 million  citizens it is necessary to revise certain articles of the  Constitution, this should, I believe, be done. The causes of a  maturing conflict need to be removed.    It is impossible to imagine that in Kazakhstan over 50  percent of the population will have other citizenship. This is  like being on a passenger airliner. Half the people have  parachutes and, should an accident occur, could save themselves,  and the other half? It is rational and logical to have an  airplane in a state of good repair and to improve its control in  order that we might feel confident about the success of the  flight. Then no one would require any parachute.    I want the Kazakh land to live in peace, tranquillity, and  satiety. The Kazakhs to feel dignified. The Russians to have a  better life here than in Russia, Ukrainians, better than in  Ukraine, the Germans, better than in Germany, and so forth. And  then no one would want to leave us. People would be proud of  their Kazakh citizenship. "We are the people of  Kazakhstan"--this is the motto of our party.    The Russian Kazakhstani has long been distinguished from the  Russian. A different cast of consciousness. For example, my  school comrade Aleksey Ugreninov, having married, left for  Krasnodon. Six months later he wrote me a letter: "Before, when  I lived in Kazakhstan, if I heard a dombra on the air, I would  turn off the radio. Now, living in Krasnodon, hearing Kazakh  music, I turn the volume up full and sit and weep. I greatly  miss Kazakhstan, my homeland, where I was born and raised."    [Ambartsumyan] You have already partially touched on a very  serious, difficult question--the two official languages.    [Suleymenov] We must be realists and recognize that the  official language was for decades Russian. Kazakh--nominally the  official language--is only just being pulled up to the level of  Russian. And we know that there have been far from professional  attempts to speed up this progress. But they have only  discredited this mission itself. Thank God, the government has  put right many zealous administrators, who had "endeavored" to  translate clerical work into Kazakh immediately. And I saw how  high-class doctors, totally at a loss, not knowing how to fill  out the history of a disease in Kazakh, quit. Who suffered from  this? Patients, the people.    The process of the formation of a second official language  is  very long, delicate, and complex. It cannot be accomplished by  some edict of rayon, city, oblast, or republic authorities. Our  language, like many others also, was sacrificed to the idea of  the communist society. It was said that in the future there  would be no national differences. And our fathers and  grandfathers believed this. And the peoples are not to blame for  the fact that so pronounced a linguistic disproportion took  shape over 70 and more years. And it cannot be eliminated in two  or three years.    For this reason we objectively have two official languages.  One is traditional-official, the other is fledgling-official. If  necessary, this should, I believe, be documented by the new  parliament so that there should be no speculation or repressive  measures and so that people who are the exponents of the Russian  language should feel themselves to be full-blooded citizens of  the republic and be at ease over their children's future. So  that Kazakh should gain strength, ascend, and naturally  penetrate all spheres. I have made my credo: "To elevate the  steppe without belittling the mountains," my life's conviction.  And only such a path of development of the Kazakh nation will be  fruitful.    [Ambartsumyan] You have advanced the slogan: "From age-old  dependence through independence to a recognition of  interdependence." Could you, perhaps, decode this?    [Suleymenov] Last summer I proposed the incorporation in the  program of our party, the NKK [People's Congress of Kazakhstan],  the idea of a future confederation of the states of Eurasia. Its  initial stage implies confederal relations between Kazakhstan  and Russia. After this, I was rebuked in certain news media for  not being a patriot of my country. But I love Kazakhstan, and I  have no need to prove this, I think.    The main token of the difficult period of disintegration of  the USSR has been the steep fall in production, constituting 50  percent in some republics. The people are, consequently,  becoming impoverished. We all feel and understand full well the  need for the restoration of economic union, primarily with  Russia, but within the framework of a confederal agreement.  Sovereignty and independence here by no means imply one state's  self-isolation from another. This is the same independence as  that of the vivifying organs in each organism. All the best  sober-minded forces of our republic, therefore, should be  aspiring to the creation of an infrastructure of a future  community of states that preserves the conditions for the full,  free, and equal coexistence of sovereign countries in the  example of the European economic confederation, which has  already been created.    There is no escaping the fact that Kazakhstan is  economically  dependent on Russia and that Russia depends to a large extent on  Kazakhstan also. All the Urals foundries without exception are  unable to cope without Sokolovskaya-Sarbay ore and without our  nonferrous metals, and 92 percent of native chromium is mined on  Aktyubinsk land. And without Kazakhstan chromium, there is no  Russian alloyed steel. We will, therefore, make every effort to  preserve the common economic space and raise it to the higher  level of confederal union.    [Ambartsumyan] But for this it is necessary to create the  corresponding legislative base, which would enable the  government to undertake important economic reforms.    [Suleymenov] I hope that the newly elected professional  parliament will be capable of tackling this problem.    It is very important that society not split along national  lines. The epidemic of national demarcation which has gripped  certain republics of the former Union is penetrating Kazakhstan  also. Unless we are able to resist this phenomenon, we will have  no future. If, however, we recognize this danger in time and  take the path of good sense and common sense, we can look  forward to a splendid future.    If we avail ourselves in proprietary and solicitous fashion  of the powerful resource base of Kazakhstan and the strong  personnel potential (and this means thousands of engineers,  highly skilled workers, specialists of agriculture, and  scientists), we can achieve a great deal. And our party, the  People's Congress of Kazakhstan, offers such a program.    [Ambartsumyan] Your party has a strong economic analysis  group. Can we already speak of specific efforts to its credit?    [Suleymenov] Yes, highly skilled economists, historians,  political scientists, psychologists, entrepreneurs, and  representatives of religious beliefs are members of this group.  Our comrades carefully analyze the phenomena occurring in the  life of the republic, make forecasts, and generate specific  recommendations, which are subsequently used in various party  programs. And some of them are being implemented already. Not  many readers know, for example, that Kazakhstan wool was going  begging and that thousands of tonnes of it had piled up at the  warehouses. Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, it had been  used for sewing the greatcoats of men of the Soviet Army. Now  everyone in any way connected with this production had been left  without a crust. And here our economists and entrepreneurs drew  up a special program for use of the wool and set up the Klem  corporation for the manufacture of carpets and felt. Equipment  is being purchased in Turkey, and it will be distributed in the  villages among the seamstresses free of charge. Good-quality and  inexpensive carpets made from Kazakhstan wool will be made at  home. We are thinking of increasing their manufacture in the  future to 1 million items a year. The problems of work for the  women in the countryside are being resolved in this way to some  extent.    We would like to set up garment production at the home in  the  cities also. If the women receive all that they need, from the  machines through the thread, there will be no need to build  giant garment factories. But the people would obtain from the  home workers, on the other hand, a particular quantity of  high-quality merchandise produced on a competitive basis and  under the aegis of this firm or the other.    In the past year alone, funds of our entrepreneurs purchased  an Italian baby food plant and four bakeries. One of them, in  Pavlodar, is already producing fresh bread. The others are  located in Semipalatinsk and West Kazakhstan oblasts. Medicines  and 1,000 tonnes of baby food have been purchased for $1  million. Members of our party are channeling all this to needy  people free of charge around the oblasts, in targeted fashion,  down to the rayon component.    [Ambartsumyan] The Nevada-Semipalatinsk international  antinuclear movement, of which you are a founder and the  permanent president, is five years old now. You write frequently  in the press and speak on television on this subject.  Nonetheless, what are your strongest impressions in connection  with the minor anniversary of this movement?    [Suleymenov] The most appalling thing was that the nuclear  testing at the Semipalatinsk range was carried out in an  atmosphere of eerie secrecy. Therefore, even the people living  in this region did not know what was going on there. They were  frightened when the earth shook beneath them (the force of the  jolts reached 5) and were subjected to lethal radiation.    How many persons departed life for this reason, no one  knows.  Two diagnoses--tuberculosis or brucellosis--were made of the  deceased. And only when our movement appeared were we able to  make contact with some documents of that time.    Many people now know Karipbek Kuyukov of Semipalatinsk  Oblast. He was born without arms, but became an artist. He draws  with a brush and pencil clenched between his teeth. We went to  Japan together and took part in protest demonstrations against  the nuclear tests carried out in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I  recall how he went into the square, where several thousand  people were gathered, and said: "The gesture of our movement is  an open palm, five continents against five test ranges. But I  cannot make this gesture." And the whole square raised its hands  with open palms. An unforgettable, stupendous feeling gripped  all those present.    I am grateful to and have profound respect for the parents  of  Karipbek Kuyukov. They raised him, feeling by the hour his and  their own misfortune. What a great feat of mother and father! He  is now nearly 30 years old. And he is telling people of the  world what misfortune nuclear weapons bring.    [Ambartsumyan] Concluding the interview, I have to ask you  about your literary plans. Your numerous admirers want to see  new poems and works.    [Suleymenov] At this time the fate of literature does not  excite me as much as the fate of my readers. We writers are  going into politics not because we lack economists or because  there is none beside us to uphold people's rights, but because  we feel the need for personal, direct participation in the  formation of our state.    But I am working, nonetheless, and completing in draft form  my new book, which will be entitled "One Thousand and One  Words." I hope to be able to present it to my readers this year.</p>

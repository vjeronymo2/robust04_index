			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EMPLOYERS GO BACK TO THE FUTURE TO FILL TEMPORARY SLOTS;  </P> <P> SUMMER JOBS: LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PROVIDE AN OVERLOOKED POOL OF EMPLOYEES  AND GAIN MUCH-NEEDED EXPERIENCE WHILE LEARNING WORK ETHIC.  </P> <P> Getting good, temporary help quickly can often be a troublesome task for  employers, but many San Diego businesses have been filling their employment  needs by tapping into tomorrow's work force: local youth.  </P> <P> Whether it's a hotelier who needs extra manpower at the front desk, a marketing  firm that needs help conducting a public opinion poll, or a manufacturer who  needs a delivery person, the San Diego Consortium &amp; Private Industry  Council encourages local businesses that need summer help to turn to its  Hire-A-Youth Program.  </P> <P> Since 1983, the council -- a coalition of private business leaders, county and  city officials, and educators -- has been matching employers' needs with  youthful workers' skills and abilities.  </P> <P> The 7-year-old program, which is jointly sponsored by the state Employment  Development Department, has provided local businesses with nearly 57,000 young  workers. And most have made their employers happy: A survey of 50 randomly  selected employers who participated in Hire-A-Youth last year showed that 95%  would hire through the program again.  </P> <P> But, these days, Hire-A-Youth officials say, employers have a responsibility to  use the program. Program advocates say the business community must address  critics' complaints about ill-prepared, uninspired youth, and help train and  educate them to ensure a viable future work force.  </P> <P> "We've left educators to worry about and solve the many problems that plague  our youth, but then we complain about them when they turn 18 and show up on our  doorsteps," said Reint Reinders, general manager of the La Jolla Marriott and  chairman of the Hire-A-Youth program.  </P> <P> "Many businesses can always use temporary help, others might be expanding  certain operations and could take on a few more hires. . . we're asking those  people to hire a youth," Reinders said. "And, even if they don't have a  pressing need, we're asking people to see if they can create a slot."  </P> <P> Program officials are asking private employers to provide youngsters, ages  14-21, jobs that would last a minimum of six weeks, 20 hours each week and pay  $5.00 an hour. "It would only cost $600," Reinders added."  </P> <P> Hire-A-Youth is counting on the private sector to provide 4,000 jobs this  summer, said Margie Rosas, the program's coordinator at the Private Industry  Council.  </P> <P> But Rosas said the Private Industry Council will be able to offer an additional  2,550 government-subsidized jobs funded by the federal Job Training Partnership  Act (JTPA), which helps finance job training for low-income, disadvantaged  youth. This year, the Hire-A-Youth program has been allocated $3.4 million in  federal funds.  </P> <P> Under the program's more structured subsidized component, Rosas said,  Hire-A-Youth officials are able to raise youngsters' awareness of the link  between education and a good job.  </P> <P> Individuals who meet JTPA criteria are given a minimum of eight hours of "labor  market orientation" that teaches job interviewing skills, goal-planning, and  the importance of proper dress and behavior in the workplace. But, more  important, Rosas said, applicants are given a standardized test that measures  competence in English comprehension and mathematics.  </P> <P> Those who lack such basic skills "spend half the day in a summer school  remedial education program and spend the other half at a job," Rosas said.  </P> <P> "The objective here is to provide more than just a summer job," Rosas said.  "It's one way to help make sure tomorrow's work force is educated properly. The  kids find out what they have to know to be able to join the work force."  </P> <P> Under the subsidized component, youngsters typically land clerical, computer,  maintenance and writing work at local government departments or at private,  nonprofit organizations. Such jobs provide a minimum of 180 hours of work at  minimum wage, $4.25 an hour.  </P> <P> Ann Burr, president of Southwestern Cable TV, says this summer will be the  fourth time her company has participated in Hire-A-Youth. Burr has offered  youngsters a variety of jobs at her company, including positions in cable  equipment repair, warehouse receiving and distribution, public affairs and  marketing.  </P> <P> Burr said she's already witnessed the program's short- and long-term benefits.  </P> <P> "We've placed people in the marketing department, where they've helped us  conduct telephone surveys, or helped us research and develop a position paper  which we used to decide whether we should proceed with a particular project,"  Burr said.  </P> <P> "It's an opportunity for us to offer a youth their first, positive work  experience and maybe they'll come back to the industry they worked in."  </P> <P> Through the Hire-A-Youth program, Tony Zych got a job repairing cable  converters at Southwestern Cable two years ago.  </P> <P> "It gave me a chance to get my feet in the door and show what I could do," said  Zych, 21, who received electronics training at Mira Mesa High School. When Zych  graduated, Southwestern Cable offered him a permanent job.  </P> <P> Last year, Jesse Wesley, 17, a junior at Gompers Secondary School Center for  Mathematics, Science and Computer Technology in Southeast San Diego, won a job.  </P> <P> The Hire-A-Youth program aggressively publicizes to schools and last year  launched its Win-A-Job campaign last year. The creative recruiting method asks  students to describe their career ambitions through an essay, poem or artistic  display. The top three finishers in each category win jobs.  </P> <P> "If a teen-ager goes out and tries to get a job on his own, there's a good  chance he's going to end up" at a fast food restaurant, Wesley said. "The  Hire-A-Youth program let's you find out about different careers," said Wesley,  who said he improved his communication skills by conducting public opinion  surveys for Pacific Group Telemarketing.  </P> <P> Wesley, who aspires to become an astronaut or work in aerospace engineering, is  hoping one of the local engineering or defense companies participates in the  Hire-A-Youth program this summer. "It would give me a glimpse at my career,"  Wesley said. "It would be a wonderful opportunity."  </P></p>

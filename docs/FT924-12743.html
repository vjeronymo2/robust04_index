			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / King Arthur tries to court public opinion: A change of emphasis by the NUM leader MR Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, accuses the government of exacting a terrible revenge on the mining industry. But he is taking his own small revenge on Conservative ministers by failing to provide his usual cameo performance as the stilted demagogue hell-bent on bringing down the government. Mindful of the lack of industrial muscle that his own activists now have, Mr Scargill is addressing a wider audience - the British public - and that requires different language and better manners. Mr Scargill spoke last week after an NUM delegate conference in Sheffield more about the costs to taxpayers of closing the mines than about class solidarity. He even said he did not want a strike. On Saturday, addressing the TUC general council, union leaders said that finger-wagging demands for solidarity had disappeared. Instead he made an impressive presentation of the economic case for coal and rounded it off with a moving story about a miner who has moved house and pit six times in the past six years. His tone has been, if anything, more conciliatory than that of Mr Roy Lynk, leader of the moderate breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, now sitting-in 1,200 feet down Silverhill colliery. With seven out of 11 Nottinghamshire pits due to close, Mr Lynk believes he has been betrayed by the government and fears that his members may vote him out of office in November. Mr Scargill's apparent willingness to accept advice from others may also have something to do with his own re-election, required no later than January. Some Scargill-watchers detect more than just a change of style. They say he is quieter, less cocksure, readier to listen  -as if his 'martyrdom' has given him an inner assurance that he used to lack. He laughs at such a notion. 'You can say what you like, I know that I haven't changed,' he insists, 'but the issues have been finally understood by the British people.' He does say that, so as not to alienate too many people, he has deliberately avoided saying 'I told you so', but he rejects the idea that popularity - or at least acceptance - from the media and public is a new experience. 'I was popular in 1972 and 1974,' he recalls. So is he really the same old Arthur just responding to new political realities? Those realities were drummed home earlier last week at a private meeting with other union leaders and members of his own executive which appear to have convinced Mr Scargill of the need for pragmatism. Some things certainly don't change. In London and Sheffield last week Mr Scargill visibly glowed in the face of media coverage. Some of it, from sectors of the press normally allied to the Conservative party, would have been inconceivable just a few months ago. The coverage emphasised the plight of the threatened mining communities rather than any suggestion that Mr Scargill had embarked on round four of his attempt to bring down a Conservative government. Mr Scargill, although subdued, is acting like a man who believes himself to be on the point of being vindicated by history: his predictions about pit closures are coming true and the current campaign is showing signs of generating precisely the kind of popular feeling against the government that evaded the NUM during the 1984-85 miners'strike. Outside the NUM conference in Sheffield there were no longer young miners shouting their support with football chants and the delegates pointedly refused to sign petitions for a general strike. If it does come to a strike ballot the union will be hoping to secure a Yes vote on the grounds that influencing public opinion has proved inadequate. Many miners will fear losing their redundancy pay - considerably less generous than it was before 1987 but better than nothing. The union, however, will be arguing that British Coal is not entitled to strip away all but the statutory requirement as a result of such action. The union will also be pointing to the radical change in working practices demanded of those who stay in the privatised industry. In that event the old belligerent Arthur Scargill will probably make a return. He showed in Chesterfield on Saturday night that he has not disappeared completely. He defended the decision not to hold a strike ballot in 1984, saying that the miners and the British people wanted a new government and blaming the 'Tory-sponsored' UDM for the 'mess we are now in'.</p>

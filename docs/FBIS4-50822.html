			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, May 21 (CNS) -- According to a provincial  meeting on land administration recently held here, Fujian has  decided that it will not approve in principle the setting up of  new economic development zones. Those items with good prospects  for their economic result will be directed to use wasteland,  waste slope and waste hills there.    By the end of last April, the province has seen 116 economic  development zones of various kinds being approved with a total  of land area already being developed or to be developed in the  near future reaching 104 square kilometres and some 1077 items  with foreign capital of U.S.$3.49 billion have been introduced  into these zones. Despite noticeable achievements have been  made, these zones, however, have occupied too much cultivated  land, leading to strong reactions from the society.    The province canceled 34 such development zones with a total  area of 292 square kilometres and will continue its guidance for  construction of such zones there. Development of those zones  which have been developing at rapid speed and achieved good  economic efficiency will speed up and their experiences will be  spread, those failing to have their items and funds in place and  failing to implement their contracts should be canceled and  those engaging in land speculation will be dealt with according  to law, even revoking their land utilization rights.</p>

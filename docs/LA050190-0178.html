			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAHLER HURT AS REDS LOSE TO PHILLIES, 4-2  </P> <P> Von Hayes broke a 2-2 tie with a seventh-inning homer, John Kruk followed with  another, and Carmelo Martinez had two RBI singles as the Philadelphia Phillies  beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-2 today.  </P> <P> Bruce Ruffin (2-2) allowed seven hits over 6 1/3 innings to give the Phillies a  split of their two-game series.  </P> <P> The Reds lost a starting pitcher to injury for the second time in three days  when Rick Mahler pulled a thigh muscle running out a third-inning grounder and  left the game. Danny Jackson was lost for two weeks when he bruised a forearm  Sunday.  </P> <P> Tim Birtsas (1-1) replaced Mahler and allowed three of the four Phillies' runs,  including the solo homers in the seventh by Hayes and Kruk.  </P> <P> Martinez singled home a run off Mahler in the first inning and did it again in  the fifth off Birtsas to make it 2-0.  </P> <P> Chris Sabo drove home the Reds' first run with a two-out single in the fifth.  The Reds tied it in the sixth on two-out doubles by Mariano Duncan and Paul  O'Neill.  </P> <P> But Hayes hit his third homer with one out in the seventh to snap the tie. One  out later, Kruk homered into the second deck in right field.  </P></p>

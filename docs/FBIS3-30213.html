			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ion Iliescu chaired an ordinary meeting  of the country's Supreme Defense Council at Cotroceni Palace  today. The first point of the agenda was an examination of the  documents adopted by the North Atlantic Council summit in  Brussels on 10-11 January, that is the declaration of the heads  of state and government and the Partnership for Peace [PFP]  documents. The discussions on this agenda point were also  attended by Messrs. Oliviu Gherman and Adrian Nastase,  presidents of the two parliamentary chambers, as guests.    The communique received by fax from Cotroceni Palace, points  out that, by adhering to the PFP Romania, along with the other  partners, is thus reiterating its commitment to fulfill, in good  faith, the obligations included in the UN Charter and the  principles of the Human Rights Declaration, as well as the  commitment to observe the CSCE Final Act and other CSCE  documents.    Unanimously endorsing Romania's adherence to the PFP as a  transitory stage toward full integration in the North Atlantic  Organization, the Supreme Defense Council also endorses further  cooperation with NATO to achieve the goals stipulated by the  basic document. The Supreme Defense Council adopted a number of  preparatory measures to facilitate the fulfillment of the  obligations incumbent upon Romania through the adherence to the  PFP. It was also decided that, in working out the presentation  document, the established team of experts -- consisting of  representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Ministry of National Defense -- should consult with specialists  nominated by NATO. Similarly, consultations should be conducted  with the heads of the political parties represented in  Parliament in order to finalize the document.    Also today, the Supreme Defense Council examined and  endorsed  a report on the strategy and program for mobilizing the national  economy in case of emergency and suggested that the government  should correlate these documents with Romania's reform program  and the special PFP program.    The Supreme Defense Council also endorsed a report on the  activity carried out by the country's Supreme Defense Council in  1993, which will be submitted to Parliament. At the same time,  the Council's activity plan for the current year was also  approved. The latter will be completed with certain activities  resulting from the need to schedule various other actions and  obligations devolving on Romania from the special PFP program,  after its content is known.    The Council also endorsed the proposals on establishing the  legal status of military cemeteries and commemorative war  monuments at home and abroad as well as the legal status of  foreign soldiers buried on Romanian soil.</p>

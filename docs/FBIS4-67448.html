The total land area that could be submerged is  1,072,000 hectares, 473,000 of which are farmland. The projected  direct economic loss in 1991 prices is 17.2 billion rubles.    There have been six major fluctuations of five to 10 meters  in the Caspian's level in our era. Each one has devastated  populated coastal areas and caused the destruction of many  points of civilization. Specialists believe that global climatic  changes largely determine water levels in the Caspian Sea. For  example, while for nearly a century, from 1837 to 1933, the  sea's level fluctuated insignificantly within a range of -25.3  to -26.5 meters, from 1933 to 1977 its level dropped by 290  centimeters, from -26.1 to -29 meters. Beginning in 1978 the  Caspian's level began rising an average of 13 centimeters per  year, for a total to date of 212 centimeters (-26.9 meters). The  trend toward rising water levels remains stable. It cannot be  ruled out that the sea's level will reach its critical mark of  -25 meters in the next 15 to 20 years.    Meanwhile, the ecological, sanitary-epidemiological, and  medical-biological situation in the Caspian's coastal areas  continues to deteriorate. Surface and subsurface waters are  polluted with toxic substances and petroleum products, soil  salinization is progressing, and infectious diseases and  outbreaks of skin ailments and allergies are occurring over a  widening area. Incidentally, this is confirmed by geochemical  studies of soils, bottom sediments, and surface and subsurface  waters in coastal cities; their findings have revealed the  presence of toxic substances in concentrations that are tens of  times in excess of the maximum allowable levels. Despite an  unending series of acts and decrees adopted at various levels  and apparently intended to save the territory from the "deluge,"  ecological conditions in the region are viewed as critical.    A federal program for the Caspian, spanning the period up to  2000, was drawn up in 1993. Researchers at institutes of the  Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian state meteorological  service, the Russian Ministry of Economics, Moscow State  University, and other leading research and design organizations  were involved in drafting the program. It must be said that all  the attempts made to prevent an ecological disaster during a  three-year period were hindered by inadequate appropriations  from the state budget and their use for other than the intended  purposes. Russian Federation government decree No. 37 of January  19, 1993, set financing sources and volumes for various  measures; they provide for capital investments of 1,021.45  million rubles (in 1991 prices) in 1993-1995. The clients were  executive government agencies of Federation constituent members.  According to the Russian Ministry of Finance, the following  amounts of the established ceilings had actually been allocated  as of January 1, 1994: to Dagestan, 65 percent; to Kalmykia, 49  percent, and to Astrakhan Oblast, 72 percent. Of these sums, the  following amounts were expended on urgent measures: by Dagestan,  75 percent, by Kalmykia, 36 percent, and by Astrakhan Oblast, 25  percent.    The studies' findings allow one to conclude that the level  of  the sea will continue to rise up to 2005 to 2010. Scientists  currently disagree on whether the rate of the rise will stay  within the range observed in previous years (an average of 13  centimeters per year) and reach the point of -25 by 2005 to 2010  or whether it will slow. However, the second scenario is more  likely, given increased evaporation rates and additional outflow  from the Caspian Sea into the Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf and undrained  depressions on the territory of Kazakhstan.    A promised federal program for solving social, economic, and  environmental problems relating to the rising level of the  Caspian was not submitted to the Russian State Construction  Committee for consideration in January of this year. "Since the  program is lacking," said State Construction Committee spokesman  Timashev, "it is wrong to promote any particular hypothesis  (effluent balance) to the detriment of others, such as the  geotectonic hypothesis." Mr. Timashev is convinced that such  "promotion" would overshadow the main issue--the need to  accelerate efforts to protect the cities and communities.    It is hardly appropriate in this situation to speak of the  adoption of any sort of "urgent measures." There remains,  contrary to Michurin's well-known saying, to pin our hopes on  nature's favors.</p>

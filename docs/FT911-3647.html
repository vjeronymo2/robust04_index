			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Public-sector workers urged to be flexible UNIONS organising in the public sector should be prepared to be flexible about traditional bargaining structures to allow better delivery of services, a senior TUC official said yesterday. In a study of how unions can help improve standards in public services, Mr Bill Callaghan, TUC assistant general secretary, said unions needed to take 'a bold and innovative stance' and allow devolution of power. Mr Callaghan was writing in a policy paper published by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a left-wing research group, and the TUC. The paper said unions should accept that competitive tendering could be good for services. The paper includes other contributions questioning whether unions should change policies. It is intended as a stimulus to the Labour party and unions to review attitudes to how public services are delivered. The contribution of unions to better delivery of public services is highly sensitive for Labour because of the role of public-sector strikes in 1979 in bringing down the last Labour government. The paper was welcomed by Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, chairman of the TUC's economic committee, who said unions did not 'want everything back the way it was a decade or more ago'. He said they could not simply defend the status quo. Mr Callaghan said there was no longer a consensus in the labour movement in favour of direct employment of labour by councils in all cases. The case in favour of direct employment would have to be made in a more sophisticated manner. In another contribution, Mr John Stewart, head of the school of public policy at Birmingham University, said that a form of public service more accountable to people would require a new degree of flexibility among staff. He said existing bargaining structures created barriers that prevented manual workers' full potential from being realised, and unions had to be prepared to negotiate new terms and conditions.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Argument With the United States </F> at the Summit"]    [Text] Ankara--Yesterday's summit on northern Iraq in  Ankara, which included the United States, France, Britain, and  Turkey, failed to create any hope of removing Turkey's anxiety  over the embargo on Baghdad. Assistant Secretary of State  Steven Oxman's inflexibility over maintaining the embargo on  Iraq created an argument in the bilateral talks held with the  Turkish side. Oxman remained irreconcilable on withdrawing oil  from the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline, saying that that would  breach the embargo. Oxman was informed that Ozdem Sanberk,  under secretary of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will  visit Baghdad to hold talks with Iraqi officials on the issue.    The Turkish side informed the U.S., French, and British  officials of the existing problems and suggested that the world  should move to normalize its relations with the Baghdad  administration with a view to solving these problems. Sadi  Calislar, Turkey's charge d'affaires in Baghdad, explained his  observations in Iraq and stressed that the view that the embargo  would remove Saddam Husayn from power is wrong. But Oxman  clearly said that the adopting of a moderate approach toward  Saddam Husayn by Washington was out of the question. The  Turkish side responded by explaining that the problems relating  to the Hammer Force, northern Iraq, and the embargo cannot be  solved if the current approach to the Saddam administration is  not relaxed. Turkish officials also explained that Ankara  upholds that view, not because it supports Saddam Husayn, but  because the embargo and the confusion it has created have  seriously affected Turkey's economy and security.    The Turkish side listed its views in the summit as follows:    1. The confusion in northern Iraq must be removed quickly.  The Hammer Force cannot remain in the region indefinitely. New  clashes may occur as a result of the confusion. That could  affect the entire region.    2. Turkey cannot allow the establishment of an independent  Kurdish state in northern Iraq. The West is inclined to favor  the establishment of a Kurdish state, something that has caused  anxiety in Turkey. Extending the flight region of the Hammer  Force aircraft to the southern sector of the 36th parallel in  Iraq is out of the question. Make no decision to encourage the  Kurds on that issue. Instead, encourage them to establish a  dialogue with the Baghdad administration. Ankara is convinced  that the effort to be made in that direction will yield a result.    3. The problem must be solved by the peoples in Iraq through  democratic methods and on the basis that Iraq's territorial  integrity is maintained and Baghdad is recognized as the central  authority.    4. The embargo on Iraq still creates problems for Turkey.  It must be lifted. It has been established that the embargo  cannot be a solution. The Baghdad administration must be  encouraged to fully comply with the UN Security Council  resolutions.</p>

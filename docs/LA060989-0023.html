			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VERSATILE ROLE SUITS NEDIN AT FLORIDA STATE  </P> <P> Tim Nedin never sank into the depths of depression this season, despite being  victimized by the depth of the Florida State pitching staff.  </P> <P> Nedin, a junior left-hander who transferred from College of the Canyons, has  performed in both relief and starting roles for the Seminoles, the top-seeded  team in the College World Series.  </P> <P> "I think if I went to another school that didn't have a pitching staff as deep  as ours, I could have thrown 140-150 innings," Nedin said. "Sometimes it's hard  with the staff we have because we have eight guys that can start.  </P> <P> "But we're here and we have a chance to win the national championship. I just  hope I get a chance to contribute."  </P> <P> Nedin pitched one inning of scoreless relief Wednesday during Florida State's  7-4 loss to Wichita State. He will be in the bullpen again tonight when the  Seminoles meet Wichita State in a game that will determine the East Division  representative in Saturday's national championship game.  </P> <P> Senior Clyde Keller (13-0, 115 innings) and junior Gar Finnvold (10-4, 135  innings) have been the principal starters for the Seminoles and are the only  pitchers who have logged more than 90 innings.  </P> <P> Nedin, who is 6-5 with a 3.16 earned-run average, went from reliever to starter  to reliever this season. The former Hart High standout has still managed 92  strikeouts and 37 walks in 78 innings.  </P> <P> "I haven't mixed my pitches well at all and that's what cost me a little this  year," said Nedin, who throws a fastball, slider, changeup and knucklecurve.  </P> <P> Control problems with the knucklecurve have been a particular source of  frustration for Nedin, who has hit eight batters and thrown 11 wild pitches.  </P> <P> "I live and die with that pitch," Nedin said. "It's one of those pitches you  either have it that day or you don't.  </P> <P> "I've hit a lot of people with that pitch, that's what killed me. I can't even  count how many times I've done that with the count 0-2."  </P> <P> Nedin, who was selected in the 21st round of the amateur draft by the Minnesota  Twins, knew nothing about struggling at the beginning of the season.  </P> <P> He compiled an 18-2 record at Canyons, and in his first appearance for Florida  State, he earned a victory against Arizona State by striking out seven during  seven shutout innings of relief.  </P> <P> Nedin followed that appearance with impressive stints against Grambling and  Florida and was promoted to the starting rotation after allowing just one run  in 18 innings.  </P> <P> As a starter, Nedin earned three wins in eight starts, including a  complete-game victory over Southern Mississippi. However, after he lasted just  one-third of an inning against Miami on April 8, Nedin returned to the bullpen.  </P> <P> "Timmy seems to respond better right now in his career as a middle reliever,"  Florida State Coach Mike Martin said. "That does not pencil him as a middle  reliever for next year because we're going to be looking for another starter  and Timmy Nedin would fit that role very well."  </P></p>

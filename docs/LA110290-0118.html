"She's hospitalized. That's all I can say."  </P> <P> For months, the young woman has been the object of a tug-of-war between  authorities in California, where she is a critical witness in the murder trial  of her half-brother, Christian, and Tahiti, where she has been charged with  complicity in the death of her lover, Dag Drollet.  </P> <P> Drollet was shot to death by Christian Brando at the elder Brando's Mulholland  Drive estate in May. Christian Brando has admitted the shooting but insists it  was accidental, the result of a struggle over a gun after his pregnant sister  told him Drollet had beaten her.  </P> <P> Brando's trial is to begin Monday, although prosecutors have asked for a delay  while they exhaust efforts to compel Cheyenne to return to Los Angeles. Without  her testimony, prosecutors say their chances of proving the shooting was  premeditated and, thus, murder are slim.  </P> <P> Cheyenne Brando told police shortly after the shooting that it was not an  accident.  </P> <P> "It was a murder, in case you don't know," she said in a June interview.  </P> <P> The young woman then took the next direct flight to Tahiti, where she gave  birth to Drollet's son and was herself charged in the death of Drollet, a  French citizen.  </P> <P> The victim's father, Jacques Drollet, said in an interview from Tahiti last  month that, since her return, Cheyenne has twice been hospitalized in a  psychiatric facility for drug detoxification.  </P> <P> "Now she's out having a good time," he reported three weeks ago. "She is  roaming about in Papeete, the main town of Tahiti, where she has been seen  shopping with her mother, Tarita, and her (newborn) son, Tookie. She is also  going out to the beaches and the nightclubs with her new boyfriend, an Italian.  . . ."  </P> <P> But Marlon Brando has maintained that his daughter has suffered both physical  and emotional problems since a near-fatal auto accident and Drollet's death.  The last time he accompanied his son to court he broke down in tears when asked  about her condition.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Thursday passed along to an appeals court the  prosecution's request to delay the trial.  </P> <P> Prosecutors also have requested that the Santa Monica Superior Court judge  hearing the case be ordered to rule on whether a formal request for help from  French authorities in returning Cheyenne Brando to California should be issued.  The high court also referred that matter to the appeals court.  </P> <P> Jury selection will begin Monday, unless the appellate court acts today.  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Perrier bolsters sales at Nestle NESTLE, the world's largest foods and mineral waters group, said its first-half net income rose 6 per cent to SFr1.25bn (Dollars 893m), on sales of SFr27.45bn, up 4.4 per cent. In view of the recession in Europe and the devaluation of a number of European currencies, the result was 'satisfactory,' it said. It also confirmed its July forecast that sales volume would pick up in the second half, and that profits for the year would show 'a satisfactory rise'. Although volume in the first half grew by 5.5 per cent, all but 1 per cent came from the acquisition of the Source Perrier mineral water business. This 'momentary' weak internal growth was attributed to lower consumer spending in Europe. Volume in North America was up slightly, and 'very appreciably' in eastern Asia and Latin America. Trading profit was up 4.9 per cent to SFr2.69bn. Net financing costs jumped to SFr434m in the first half, from SFr307m in the comparable period, reflecting the cost of the Perrier acquisition. Net borrowings rose to SFr10.4bn at the end of the period, compared with SFr8.9bn a year earlier, prior to the acquisition. However, in July, the group collected SFr1.2bn in proceeds from its spring rights issue. In its letter to shareholders, Nestle said the recent alarm in financial circles about the value of branded food products arising from the marketing problems of Marlboro cigarettes was unwarranted. The company 'remains convinced that the major brands guarantee a superior and a recognised quality'.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico Mexican equities failed to maintain Monday's record close, which had resulted from better-than-expected first half gross domestic product figures. After rising initially to 1,938.40, profit-taking forced the IPC down to 1,917.19 in very heavy trading of 152.43m shares. In the afternoon foreign buying helped the IPC to close only 1.6 points down at 1,930.97.</p>

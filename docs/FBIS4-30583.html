			<p>BFN     [Text] Korea will be stripped of its European tariff  reduction favor on textile products, during the latter half of  this year, and will see more cuts in items subject to the  generalized system of preferences (GSP), starting next year, the  Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) said yesterday.    The KFTA said that the European Union's (EU) board of  directors have recently agreed that they will suspend the GSP  favor for Korea's textile products under the multi-fiber  agreement (MFA), starting July 1.    The withdrawal of the GSP favor is apparently in retaliation  for Korea's imposition of higher tariff on European wool  products, a KFTA official said.    Korea exported $57,233,000 worth of textile products under  the GSP in 1992, representing 16.5 percent of GSP-Favored  exports to the EU and 3.37 percent of total exports.    The official said that the EU plans to draw up a law on its  new GSP system to be applied during the 1995-2005. The law  draft will be presented to the EU's Executive Commission in July  for finalization by the end of this year. He said, quoting a  report from KFTA's branch in Brussels.    Korea will remain beneficiary of the EU's new GSP but the  items and volumes benefiting from the GSP will sharply decline,  he said, adding that this assumption is based on reports  circulated so far.    Korea has been given GSP favor by the EU since 1971, except  for 1988-91 when the favor was suspended due to bilateral  disputes over the protection of European intellectual property  rights. The EU has also used the GSP as a leverage in trade  negotiations with Korea on several other items, including  automobiles.    Korea ha sold 20.8 percent of its total exports to the EU  under the tariff rate reduction.    General industrial products, including automobiles, and  textiles represented 96.1 percent of total GSP-favored exports  but the major export items of automobiles, electronics goods and  textile products have received reduced favored due to the EU's  protectionist measures, the KFTA official said.    Meanwhile, Hong Kong's exports to the EU under the GSP were  9.3 percent in 1992, and those of Mexico 21.8 percent. China  saw 39.3 percent and members of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) 34.8 percent.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / French approve of Balladur as PM Mr Edouard Balladur has won the approval of 56 per cent of French voters in his first three weeks as prime minister, according to the latest IFOP opinion poll, in the highest approval rating achieved by any premier in the Fifth Republic at the start of a term of office, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris. President Francois Mitterrand has also seen his approval rating rise sharply, from 24 per cent a month ago to 34 per cent now. One factor behind Mr Balladur's popularity is his conciliatory approach to the potentially prickly problem of ruling France in cohabitation between his centre-right coalition govermment and the socialist President Mitterrand.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: OVER-THE-LINE APPROACH  FOR S.D. CLASSICAL MUSIC?  </P> <P> Violinist Frank Almond III suffers from a peculiar type of bicoastal  schizophrenia. In New York City, he is the student; in San Diego, he is the  teacher. While he is completing the final year of his Master's program at  Juilliard in New York, he is also one of this year's Stauffer Visiting  Professors in String Performance at San Diego State University. During the  1988-89 academic year, Almond has made several visits to the SDSU campus to  perform, give master classes to string players, and talk to classes about the  music profession.  </P> <P> Veteran San Diego prodigy watchers recall Almond as the local teen-ager who won  third place at the Paganini Competition in Genoa, Italy, and as one of two  American laureates in the 1986 Tchaikovsky International Violin Competition in  Moscow.  </P> <P> Almond was scheduled to perform last night as guest concertmaster for maestro  Donald Barra's San Diego Chamber Orchestra. Regular concertmaster Igor Gruppman  was busy with the San Diego Symphony string auditions, so Almond agreed to step  in. This visit will also serve as a kind of trial -- for both parties -- should  Gruppman's workload as the San Diego Symphony's concertmaster cause him to give  up his chamber orchestra post. Almond displayed a decorous interest in the  position.  </P> <P> "It's a real possibility. Their season is not so extensive that I would have to  live here. If I could get along artistically and personally with Barra, I'm  guardedly optimistic about the possibility," said Almond.  </P> <P> While he is pursuing his solo career -- he will make his Boston debut later  this week at the Gardiner Museum -- he is also keeping up his concertmaster  chops. He is still the concertmaster of the Juilliard Orchestra, and this  summer he did a stint as concertmaster of the Batiquitos Festival Orchestra for  the first three weeks of that ill-fated North County venture.  </P> <P> Although Almond counts himself as one of the few people hired by the festival  who was actually paid his contractual fee, the former pupil of Batiquitos  Festival director Michael Tseitlin admitted it was one of the most chaotic and  ill-planned festivals he had ever encountered. And he confirmed that the  festival's shoddy reputation spread to the East Coast almost immediately.  </P> <P> "Even as early as when I came back to play in the La Jolla SummerFest in  August, the word was out. You can't involve that many well-known music people  and not expect news like that to make the rounds."  </P> <P> When asked about his programming for the March 5 recital he will play at SDSU's  Montezuma Hall, he promised to include some approachable contemporary music.  </P> <P> "There's no question that people are tired of the same old stuff. It's not  smart, and it doesn't do anybody any good," said Almond. "I'll play a new piece  I recorded a couple of years ago that everybody seems to like, called "Birds in  Warped Time" by Somei Satoh. I gave the American premiere of it a couple of  years ago, then recorded it. Everybody started buying the record and playing it  all over the radio, and last month the New York Times put that disc on the  critics' choice list."  </P> <P> Since Almond grew up in San Diego, he is well aware of the challenges local  classical music promoters face. His suggestion for a new San Diego festival  aimed at a broader audience: an over-the-line chamber music festival, where  concerts would be played in the evenings on Fiesta Island after the infamous  ball games.  </P> <P> Music of the Holocaust. The San Diego Jewish Community Center's College area  branch will present a concert Feb. 5 featuring music written by four composers  of the Terezin concentration camp. Pianist David Bloch of Tel Aviv's Rubin  Music Academy and mezzo soprano Emile Berendsen will perform songs and chamber  music that survived this infamous cultural ghetto -- also known as  Theresienstadt -- an interim concentration camp set up by the Nazis just  outside Prague where Jewish composers and artists worked before being sent to  other camps for extermination.  </P> <P> "One of the composers, Victor Ullman, was a pupil of Schoenberg," said local  program organizer Eileen Wingard. "While in the camp he wrote some 25 works,  and was even assigned to review concerts given there."  </P> <P> Some of this music has survived, even though the composers did not, because it  was saved by the composers' relatives.  </P> <P> "Gideon Kline, whose Alban Berg-like piano sonata will be performed, is  survived by a sister who lives and teaches in Prague. She saved his Terezin  compositions," Wingard said.  </P> <P> Before coming to San Diego, Bloch and Berendsen will give the program in New  York City. In San Diego, they will be assisted by three members of the San  Diego Symphony -- violist Gary Syroid, cellist Karla Holland-Moritz and  violinist Wingard.  </P> <P> The program, part of the community center's music series, begins at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Just one rebate. When cellist Yo Yo Ma canceled his Symphony Hall recital last  Tuesday, the staff of the sponsoring La Jolla Chamber Music Society worried  about the number of people who might show up expecting to hear Ma and pianist  Emmanuel Ax. After all, Ma's management had given but one day's notice of the  cancellation, and the society had to scramble to get the word out. Out of the  2200 ticket holders, only 44 showed up for the recital, and only one asked for  a refund, according to the society's executive director Neale Perl. Perl is  still searching for a date to reschedule the popular duo.  </P> <P> Quartet winners. Winners of the San Diego State University high school and  junior college string quartet competition, held the weekend of Jan. 21-22, are  the Teller-Chappui Quartet of Los Angeles and a quartet from the local Academy  of Strings. Each quartet received a $600 award, and the Grace Davis High School  string quartet from Modesto was named runner-up. Members of the Lark Quartet,  SDSU's resident string quartet, judged the contest.  </P></p>

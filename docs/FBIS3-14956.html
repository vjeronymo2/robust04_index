A RIA  correspondent was told this by Sergey Yerofeyev, director for  international links at the All-Russian State Television and  Radio Company. He said that in line with existing global  practice, a country or a specific television and radio station  broadcasting a program within its territory from another state  must not only itself accept the expenditure involved, but often  also pay considerable money for the right to relay these  programs. In the territories of the former Union everything is  the other way around.    Except for Turkmenistan, Belarus, and certain other CIS  countries, which have assumed responsibility for the expenditure  involved, the other states are producing uncertainty by their  statements that they cannot pay for the reception of Russian  television and radio broadcasts.</p>

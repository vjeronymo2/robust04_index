			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal  Democratic Party decided Tuesday [1 February] to ask the  coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to  implement a 15 trillion yen economic stimulus package, party  officials said. The officials said the request will be made by  party leader Yohei Kono at his meeting with Hosokawa on  Wednesday afternoon.    The program, adopted at the party's special panel to combat  the recession, partly reflects a proposal made by Michio  Watanabe, a senior member of the party and former foreign  minister, they said. His 20 trillion yen proposal incorporated  income and local tax cuts totaling about 10 trillion yen, they  said.    But the LDP will only request an "early implementation of  sharp tax cuts," they said. The officials said the LDP program  also calls for a substantial reduction or a freeze of the land  value tax.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Argentines hold four over bomb ARGENTINE police arrested four people at the weekend over the bombing of the Israeli embassy, which killed 28 people, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. Witnesses to the arrests said they believed the four, all men, were of Arab descent. The bomb destroyed the embassy and injured 225 people. Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior minister, said last week that investigators believed a remote control device detonated 100kg of explosives packed in a truck parked in front of the embassy. Lebanon's pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, said it planted the bomb to avenge Israel's killing last month of Hizbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi.</p>

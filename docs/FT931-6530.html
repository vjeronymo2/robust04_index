			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong The poker game between Mr Chris Patten and the Chinese government gets more absorbing, not least because it is unclear who is bluffing. By rallying to within an ace of all-time highs, the market clearly believes a fudge will be agreed behind the scenes, presumably with the British doing most of the backing down. Such a deal is also expected to include agreement on the new airport and associated large construction contracts. That view may be too sanguine, given the void between Mr Patten's public position and the apparently implacable Chinese opposition. Even if the gap can be bridged it will take time, and the market will not keep patience for ever. Besides, the Legislative Council is no longer just a rubber stamp and requires a reasonable period to debate the proposals before the end of the session in July. If Mr Patten cedes too much to Beijing, he may also get flak from the democratic reformers who, thus far, have been his main support. None of that will lower the political temperature in the colony, however much the business community wants to hush up the whole affair. The market thus remains vulnerable, all the more so since over half the Hang Seng's earnings still come from property, which can hardly move to safer shores.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / People: Improved infrastructure for Aerostructures The six-week hunt for a new chief executive for the troubled Aerostructures Hamble ended yesterday with the appointment of Christopher West. Southampton-based Aerostructures, which makes aircraft parts, last month saw its shares collapse to 24p after a second profits warning following production problems. Andy Barr, the chief executive who led the flotation at 120p a share in June, took early retirement, citing stress-related illness. West, 46, has been acting as an independent consultant with a special interest in aerospace since leaving Westland Helicopters in 1992 after two years as operations director. Most of his working life has been spent in the aerospace industry. From 1968 to 1990 he was with British Aerospace, former owner of Aerostructures and still its principal customer. At one time, West was flight test engineer for the Tornado. He eventually became managing director of BAe's Kingston and Dunsfold unit, responsible for marketing and developing the Harrier, with a turnover of Pounds 400m and a staff of 5,200. Lord King of Wartnaby, Aerostructure's chairman, says West, who takes up his post on January 2, has a wealth of experience, valuable 'both in terms of manufacturing techniques and customer relationships'. David Ring, who has acquitted himself well as acting chief executive since Barr retired, will revert to his role as commercial director.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Multinationals take lead as world economic force - Unctad's World Investment Report OVERSEAS investment by multinationals has become a bigger force in the world economy than world trade, according to a report from the United Nations. In 1992, sales generated by multinationals outside their country of origin totalled Dollars 5.5trillion (million million), compared with total world exports of Dollars 4trillion. Transnational corporations (TNCs) now control a third of the world's private sector productive assets. The stock of foreign investment worldwide totals Dollars 2trillion. In national terms, the biggest owners are the US with Dollars 474bn and the UK with Dollars 259bn. Japan is catching up fast with Dollars 251bn. Growth in foreign direct investment is set to take off again after a period of decline, according to the report. In particular, investment in the developing world could double in real terms by the year 2000 from Dollars 40bn last year. Total investment fell in 1992 for the second year running, from Dollars 183bn to Dollars 150bn, compared with a peak figure in 1990 of Dollars 234bn. But inflows to the developing world carried on rising, while those to the developed world fell sharply. The latest decline follows a period of growth well above average. During the past two decades, the average annual rise in investment was 13 per cent. In the period 1986-90 the average was 28 per cent. The report attributes this to the economic boom of the late 1980s and a consequent wave of mergers and acquisitions, and to one-off policy changes such as the announcement of the EC single market. The underlying trend is still upward, the UN says. There is continuing liberalisation in policies towards foreign investment, especially in services such as telecommunications, transportation, utilities and insurance. In addition, the report argues, 'international production has become a central structural characteristic of the world economy'. This is partly a result of the revolution in communications, which allows companies to integrate more fully with their overseas subsidiaries. Assuming trade liberalisation continues, companies will still have the incentive to locate production in low-cost countries from which they can export. The report points to privatisation as helping the trend. From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, it says, many developing countries expropriated multinationals' assets in the belief that control was the key to economic independence. From the mid-1970s, inward investment came to be seen as the way to attract foreign capital and technology. Multinationals have been particularly involved in privatisation in Latin America and eastern Europe. However, the report warns the trend could reverse again if economic growth remains weak, technology transfer proves disappointing or world markets are closed through protectionism. By the early 1990s the world total of transnational corporations had reached 37,000, with more than 170,000 foreign affiliates. Because of non-equity arrangements such as franchising and licensing, this is claimed to underestimate their true influence. More than 90 per cent of TNCs have their headquarters in the developed world. Almost 60 per cent of all parent companies are in manufacturing, 37 per cent in services and 3 per cent in the primary sector. There is an increasing concentration of investment in services and technology-intensive manufacturing, with a declining share in the primary sector and resource-based manufacturing. Ownership of foreign assets is highly concentrated, with half the total owned by just 1 per cent of the companies. The world's biggest transnational corporation, by size of overseas assets, is Royal Dutch Shell. Next come Ford, GM, Exxon and IBM. Of the top 20, seven are US, three Japanese, two German, two Anglo-Dutch and two Swiss, with one each from the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and France. The list does not include financial corporations. Investment in developing countries continues to show a clustering pattern. However, it is crossing regions more. The strategies of TNCs are fostering world-wide economic integration, the report says. Companies are locating central functions in whichever country is most cheap or efficient. Swissair handles all its revenue accounting from Bombay, for example. The report argues that such activities cause integration between countries even in the absence of formal agreements such as the EC single market. Asian economies have been more closely integrated by the production strategies of Japanese companies, while US companies were establishing links with Mexico before the negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'The traditional division between integration at the corporate and country levels begins to break down. TNCs . . . encroach on areas over which sovereignty and responsibilities have traditionally been reserved for national governments.'

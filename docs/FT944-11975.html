			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BS attacks continental subsidies British Steel has said that it is being put off from investing in the UK and the rest of Europe by the subsidies allowed to competitors on the continent. Mr Brian Moffatt, chairman and chief executive, told a Commons trade and industry committee that these subsidies would undermine British Steel's profitability as UK economic growth slowed. He said: 'To take on companies whose losses are subsidised is something we are not capable of doing.' Mr Moffatt told MPs that if these subsidies continued, his board felt that there were much more attractive areas in which to invest. He cited the group's recent decision to build a Pounds 97m mini-mill at Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary. British Steel, Europe's second largest producer after France's state-owned Usinor Sacilor, has strongly opposed aid to public companies to help them restructure. It has even launched an action against the European Commission at the European Court of Justice, accusing it of breaking its own rules on subsidies. An EC plan to restructure the industry collapsed last week after steel companies did not come up with the cuts in capacity required for the project to proceed. Mr Moffatt also said the future for the industry was bleaker. 'The economy is moving forward at the moment, but when the next slowdown comes, if the subsidy argument is not put to bed now, it will be back with us in a few years' time.' This argument was echoed by Mr Ian Blakey, director-general of the British Iron and Steel Producers Association. He said: 'We must be storing up trouble for the next recession. We must stamp out subsidies and let the market take its course and it will take its course during the next recession.' Mr Moffatt urged the UK government, which cut British Steel off from aid in 1985, to act as a referee on state aid in the European Union and be consistent about its stance on the issue.</p>

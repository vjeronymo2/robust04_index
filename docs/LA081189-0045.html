			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD CORNER: 58 ROLLING STONES SINGLES COMING OUT ON CD  </P> <P> The Rolling Stones' new music -- the "Steel Wheels" album -- won't be in stores  until Aug. 29, two days before the start in Philadelphia of the British rock  band's first U.S. tour in eight years.  </P> <P> But much of the Stones' classic material is showcased in a three-disc boxed set  that will be released Tuesday by ABKCO Records. "The Rolling Stones Singles  Collection: The London Years," which will also be available in vinyl and  cassette sets, contains both sides of every Stones single released in this  country or England between 1963 and 1971.  </P> <P> That adds up to 58 singles, stretching from the quintet's first, U.K.-only  single -- a remake of Chuck Berry's "Come On" on one side and Willie Dixon's "I  Want to Be Loved" on the other -- through the remarkable string of mid-'60s  hits, including "Satisfaction," "Let's Spend the Night Together" and "Honky  Tonk Woman."  </P> <P> In addition, the set -- expected to retail for about $60 in the CD version --  includes an illustrated, 72-page booklet, featuring the lyrics of every song  plus liner notes and recording-session data.  </P> <P> For casual Stones fans who may be only marginally interested in the relatively  obscure flip sides of some of the band's landmark hits, the already available  "Hot Rocks" CD may be a better buy. The two-disc set, which retails for about  $30, contains 21 of the band's best-known numbers.  </P> <P> However, the new three-hour set is an essential package for hard-core Stones  fans. The tracks are mostly in the original mono and all digitally remastered  from the original tapes under the supervision of producer Andrew Oldham.  </P></p>

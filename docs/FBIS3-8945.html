The talks which according to observers concern filling  ministerial posts in a new government are conducted secretly by  opposition leaders. The opposition parties will meet also  President Michal Kovac today to inform him about the outcome of  their talks.    Kovac will recall the government of Premier Vladimir Meciar  against whom the no-confidence vote was passed by parliament, on  Monday [14 March].    Meanwhile Ivan Laluha, representative of Meciar's Movement  for a Democratic Slovak (HZDS) and chairman of the parliamentary  foreign committee, told Slovak Television today that the HZDS  would charge nobody else than Meciar with forming a new cabinet.    "If the president does not agree with Meciar that it is  clear  that he would be talking with other political entities about  forming a new government," Laluha said. He said that Chairman  of the HZDS Deputies' Group Tibor Cabaj was not entitled to  negotiate the composition of a new government, as the media  reported.    On Saturday [12 March] Kovac asked Cabaj to visit him to  discuss the forming a new cabinet. Cabaj did not, however,  accept the invitation citing a meeting of the HZDS Presidium  which took place in Spisska Nova Ves, East Slovakia, also on  Saturday.    Milan Zemko from the President's Office said that in spite  of  Meciar's statement that the HZDS will not enter a new  government, it is a "political decency" on the part of Kovac to  put such an offer to the largest deputies' group.    "Everything is under discussion, nothing is concluded,"  Stefan Harna, deputy chairman of Egyutteles (Co-Existence), a  Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, told Slovak Television  after the first round of talks of the opposition parties on  appointing a new government.    Asked whether the name of the future premier or other  ministers in a new cabinet are known, Harna said that although  "nothing definitive is known," it can be supposed that the talks  will end tonight. He excluded the possibility of participation  of Hungarian party representatives in a new government.</p>

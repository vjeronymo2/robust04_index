			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN EARLY CAMPAIGN OF CURTIS RECALLED  </P> <P> The cartoon showing a man riding a large piggy bank with a dollar sign on it  toward a sign reading Election Victory (Feb. 18) truly represents the problem  facing the voters of Mission Viejo on Feb. 27.  </P> <P> A coalition of builders and the Mission Viejo Co. has been spending huge sums  of money to defeat one man, a councilman who is against unlimited development  of the few remaining open areas.  </P> <P> The arguments given for wanting to recall this councilman (Robert Curtis) are  without merit. The city of Mission Viejo has five council members. One council  member cannot enact any law or policy on his own. The true reason so much money  has been spent by the anti-Curtis forces is that he is independent and is not  beholden to the Mission Viejo Co. or the builders whose only interests are how  much money they can make and how quickly on the small amount of land still  available.  </P> <P> Surely the voters of Mission Viejo can recognize that it is in their interests  to have one independent, caring city official who will not be a puppet or a  rubber stamp to powerful interests who seek to enrich themselves at our expense  and to the detriment of the community.  </P> <P> ERNIE JOHNSTON  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

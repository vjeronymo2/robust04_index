			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS ARE SAD JETS HAVE GONE  </P> <P> How about the New England Patriots?  </P> <P> They're 1-11. That's even worse than the New York Jets, who left San Diego with  a 4-9 record after the Chargers clubbed them, 38-17, Sunday.  </P> <P> "If we didn't have the fifth-place schedule, maybe we'd have a chance to play  New England," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "But we don't."  </P> <P> So the New York Jets are the next best thing. The Chargers will miss them.  </P> <P> This happened once already this season. The Chargers had lost consecutive games  to the Houston Oilers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, and then they went East to  play the Jets on Oct. 14 and won, 39-3.  </P> <P> Losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Seattle Seahawks preceded Sunday's  victory, which kept the Chargers' playoff hopes flickering. The candle will go  out with one more loss.  </P> <P> Three games remain: the Broncos in Denver, the Chiefs in San Diego and the  Raiders in Los Angeles. What remains to be seen is whether the Chargers can do  the same nice things against their remaining opponents as they did against  their favorite team from New York.  </P> <P> Among the good Sunday was the play of receiver Nate Lewis, who caught four  passes for 89 yards and scored two touchdowns, and, of course, running back  Marion Butts, who ran for 159 yards in 26 carries.  </P> <P> Butts also provided a bit of late game excitement when the outcome had been  decided with his 52-yard run in the fourth quarter. He also gave reporters a  laugh with his explanation of why he was caught from behind by Jet safety Erik  McMillan on that run.  </P> <P> "I have a little speed," he said. "McMillan, hey, he's a 4.2 guy."  </P> <P> Butts was told that McMillan actually runs the 40-yard dash in 4.9.  </P> <P> "McMillan?" he said. "Oh, nooooo. No. McMillan is 4.2."  </P> <P> Whatever you say, Marion. Anyway, Butts continues to be the steadiest performer  on an offense that is still looking for more consistency from its leader,  quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver.  </P> <P> As usual, Tolliver was up and down Sunday, throwing strikes on some occasions  and missing open receivers on others.  </P> <P> "We think he's coming along," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "He made plays to  help us win the game. He made one play that could have cost us dearly, and that  was waiting too long to throw that ball that was intercepted."  </P></p>

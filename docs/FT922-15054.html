			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Safe hands for a party in distress: Ian Davidson asks whether the new prime minister can save the French Socialists Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, is a paragon of gravity, moderation and great experience. Of all the available candidates, he looks the safest to take over the government, at a time when President Francois Mitterrand's administration is reeling from its humiliating rout in the recent regional and local elections. What is not immediately obvious is whether he also has that flair of inspiration, in addition to his many manifest qualities of decency, which might help him restore the political legitimacy of the Socialist government, now virtually destroyed. This is the scale of the problem facing him. It is commonly said that whoever succeeded Mrs Edith Cresson would face two tasks of steeply rising difficulty. The first is to halt the disastrous collapse in the government's popularity which accompanied her 10-month premiership; the second is to encourage the Socialist party to face the general elections a year from now, if not with confidence, at least without the dreadful certainty of a total massacre. Equally commonly, it is said that the first task is difficult, and the second out of reach. In fact, the crisis facing the government is far more serious than that. The question is not whether Mr Beregovoy can climb up the charts again in time for next year's general elections, but whether this government can manage to stay in power even until the end of this year. The political crisis is now so acute that the Mitterrand regime may not be able to avoid either early general elections, or early presidential elections, or both. The question of democratic legitimacy is clearly posed by the stunning collapse in popular support for the ruling Socialist party. Four years ago, in the 1988 general elections, the Socialists fell short of an absolute majority of seats in parliament, but at least they could claim the popular support of nearly 35 per cent of the voters. In the regional elections of 10 days ago, by contrast, their popular support had shrivelled to less than 19 per cent. Of course, the regional elections have no effect on the Socialists' strength in the National Assembly; but a disavowal on this scale cannot fail to destabilise the credibility of their position as the party of government. The regional elections may, however, have overstated the Socialists' loss of support. The free-fall proportional system encouraged a dispersal of voting, which would probably not apply to a real-life general election with majority voting. In the second round of the local elections, for example, the Socialists got nearly 25 per cent, and most polls of future voting intentions point to 22 or 23 per cent. Still, even 23 per cent represents a very large drop. The follow-on effect of the regional election disaster is that it will become increasingly difficult for the Socialists to get legislation through parliament. As it is, the previous government often had to resort to awkward methods of pushing through its bills, to make up for its lack of an absolute majority. First, it co-opted some non-Socialists into the cabinet so as to enlarge the apparent size of its political base; second, it sometimes coerced the Communists into reluctant acquiescence by threatening to provoke a vote of no-confidence. Neither of these devices is likely to work as well in future. The moderate conservative, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, was one of the leading non-Socialists in the outgoing Cresson government. But he was forced to resign from his job as minister of public administration because he appeared to have accepted the support of the extreme right-wing National Front in his election to the presidency of the Bourgogne regional council. Mr Brice Lalonde, leader of the Generation Ecologie movement, was minister for the environment in the outgoing Cresson government, but he has announced that he will not be a minister in a future Socialist government. He says he is revolted by the wheeling and dealing that have been taking place in the corridors of power of the newly elected regional councils. His real reason may be that, with more than 7 per cent of the national vote, he sees more advantage in working for his own party than for a Socialist government which looks doomed. But the result is the same: his interest is to lead a party of opposition. Whatever his reasons, the Socialists will find it more difficult to co-opt symbolic figures from the ecological movements, who in any case are not represented in parliament. Moreover, centrists who were once tempted by President Mitterrand's overtures now know that they have much less to gain from helping the Socialists than from lining up with their more natural allies on the right. The Communists, for their part, have finally rejected all vestiges of their one-time alliance with the Socialists and are set to play an openly hostile role in future. In the regional elections their vote sank once again to a hard core of 8 per cent, compared with 11 per cent in the last general elections, and the party now seems to have decided that it has little left to lose. It has described its new posture as that of 'opposition of the left', which implies a systematic hostility to the Socialist party. If the Communists accept that they are now doomed to the residual role of a protest party, but believe that their support can scarcely fall any further, they will be much less afraid of early general elections than the Socialists. As it is, they announced yesterday that they would not support a vote of confidence in the new Socialist government. It is a measure of President Mitterrand's predicament that his preferred candidate to take over the prime ministership declined the invitation. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, consistently sails right at the top of the French popularity ratings, and the polls say he is much the strongest potential Socialist candidate for the next presidential elections. As a result, he looked naturally cast for the part of the white knight who could rescue the Socialist party in its distress. He evidently concluded that the costs of the operation would far outweigh the rewards. dent Mitterrand and Mr Delors conducted intense negotiations last week. Their failure was made public on Monday, with the pointed announcement by Mr Delors' spokesman that the Commission president was fully engaged in his present heavy responsibilities in Brussels, and expected to serve out the rest of his term, which runs until the end of this year. According to Le Figaro, the negotiations foundered because the political conditions demanded by Mr Delors were unacceptably high. He insisted, said the newspaper, that he must have the authority to dissolve parliament, as a lever to exert the maximum discipline over the Socialist party. In formal terms, such a condition could not have been met: under the constitution only the president has the authority to dissolve parliament. But the message was that Mr Delors was not interested in becoming prime minister unless President Mitterrand was effectively prepared to concede to him the ultimate powers of decision in the state. This would be the second time that Mr Delors was offered the Hotel Matignon, but set impossible conditions. In the spring of 1983, the new Socialist government was being battered by continuing foreign exchange crises and a third devaluation, as well as by a heavy electoral defeat in the March municipal elections. The president turned to Mr Delors, then finance minister, and asked him to take over from Mr Pierre Mauroy as prime minister; Mr Delors said yes, but only if he kept control of the Finance Ministry. Mr Mitterrand refused and, after nine days of hesitation, Mr Mauroy was obliged to soldier on as prime minister for another 16 months. So Mr Delors stayed at the Finance Ministry, and imposed the new, rigorous and non-Socialist economic policy that is still in force. The lesson of today's crisis is that the job facing any new prime minister is once again so difficult that the position is not necessarily attractive to a politician with further ambitions. At best, the prime minister in France carries responsibilities and risks which are far greater than his political authority: the president rules, and the prime minister is his submissive executant. In present circumstances, Mr Jacques Delors had nothing to gain, and a great deal to lose, from President Mitterrand's offer. He could only safeguard his popularity and his chances in a future presidential election by staying right away from the calamitous situation in France. Yesterday, Mr Beregovoy set an agenda which is clearly meant as an answer to France's disaffected protest voters: unemployment and economic recovery, law and order, and the environment. This is unlikely to mean a significant change of policies, however, because his room for manoeuvre is so narrow. His key asset, his reputation for economic orthodoxy, remains unquestioned, despite a budget deficit which has swelled out of control as a result of the recession, because his anti-inflation achievements are intact. It is unlikely he will risk any heroic reflationary adventures, because they would do serious damage long before they did any good. In any case, the managerial aspects of Mr Beregovoy's programme will be overshadowed by the political dramas which lie ahead. President Mitterrand is in a position of great difficulty and weakness; it is entirely possible that he will be unable to complete his term, which expires in 1995; but he is certain to fight to regain the initiative right until the end. How he will fight is still undecided, but he must take his stand on an issue of important political principle. There are two which are tailor-made for the battle: the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty of European Union, scheduled for next month; and a second constitutional revision, to shorten the term of the presidency, planned for the autumn. His problem is that he cannot make a conclusive personal come-back, except with a convincing 'yes' vote in a popular referendum. The danger is that the electorate might vote 'no' to the questioner, rather than 'yes' to the question. Since President Mitterrand will not risk a rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, he is likely to push ratification through a special session of parliament. The logical inference, therefore, is that he should wait until the autumn to stake his position and the standing of the Socialist government on the second constitutional revision in a popular referendum. But the key problem is that he may not be able to control the timetable. If the crisis breaks earlier for reasons beyond his control, much of his presidential legacy, starting with the ratification of Maastricht, could be in jeopardy.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The HA'ARETZ supplement of Tel Aviv  HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 3 June carries a 5,000-word report by  Mikhal Peleg on pages 36, 37, 38, and 40, on the issue of  Jerusalem.    Peleg asserts that in the 27 years since East Jerusalem was  conquered, "Israel has done all it could to make the city one --  and Jewish. Yet one united Jerusalem -- the only national  consensus that survived the evils of conquest -- does not exist  in reality. In real life, the capital is a patchwork of Jewish  neighborhoods densely interspersed with enclaves of alienated  Arab population surviving in dire conditions. The border which  once separated the two parts of Jerusalem has disintegrated into  dozens of border lines of an elusive yet very tangible nature,  and they are never crossed. The alienation between the two  populations has created a situation no Israeli Government ever  intended; construction and development were invested in the  judaization of Jerusalem, and the discrimination practiced  against the city's Arab residents made them a separate entity.  Now it is easy for the Palestinians to demand separation  because separation is already there."    Peleg goes on: "The battle for Jerusalem did not end with  military occupation. It has been going on since 1967 through  vast investments in infrastructure and the expedited  construction of Jewish neighborhoods over the entire annexed  territory, even at the expense of irreversible damage to scenery  and the city's special character. Today, East Jerusalem alone  is inhabited by 160,000 Jews, versus about 155,000 Arabs. The  takeover campaign is complemented by several steps: a  wide-scale expropriation of Arab lands -- 26,200 dunam to date;  systematic restrictions on Arab construction; and the deliberate  disregard for basic services to the Palestinian population.  Over the years, Jerusalem's Arab residents have opted for  passive resistance, which was mainly reflected in the scant  participation in municipal elections (6 percent after the  outbreak of the intifadah in 1989, less than 10 percent in the  last elections)."    Peleg states that Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert believes the  unofficial separation between the two parts of Jerusalem is "a  temporary situation. Olmert plans to invest in improvements in  the Arab city, and he accuses Teddy Kollek of neglecting and  totally ignoring the Arab population's needs. He says he needs  140 million shekels of government funds to bring that part of  the city up to date."    "Two cities exist side by side in Jerusalem: In one of them,  new neighborhoods are built at a rate unparalleled in the entire  State of Israel. Thousands of housing units are built and  enormous investments are made in infrastructure, roads,  landscape planning, street illumination, shopping malls,  industrial and trade regions. Israel has built 60,000 housing  units for Jews in areas annexed in 1967 alone, and 10,000 more  are currently under construction. On the other side, there is  another city, which can be hardly called a city. It is made up  of isolated enclaves which look like dusty rural areas; one- or  two-story houses, hardly any sidewalks, many unpaved roads, few  street lights, most of which do not work, several streets  sharing a single garbage collection receptacle, no playgrounds  or parks."    "Jewish neighborhoods receive electricity from the Israeli  Electrical Corporation. Arab neighborhoods receive theirs  through the mediation of the East Jerusalem Electricity Company,  a Jordanian-owned firm whose plants near Shu'fat were deserted  when it was forced to stop producing power and made to buy it  from the Israeli corporation. To reach West Jerusalem and the  Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, one uses Egged buses;  the Palestinians have buses operated by small private companies  from nearby villages, such as Abu-Dis and al-'Ayzariyah."    Peleg maintains that to facilitate Jewish construction in  Jerusalem, the government has been expropriating and freezing  Arab land. "In addition to the 73,000 dunam annexed in 1967,"  "26,200 dunam of privately owned Arab land were expropriated in  1968, 1970, 1980, and 1990." To accommodate construction plans,  another 2,300 dunam will be expropriated in the near future;  tens of thousands of housing units for Jews were built on that  land. That was how Gilo, Talpiyyot East, Neve Ya'aqov, Pisgat  Ze'ev, and other neighborhoods sprouted. Another 35,000 dunam  of unused Arab-owned land in East Jerusalem were frozen, that  is, construction is prohibited on them. The Arabs have been left  with a 9,500-dunam area on which they may build.    "A method of transferring lands to Jews was established  under Teddy Kollek. The method consisted of marking map areas  featuring privately owned Arab land in green. This was the sign  allegedly indicating that the land was earmarked for public use  and parks, and that construction was prohibited there. A few  years after the land was marked green, some of it was  expropriated and Jewish neighborhoods were built on them. For  example, the Rekhes Shu'fat neighborhood, to be inhabited by  Canadian ultra-Orthodox Jews, is in initial stages of  construction, and planning has begun for two new neighborhoods,  Har Homa and Sha'ar Mizrah between Neve Ya'aqov and the French  Hill as well as a residential Jewish area in the heart of the  Arab Ra's al-'Amud neighborhood."    Peleg adds that while "West Jerusalem has a master plan, all  East Jerusalem has are local master plans which, for years,  referred only to the Jewish neighborhoods. Only six Arab  neighborhoods have received official license to date, while  eight others have been waiting for approval for 10 years. In  1980, a municipal committee submitted a plan which indicated a  need for 18,000 additional housing units for the city's Arab  population. Nothing of this materialized. The Arab population  grew from 114,000 in 1980 to 155,500 today. On the basis of  five persons to an apartment, about 26,000 housing units for  Arabs should have been built in East Jerusalem. As a result of  the shortage and the overcrowded conditions, 5,000 housing units  were built -- many without a license. In 1990, for instance,  3,000 building permits were issued; of these, only 150 were for  Arabs. Former city council member Sara Kaminker, who had been  Kollek's adviser on Arab neighborhoods until her protest  resignation, has amassed information indicating that about  21,000 Jerusalemite Arab families are homeless."    Peleg maintains that "the war over Jerusalem has changed  after the Palestinians began, for the first time, to take action  to improve their positions. Last November, a committee  initiated by Faysal al-Husayni was set up. Its objective is to  establish the National Council for Jerusalem-Palestine and to  outline an action plan for the interim period. The committee,  which is headed by Dr. Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi from PASSIA  (Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International  Affairs), has practically drafted a plan for every municipal  council department, from construction planning and  infrastructure down to services, such as education, health,  culture and religion, public security, and tax collection,  including a blueprint for a Palestinian police force in East  Jerusalem. PASSIA holds workshops from which local leaders and  professional teams are gradually emerging." "In other offices  related to Orient House, such as the Palestinian Geographical  Center, Israeli takeover of Arab lands is meticulously  documented, and each change is immediately noticed. In  addition, they draw maps for future negotiations."    Khalil Tufakji, the Palestinian Geographical Center  director,  "claims that Ehud Olmert is trying to continue the Jewish  expansion eastward, to the area outside metropolitan Jerusalem's  boundaries, through the Sha'ar Mizrah neighborhood due to be  built beyond road No. 9, linking Ma'ale Adumim to Pisgat Ze'ev."    "Palestinians have a vested interest in launching the debate  on Jerusalem before the two years stipulated in the agreement  are out: Their argument is that by then, they may have no land  to discuss. The Israeli Government is also aware of the fact  that the mounting tensions in the city and the operation of its  Palestinian institutions -- most notably Orient House, which  even today is acting as a Palestinian municipal center and a  quasi Foreign Ministry -- will force it to deal with the problem  earlier than expected."</p>

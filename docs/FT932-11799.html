			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (16): New examples on the way - Alternatives / Multi-Purpose Vehicles Government ministers may have been banned from using the expression 'green shoots of recovery' and Mr Ian McAIIister, Ford's chairman, would only hint recently about 'a stirring of the soil' but motor industry executives are confident that at least one area of the business is heading for substantial growth in the UK and continental Europe: the MPV or multi-purpose vehicle. This is partly because people are looking for alternatives now that high performance and sporty cars have been driven out of reach by soaring insurance rates; partly because once the space, flexibility and comfort of an MPV has been enjoyed, it becomes difficult to revert to a normal vehicle. But mostly it is because of the number of new examples about to reach British showrooms. The current market leader, by a comfortable margin, is the Renault Espace, introduced in 1984 and which in 1992 took 41 per cent of the UK market. The 'one box' format, which allows seven seats and lots of space in a vehicle the length of a medium saloon was so innovative that it is surprising it has taken the rest of the industry so long to catch up. Already Nissan, Mitsubishi and Toyota have launched competitors with the Serena, Space Cruiser and Previa respectively, but next year will see a joint-venture MPV from Volkswagen and Ford and a second joint venture from Fiat Group and PSA which will certainly see the launch of a Fiat, Lancia and Peugeot MPV and possibly a Citroen version too. Last year the Renault Espace accounted for 3,221 of the 7,851 MPVs sold in Britain. This year, Renault expects to sell 4,800 examples in a total market it believes will expand to between 9,000 and 10,000 units. 'Our strategy is to achieve a 50 per cent market share now before the market finally starts to take off as competitor cars reach the showrooms and to retain that leading market share by confirming the Espace as the benchmark or generic model in the sector', says Mr Phil Horton, director of communications. Two variants - a turbo-diesel and an automatic V6 - are available to encourage even more potential Espace buyers, and the company is advertising the model on television for the first time in the UK to reinforce the message. 'The Turbo-diesel is already accounting for 35 per cent of customer orders and the automatic V6 provides the right product for buyers in the Pounds 25,000-plus executive sector', says Mr Horton, who also promises special editions for the summer to boost sales. Nissan's manager of marketing and planning, Mr David Archibold, is even more bullish than Renault about the prospects for the MPV sector. 'We expect it to be a fairly stable market in 1993 with perhaps a modest increase, but next year sales should reach 20,000 units, up 50 per cent, because of all the new products coming onto the market', he says. 'We also expect the market to increase by a further 50 per cent in 1995 in Europe. On the continent, the market is forecast to increase even further than in the UK, but that increase won't happen overnight here because this is a more conservative market. But there is no doubt of the increase in interest in the sector'. Nissan introduced its new Serena last year. Most buyers were previously estate car drivers, according to Mr Archibold. Those same estate car buyers seeking yet more interior space have been identified by Volkswagen as the people most likely to move into the MPV sector. At last year's motor show, VW displayed its Caravelle model on the cars stand for the first time. While the van-based Caravelle is rather larger than most MPVs and very much at the top end of the segment, Volkswagen, like Nissan, found that most of those showing an interest were already estate car drivers, many with larger families unhappy at carrying children without proper seat belts. 'The Caravelle, with its seven or eight seats, all with belts, fulfils a need,' said Volkswagen, although it acknowledged that the Caravelle model was very much a niche product. The company's model in the central MPV sector comes next year, jointly developed with Ford. The other imminent joint venture, between Fiat and PSA, is interesting because of the decision to have an upmarket Lancia version as well as the standard Fiat derivative. This indicates that Fiat executives reckon there is room for an executive version which will offer all the comforts and luxuries of a top-line saloon with the space and flexibility of an MPV. Mercedes-Benz planners have the same thought and showed a concept of an MPV at Frankfurt. However there is no word on whether the project has been given the go-ahead. Unlikely to reach production is Giugiaro's stunning concept for a mobile office, shown at Geneva. The Columbus, with its seven seats, four-wheel drive and outlandish styling, may never be built, although the idea of being able to work on the move interests several manufacturers and specialists. Ford has its Granada Office Car, equipped with fax and telephone, and also offers an Executive Transit van - essentially a luxury mini-coach for groups of businessmen. Others have also prepared similar concepts including Chrysler, based upon the Voyager MPV. But to date executives have been unwilling to pay for the privilege of being able to work and be in constant touch both inside and outside the office. For the time being, the growth area is the straightforward MPV - part car, part people carrier, and part lifestyle accessory. Renault's inspired initial design looks set to lead one of the motor industry's few bright sectors over the next few years, and the company is not concerned at the way others are cashing in on its idea.</p>

Each has won at home, SDSU two years ago (72-63) and Texas Tech last  year (58-43). The teams have a similar makeup in that the Red Raiders have nine  new players and the Aztecs eight. Texas Tech is coming off a 78-77 loss to host  Austin Peay in the championship of the Acme Boot tournament Saturday after  defeating Portland in the opening round, 94-58, for its only victory over an  NCAA Division I team. SDSU's only victories are against Division II Chaminade  and UC Riverside. The Aztecs are shooting 45.2% from the field.  </P></p>

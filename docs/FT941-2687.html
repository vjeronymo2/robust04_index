			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Industrial groups to shed 750 jobs About 750 jobs in steel, engineering and ship repair faced the axe last night following announcements of cuts at British Steel Tinplate in south Wales, Bridon, the Doncaster-based wire rope group, and A &amp; P Appledore on Tyneside, Andrew Baxter and Chris Tighe write. British Steel Tinplate is cutting 345 jobs by restructuring work patterns and closing older coating lines. It said about 155 jobs would go at its Ebbw Vale works in Gwent and about 190 jobs at the Trostre works near Llanelli. A &amp; P Appledore, the UK's largest commercial ship repairer, announced 150 shop floor redundancies at its Tyneside yards, more than halving the present hourly paid workforce. Bridon is seeking up to 250 redundancies, initially on a voluntary basis. The move is part of a restructuring programme.</p>

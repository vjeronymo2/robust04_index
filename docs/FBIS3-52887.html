			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI) -- India and China will soon  start talks on reducing troop-levels on both sides of the line  of actual control (LAC) in pursuance of an agreement signed  during the Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Beijing  last September, Chinese ambassador Cheng Ruisheng, said in an  interview here.    "Both sides may have already reduced some troops, but I am  not aware of the facts. Both sides want to divert their  resources from military to economic development," Mr Cheng said.    The Chinese ambassador said that an experts group of  diplomats and military personnel, set up as part of the  agreement on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the  LAC, would hold its first meeting in New Delhi next month.    He said the experts group would tackle the issue relating to  the redeployment with a view to reduction in military forces in  the areas along the LAC.    The experts group, which will have about 10 members from  each  side, shall advise the Foreign Secretary-level joint working  group (JWG) on the resolution of differences between the two  sides on the alignment of the line of actual control.    Replying to wide-ranging questions, Mr. Cheng said there was  no Pakistan factor in China's development of relations with  India.    Describing "stability and overall improvement" as the main  characteristics of the Sino-Indian relations in 1993, he said if  China used India or Pakistan as a card for developing bilateral  relations, it would "complicate matters very much."    He emphasised that India and China had achieved a  breakthrough in exchanges in the military field.    The visit of the Chinese vice chief of Army staff to India  last month came after a gap of over 30 years. Like-wise, the  Chinese naval ships visited Bombay nearly after 40 years.    India and China had problems in 1962 but that was part of  history now. "We are trying to catch up with the lost time," the  Chinese envoy said.    He emphasised that there was no such gap in the development  of China's relations with Pakistan.    Mr. Cheng agreed with the questioner that the human rights  issue was being exploited by the west.    The Chinese envoy said India and China had identical views  on  the human rights issue.    "We are of the opinion that differences on the human rights  issue should not be linked with bilateral relations including  trade or economic ties," he said.    Replying to a question on the nuclear issue, Mr. Cheng  referred to differing perceptions between India and China.    China had already signed the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty. India was not prepared to do the same, he observed.    Mr. Cheng said his country was in favour of a nuclear  weapons  free zone in South Asia as there was no nuclear power in the  region.    China, he said, felt that the two major world powers should  reduce their nuclear weapons.    Asked about the Chinese military assistance to Pakistan, he  said this did not pose any threat to India.    He made the point that China was involved in commercial  sales  of military hardware and India could also be a buyer if it so  desired.</p>

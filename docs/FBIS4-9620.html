			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian Assembly Chairman Stipe Mesic left for  Brussels this morning to attend a two-day working conference of  international parliamentarians which will discuss justice and  progress as bases for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Prior to his  departure for Brussels to attend the conference, which is to be  held under the sponsorship of Egon Alfred Klepsch, chairman of  the European Parliament, Mesic said he will present to the  conference a Croatian proposal that the international community  return to its principle of the inviolability of borders. This  principle will secure an undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the  occupied areas in Croatia will be fully reintegrated into its  legal and constitutional system. Bosnia-Herzegovina should be  demilitarized, and also Serbia, which presents the worst danger  for this part of the world. President Mesic also said he will  meet parliamentarians from a number of countries in the course  of his visit to Brussels.</p>

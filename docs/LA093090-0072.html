			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BRUSH MIND BY KAZUAKI TANAHASHI (PARALLAX PRESS: $15,  ILLUSTRATED);  </P> <P> ZEN AND THE ART OF CALLIGRAPHY; THE ESSENCE OF SHO BY OMORI SOGEN AND TERAYAMA  KATSUJO TRANSLATED BY JOHN STEVENS (ARKANA: $12.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> The Japanese concept of calligraphy is very different from the Western one: Its  aim is not to produce pretty letters (some of the finest calligraphy borders on  illegibility) but to imbue each brush stroke with the self-conscious  artlessness that characterizes Japanese aesthetics. "The Essence of Sho"  surveys the themes of the Zen school of calligraphic art, one tenant of which  states: "For a work to be truly alive, each of the thousand hairs of the brush  must be energized"; Omori Sogen and Terayama Katsujo use electron  photomicrographs to reveal how in the best work, the individual particles of  ink form recognizable patterns, even when magnified 50,000 times!  </P> <P> "Brush Mind" comprises 60 one-stroke paintings done by the noted modern  calligrapher, Kazuaki Tanahashi. These minimal, intriguing pictures reveal the  extraordinary flexibility of the brush in the hands of a master, and range from  fragile-looking wisps that suggest waves on a distant sea to broad, black  swipes relieved only by a few tiny streaks of white. Accompanying the pictures  is a collection of Tanaha-shi's often paradoxical reflections on various  subjects: "To be thoroughly lazy is a tough job, but somebody has to do it.  Industrious people build industry. Lazy people build civilization."  </P></p>

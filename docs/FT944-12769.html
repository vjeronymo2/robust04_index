			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Tobacco offsets weak insurance at BAT - Other companies BAT Industries: The tobacco and insurance conglomerate is expected to report on Wednesday an increase of about 10 per cent in third-quarter pre-tax profits from last year's Pounds 455m. The main growth will come from US tobacco. In insurance, BAT will report a downturn at Farmers, its US subsidiary which has slowed its rate of growth of new business, particularly after the Los Angeles earthquake. In the UK, Eagle Star will have suffered from a softening of car premiums.</p>

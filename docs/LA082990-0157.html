			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'ROCKY HORROR' MAY BE FALL VIDEO  </P> <P> The midnight cult classic "Rocky Horror Picture Show" may come out as a video  for the first time this fall.  </P> <P> The 1975 camp hit, starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick, has  so far grossed $150 million and it may be released in November by CBS-Fox Video  if negotiations are successful. The film marks its 15th anniversary in October.  </P> <P> But "Rocky Horror" producer Lou Adler is worried that a video release could  damage the film's performance in midnight showings at theaters across the  country, including several in the Southland.  </P> <P> In those late-night screenings, moviegoers wear costumes, throw rice at the  screen during the film's wedding ceremony and act out the entire movie in their  seats.  </P></p>

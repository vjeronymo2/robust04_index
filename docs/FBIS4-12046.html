			<p>BFN     [Text] The seventh Pan-African Congress convened in  Kampala, the capital of Uganda, today in the presence of top  officials from various countries and representatives of regional  and international organizations.    According to a Central News Unit correspondent's report  Foreign Minister Velayati, who is taking part in the Congress at  the invitation of the Ugandan Government, said in a speech at  the session: The revival of Islam is one of the most successful  replies to the rule of colonialist powers. It is the Islamic  movements which are leading the struggle against foreign rule.    Mr Velayati described the special circumstances of the Third  World countries, particularly African countries, in global  equations and referred to the conspiracies of hegemonistic  powers to plunder their wealth. He said: In the past, through  dangerous propaganda, the people of the Third World were  estranged from their spiritual and material values. Today  colonialist powers are resorting to fresh political, economic  and even military means to continue their rule.    Mr Velayati said the South-South cooperation was a  prerequisite to the task of the Third World countries. He said:  Collective self-sufficiency in the Third World could be further  achieved through cooperation in organizations such as the  Non-Aligned Movement, the African Unity Organization, and the  Islamic Conference Organization.    Our country's Foreign Minister referred to the expansion of  Iran's cooperation with Africa after the victory of the Islamic  revolution. He said: Iran's diplomatic relations with African  countries has doubled in the past 15 years. We are actively  taking part in the development programs of African countries.    Referring to the severance of relations between the Islamic  Republic of Iran and the racist regime of South Africa he said:  Iran continues to give the necessary support to freedom-seeking  struggles in Africa, such as the struggle of the Namibian  nation. We hope that, from now on, through unity and  understanding, especially amongst the majority of the deprived  peoples of South Africa, the dark days of racism come to an end  in that country, too.</p>

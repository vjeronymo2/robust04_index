			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The provisional GDP figures for  1993 released by the Federal Statistical Office are in line  "with the expectations of the Federal Government of last fall,"  in the view of Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free  Democratic Party). According to the figures from the  Wiesbaden-based office, GDP for the whole of Germany decreased  in real terms by 1.3 percent on 1992. The fall in GDP in western  Germany was 1.9 percent and in eastern Germany GDP grew by 6.3  percent. GDP in money terms amounted to over 3.1 trillion  German marks [DM] of which western Germany accounts for a  substantial 91 percent and eastern Germany for almost 9 percent.    In a statement issued today on these figures, Rexrodt  pointed  out that the average figures conceal the slight recovery which  set in during the course of the year following the slump in the  spring. The noticeable slowdown in price increases in all  important demand areas is also pleasing as is the fact that  growth in eastern Germany has broadened its base. Not only is  the construction sector expanding there, but signs of  improvement in the manufacturing sector are also increasing.  However, despite strong GDP growth in eastern Germany for the  second year, there can be no talk yet of a self-sustaining  upswing in the east. The gap between demand and income, on the  one hand, and production, on the other hand, still has to be  covered by transfers from western Germany.    The economics minister announced that the Federal Government  will soon set out in detail, in its annual economic report, how  it expects the economy to perform in 1994.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Westland joins GKN stable M&amp;G and Schroders, the largest institutional shareholders in Westland Group, are expected shortly to accept GKN's increased takeover offer for the helicopter manufacturer. The two institutions, which together control 25 per cent of the Yeovil-based company, are likely to take the revised 335p-a-share cash offer following the Westland board's reluctant decision to recommend acceptance of GKN's Pounds 577m hostile bid. Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, made the recommendation following a meeting on Thursday with Sir David Lees, his GKN counterpart. Sir David told him that the engineering group had secured enough shares to ensure its stake could not be diluted below 50 per cent. GKN, which increased its 290p-a-share offer by 15 per cent earlier this week, has purchased more than 13.4m Westland shares at 335p and now controls 52.35 per cent of the enlarged share capital - allowing for conversion of preference shares. Although Mr Jones claimed GKN's revised offer still undervalued Westland, he told investors: 'It would not be in the interest of shareholders or warrant holders to continue to retain minority holdings in a company that formed part of the enlarged GKN group.' Royal Insurance, which controls 4 per cent of Westland, has signalled its intention to follow the recommendation and other institutions are expected to follow suit. United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters, will also gain from the revised offer. The group is expected to receive around Pounds 86m rather than the Pounds 75m on offer at the 290p price.</p>

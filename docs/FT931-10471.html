			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Downiebrae shares surge 22p SHARES IN Downiebrae Holdings, the Glasgow-based engineering company, yesterday jumped 22p to 53p on news that Mr Robert Newman, the accountant and takeover specialist, had bought back into the company by paying Pounds 2.25m for a 29.99 per cent stake. Mr Newman, who helped mastermind the evolution of The Times Veneer, a wood products company which was also little more than a shell, into Era Group in the 1980s, said he planned to use Downiebrae as an acquisition vehicle. He acquired the 5.25m shares, at 42.85p apiece, via the family-controlled Braystar investment company from Mr Jacques Murray, the outgoing chief executive who originally bought the stake from Mr Newman in February 1988. Mr Murray and his associate, Mr Andrew Chudnoff, have resigned from Downiebrae's board and have been replaced by Mr Newman and Mr Denys Cole. Mr Newman, who will be Downiebrae's chief executive, said the company was 'the perfect vehicle for acquisitions' with Pounds 4.7m of cash, two properties and two northern-based engineering businesses. He said yesterday that he planned to use the company to expand in engineering or other fields. In October Downiebrae reported a decline in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 152,000 (Pounds 241,000). The company, which makes pipe flanges and cuts steel profiles, said that no immediate improvement was foreseen. Turnover increased to Pounds 822,000 (Pounds 808,000) and earnings per share were 0.7p (1.07p). Mr Murray, who is chairman of Nu-Swift, was recently involved in a failed bid to win control of the board of Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial services group where he also owns a 29.2 per cent stake.</p>

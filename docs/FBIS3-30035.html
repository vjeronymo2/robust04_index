			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Should Be Done To Expand Sales of American </F> Automobiles?"]    [Text] The liberalization of Japan's auto market has  become a major issue between Japan and the United States. In  the Japan-U.S. economic consultations that broke down recently,  the U.S. Government strongly demanded setting targets to expand  imports of finished automobiles. The U.S. auto industry has  called on Japan to expand its sale of U.S.-made automobiles to  100,000 units over the next three years (19,000 units sold last  year).    Certainly, it is difficult not only for foreign companies  but  also for domestic companies to break into the Japanese market.  Commercial practices of a closed nature as well as excessive  government controls must be remedied. Still, however hard other  companies may try to pry open the markets of Japan through  government-to-government treaties, unless they can interest the  dealers, who sell the automobiles, and the consumers, who buy  them, business can never materialize.    Japanese dealers may be called keiretsu dealers, but they  are  different from the past, and they are not bound by contracts  with manufacturers as to which manufacturers' vehicles to sell.  Besides, lately, the business of selling domestic automobiles  is not going well. If the dealers confined themselves as  keiretsu dealers, their business would only suffer more.  Individual dealers now need to establish independence for  themselves, and to get rid of the old way of thinking which took  controls by keiretsu-connected manufacturers for granted.    On the other hand, U.S. manufacturers need to get more  serious in the efforts to break into the markets. Specifically,  they should put more efforts into selling to dealers directly.  Some of the Big Three auto makers are selling their products  through the sales outlets of Japanese auto manufacturers. This  means they do not want to develop their own sales outlets and  instead want to let their competitors sell their products. That  attitude is too easy-going.    Secondly, what needs to be done to get the dealers  interested, naturally, is to offer commodities which are  appropriate for, and can be sold in, the Japanese market, and  also to present attractive business terms. The manufacturers  need to offer right-hand drive automobiles, ensure high  performance and good quality products, not overprice the  products, and be able to provide good after-sales service.    Americans consider cars as something like shoes, while  Japanese value them as if they were part of their own houses.  The U.S. manufacturers should recognize this different cultural  view, and pursue efforts to develop markets with the  business-version perception of "In Rome, do as the Romans do."  Japanese consumers are prone to buy foreign-made products. The  Japanese market is worth U.S. manufacturers going after  seriously.    Recently, the results of a joint survey by Japanese and U.S.  consulting companies at the request of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of  Commerce were released. The survey analyzed the Japanese market  with respect to dealer networks, distribution costs, prices of  cars, purchasing practices, permits, and customer satisfaction.    The survey presented an estimate that the U.S. Big Three's  annual sales in Japan will grow to 57,000 units if all existing  problems in Japan -- like closed keiretsu relations between  manufacturers and dealers, and the U.S. manufacturers'  inadequate efforts -- are resolved. Some of the premises for  the estimate are questionable, but the survey does show there is  plenty of room for both Japan and the United States,  particularly in the private sectors, to make efforts for  improvement.</p>

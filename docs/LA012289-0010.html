			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING UP WITH AN OLD LADY;  </P> <P> NELLY'S VERSION BY EVA FIGES (PANTHEON BOOKS: $8.95, PAPER; 218 PP.;  0-679-72035-9);  </P> <P> GHOSTS BY EVA FIGES (PANTHEON BOOKS: $16.95; 150 PP.; 0-394-57159-2)  </P> <P> In England, Eva Figes is regarded as a literary descendant of Virginia Woolf  for her insistance on the inner world as the special province of the novel and  for her ability to render that world in precisely calibrated and luminous  lyrical imagery. The author of eight novels, she is arguably best known for her  nonfiction work, "Patriarchal Attitudes," published in 1970, a vintage feminist  classic in which she re-examined the ideas of major Western thinkers to expose  their underlying view of woman as the projection of men's fears and desires.  She concluded, "It is to this mirror image that woman has had to comply."  </P> <P> What is a woman's identity apart from these projections? This question lies at  the heart of "Nelly's Version," a novel originally published in Britain in  1977, now reissued in tandem with "Ghosts," the author's new novel. The central  character is a middle-aged woman suffering from amnesia. As the story begins,  she finds herself checking into a strange hotel in a strange town under an  assumed name with a suitcase full of bank notes. She imagines herself to be an  accomplice in some sort of secret plot; she awaits a cue that will reveal her  role in the unfolding of a thriller.  </P> <P> The first sight of herself in a mirror is a shock. At first she thinks a  stranger is in the room with her. Then it dawns. "I'll have to put up with you,  won't I? Somehow." The image in the mirror does not reply. "I suspected her of  being one of those women who had quietly put up with many things without  answering back, so that it had become a lifelong habit."  </P> <P> Although she avoids mirrors from that point on, at the hair- dresser she is  again forced to confront "the stranger, this alien and unlikely female" that is  her self. There, watching the alien self silently submit to unwelcome preening  and grooming, she feels contempt. "I would never grow to like her. But we were  stuck with each other now, like two inseparable sisters. One timid, the other  hard and rebellious." Eventually strangers in the form of husband and son --  both of them obnoxious and uncaring -- lay claim to the timid sister while the  hard rebellious sister turns incendiary.  </P> <P> The author's attempt to weave a solipsistic fictional world into the warp of  the mind of a profoundly alienated amnesiac is daring and skilled. Here a spark  of consciousness of what we must assume to be the narrator's true self forms in  the vacuum of a mind cut off from all memory, personal ties, and feeling.  Nothing is sacred as savagely funny scenes unfold between the narrator and  those claming to be her nearest of kin, for whom she has not a single shred of  feeling. The question of the narrator's real identity haunts the narrative from  beginning to end, where we are left wondering whether her amnesia was willed  unconsciously as a device to liberate her true, hard, rebellious self from the  mirror image of the compliant alien other self.  </P> <P> "Ghosts" is a fitting companion for the earlier novel because it, too,  experiments with the frontiers of fiction in addressing the theme of the  obliteration of the past. The narrator, also middle-aged and female, meditates  on the passage of time, her own transit into old age, and the loss of  everything caught up in the maelstrom of disintegration and renewal. While the  mood of "Nelly's Vision" was wicked, here it is melancholy.  </P> <P> The four seasons provide the structural divisions and backdrop for her thoughts  and memories of her own childhood and youth, her children's childhood now past,  her deceased father and mentally vacant mother, her dying friend and the secret  love she once shared with that friend's husband. Saturated images of nature  vividly convey our relentlessly changing world where life flows absently away  along with the spring rain washing through the gutters. In these images of  flowing water we sense the ghost of Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher who  articulated this modernist sensibility of ceaseless change a mere 2,500 years  ago in his famous maxim: "You cannot step twice into the same river."  </P> <P> Modern forces of development are now accelerating the pace set by nature. The  flow of traffic, the movement of people in the train station underscore the  fleetingness of the moment. Streets are widened and billboards posted where  once a row of shops used to stand. An old woman loses her flower shop and now  wanders, homeless, with plastic bags wrapped around her feet, her tracks fading  with the falling snow just as her memory too will be effaced with time.  </P> <P> The patterns of continuity do not offer comfort to the narrator. In the typical  way that her son twists his foot, she sees the ghost of her lost father, not  the ongoing presence of his spirit. In archetypally recurring events, there is  also no comfort. While others are absorbed in the annual celebration of the  Christmas pageant, the narrator has her eyes on the exit, almost in the manner  of a Holocaust survivor for whom the experiences of loss and escape are  inextricably united.  </P> <P> The only force opposing the suction of time and change seems to reside in the  created work itself, in the carefully measured prose and in poetic images that  capture and evoke the passing moment, the individual, the feeling. In this  prose poem of a novel, the beautiful cadence and imagery of the language itself  seem to reverse the rush to oblivion pictured in its words.  </P></p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Perkins buys Dorman Diesels in Dollars 50m deal Dorman Diesels, one of the oldest and most famous names in the diesel engine industry, is being bought by Peterborough-based Perkins Group for about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m), including the assumption of Dollars 12m of debt. The agreed deal, which is close to completion, has been under discussion for five months and is the most important ownership change in the UK diesel industry this decade. It comes less than two months after Varity, Perkins' US parent, sold the Massey Ferguson tractor business to concentrate on its core businesses of Perkins diesel engines and Kelsey-Hayes automotive parts. Dorman, established in Stafford in the 1870s, supplies high horsepower diesel engines for the power generation market and is also at the forefront of natural gas engine technology. Part of English Electric in the 1960s, it was later absorbed into GEC, which sold it in 1987 to Broadcrown Group, a private company based in Stone, Staffordshire. Broadcrown would not comment on the sale yesterday, beyond calling it a 'strategic disposal'. Dorman, which has 650 employees worldwide, most of whom are based at Stafford and Lincoln, has seen profits rise in recent years. Pre-tax profits last year were about Pounds 3m, on turnover in excess of Dollars 75m Perkins' sales last year were Dollars 702m. Perkins approached Dorman as part of its strategic plan to expand its product range, either through acquisitions and alliances, or through direct investment in new products. 'One of the real attractions of Dorman was its product range, which is the newest in its power band,' said Mr Tony Gilroy, chief executive of Perkins. Perkins offers engines from five to 1,500 bhp. The Dorman engines extend the range to 2,500 bhp and will enable Perkins to move quickly into power generation, a key growth sector of the diesel engine market, and natural gas engines. The deal will also bolster Perkins' expansion plans in south-east Asia, where Dorman has built a significant presence. Dorman Diesels will be renamed Perkins Engines (Stafford) although the Dorman name will be retained in some markets for the time being.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi tightens hold on Fondiaria FERRUZZI, the Italian industrial group, yesterday tightened its management hold over Fondiaria, the Florentine insurer that it jointly controls. At the same, Ferruzzi - which has debts of more than L10,700bn (Dollars 7bn)  -responded to speculation that it would dispose of Fondiaria in order to reduce its borrowings by stressing that the company was not for sale. The announcement followed a board meeting at the troubled insurance company, which saw the resignation of Mr Alfonso Scarpa, its long-standing managing director, and the appointment of Mr Carlo Sama, a senior Ferruzzi executive and husband of one of the Ferruzzi heiresses, as Fondiaria's new chairman. Mr Sama replaces Mr Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier and cousin of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, who died last month. Mr Camillo De Benedetti shared control of Fondiaria with Ferruzzi through Gaic, a quoted holding company. Ferruzzi's financial difficulties and Fondiaria's waning profitability have led to speculation that part or all of the insurance operation may be sold. However, Mr Sama said he considered Fondiaria 'Ferruzzi's life insurance, and . . . one doesn't sell life insurance'. Fondiaria, which appointed Mr Arrigo Bianchi di Lavagna as its new managing director, gave no indication of how it planned to improve earnings. Its financial performance has deteriorated as a result of difficulties in the Italian insurance sector and setbacks in its own ambitious expansion policy. Fondiaria's biggest problems have arisen in Germany, where it owns 20 per cent of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, the big insurance group in which Assurances Generales de France is now the major shareholder. Mr Bianchi di Lavagna, an experienced insurance and banking executive, was previously managing director of Unione di Riassicurazione, the reinsurance company owned by leading Italian insurers. No indication was given of Mr Scarpa's future plans.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Koreas agree on new links NORTH and South Korea yesterday narrowed the cold war gap, agreeing a framework for re-establishing land, sea and air links in a unified nation, Reuter reports from Seoul. Seoul's South-North Dialogue Office said 16 points, including transport links, had been agreed during two hours of talks between the communist North and capitalist South at the border village of Panmunjom. But scores of differences still remain between the ideological foes before they can sign a full economic pact. 'Both Koreas reached final agreement on 16 items concerning mutual economic exchanges and co-operation which are included in an accord to implement the non-aggression and reconciliation pact,' the office said. The agreements included the re-opening of railways and roads, sea and air routes and the relinking of mail services and other communications. The two sides also agreed to forge scientific, technological and environmental exchanges and co-operation once the border re-opens. The two sides meet again on August 21. Direct links between the two Koreas were cut after the bitter 1950-53 Korean war, which ended in an uncertain truce. The prime ministers signed a non-aggression pact last December and launched regular talks aimed at putting the accord into practice. But progress limped to a halt when a bitter row erupted over the South's demand to inspect nuclear facilities in the North. The first victim of the nuclear impasse was a reunion programme for families divided by the war, which was due this month. The two Koreas agreed in May to allow cross-border visits by a handful of elderly Koreans separated from their families by the 1945 division of the Korean peninsula. But the humanitarian exchanges have been held to ransom by the nuclear issue, and talks collapsed last Friday. The next day, South Korean news media said Seoul might suspend plans to send deputy premier Choi Kak-kyu and a mission of businessmen and government officials to the North to study joint ventures and economic co-operation.</p>

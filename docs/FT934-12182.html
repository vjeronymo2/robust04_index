			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / German plea to delay N-power decision THE chief executive of RWE, Germany's biggest electricity generator, yesterday proposed a moratorium of several years on any final decision about a new generation of nuclear power stations in the country. Mr Friedhelm Gieske called instead for rapid political agreement on a permitted working life of 35-40 years for the present generation of reactors to give the electricity industry a reliable planning framework for investments. At the same time he warned that failure to allow a new prototype extra-safe reactor to be built in Germany would prevent the country from helping to raise safety standards throughout the world. 'We are inclined to be far more conscious of the risks than we are of the opportunities,' he said. 'If we carry on like this, I am afraid Germany will be gravely weakened as an industrial location.' He was speaking just before negotiations seeking an energy consensus between the government and opposition failed because of disagreement over the long-term nuclear option. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, and Gerhard Schroder, Lower Saxony premier, said they would not be continued in the same form because positions were irreconcilable. In an attempt to head off any rapid move to abandon nuclear energy completely, as proposed by the opposition Social Democratic (SPD) and Green parties, Mr Gieske said that a standstill would be a sensible decision. 'I can personally live very well with a moratorium of several years,' he told RWE's annual news conference. 'This would give us a pause for thought, for a complete rethink.' He said the SPD decision to reject a compromise negotiated by Mr Schroder and Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, was inexplicable. 'That is why I believe that in the short term we will not reach a consensus,' he said. 'But as long as there is still talking, I will not give up hope.' RWE, the largest of Germany's big three electricity utilities, is the least dependent on nuclear energy. But Mr Gieske's paramount demand is for a decision which will simply provide long-term planning certainty. On the issue of nuclear waste reprocessing, the other immediate question needing a political decision, Mr Dietmar Kuhnt, chief executive of RWE Energie, said the company had no plans to pull out of its British and French contracts. Although direct disposal was under political consideration, preceded by 'long-term interim storage' of high-level radioactive waste, such a solution was still illegal.

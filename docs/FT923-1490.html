			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Fittings loses Pounds 1.02m BRITISH FITTINGS Group yesterday reported its second successive half-yearly loss but is paying a token interim dividend as an indication that it had reached its nadir and would return to profit by the year end. The group, which distributes valves, tubes and fittings, manufactures and hires high pressure water products, and distributes non-ferrous metals, announced a pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 1.02m compared with a profit of Pounds 1.71m in the 1991 first half. The group's position deteriorated during the second six months last year, however, and it posted a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.96m for the full year after heavy exceptional items. The latest deficit, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 622,000 (Pounds 374,000), came on turnover reduced to Pounds 40.4m (Pounds 42m). Fully diluted losses per share were 3.48p compared with earnings of 5.37p. However, Mr Brian Stanton, chief executive, said 'the company should run into profit in the second half.' An interim dividend of 0.5p (1.375p) is declared.</p>

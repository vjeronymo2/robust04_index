Vytautas Landsbergis said in a statement circulated Friday  that Russia tries to preserve its military bases in Latvia and  wants to inveigle Lithuania into a post-Soviet union.    To attain its goals, he said, Russia employs the imaginary  need for a huge army in its Kaliningrad region, as well "the  weakness and the conformity of the current Lithuanian  leadership," and pressures it to sign an agreement on Russian  military transit through Lithuanian territory.    The opposition leader said an agreement on military transit  would give Russia if a better pretext to interfere, to accuse  and to demand "rights" for itself, just like in 1940. Military  transit would be a constant threat to Lithuanian independence.  Landsbergis said the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party  does not have any right to "step over" the June 8, 1992  constitutional act that bars Lithuania from any post-Soviet  unions.</p>

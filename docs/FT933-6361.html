			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES trading trod a cautious path ahead of yesterday morning's Bundesbank policy council meeting, with uncertainty over interest rate cuts holding volume in check, Christine Buckley writes. Some profit-taking in equity futures depressed the level of the September contract on the FT-SE 100 in morning trading and it fell to the day's low just before the Bundesbank's news. But once Germany stemmed speculation with a decision to stand firm on its rates, more action moved into the market, taking the September future on a rally that did not turn back. The contract also received added impetus from a squeeze. With short positions boosting the performance, it closed at 3,097 with 11,740 contracts traded, a rise of 6 points on the day. Given the lack of German action on interest rates and a fairly lacklustre trade in short sterling and gilts, the fact that the contract moved upwards was a measure of its underlying strength, traders believed. It finished the session 12 points ahead of its fair value premium to the cash market, the measure of carrying costs and dividend payments on the underlying contract. A significant amount of switching between futures and cash was also seen, as well as some large block deals. Traded options had less fire with 24,269 lots traded. The Footsie option weighed in with 7,098 contracts and the highest stock was Glaxo at 3,774.</p>

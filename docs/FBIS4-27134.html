			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu began consultations with major allies' envoys Monday on  the North Korean nuclear crisis, meeting first with U.S.  Ambassador James Laney.    Han, returning from an inter-ministerial security  coordination meeting at the presidential office, asked Laney to  come to the Foreign Ministry, officials said.    The move is part of instructions from President Kim Yong-sam  to consult with the four major countries involved -- the United  States, Japan, Russia and China -- as the U.N. Security Council  prepares to meet Tuesday to discuss action against North Korea.    He is expected to emphasize that now is the critical time in  dealing with the nuclear dispute, noting that North Korea is  clearly in violation of the safeguards agreement with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Han and Laney are expected to agree on coordinated action at  the United Nations in a last-minute attempt to get North Korea  to stop unloading spent fuel from its reactor, while also  agreeing that stringent measures are inevitable otherwise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 Apr (DPA) -- A Cuban Foreign Relations  Ministry source said today that the NATO bombings of the Bosnian  city of Gorazde could trigger serious consequences for the  Balkans, Europe, and the rest of the world.    The governmental Radio Rebelde reported that the diplomatic  source maintained that the air attacks could spark unexpected  consequences at regional, continental, and world levels, instead  of contributing to reaching a fair solution of the conflict.  The source of the Cuban Foreign Ministry believes that the path  to peace must not follow an escalation of war, not even as a  result of a foreign military intervention. On the contrary, all  parties should refrain from encouraging this alternative; they  should take definite steps toward promoting the success of the  negotiation efforts and the attainment of a political agreement  that would bring peace to that region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 19 (AFP) -- A force of three  thousand Khmer Rouge [KR] guerrillas stormed back into the  northwest town of Pailin on Tuesday, a month after losing the  stronghold to government troops, a spokesman for the radical  faction said.    "We took our base back at 12:45 P.M., captured eight  government tanks in good condition and destroyed seven," the  Khmer Rouge spokesman in the capital told AFP.    Casualty figures were not yet confirmed, he said.    The spokesman said the 3,000 guerrillas attacked and forced  back some 7,000 government troops.    "I am very excited to hear we can get back our houses," he  said.    The Khmer Rouge need to clear mines around the town, "then  we  can bring back the people who lived there before," the spokesman  said.    Co-Defence Minister Tie Banh, speaking from Battambang,  admitted that the Khmer Rouge had recaptured part of Pailin.    "But remember Pailin is a very big place," he said. "Some of  our troops are countering the attack and there is fighting going  on there."    Tie Banh said the government had only six tanks in operation  at Pailin and questioned how the guerrillas could talk about 15  tanks.    Other military officials said the situation in Pailin was  not  yet clear.    "We should wait until tomorrow," one general said.    "The nature of military (operations) is like that, there is  pushing up and down," he said. Co-premier Hun Sen also went to  Battambang Province Tuesday, a government official said.    The region's military headquarters is based in the city of  Battambang, around 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Pailin.    Military officials, confirmed there was shelling in Pailin  early Tuesday and increased fighting in the area was been  reported during the past week.    A Western diplomat, however, cautioned there was "no hard  evidence" to confirm the fall of Pailin.    "The government was pouring all sorts of resources into the  area. So even if they were knocked out of Pailin town, they  could be in a good position to take it back," the diplomat said.    The government forces captured Pailin March 19 and the Khmer  Rouge, rather than face them in a conventional battle, retreated  from the town and melted into the hills to the west along the  Thai border.    Generals said the capture of the resource-rich area was a  major blow to the notorious guerrilla faction opposing the  government that emerged from the UN-sponsored elections last May.    The Khmer Rouge financed their organisation by selling  gem-mining and logging concessions, primarily to Thai business  consortia, many of which were reported to have links with the  Thai military.    The government commanders said at the time that if they  could  not hold Pailin "they did not deserve to be called the Royal  Cambodian Armed Forces."    The commanders swore that they would not let Pailin suffer  the same fate as Anlung Veng, another major guerrilla base which  the government forces seized -- only to be routed several weeks  later when the guerrillas launched a major counter-attack.    King Norodom Sihanouk expressed his support for the  government's seizure of Pailin, and described the offensive as  "legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable."    But the king warned the victory could be a "double-edged  sword" and the army could be entering a situation akin to Dien  Bien Phu, where a static French force fell to a nimble force of  Vietnamese guerrillas.    If the guerrillas recaptured Pailin, it would seriously  undermine government's and the army's credibility and morale and  "hypothetically could threaten the very future of our new  regime," the king said.    Western military analysts had predicted that the guerrillas  might try to recapture their base when the rainy season started  in May-June.    The rains would turn the already difficult supply routes  into  almost impassable, treacherous trails of mud, they said.</p>

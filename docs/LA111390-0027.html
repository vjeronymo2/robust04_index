			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: ST. IVES LABS' PROFIT UP 42% IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> St. Ives Laboratories Inc., recovering from a marketing goof, said its  third-quarter profit jumped 42% from a year earlier on a 9% increase in sales.  </P> <P> In the quarter ended Sept. 30, St. Ives' net income rose to $835,731 from  $590,532 a year earlier, and its sales rose to $27.5 million from $25.3  million.  </P> <P> Based in Chatsworth, St. Ives makes shampoos and other personal-care products.  In late-1989 and early this year, its earnings had slumped largely because the  company had put its hair-care products in new packages that bombed with  consumers. St. Ives has since gone back to its previous packaging and its  profit rebounded in the latest quarter.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of 1990, however, St. Ives' profit was still down 33%  from a year earlier, to $2.47 million from $3.71 million. Its nine-month sales  fell 6% to $78.6 million from $83.5 million.  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Ivory Coast nearer crisis Ivory Coast edged closer to a constitutional crisis yesterday,with the main opposition party arguing that ailing President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is no longer able to govern, Reuter reports from Abidjan. State-run media maintained a news blackout on the health of Mr Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest-serving leader, not seen in public since returning on November 19 from prostate surgery in Europe. The Ivorian Popular Front, the main opposition party, says Mr Houphouet-Boigny can no longer run the country. Electricity workers staged a brief strike on Monday and Abidjan's main hospitals are due to be hit by a strike today. Civil service salaries are being paid up to three weeks late, an unprecedented delay.</p>

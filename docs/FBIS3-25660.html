Addressing about 2,000 residents in the coloured  township of Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg, Mr Ramaphosa said  the way things were developing the NPF would barely have enough  troops ready to provide one soldier per polling booth, whereas  there should be at least 15.    It would not be easy to convince the presently very cautious  international community to send enough, if any, peacekeeping  soldiers. "So we are going to have to rely on the security  forces."    There were some defence force and police members who would  be  unwilling to protect the interim constitution or those who  wished to vote, but there were many, especially black security  force members, who would be. Besides this, said Mr Rampahosa,  "we must each become peace-keepers ourselves."</p>

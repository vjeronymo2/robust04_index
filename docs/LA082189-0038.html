			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> JAVA MAY HINDER EX-SMOKERS  </P> <P> Researchers at San Francisco General Hospital reported last week that smokers  who recently kicked the habit may be unusually sensitive to caffeine,  suggesting that their tendency to be anxious and irritable from nicotine  withdrawal may be magnified by a cup of java.  </P> <P> Dr. Neal Benowitz and his colleagues studied 68 men and women who were going to  try to quit smoking. The amount of caffeine in the blood of those who stopped  smoking was more than 2 1/2 times higher after they quit than before, even  though their caffeine consumption remained the same or even decreased, the  researchers reported in the British Medical Journal. By comparison, there was  no change in the amount of caffeine in the blood of those who did not quit, the  researchers said.  </P> <P> The tar in cigarette smoke is believed to accelerate the breakdown of a number  of drugs, including caffeine, said Benowitz, so when someone quits smoking, the  caffeine may not be broken down as quickly.  </P></p>

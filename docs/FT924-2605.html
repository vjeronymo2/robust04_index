			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Booth Industries A reduced volume of work at Booth Industries resulted in a decline in turnover from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 12m and in pre-tax profit from Pounds 324,000 to Pounds 110,000 for the half year to end-September. It would be unwise to look to any 'meaningful improvement' during the second half, directors warned. However, the interim dividend is held at 0.7p, payable from earnings per share of 1.84p (5.42p).</p>

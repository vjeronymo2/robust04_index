			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Swan Hunter design team loses work offer The design team at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, faces redundancy on Monday. after a proposal to offer it sub-contract work was withdrawn yesterday by Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. Earlier this week the French company dropped its attempt to buy the yard as a going concern. Most or all of the 100 design staff will lose their jobs on Monday unless receiver Price Waterhouse is able over the weekend to convert other expressions of interest in buying Swans as a going concern into firm propositions. Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said yesterday that the likelihood of this was a 'long shot'. Mr Horsfield, who earlier this week said prospects of a going-concern sale were now remote, said the redundancies were likely to be announced on Monday. The loss of the design team would end the ability of the 164-year-old company, one of the world's great shipbuilding names, to tender for new work, in effect sealing its fate. Their chances of staff finding alternative employment in the shrunken UK shipbuilding industry were further dented yesterday by an announcement from Yarrow, the Clyde warship builder, that it now has a 'surplus' of 93 technical staff, including drawing office employees. At Swans, Mr Horsfield said negotiations were likely to start next week on a piecemeal sale of assets. Some deals, he said, could be concluded by the end of the month. Swans is due to hand over its last vessel, the Type 23 frigate Richmond, on November 2. Although the company has shed 1,800 jobs since it went into receivership in May 1993, the fact it now has 660 employees and a virtually empty order book is a big impediment to any sale. Under the Transfer of Undertakings (Employment) Regulations, any going-concern purchaser would have to take on Pounds 8m of contingent liabilities for the workforce, many of whom have worked at Swans for 20 years or more. 'It's a classic example of a situation in which potential buyers for a business have been frightened off by European legislation which is designed to protect employment,' said Mr Horsfield. The design team was to have been made redundant on August 31, but the deadline was extended to yesterday after CMN tabled revised purchase proposals 10 days ago following deadlock with the MoD over a previous plan. On Monday, CMN and Price Waterhouse said they had been unable to agree terms for a going-concern sale conditional on Swans first winning two years' work before CMN took over. CMN then put forward proposals to acquire Swans' Hebburn dry dock, the biggest on the east coast of Britain, and its intellectual property rights. It also proposed to offer the design team subcontract work up to the end of the year. It is still bidding for Hebburn and Swans' intellectual rights. In a statement which indicated increasing frustration with CMN, Price Waterhouse said yesterday: 'This is the third proposal we have considered from Soffia/CMN in as many weeks, and each has failed to come to fruition. The frustration felt by the design team, and the bitterness of the whole Swan Hunter workforce, can only be imagined as their hopes have been raised and dashed once again.' Mr Peter Chapman, Swans' MSF representative, said CMN now had no credibility with the workforce. 'It's the way they have strung us along, and their indecisiveness.' Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team, said it had withdrawn its subcontract proposal yesterday after the receivers said it must start paying the design team's Pounds 200,000 monthly wage bill now without any certainty of acquiring the Hebburn dry dock. He said CMN wanted the dry dock to carry out shipbuilding.</p>

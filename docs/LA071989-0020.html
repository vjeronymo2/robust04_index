			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> At a time of cuts in network program-standards staffs and increasing beefs by  pressure groups about what they see as the rise of ribaldry on TV, Alice  Henderson, a former CBS program-practices vice president, has set up her own  New York-based consulting company to deal in matters of naughty and nice. For a  fee, the company will advise TV show-makers on what may or may not be  acceptable in what Henderson calls "this era of heightened concern in the  private sector and in government regarding standards for sexuality, violence  and language in television programs."

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Rebuilding southern China in its own image - Hong Kong's growing influence in the mainland IN the 1980s, Hong Kong shifted its low-cost manufacturing businesses across the border; but in the 1990s it is already in the advanced stages of rebuilding southern China in its own image, and it is now turning its attention further north. In the flat marshland around the Pearl River delta, factories are already giving way to residential tower blocks, shopping malls are being constructed to sell Hong Kong brand names, and the area is scarred with motorways and power stations; almost all of it is funded with Hong Kong capital. Guangzhou even has a Hong Kong-funded race-course. Only two years ago, China business concepts were spurned as unduly risky, but as the economic ties between the two have evolved, attitudes have changed radically. Mr Henry Cheng, managing director of New World Development, one of Hong Kong's property giants, argues: 'After 1997, Hong Kong will be part of China, so if you are planning to invest in Hong Kong, you might as well invest in China. The cost is much less and the potential profit is much more.' Hong Kong manufacturing companies already employ an estimated three million people in Guangdong province, and in 1992, more than 20 million Hong Kong people crossed the border into China - almost four trips a year for every man, woman and child in the colony. 'In many ways, Guangdong Province is becoming like a substantially bigger New Territories,' said Mr Tim Williams, director of Schroders Asia. In the late-1970s, Hong Kong's New Territories was an expanse of farmland, but now it has a population of 2.3m and its main city, Shatin, boasts one of the busiest McDonald's restaurant in the world. The links between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province are already economically unbreakable. Hongkong Bank has estimated that close to 30 per cent of Hong Kong's notes and coins in circulation are held in China (where they represent a tradeable currency, and a hedge against the further devaluation of the Renminbi). The border city of Shenzhen is constructed in the Hong Kong style, and continued growth in Guangdong (the Province) is contingent, in the short-term, on more capital from the colony. Hong Kong accounted for more than 60 per cent of all investment into China last year. A survey by Credit Lyonnais, the French securities company, of Hong Kong investment flows into China has discovered that listed companies in Hong Kong are involved in at least 802 projects over the border, and that the total value of projects involving local companies (in discloseable transactions) comes to Dollars HK521bn. This represents one third of the entire capitalisation of the Hong Kong stock market. A number of these projects are exceptionally long-term, and some may never materialise. But Credit Lyonnais estimates the current site area of Hong Kong's land bank in China - at 2.37bn sq ft - is almost three times the land mass of Hong Kong island. Property projects accounted for 40 per cent of total investment. Another 5 per cent was channeled into manufacturing, but the largest target was infra-structure, accounting for 47 per cent of the total amount. The investment in infra-structure is an important indicator, since it suggests a level of long-term commitment that has rarely been a hallmark of Hong Kong corporate investment. Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings, was the trailblazer for these projects. His Guangzhou (Canton) to Shenzhen Superhighway took a decade to negotiate and has required substantial trust and patience, but ultimately it is likely to be highly profitable. Numerous Hong Kong-listed companies are constructing joint venture power stations to try to meet China's voracious appetite for power; China Light &amp; Power, Hopewell, New World, Lippo, China Strategic, Kumagai Gumi (Hongkong) and Citic Pacific, are all involved in such projects. Significant capital is also going into developing feeder ports for Hong Kong's own container terminal. The majority of Hong Kong companies may continue to spread the philosophy of quick-fire construction and sale, but, like Hopewell, there are a number of companies which are looking further ahead. Mr Peter Woo, Chairman of Wharf, has developed the compelling concept of building highly efficient transportation links with the city of Wuhan in central China. This will create a conduit for goods from China's most populous province of Sichuan. Wharf is already planning a Wuhan containerisation terminal, so that the role of Hong Kong's service economy can stretch far beyond Guangdong. Mr Yu Chung-po has gone further still. The chairman of Kumagai Gumi (Hongkong) is planning to replicate the entire formula for Hong Kong's success on the tip of Hainan Island, which lies to the South of Guangdong. Yangpu, for which Kumagai has a 70-year lease, is the only genuine free trade zone in China. The developer will construct power stations, an airport and container terminal, to serve a light industrial export zone with a population of 250,000. Investment costs in the next five years will exceed Dollars HK10bn. What makes it unique, however, is that there are no currency or trade restrictions, minimal tax and no duty, while planning permission will be controlled by Kumagai and not China. Some analysts are doubtful that China will fully abide by Yangpu's autonomy, but Mr Yu argues that 'China has never violated any contract, once it has signed it'. The project has the firm backing of Premier Li Peng, and as a hedge, Chinese partners account for 55 per cent of the development consortium, so the state will benefit from the success of the project. It remains debatable whether China is ready for such projects. Per capita income is Dollars US355, compared with Dollars US1,799 in neighbouring Thailand. But the reality is not as clear-cut, since China's figures ignore state housing and transport subsidies, salary bonuses, and the extreme regional variations in wealth. Just 14 years after it became a Special Economic Zone, Hong Kong's border city of Shenzhen has a population of over two million, and the average household owns more than one colour television. China has always been highly regionalised, and it was only logical that the Cantonese of Hong Kong should focus on business with the Cantonese of Guangdong. Business in China is based on contacts and trust, and the racial link enhances both. Guangdong has a population of more than 60m of the most affluent people in China, and as Mr Williams says: 'If all that Hong Kong is, in the future, is the entrepot and service centre for Guangdong Province, then that is not a bad position to be in.' But department stores are already multiplying in the northern cities of Beijing and Shanghai, and these are doing the statistically improbable and selling Dollars US1,000 pairs of shoes, indicating a rapid northward migration of capital. Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong luxury goods company which owns Harvey Nicholls in London, plans to open three luxury stores in China this year; only one of these is in the south. According to Credit Lyonnais, Guangdong Province accounts for only 50 per cent of Hong Kong listed companies' investment in China. China faces the political imperative of using Guangdong's formula for wealth-generation to rebuild the poorer northern provinces, and Hong Kong's businessmen are already playing a front line role.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Heseltine 'damaging Post Office' with delay in review Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was yesterday attacked by MPs for damaging the Post Office by prolonging his review of its future. The Commons trade and industry committee, which has a Conservative majority, added to the cabinet debate over whether to exclude radical measures from next year's legislative programme by urging Mr Heseltine to publish the conclusions of the review and plans for any legislative action 'without delay'. Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, said: 'What we are saying is we want to see a bill in the next session.' Mr Heseltine has said that there is a strong economic case for privatising the Royal Mail - the Post Office's letters division - but has indicated that political considerations have prevented him from doing so. Many Tory backbenchers, particularly those threatened by Liberal Democrats in the south-west of England, are worried about the impact of privatisation on rural postal services. A report by the committee, published yesterday, did not give its own proposals on the Post Office's future - so hiding party political divisions. Mr Keith Hampson, a Tory member of the committee, indicated that he favoured privatising the Royal Mail, while Labour's Mr Michael Clapham argued that the three Post Office divisions - Royal Mail, Parcelforce and Post Office Counters - should be kept together. The committee pinned the blame for uncertainty over the corporation's future on Mr Heseltine, saying: 'It would appear that no new information or research is awaited, only ministerial decisions.' It said that while the review - which has lasted 20 months and cost Pounds 1.3m - continues, 'the Post Office has seen competitors attack its core markets, but has been unable to fight back because, as a public sector body, it faces government restrictions on its activities'. 'The growth of competition is made particularly harmful to the Post Office by the uncertainty over its future,' it added. The committee supported the Post Office's contention that it should be free to raise money without being constrained by the public sector borrowing requirement. The Future of the Post Office. HMSO.

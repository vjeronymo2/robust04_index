			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Private prison services attacked A United Nations committee is to be asked to consider whether Britain's development of privately managed prisons contravenes international law. The Howard League for Penal Reform has submitted a document to the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, alleging financial and humanitarian failures in Britain's commercially managed prisons. It complains of a series of failings including poor regimes for inmates, financial profligacy, obsessive secrecy, suicides and disturbances. Ms Frances Crook, Howard League director, said yesterday that the government had failed to develop a coherent penal policy and was trying to conceal this by 'handing over prisoners to commercial companies' whose main motive was financial gain. She added: 'The Howard League considers commercial prisons to be immoral, impracticable, and contrary to international law.' If the UN sub-commission supports its view, the league might consider legal action against the government. Privately run prisons have been established in other countries - notably the US - for some years. US private prison operators have been part of groups bidding to manage UK prisons. Britain has three privately managed prisons and the contract to run a fourth, Buckley Hall at Rochdale, was awarded last month. Private-sector groups are preparing proposals to finance, build and manage prisons at Liverpool and in south Wales, and private bids to manage some existing public prisons are to be invited. The Prison Service says the process of market testing prison management is leading to imaginative bids from both the private and public sectors which offer enhanced regimes for prisoners.</p>

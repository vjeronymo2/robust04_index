			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / PC prices set to rise after fall in sterling PRICES of personal computers in the UK look set to rise because of the devaluation of sterling following Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Up to 40 companies could announce price increases, despite the fiercely competitive UK market. Some have already done so. Elonex, the London-based company which is the sixth largest supplier of personal computers in the UK, said yesterday it was raising prices by between 7 1/2 and 12 1/2 per cent on a range of machines. A desktop PC will cost another Pounds 100, a notebook computer Pounds 200 more. Other companies are understood to have raised prices but refused to make the increases public. The computer industry buys components, chiefly from the US and the Far East, in dollars, but sells them in the UK in sterling. Mr Israel Wetrin, Elonex founder and chief executive, said: 'Do we stick with lower prices and compromise on quality or do we absorb as much of the extra cost as we can and raise our prices by as much as is necessary to maintain high standards? 'Elonex has chosen the latter course,' he added. Mr Jeremy Davies, managing director of Context, a UK-based consultancy which tracks PC prices, said devaluation of the pound had forced PC suppliers into one of two camps: those, such as Elonex, Viglen and Opus, which are assembling PCs in the UK and face increased component costs, and others including Compaq, Dell and Acer, which assemble outside the UK and are not affected. He said: 'This will accelerate the shake-out we have been expecting among PC suppliers'. Dell, the US-based pioneer in direct selling through telesales and newspaper advertisements, said it would not raise prices. Opus Technologies, UK-based supplier, refused to comment. The price rises will be the first since the PC industry was riven by a price war which began two years ago. Since then prices have been falling by up to 40 per cent a year. In the past few months Compaq and IBM, the market leaders, have announced low-cost PCs which will intensify competition in what one supplier described as 'a grubby business today'.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: USAir seeks to reduce payroll costs by Dollars 500m USAir, the loss-making US carrier in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake, is seeking pay and benefit cost cuts of Dollars 500m from employees to help reduce annual operating expenses by Dollars 1bn. Outlining details of USAir's cost-cutting programme at a Merrill Lynch transportation conference in New York, Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's chairman and chief executive, said the carrier had introduced measures to reduce costs by Dollars 175m this year. These included job cuts, subcontracting freight and mail handling, and improved inventory management. He said USAir would not attain its goal of cutting annual costs by Dollars 1bn unless pay and benefits were lowered to 'levels more consistent with market standards'. Talks with the unions were under way. Mr Schofield said that when agreement on a cost-reduction plan was obtained from at least one of the three primary unions, the carrier would implement the measures with both its members and all non-union employees. The US fares war has prevented the airline from turning around its finances. In the first quarter of this year, USAir lost Dollars 196.7m. The carrier wants to cut costs through fleet rationalisation, more productive flight crew and aircraft scheduling, the centralisation of cargo management and purchasing, distribution system refinements and contracting out catering. This month, labour unions announced plans to seek a federal injunction to stop USAir's plans to contract out its freight and mail handling operations. USAir shares closed unchanged at Dollars 6 1/2 in New York. Delta Air Lines, seeking to slash annual costs, is to suspend four transatlantic routes - New York-Oslo, New York-Stockholm, Miami-London and Cincinnati-Munich - and remove all 13 Airbus A-130 aircraft from its fleet. United Airlines said it was seeking to take over Delta's Miami-London route.</p>

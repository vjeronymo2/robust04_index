			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Russia cuts natural gas supplies to Poland RUSSIA has cut by half its deliveries of natural gas to Poland, adding to Warsaw's economic uncertainty in face of protests over the steep new year price increases for energy, AP reports from Warsaw. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, deputy foreign trade minister, said yesterday that Russian exporters had informed Polish companies of reduced deliveries since the government in Moscow had failed to set export quotas for natural resources for 1992. 'We do not consider the situation serious because it is only a result of bureaucratic delays,' Mr Olechowski. The Solidarity trade union, along with two other big labour federations, had called for strikes today and on Thursday to protest at the price increases for natural gas, electricity and hot-water heating. Dissatisfaction with the hardships of market reforms pose a threat to the stability of Poland's three-week-old government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. The price rises, ranging from 20 to 100 per cent, result from increased expenditure on energy and lower government subsidies. Following 'energetic' intervention in Moscow, deliveries are expected to return within the next few days to the levels set by a trade agreement between Russia and Poland, Mr Olechowski said. After months of uncertainty in trade with the former Soviet Union, which for decades had been Poland's biggest trading partner, the deal on December 24 deal provides for deliveries of 8.1bn cubic metres of natural gas and 5m tons of oil in return for Polish foodstuffs and medicines. The switch in 1991 to hard currency payments in trade within the former eastern bloc and economic turmoil in the former Soviet Union saw a 60 per cent decline in trade between Poland and its neighbour.</p>

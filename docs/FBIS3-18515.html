			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel does not want the example of the NATO ultimatum to be  applied to other areas in Bosnia yet. In an interview with the  television company `N-TV' in Berlin on Thursday [3 March],  Kinkel came out against issuing such an ultimatum "without  examination" and "automatically" for such cities as Tuzla and  Bihac. Instead, the "new momentum" has to be used "to make  political progress."    Kinkel nevertheless advocates linking the "political" and  the  "military" components. He argues for "tackling the individual  crisis spots with this combination of the military and the  political approaches, but above all with the political  approach." In this way, an "overall solution" should be  achieved "by a domino effect."</p>

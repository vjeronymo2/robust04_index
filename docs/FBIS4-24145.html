			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament June 23 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]  had had "an open cheque book" to fulfill their mandates, the  director-general of state expenditure, Mr Hannes Smit, said on  Thursday. Appearing before the Joint Standing Committee on  Finance, he said both the IEC and TEC did not have budgets  approved by Parliament, and therefore there was no over-spending  on specific allocations.    Mr Smit was replying to a question by Mr David Graaff (NP)  [National Party] on over-spending by the IEC and TEC.    He said the IEC, funded from the budget of the Department of  Home Affairs, had received R119 million [rand] from the 1993/94  budget and R128.5 million from the department's 1994/95  allocation.    The IEC had then requested an additional R700 million,  bringing its total allocation to R948.3 million.    The TEC had received R7.5 million from the 1993/94 home  affairs budget and R8.4 million in 1994/95 -- a total of R15.9  million.</p>

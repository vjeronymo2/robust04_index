			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Quayle directs attack at Clinton VICE-PRESIDENT Dan Quayle last night attacked the 'cultural divide' across America between those 'fighting for what is right and (those) refusing to see what is wrong'. His acceptance speech to the Republican party convention constituted a stout defence of his conservative beliefs, an attempt to redefine his image, a slashing attack on the Democrats and Mr Bill Clinton, their nominee, and a predictably effusive endorsement of President George Bush. Mr Quayle portrayed himself as the embodiment of the traditional small-town values that have featured greatly at the convention, in an apparent attempt to emulate last month's acceptance speech of Senator Al Gore, his Democratic counterpart. But his speech was mostly a standard indictment of the Democrats and, on the face of it, unlikely to do much to enhance his modest reputation. He emphasised two crusades he has conducted over the last year. The US legal system was spinning out of control, replete with 'frivolous law suits' burdening the economy and weakening the judicial system. Mr Clinton, he charged, would not address legal reform - 'the trial lawyers won't let him'. Mr Quayle extolled the Council on Competitiveness - he is its chairman  - which targets federal regulation, and attacked Congress for trying to kill it off.</p>

Compliance tests performed for NHTSA indicate that the shoulder belt webbing on Fisher-Price Models AO9191, DO9191, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179, and 9180 seats manufactured between 1988 and September 16, 1993 do not meet the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213 and therefore would not provide adequate protection to children in the event of a fire in a vehicle in which they are installed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 49 CFR 554.10, a public meeting will be held at 10 a.m., on Monday, October 21, 1994 in Room 9230, Department of Transportation Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, at which time the manufacturer and all other interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments on the issue of whether the child safety seats covered by this initial decision comply with FMVSS No. 213. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In September 1993, Fisher-Price filed a petition seeking an exemption from the recall requirements of the statute on the basis that any noncompliance with the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213 was inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety (58 FR 59511). After NHTSA denied the petition (59 FR 23253), Fisher-Price appealed (59 FR 30957). In conjunction with its appeal, Fisher-Price requested the agency to convene a public meeting on the inconsequentiality issue, which was scheduled for August 17, 1994 (59 FR 39015). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the agency's regulations governing inconsequentiality petitions, 49 CFR 556.4(a), such petitions may only be filed after a determination that a noncompliance exists. Until recently, NHTSA had believed that Fisher-Price had made such a determination in September 1993, prior to filing its inconsequentiality petition. However, on August 10, 1994, Fisher-Price informed the agency that it was taking the position that it had never formally determined that a noncompliance existed. NHTSA therefore canceled the public meeting and terminated the inconsequentiality proceeding (59 FR 42326). The documents reflecting the agency's consideration of that petition may be found in NHTSA Docket No. 93&hyph;79. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the circumstances, NHTSA has resumed its noncompliance investigation and, as described above, has made an initial decision that these Fisher-Price car seats do not comply with FMVSS No. 213. Pursuant to 49 CFR 556.4(a), Fisher-Price could at this time renew its petition for an inconsequentiality determination. However, by letter dated August 25, 1994, counsel for Fisher-Price advised NHTSA that the company did not plan to file such a petition, even if the agency should finally decide that a noncompliance exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to participate in this proceeding through written an/or oral presentations. Persons wishing to make oral presentations are requested to notify Ms. Elaine Beale, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 6111, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;2832, before the close of business on October 18, 1994. Written comments must be submitted to the same address and received not later than the beginning of the meeting on October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All materials related to the issues addressed by this notice are available for public inspection during working hours (9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.) in NHTSA's Technical Reference Library, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. 30118(a); delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50(a) and 49 CFR 501.8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: September 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSE CALLS IN L.A. SKY DIP BY 47%;  </P> <P> AIR SAFETY: BY CONTRAST, THE NUMBER OF NEAR COLLISIONS OVER ORANGE COUNTY  INCREASED 125% IN THE FIRST 10 MONTHS OF 1989.  </P> <P> While Orange County experienced a 125% increase in pilot-reported near  collisions in 1989, the skies above Los Angeles County saw a sharp drop in such  incidents, according to Federal Aviation Administration documents.  </P> <P> The computerized list showed that pilots reported 18 near midair collisions in  the skies over Orange County through Nov. 5, 1989, up from eight during all of  1988.  </P> <P> By contrast, the number of near midair collisions in Los Angeles County  declined from 36 incidents during the first 10 months of 1988 to 19 during the  same period in 1989 -- a 47% decrease, according to FAA reports obtained by The  Times.  </P> <P> Bill Williams, manager of the Flight Standards Division of the FAA's Western  Pacific Region, attributed the drop in Los Angeles County to an intensive  education program for both professional and private pilots and the adoption of  new visual flight rule charts.  </P> <P> "We talked to air carrier pilots about where they are likely to find general  aviation operations," Williams said. "And, we talked to general aviation pilots  about where they can expect air carrier operations."  </P> <P> Also, he said new charts -- adopted recently -- clearly show private pilots the  routes to use in flying into the Los Angeles Basin. Previous charts were  complicated by flight information showing general aviation pilots where they  should not fly.  </P> <P> The FAA list was compiled by the Office of Safety Analysis in Washington.  </P> <P> It showed that, statewide, the number of incidents reported by pilots dropped  36.5%, from 170 in all of 1988 to 108 through Nov. 5, 1989. The data for the  period after Nov. 5, will not be available until next week, but it is unlikely  to change the established pattern, FAA officials said. Referring to the  dramatic increase reported for Orange County, a veteran airline pilot said  there are simply too many additional aircraft using the air space each year.  </P> <P> "You have all of the ingredients for a tremendous number of midair collisions,"  said Dick Russell, a veteran airline pilot who serves on the safety committee  of the Washington-based Air Line Pilots Assn.  </P> <P> Russell said the number of near midair collisions is vasty understated because  pilots do not report all of them.  </P> <P> But other pilots and air traffic controllers said the increase in near midair  collisions is puzzling because their personal experience suggested that  incidents were declining. They also cautioned that the public should not view  the numbers literally, because the number of reported near midair collisions  often swings substantially from year to year.  </P> <P> For example, pilots reported 28 near midair collisions over Orange County in  1987, but only 17 in 1986.  </P> <P> Many of the incidents have not been verified, FAA officials said, because the  second aircraft involved could not be identified and the pilot of that plane  was not interviewed.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, the FAA reported 10 near midair collisions in 1988. Four  of those involved military aircraft, including sophisticated F-16 Navy  fighters. The county has several Navy and Marine airfields, including the famed  Top Gun fighter pilot's school at Miramar Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> Figures available for the first 11 months of 1989 show a 50% reduction in  reported incidents. According to FAA figures, four of the five near misses  reported during that period involved military aircraft, including a June 15  incident in which a KC-135 tanker came within 2,550 feet of a DC-10 passenger  jet, while flying at 28,000 feet.  </P> <P> Bob Vaughn, air traffic manager for San Diego terminal approach radar control  (TRACON), credits the relatively small number of incidents in the county to a  tough policy that requires approaching aircraft to get clearance from air  traffic controllers before they can venture into local airspace.  </P> <P> The San Diego policy uses a tactical control area (TCA). Orange County did not  have a similar policy until this month, when air traffic controllers instituted  the airport radar service area (ARSA), Vaughn said.  </P> <P> "Under TCA, entry into airspace requires air traffic control authorization,"  Vaughn said. "The TCA uses more stringent separation criteria for airplanes. .  . . I don't really know that we did anything different in 1989, other than we  also have a very active pilot education program."  </P> <P> Some officials cast doubt on the validity of the data.  </P> <P> "I don't really have an explanation for the reported increase," said James H.  Panter, air traffic manager at the Coast Terminal Approach Radar Control Center  in El Toro. That center handles aircraft in the Orange County-Long Beach area.  "Nor, by the way, does it sound correct. I haven't noticed any significant  increases."  </P> <P> Panter said the number of pilot reports varies year to year in part because  sometimes pilots are more prone to notify the FAA during a major safety push,  or right after a disaster such as the Cerritos air crash in 1986.  </P> <P> "Many near midair collisions aren't really what they seem to be," Panter said.  "If two pilots flying under visual flight rules come close together but one  avoids the other, they did exactly what they were supposed to do and nothing  happened."  </P> <P> In many instances of reported near misses, Panter added, one pilot's subjective  view of how close the two aircraft came together is all the FAA has to go on.  Many aircraft flying under visual flight rules are not in contact with air  traffic controllers, he said, and thus cannot even be warned that they are too  close together.  </P> <P> "We don't know what (radio) frequency they're on, and unless they have a  transponder, we don't know their altitude either," Panter said.  </P> <P> He said the FAA uses the near midair collision data by placing red pins on a  map to show areas that seem to have clusters of incidents. Such clusters, he  said, may indicate the need for an air safety meeting to advise pilots of a  particular problem.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, it's hard to get a handle on this data," Panter said. "It should  not be taken literally."  </P> <P> Randy Moore, an air traffic controller at the Coast Radar Control Center and  immediate past president of the local National Air Traffic Controllers Assn.  chapter, said the increase reported for Orange County skies may be a result of  airline pilots campaigning for creation of a new safety zone around John Wayne  Airport that was put into effect earlier this month.  </P> <P> "Those figures just support the ARSA (airport radar service area)," Moore  said."  </P> <P> Moore said the controllers' group would like to see a terminal control area  covering Orange County and requiring pilots to obtain entry permission from an  air traffic controller.  </P> <P> "We've done some figuring, and as far as the (controllers') union goes, we feel  if we had a TCA it would cut down 94% of the near midair collisions."  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board last year issued a report strongly  critical of the Coast Radar Control Center for being understaffed and using  outmoded equipment and facilities.  </P> <P> The FAA, however, disputed the findings and pointed to several improvements  that had been made at the facility and a recruitment program that has been  attracting additional controllers.  </P> <P> In 1994, the Coast Radar Control Center is scheduled to be merged into a new  facility near San Diego that will handle the entire Southern California area.  </P> <P> Last July, officials of the federal General Accounting Office reported that the  skies above Orange County ranked seventh in the nation in near midair  collisions involving air carriers during the previous three years.  </P> <P> Panter -- who flies a small Cessna -- said that the Coast Radar Control Center  has been handling record numbers of aircraft flights -- about 2,000 a day,  about double the workload of five years ago, but he said that not all of the  increase is due to air carriers, which must stay in contact with his facility.  </P> <P> Still, Michael C. Church, president of the Orange County Airport Assn., an  influential pilots' group, questioned whether the increase in incidents  reported for Orange County between 1988 and 1989 might not be heavily  influenced by numbers of air carrier operations and the subjective nature of  such incident reports.  </P> <P> Church, a flight instructor at John Wayne Airport, said that pilot reports are  based much more "on opinion than actual fact."  </P> <P> The statistics should be used to educate pilots about problem areas, he said,  but not for more restrictive measures that may be merely good public relations  gestures.  </P> <P> Times staff writers John Kendall in Los Angeles and H. G. Reza in San Diego  contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REPORTED NEAR-COLLISIONS  </P> <P>  Chart shows the number of aircraft near-collisions reported by pilots for  years indicated.

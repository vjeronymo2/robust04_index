			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Portugal replaces bank chief: Appointment of minister as new governor raises suspicion The governor of the Bank of Portugal was yesterday replaced with a junior government minister, casting doubt on the central bank's independence and the future of monetary policy. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, accepted the resignation of Mr Miguel Beleza and replaced him with Mr Antonio de Sousa, who was secretary of state for finance. The resignations of two vice-governors and a director of the bank were also accepted. Mr Beleza, a former finance minister in the centre-right government, had directed a firm defence of the exchange-rate stability of the escudo since he was appointed governor of the central bank in March 1992. But his policy began to be undermined by a government pressing for lower interest rates to help stimulate recovery from recession. Although the government has expressed support for a stable escudo, Mr Beleza's resignation had been expected as a result of growing tension over monetary policy between the central bank and the government and within the Bank of Portugal itself. Over the past three months, the apparent contradiction between the government's commitment to both a firm currency and lower interest rates has led to a wave of attacks against the escudo by speculators expecting a realignment of the currency. Contrary to the prime minister's forecast in April that Portugal's main money market rates would fall two points this year, Mr Beleza's defence of the currency has forced rates up several points and banks have raised their lending rates. Earlier this week, Mr Cavaco Silva strongly defended the stability of the escudo and said the speculators would be beaten. Mr Joao Costa Pinto, one of the new vice-governors of the Bank of Portugal, said yesterday that nothing would change in regard to the bank's exchange rate policy. But Mr de Sousa, who has been in charge of Portugal's privatisation programme and is a close ally of the prime minister, is widely known to support lower interest rates. The incompatibility of this position with a commitment to maintaining exchange rate stability caused uncertainty on Portugal's foreign exchange and money markets yesterday. The escudo strengthened to Es103.4 to the D-Mark from 103.6 on Wednesday after the central bank intervened by buying escudos at 103.5 and 103.6. 'We expect Mr de Sousa will allow the escudo to slip a little despite the government's statements,' said Mr Rui Ferreira, a director of Banco Finantia. Mr Antonio Borges, a former vice-governor of the Bank of Portugal, who resigned last year because of disagreements with the government, said yesterday that the appointment of the new governor would clearly strengthen government influence over the central bank. Mr Borges joined opposition parties in saying the government was reversing a long process of increasing the bank's independence and was at odds with European Union efforts to diminish government influence over central banks.</p>

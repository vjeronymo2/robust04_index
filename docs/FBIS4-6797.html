			<p>BFN     [Text] AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of  Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo T. Enrile yesterday named three veteran  Mindanao campaigners to sensitive military posts signalling a  revamp in the military establishments.    Army Brig. Gen. Jocelyn Nazareno, Camp Aguinaldo commander  and former 602 Brigade commander based in Maguindanao, was  designated as the new deputy AFP chief of staff for civilian  military operation.    Army Brig. Gen. Victor Lapus, chief of the AFP training  command based in Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal, was appointed as  the new deputy AFP chief of staff for operations.    Another Mindanao campaigner, Col. Angelo Reyes, chief of the  603 Brigade based in Davao City, was appointed as the new chief  of the AFP Civil Relations Service [AFP/CRS].    Nazareno replaced Brig. Romeo Padiernos who was named chief  of the Army's 5th Infantry Division based in Gamu, Isabela.    Col. Reyes replaced Brig. Gen.

Danilo Olay, who was  appointed as the new chief of the Army's 8th Infantry Division  based in Samar.    Lt.

Major General Orlando  Soriano of Northern Luzon Command [Nolcom] was also earlier  appointed as chief of the AFP Southern Command [Southcom] based  in Zamboanga City.    Soriano replaced Lt. Gen.

General Ruperto Ambil of the 8th Infantry Division  was named General Yap's replacement at the AFP Visayas Command  based in Cebu City.    Brig. Gen. Edgardo Batenga, who came from the Army's 5th  Infantry Division, took over as General Soriano's replacement at  the Nolcom.</p>

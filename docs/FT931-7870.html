			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (8): Security now a selling point - How crime is distorting the new car market UK motorists are more than twice as likely to suffer from car crime than they were 13 years ago when the Conservatives came to power, according to Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman. He says that each year one in five drivers will either have their cars stolen or broken into, writes Martin Derrick. The Home Office response is that its Car Crime Prevention Year has an advertising and promotional budget of Pounds 5m and that during the first three months of the campaign, car thefts were down 7 per cent. Leaving aside the political point-scoring, the fact remains that car crime is at epidemic levels - so much so that it now distorts the new car market. Insurers are either refusing to cover or demanding massive premiums for the high performance cars that seem to be the major targets. The result has been a significant fall in demand for hot hatchbacks and CT models, both new and used. The government's response is primarily that it is up to the motor manufacturers to provide better in-car security measures, and the efforts of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association over the past five years to persuade manufacturers to do just that are finally bearing real fruit. The BVRLA instituted an annual anti-theft award in 1989 and in the first two years it went to Vauxhall, the only volume producer to take the subject at all seriously at that time. No award was made in 1991, but a well-deserved winner last year was Rover for the highly sophisticated measures - including a standard ultrasonic alarm system - on the revised Rover 800 Series cars. Happily, the BVRLA judges are going to have their work cut out to decide on the 1993 recipient, because virtually all major manufacturers have now b e e n p e r s u a d e d t h at security is an important selling point and that the cost of providing improved protection is outweighed by the commercial benefits. Rover is likely to be a front- runner again since it has launched the 200 Coupe range, fitted with the same infra-red central door locking and ultrasonic alarm system as the larger 800. Even more pointedly, it has fitted as standard all Metros for the 1993 model year with an immobilising system - the first time any volume manufacturer has done so at the lower end of the market. And although it will not discuss future products, a new 600 Series will be launched in the spring and it is reasonable to speculate that this model will incorporate advanced security measures. Similarly, what Ford expects to be its biggest-selling fleet car, the Mondeo, which is launched in March to replace the Sierra, features a visible VlN number, high security door locks operated by sleeved cables and shielded from attack by protective steel plates between the two door skins, and an optional deadlocking system combined with an anti-theft alarm which also immobilises the starter motor. A state-of-the-art protection system is standard on the ultra-high performance Ford Escort RS Cosworth which involves not just deadlocking and alarms but also a Vecta immobilisation system that requires a second electronic key to disarm it. Vauxhall, like Rover, is now bringing improved anti-theft measures to the lower end of the market with deadlocks available on all models in the new Corsa range which goes on sale in April. A security alarm and engine immobiliser is also standard on 65-versions and optional on all other models. Porsche has just launched an approved Anti-Theft immobiliser system which, like the Escort Cosworth's, requires a high security microchip key to be fitted into a dashboard housing before the car will start. Porsche claims that with over 35bn key combinations, no two codes will ever be the same and as a result Norwich Union is offering an insurance discount to customers who have the immobiliser fitted to their Porsches. In many ways it is insurance companies which stand to benefit most from improved vehicle security and this is why Mr Derick Perkins of Fleet Management Services says they should do more to contribute towards research to help manufacturers improve the security of vehicles: 'Total vehicle security is still a long way off and needs considerable research before manufacturers are in a position to know how to deal with the problem effectively,' he says. Perhaps long-term, research being undertaken by Ford will provide the answer to car theft. Its proposed 'Star Wars' system uses satellite technology to pick up signals sent out by the electronic engine management system of the car in the event of theft. A signal is then sent back from the satellite which stops the engine, applies the brakes and triggers an alarm. Combined with the sort of location system already used by Datatrak to follow high-security trucks and vans, it could also alert police to the exact position of the car.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cut in bad debt costs helps lift Australian bank Commonwealth Bank of Australia, one of Australia's 'big four' banks and now partially privatised by the federal government, yesterday announced a profit after tax of ADollars 682.1m (USDollars 507.9m) in the year to end-June. This compares with ADollars 443.1m in 1992-93. Earnings per share rose to 76.9 cents from 51.7 cent, while the final dividend goes up to 36 cents from 22 cents. The 1992-93 figure was reached after a net abnormal charge of ADollars 136.7m. There were no abnormals in the latest year. During the 12-month period, CBA's total operating income fell by around 2.5 per cent to ADollars 4.26bn. However, this was offset by a substantial reduction in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. The charge for bad and doubtful debts fell by almost a third, to ADollars 320.7m. CBA's operating expenses were also 2.4 per cent lower at ADollars 2.84bn. The company said this reflected an internal reorganisation programme, which had already reduced staff numbers to 37,269, compared with 42,329 a year ago. Further 'orderly reductions' are expected as the branch restructuring continues into 1995. The contribution of the core banking operations to group profit rose to ADollars 536.8m from ADollars 502.5m, while the financial services division saw a much sharper jump, to ADollars 46.5m compared with ADollars 18.6m previously. The Commonwealth Development Bank business turned in a profit of ADollars 39.5m, compared with a loss last time of ADollars 11.7m, blamed on bad debt expenses. Meanwhile, ASB Bank in New Zealand saw an 18.1 per cent increase in profits to NZDollars 45.5m (USDollars 27.4m). CBA said it was looking for further earnings growth in 1994-95, as lending volumes picked up on the back of increased domestic economic activity. However, it claimed that the 'intensely competitive nature of the industry' could hamper progress.</p>

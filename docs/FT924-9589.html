			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: RBC to set aside extra CDollars 900m for provisions ROYAL Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, is almost doubling its 1992 loan loss provisions to reflect unexpectedly heavy write-downs on its real estate portfolio and other corporate loans to customers in the Toronto area. The additional provisions and a one-time restructuring charge will slash the bank's net earnings for fiscal 1992 to about CDollars 100m (USDollars 83m), down from CDollars 983m in 1991. The bank said it was setting aside an extra CDollars 900m in provisions for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992, which ended on October 31. This would raise provisions for the year to CDollars 2.1bn, from an earlier estimate of CDollars 1.2bn. Restructuring costs of CDollars 130m will also be charged against income. These charges will result in a fourth-quarter loss of about CDollars 480m, or CDollars 1.65 per share. The bank said more than half the additional write-down applied to 'a number of accounts' in the commercial real estate industry. Earlier this year, RBC added CDollars 300m to its loan-loss reserves, largely to cover expected losses from CDollars 780m exposure to Olympia &amp; York. But this was offset by an identical reversal in earlier provisions on third world loans. RBC said the remaining write-downs were concentrated among corporate customers around Toronto, which has been among the hardest-hit parts of Canada during the recession. Non-performing loans on October 31 totalled about CDollars 3.7bn, a CDollars 500m increase from three months earlier. The bank said it had classified as non-accrual accounts those which are still servicing their debts but which may run into difficulty later on. RBC said it expected to maintain its dividend and its capital ratios remained well above regulatory requirements. It added that problems were confined to its corporate loan portfolio while its retail, treasury and securities businesses were performing strongly.</p>

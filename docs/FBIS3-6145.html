			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Minister of Justice Oetojo Oesman, SH [Master of  Laws], confirmed that the government has not issued a permit  allowing the Indonesian Legal Aid Society (LBH) to visit the  convict Jose Alexandre Xanana Gusmao. The government, in  particular the Department of Justice, would like to know exactly  why the LBH is interested in visiting the prisoner.    Minister of Justice Oetojo Oesman made this statement in  response to questions from the press in Sukabumi on Thursday (3  February). The press asked about the decision to postpone the  visit to Xanana and about letters from the Indonesian Legal Aid  Society requesting permission to see Xanana at the Cipinang  Penitentiary.    As has been reported, the YLBHI [Indonesian Legal Aid  Society] wrote Prof Dr Baharuddin Lopa, SH, Director General of  Prisons, two times asking for permission to meet with Xanana in  Cipinang. Dr Adnan Buyung Nasution, SH, chairman of the YLBHI,  sent the first letter several weeks ago, after first submitting  a verbal request. Since there was no response to the verbal and  written requests, Buyung then wrote to Director General Lopa  again asking when his group could meet with Xanana Gusmao. The  letter, written on YLBHI letter-head, was signed by Adnan Buyung  Nasution, Chairman of YLBHI's Executive Board, and by Secretary  Frans Hendra Winarta, SH. "But since we haven't gotten an answer  we wrote him again," said Frans.    Minister of Justice Oetojo said that it would be prudent to  see these problems from the proper perspective considering the  judicial regulations involved; the question is who is allowed to  deal with or visit the inmate, for example, because that is a  matter of judicial regulations. In general, only family members,  close friends and attorneys handling the case are allowed to  visit an inmate in the penitentiary.    It would also be a good thing to ask why the LBH is  interested in visiting Xanana. Do they just want to see how  Xanana is doing or do they have some direct interest in the case  or not. "Meaning, it's OK for LBH to go see Xanana Gusmao, but  what do they want to see?" he asked.    If, for example, Oetojo continued, they want to ask whether  Jose Xanana Gusmao's trial was valid or not, or if they want to  ask whether there were any judicial errors made during his  trial, clearly they will not be given permission. Because  Xanana's trial is over, the results are in force; it has the  permanent force of law and can no longer be questioned from a  judicial point of view. Moreover, as we know, Xanana submitted a  request for clemency (a request for forgiveness) to the  president. The president accepted this request for clemency and  he commuted Xanana Gusmao's original life sentence to twenty  years in prison.    So, Oetojo said, the Department of Justice will decide  whether YLBHI's request falls into one of the categories just  mentioned. If they just want to visit, that's OK, but what's  their direct interest in the matter, Oetojo asked.    The press asked why two special envoys from the UN Secretary  General were allowed to visit Xanana Gusmao. When they made  their visit on Monday, 24 January, the policy of postponing  visits to Xanana was still in effect (up to 9 February -  editor)--and yet now the LBH is not given permission. Oetojo  said the situations were different.    Oetojo said that the visit made by the two special envoys  from the UN Secretary General had been planned long ago and had  been programmed far in advance. In addition, the two envoys,  Francesc [as published] Vendrell and Tamrat Samuel, had not only  visited Xanana Gusmao but had also looked at general conditions  in the Cipinang Penitentiary and had visited other inmates.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEPPER'S VISION, ENERGY, LEGACY ARE PRAISED IN CAPITOL CEREMONY  </P> <P> Lines of tearful friends and relatives wound through the Capitol on Thursday to  bid farewell to Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), whose body lay in state in the  Rotunda.  </P> <P> "Claude Pepper's death marks the passing of an era in American history," said  Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine at a Rotunda ceremony. "His  energy and his vision will be sorely missed."  </P> <P> Pepper, who died Tuesday at 88 of stomach cancer, was to lie in state in the  Rotunda until noon today. Only 26 other Americans have been so honored.  </P> <P> "Claude Pepper was a man of his time but he was also a man ahead of his time,"  Mitchell said. "Millions will lead more full, healthy and meaningful lives  because of his efforts."  </P> <P> "Many will never know his name, but it is in their behalf that we say thank  you," Mitchell said. "His legacy remains as vibrant as he was."  </P> <P> Pepper, a tenacious New Dealer who began his political career in 1937, served  14 years in the Senate. He was defeated in 1950, and after 12 years in private  life he returned to Capitol Hill to begin a celebrated career in the House.  </P> <P> When he died, Pepper was not only the oldest member of Congress, but the only  member in either chamber who served during the New Deal of the 1930s.  </P> <P> In his later years, Pepper was beloved by senior citizens for his determined  efforts on their behalf.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle told the gathering in the Rotunda that Pepper "taught  us about how to make a difference in the world. He never lost faith that things  could or would get better."  </P> <P> Pepper's flag-draped coffin was brought into the Rotunda by six military  pallbearers and placed on a black-draped wooden catafalque first used to bear  Abraham Lincoln's body in 1865.  </P> <P> The Rotunda then was cleared of family, guests and reporters while attendants  opened the coffin. Guests were ushered back in and the ceremony began.  </P> <P> Dozens of friends, longtime aides, senators, House members and admirers filled  the Rotunda to honor Pepper and filed past his coffin after the speeches and  prayers.  </P> <P> After the lying in state, Pepper's body will be flown to Miami for services  Sunday in the district he represented in the House for 26 years.  </P> <P> His body will lie in state later Sunday in the Rotunda of the old Florida  Capitol in Tallahassee and will be buried in that city Monday next to his wife,  Mildred, who died in 1979.  </P></p>

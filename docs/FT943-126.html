			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica cuts first-half loss Finmeccanica, Italy's state-controlled engineering group, managed to cut its first half loss to L146bn (Dollars 59.32m) from L160bn, but warned yesterday that the second half would be 'demanding'. The company said it had not felt the full impact of gradual economic recovery because it operated in sectors like space and defence, which depend on large public investment projects, although it added that certain subsidiaries - such as the automation operations - had reported much better results. Overall turnover grew to L4,827bn from L4,696bn in the equivalent period, and the operating profit nearly doubled to L110bn from L57bn. The company attributed the increase to the benefits of continuing rationalisation. Net debt fell to L5,882bn at June 30, compared with L6,311bn a year earlier, and financial charges were cut to L152bn (L190bn). Parmalat, the Italian dairy products group, increased consolidated pre-tax profits in the first half of this year to L75bn, from L55bn in the first six months of 1993.</p>

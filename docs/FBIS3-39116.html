			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Karl-Ludwig </F> Guensche; place and date not given: "Kinkel: Yeltsin Must Take  Certain Things Into Consideration"]    [Text] [Guensche] Minister, the characteristic feature of  Germany's Russia policy is the motto "massive aid to strengthen  the reformers." Has this policy not failed?    [Kinkel] Certainly not. There is no alternative to this  policy. To support the reform forces is not only Germany's  policy but all significant countries pursue the same course.  What we must achieve in Russia is that the developments toward  law-governed and market-economy structures become irreversible,  and that the revolutionary process comes to a standstill -- or,  at least, to a consolidation so that this huge, important  country can embark on quieter tracks.    [Guensche] The figureheads among the reformers have  abandoned ship....    [Kinkel] That is not quite true either. You are obviously  alluding to Gaydar and Federov. It is true that the resignation  of the two men was not a good signal because both had a good  reputation in the West, for example at the IMF, the World Bank,  among economic experts, and because one thought that they would  be capable of implementing the necessary economic reforms that  are so decisive for the political success of the Russian  reforms. Yet, the real figurehead for the Russian reforms is  President Yeltsin.    [Guensche] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has spoken of the end  of the market romanticism....    [Kinkel] Some of Mr. Chernomyrdin's recent remarks, if he  really made them in the way they were received outside, were  indeed somewhat irritating. Still, I think that he supports  Yeltsin's policy.    [Guensche] Mr. Illrionov, Chernomyrdin's economic adviser,  has given up this week. Are all these events not serious  warning signals?    [Kinkel] Yes, they are warning signals. However, could  anybody really expect the enormously difficult Russian  transformation process from dictatorship to democracy, from  total controlled economy to the market economy to have taken  place rapidly and without any problems? My answer is: no.  Problems, adjustments, setbacks were bound to occur. Still,  this must not influence our policy of support for the reform  forces. I repeat that I do not see any alternative to this  policy.    [Guensche] Is it not also a warning sign when President  Yeltsin announces that he would defend more strongly the  interests of the 25 million Russians living in the "immediate  neighborhood," that is to say in the former Soviet republics?    [Kinkel] Yeltsin is under pressure from the conservatives  and extremists. He must take certain things into consideration.  What you are referring to is not nice and must neither be  belittled nor dramatized.    [Guensche] Your counterpart, Kozyrev, claims a protective  function for Russia in the Baltics, and has spoken of Russia's  "special role" on the territory of the old Soviet Union. Does  this not point to a U-turn in the former position?    [Kinkel] Russia's relations with the Baltic countries are  particularly sensitive as a result of the minority problems, the  issue of the withdrawal of Russian forces, and the somewhat  unfortunate legal regulations for Russians living in the Baltic  countries. Still, we must not accept Russia's claims of  hegemony.    [Guensche] Is this not exactly what we did in the case of  the NATO decision?    [Kinkel] No, we have always said -- and I am doing it again  -- that Russia cannot claim a veto right regarding the getting  closer to NATO or membership of Central and East European  reformist countries. Nevertheless, it is also in the interest  of those countries that, by creating a new European security  architecture, we avoid opening up new gulfs between Russia, the  CIS countries, and the Central and East European countries.    [Guensche] Do you not sometimes get the feeling that Russia  is trying to resuscitate the old Soviet Union in a new form?    [Kinkel] I am building on the success of the reform forces,  who do not want that. Once again: One cannot be happy about  some tendencies that began to emerge recently. The success of  the extremists in the election is not something, either, that  would strengthen confidence in this large and important country.  Still, we must not lose patience and not expect too much too  rapidly.    [Guensche] How reliable is Yeltsin for you as a partner?    [Kinkel] Yeltsin personifies and articulates the reform  forces. We are banking on him and we hope that Yeltsin will  hold his own, which is why we support him.    [Guensche] Even people close to Yeltsin admit that the  president is ill. Do you have any information on how ill he is?    [Kinkel] No.    [Guensche] What is your very personal prediction for the  developments in Russia?    [Kinkel] I am hopeful that things will turn out well. We  want to contribute everything we can to it.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Chapter XXIV will be added the OCC Rules to accommodate FX Index Options. FX Index Options will be exercised pursuant to the rules governing existing index options. Accordingly, the rules governing exercise, assignment, allocation, and the exercise settlement date from Chapter XVIII, which pertains to index options, will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. In addition, the settlement procedure for FX Index Options will be the same as the procedure for existing index options. Exercised FX Index Options will be settled through the payment of an exercise settlement amount, which is the difference between the aggregate exercise price and the aggregate current index value. Accordingly, the rules governing exercise settlement and the exercise settlement date from Chapter XVIII will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. Because FX Index Options will settle in a foreign currency, certain settlement obligations of a party to a FX Index Option contract will be similar to the settlement obligations of a party to a cross-rate foreign currency option contract. Therefore, certain rules governing settlement obligations from Chapter XXI, which pertains to cross-rate foreign currency options, will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV. Specifically, these include the obligation to set up bank accounts and the consequence of failing to pay a foreign currency. Finally, FX Index Options will be margined like cross-rate foreign currency options in that the margin requirement will be calculated in the applicable trading currency and then converted to United States dollars. Consequently, the language of Rule 2111 governing margin requirements for cross-rate foreign currency options will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two additional changes to the OCC By-Laws and an additional change to OCC's Rules also will be made. Specifically, the term ``FX index option clearing member'' will be added to the definition of ``clearing member'' in Article I, Section 1 of the By-Laws. In addition, the reference to the term ``FLEX'' in the definition of clearing member will be changed to ``flexibly structured option'' in order to make that term more generic. Finally, OCC Rule 401 will be amended to require that the currency in which the option is denominated, the expiration date of the option contract as opposed to the month, and the cap price, if any, be included in the Report of Matched Trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act because it provides for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in flexibly structured index options denominated in a foreign currency and because it provides for the safeguarding of related securities and funds. The proposed rule change meets such requirements by establishing a framework in which existing OCC systems, rules, and procedures are extended to the processing of the new FX Index Options. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

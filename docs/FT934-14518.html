			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Malawi gets ready for life without Banda: The background to reform ONE OF Africa's most extraordinary political careers came in effect to an unheralded end this week. Without fanfare, and in accordance with the constitution, executive power passed from the hands of Malawi's President Hastings Kamuzu Banda to a triumvirate drawn from the ranks of the ruling Malawi Congress party. Dr Banda, who has presided over the country's fortunes since independence in 1964, is convalescing after brain surgery in a South African clinic, and unlikely to make a political comeback. But the reforms he reluctantly set in train now have a momentum of their own. The country's transition from one-party rule to multi-party democracy, which began last June when a substantial majority voted in a referendum to end single-party rule, looks set to end in a general election next May. Campaigning has yet to get formally under way, but the ruling party could well retain office through a combination of shrewd tactics and a divided opposition. The former is illustrated by the party's choice for chairman of the triumvirate: Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, a former cabinet minister, who came out of prison in July after serving 13 years' hard labour for sedition. That he should now be willing to lead the party which locked him up, followed by a brief spell with the opposition United Democratic Front, may be seen as opportunistic or pragmatic. It certainly took the opposition by surprise. A party stalwart, Mr John Tembo, is also in the new triumvirate, the closest minister to Mr Banda in recent years and long tipped as his successor. But Mr Tembo appears to have moved with the times. Few now think he will try to roll back the democratisation process that has been urged on Malawi by the international community. The government has so far honoured its pledge to work with opposition parties, represented on a National Consultative Council on which they hold a majority, towards general elections. The current issue for the Congress party is not how to prevent political pluralism but how to survive within it; and the indications are that the party may yet have a political future despite a distinctly mixed past, with a moderate to good record on economic management and a very poor one on human rights. Impoverished at independence, the country remains poor, with a per capita GNP of Dollars 160 (Pounds 106), among the lowest in the world, reflected in bad health and social indicators. However, none of the economic challenges ahead have been seriously addressed by Malawi's new and vociferous political classes, partly because they recognise the constraints that will limit the policy choices of whoever is in power. Thus a round of strikes last month in pursuit of pay claims, many in excess of 100 per cent, passed almost without comment from Mr Chakufwa Chihana, leader of the Alliance for Democracy (Aford), or Mr Bakili Muluzi of the rival United Democratic Front. There is, it seems, a tacit agreement with the government that the country cannot afford the inflationary pressure of wage settlements. Instead, the main opposition groups prefer to keep attention focused on their rival claims to be the most effective guarantors of human rights and democracy. Aford perhaps has the moral edge in the display of democratic credentials. Mr Chihana has a trade union background and has thrice been imprisoned by the Banda regime, whereas Mr Muluzi is a former cabinet minister and secretary general of the Congress party. UDF, however, has more evident support in the business community, more funds and better organisation, and is better able to present itself as a serious contender for government. Both parties accept the broad terms of structural adjustment in progress in Malawi since the late 1980s and are resigned to funding any new social or productive programmes from rationalisation of existing government expenditure. Two much smaller opposition parties, the Malawi Democratic party and the United Front for Multiparty Democracy, are hoping to pick up refugees from the larger groups. With little of substance yet to distinguish the main opposition contenders, the clearest difference for most Malawians is their regional affiliation. Aford's support lies predominantly in the north, UDF's in the south. Mr Chihana and Mr Muluzi both aspire to address the whole country, but the vaguer they are about what they stand for, the greater the perception of regionalism becomes. If this trend is consolidated, the Malawi Congress party may yet retain support in the central region, with which it is primarily identified, or even manage to project itself as the most truly national of the contenders for power in the elections scheduled for May.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 1 (XINHUA) -- Starting today,  China has replaced the two-tiered foreign exchange rate system  with a single, controlled floating rate system based on market  demand and supply.    This marks an important step in the country's advance  towards  a market economy.    Reform of the foreign exchange system, announced by the  People's Bank of China, is to unfold in the following aspects:    To buy and sell foreign currencies through banks, with a  standardized and unified inter-bank foreign exchange market  established, while gradually phasing out the swap markets which  are currently in operation;    To cancel the exchange retainment and delivery systems  practiced by Chinese enterprises, as well as the mandatory  allocation of foreign exchanges.    The state will no longer issue foreign exchange certificates  (FEC) and ban the circulation of foreign currencies in the  domestic market at the same time.    From now on, the state will regulate the foreign exchange  market mainly through economic and legal measures, to achieve  the balance of international current account.    The Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth National  Congress  of the Chinese Communist Party decided to speed up the financial  reform which is deemed to be one of the important parts of the  economic reform.    However, the success of the financial reform hinges on the  on- going reform of the foreign exchange system.    The dual-rate foreign exchange system, or the co-existence  of  the official rate and a swap market rate, have many drawbacks  which have hindered the development of China's foreign trade and  foreign investment.    The original dual-rate system was difficult to manage and  supervise. Moreover, it bred corruption.    The reform will exert positive influence on many aspects,  especially on China's further opening to the outside world. It  will help attract more foreign investment, enhance efficiency in  the use of foreign funds, and facilitate the flow of capital.    By the end of 1992, a total of 100 billion U.S. dollars had  flowed into China, equivalent to over 800 billion Chinese yuan.    The figure was far more than the total amount of stocks and  bonds the country issued for the same period, which stood at  over 500 billion yuan.    The reform will also make foreign exchange more available to  Chinese enterprises. With necessary documentation, they will be  able to buy hard currencies from the banks at any time.    It is also beneficial to foreign investors, as they can  register their capital and remit their profits at the same  exchange rate.    The reform of the foreign exchange system is beneficial to  the resumption of China's status as a signatory of GATT, the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    China should, among others, abide by the GATT regulations on  exchange rates, for the country's re-entry into the  international trade system.    The unification of the exchange rates has paved the way for  China's goal of making the Renminbi a freely convertible  currency and eventually keep it in line with the international  markets.    However, economists here said that there remained a lot of  things to do to replace the old system with a new one which is  still embryonic.    The authorities will resort to economic and legal measures  to  realize their macro-economic regulations on foreign currencies  and international current accounts and avoid fluctuations of  exchange rates to ensure the continuous, speedy and healthy  development of the country's economy.</p>

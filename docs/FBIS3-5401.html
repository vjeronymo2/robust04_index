"The Kim Yong-sam group is dumping into the sea a fabulous  amount of radioactive substances which destroy the natural  ecosystem and inflict fatal damages on human body," he noted,  and went on:    "Such act shows that they are, indeed, an enemy of the  nation  who is clean indifferent to the existence of the 70 million  fellow countrymen, and international criminals who pay no heed  to the importance of the international natural ecosystem.    "The nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam group is not  unrelated to the nuclear development stepped up in secrecy in  South Korea. One of the purposes sought by them in their  malicious anti-DPRK row over the fictitious `nuclear issue' is  to conceal their nuclear development programme.    "With the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, the nation cannot  evade a nuclear holocaust.    "Hanminjon will get firmly united with the patriotic-minded  people of various strata in South Korea and wage a vigorous  anti-war, anti-nuke movement and force the bellicose group of  Kim Yong-sam, a despicable nuclear war servant, out of power."</p>

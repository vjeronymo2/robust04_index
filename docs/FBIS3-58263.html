The  neocentrists immediately seized this opportunity to argue again  the "need" for a grand alliance comprising the nonconfessional  groups, the DC [Christian Democratic Party], the League, and  Silvio Berlusconi.    To underline the significance of their demand, all the  group's leaders have entered the arena -- Pierferdinando Casini,  Francesco D'Onofrio, Clemente Mastella, Franco Fausti, Sandro  Fontana, Ombretta Fumagalli-Carulli, and Silvio Lega signed a  joint statement yesterday. In it they told Martinazzoli that  "Christian Democrats must be clearly aware of the nature of a  conflict that cannot be resolved by means of appeals -- though  we consider them praiseworthy and sincere -- but only on the  basis of a real and proper political clarification."    This "political clarification" concerns the policy of  alliances of the DC and of the future People's Party. Hitherto  Martinazzoli has always said that the League and Berlusconi are  not possible allies and that Mario Segni remains the only  reference point.    Now the "neocentrists" are reading with satisfaction the  interview with Umberto Bossi published by IL GIORNALE yesterday  in which the League leader says: "We have realized that our  interlocutors are not yet ready for federalism, so we are  scaling down our demands." Translated, this means that the  League is afraid of the progressive alignment and will content  itself with regionalism as long as Occhetto can be defeated.    This remark prompted the "neocentrists" to say: "The League  leader must begin a revision on the topics of national unity,  democracy, and an end to North-South discrimination. These are  some of the demands made by Christian Democratic `neocentrists'  and by those, such as Buttiglione, who have no prejudices  against sitting down at a common table to draw up a moderate,  liberal-democratic cartel."    The next step was a logical one -- another ultimatum to  Martinazzoli. The neocentrists wrote: "This, and no other, is  the only path capable of preventing Occhetto's victory.  Martinazzoli must make it clear whether -- as Rosy Bindi,  Mattarella, and Elia say -- there is on the part of the People's  Party a predetermined rejection of an accord with the  nonconfessional groups, Berlusconi, and the League."    Rosy Bindi responded to this from Padua, urging DC  Chairwoman  Rosa Russo Jervolino to "take the legal steps to dissolve the  party" so that on 18 January the National Council can officially  announce the birth of the People's Party.    Venice's "pasionaria" went on to demand once more that the  People's Party include as few representatives as possible of the  "buried party." Therefore, she said, it is better that all  outgoing members of parliament stand aside and forego standing  as candidates in the coming elections. This appeal, addressed  for the present to deputies and senators of the Venice region,  was made official yesterday at the meeting held in Padua to  appoint the coordinators for the People's Party in the Venice  region.    These 111 "musketeers" will choose the candidates for the  coming elections, in very close cooperation with Bindi.  Defining how they will be chosen, "la pasionaria" said: "We  will consider outgoing members whom it is important that we  field as candidates again and who can provide evidence of lofty  ethical standards, but everyone must first be willing to stand  aside."    So Rosy Bindi is issuing a new challenge. Just a year and a  half ago, when she assumed the leadership of the Venice DC,  which had been brought to its knees by the judicial inquiries,  she asked all investigatees to stop attending party meetings;  now she is directly addressing all those elected in the 5 April  1992 elections to agree to submit to an "examination" by her 111  trusted coordinators appointed yesterday. In theory,  irrespective of the election results, 25 parliamentarians risk  losing their seats, including two former ministers -- Carlo  Fracanzani and Carlo Bernini -- and the current deputy secretary  at the Treasury Ministry, Giovanni Malvestio.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUIS BARRON; MADE MUSIC ELECTRONICALLY  </P> <P> Louis Barron, an electronic pioneer who created music from circuitry long  before the evolvement of synthesizers, has died of lung cancer, his wife said  this week.  </P> <P> Barron, who with his first wife fashioned the score for the innovative music in  the 1956 film "Forbidden Planet," died Nov. 1 in Los Angeles. Mary Ellen Barron  said her husband was 69.  </P> <P> A largely self-taught engineer and pianist, Barron first combined those  interests in 1948 when he and his then wife, Bebe, created circuits that  mechanically altered sound. At the time, he was one of few Americans involved  in the field.  </P> <P> He later worked with composer John Cage investigating the relationship between  music and sound and, after a few experimental film scores, was asked with his  wife to write the music for "Forbidden Planet," a science-fiction film based on  Shakespeare's "The Tempest."  </P> <P> Louis and Bebe Barron also collaborated on concerts and on such Broadway  productions as "Visit to a Small Planet," "The Happiest Girl in the World" and  "The Chinese Wall."  </P> <P> Besides his wife he is survived by two sons.  </P></p>

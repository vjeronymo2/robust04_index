			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: John Cahill receives his Dollars 800,000 salary in US MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, receives his Dollars 800,000 (Pounds 520,000) salary in the US, despite being head of one of the UK's largest manufacturing companies. A resident of Long Bay Key, Florida, for tax purposes, Mr Cahill joined BAe when the group was looking for a 'British' replacement for Prof Sir Roland Smith, who was ousted in a boardroom coup in 1991. Mr Cahill, the former chief executive of BTR, the industrial holding company, is also due to receive stock options to buy shares valued 'in or around' September 1992 at about Dollars 3.2m. According to his service contract, Mr Cahill is required to work an average of four days a week but has 'no established work schedule' and can 'perform his services at times and places reasonably and in good faith selected by him'. The company also pays for legal, tax, accounting financial and estate planning counselling. Mr Cahill's service contract was available for public scrutiny in the run up to yesterday's annual meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with new mayor of Vladivostok Konstantin </F> Tolstoshein by Valentina Bratchikova; date not given: "Action  is What is Needed. How to Create Equilibrium in Vladivostok"]    [Text] Vladivostok -- Many will remember the scandal that  erupted over the former mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov.  Our dialogue with the new mayor, Konstantin Borisovich  Tolstoshein, began with an assessment of this situation.    [Bratchikova] Tell me, did it not bother you that people  would be doubly prejudiced when assessing your every step?  Indeed the psychological background, to be frank, is very  complex and the rumor mill tends to compare, to lay it on thick,  to look for mercenary intentions....    [Tolstoshein] I am 42. I have managed in my time to work in  various leading posts, so I was not particularly seeking power.  I also know there is still plenty of life left in my batteries.    Everyone got tired of the endless political wrangling a long  time ago. I said as much to my staff when I arrived in city  hall: If you want to engage in politics, join parties or  movements; what is required of you here is action. What are you  missing? Independence? Initiative? Please, take what you want,  I'm not going to stop you. But first of all we have to  establish equilibrium in the city. We agreed on that.    Things were particularly disgraceful for our veterans and  those who had fought in Afghanistan. Practically all the stores  in the city had been privatized, but they had simply forgotten  about these people, struck them off the list. Justice had to be  restored. Ten or so extra retail outlets have been opened for  their personal use and we want to win back through the courts  the stores that were bought by fraudulent means....    Remember last winter -- the city nearly froze to death due  to  the lack of coal and petroleum products. The city managers,  however, were shouting from the housetops: There is enough  fuel... To prevent a repetition of this we embarked on  preparations for next winter before the arrival of spring.    [Bratchikova] So the economy began to recover swiftly...    [Tolstoshein] Of course, you cannot solve everything in just  over a month. But there are areas where we must not delay. For  example, the fight against crime. We can increase the staffs of  law-enforcement organs, give them more funds, and buy the latest  technology and equipment. We began by giving guarantees that  housing would be provided for everyone who needed it. Not only  command personnel, but warrant officers and petty officers. The  idea is not to recruit new people and teach them ways of  combatting the mafia, but to keep those who have proved their  worth, prevent them from going off in pursuit of "big bucks,"  and provide their families with the basics at least.    [Bratchikova] How do you view the willingness of foreign  countries -- neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region -- to give us  humanitarian, economic, and other aid? Are we that poor and  feeble?    [Tolstoshein] I believe we have not yet been able properly  to take advantage of the fact that Vladivistok has become an  open port. Open to cooperation, to business partnership. Five  consulates -- it must mean something! You don't even need to go  to the countries they represent, since much can be agreed upon  on the spot. You just have to effect a radical, 180-degree  change in your attitude toward foreign economic activity -- I  discussed this recently with the heads of leading enterprises in  the city. There are things we can teach foreigners and we have  our fair share of natural resources -- timber, fish, minerals.  But we have a lot to learn from them, for example, construction  organization, entrepreneurial methods, and business skills.    For example, I am about to go to South Korea, where we will  discuss the details of the joint construction of a regional  business center in Vladivostok. They are providing the finance.  We are providing a small plot of land in the city. Not forever,  but on a 50-year lease. In a year's time we will have at our  disposal a splendid, fully equipped modern center, which will  help us organize small and medium-size business in the kray in a  whole new way.    [Bratchikova] There was a big agricultural fair in  Vladivostok recently. At it people were able to buy at  rock-bottom prices food, agricultural equipment for work on  subsidiary plots, and much else. Is this a once-only event or  do you intend to continue to revive these fine, but forgotten  traditions in the city?    [Tolstoshein] By means of the fair you are talking about we  were not only doing battle with the middlemen, we were also  demonstrating that the Maritime Kray countryside is not  impoverished, that it is possible, indeed essential to work with  it on mutually advantageous terms. We will continue to develop  this kind of open trade in squares. In the next few days we  will be holding a fish fair, where we will be offering citizens  fresh fish and other absolutely fresh seafood they have been  longing for... So there are many plans, and I hope they will be  implemented.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A headine in Saturday editions stated incorrectly that Interior Secretary  Manuel Lujan Jr. was being asked by critics to resign from a White House task  force studying offshore oil drilling. As the accompanying story stated,  California's two senators and 17 of the state's congressmen are demanding that  Lujan resign as chairman of the group, not from the group itself.  </P></p>

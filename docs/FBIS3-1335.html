Molusi] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- The Freedom Front [FF]  said on Thursday [24 March] it was ironic that the National  Party [NP] was suddenly concerned about the number of communists  on the African National Congress' [ANC] election candidates list.    Reacting to Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha's statement  that more than half of the people in the top 50 of the ANC's  list were communists, the Freedom Front said it was the NP that  had declared communism dead when it unbanned the SA [South  African] Communist Party [SACP] in 1990.    Mr Botha was responding to a challenge by SACP official  Jeremy Cronin that the NP should prove the SACP had more than 16  members on the ANC list.    Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said his party  remained  consistent in its opposition to communism, and urged voters to  support the FF to effectively combat the communist threat.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Struggling to hold the back door closed: The UK's attempts to control acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies The clearance last week of Elf Aquitaine's Pounds 300m acquisition of Amoco, the UK petrol-station and refinery business, has thrown the whole future of the British government's tough stance on acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies into doubt. For the fourth time since Mr Peter Lilley, the Trade and Industry Secretary, announced last July that in future he would scrutinise all acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has left him powerless to act. If the aim of the policy was to prevent 'nationalisation by the back door', it appears to have failed. At the very least it now seems unnecessary. Can it survive this latest blow? At the back of Mr Lilley's policy lies the government's conviction that private ownership leads to the more efficient allocation of resources - the same economic policy stance which lies behind its commitment to privatisation. Viewed from abroad, however, it is easy to see how this new policy might appear protectionist and contrary to the underlying principles of the single market. The French, in particular, appear to believe it is a protectionist policy directed specifically at them. Four of the five references to the commission made since the new policy was introduced have involved French state-controlled companies. Three of them - Woodchester/Credit Lyonnais, Sligos( owned by Credit Lyonnais)/Signet and Elf Aquitaine/Amoco - were referred by Mr Lilley against the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading. In only one case, Kemira Oy/ICI, has the commission concluded that the merger might be expected to operate against the public interest. Credit Lyonnais, incensed by what it sees as a deliberate discriminatory policy, has lodged a complaint with the European Commission in Brussels. In defence of the British position it was almost inevitable that the French would fall foul of the new policy more often than other European states. Since early 1989 French state-controlled companies have made many more cross-border mergers and acquisitions throughout Europe than nationalised groups from any other European country. They were particularly active during the first quarter of 1990 making 40 European deals with a disclosed value of Ecu 2.52bn (Pounds 1.4bn) - 58 per cent of the value of all French deals in Europe. Britain has proved the most popular target for French state-controlled industry. Indeed, Mr John Redwood, Corporate Affairs Minister, first referred to the government's intention to adopt the policy announced officially by Mr Lilley in July after the announcement in March last year of a Pounds 301m bid by Orkem, the French state-controlled chemicals group for Coates Brothers, the UK inks and resins manufacturer. The French may also have fallen foul of the Lilley policy because of their fundamentally different attitude to public-sector enterprises. They do not hold with the British view that private ownership necessarily leads to the more efficient allocation of resources. It all depends on how state control is exercised. During the early stages of the investigation by the MMC of the Credit Lyonnais/ Woodchester acquisition, the first of the five to be referred following the policy statement at the end of July, the DTI took pains to explain to the commission the reasons why Mr Lilley regards state ownership as raising public-interest issues which may merit investigation. A letter was sent from the DTI to the MMC outlining the reasons behind the policy. DTI officials attended hearings at the commission and made written submissions. The DTI letter makes it clear that the new merger reference policy rests on the proposition that state-controlled companies are always likely to behave in fundamentally different ways in the market place than privately owned ones because the state as shareholder is unlike private enterprise shareholders. The Government believes state control represents an extreme degree of immunity from market forces. The state may have objectives distinct from normal commercial objectives of maximising the financial return on a shareholder's investment. State-controlled companies do not face the threat of financial failure. The DTI maintains that, because their objectives may or may not be seen as strictly commercial their behaviour is unpredictable, creating uncertainty in the market. Competitive forces are weakened and some misallocation of resources and overall loss of efficiency may result. In the case of acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies, the DTI also fears that the state concerned might be trying to gain control of a certain sector of the market in order to influence it in some way which could be damaging to UK interests. Furthermore the market for corporate control will be adversely affected because state-controlled companies themselves are generally immune from takeover and takeover pressures. The French approach is made clear by evidence to the MMC by its Ecomomics and Finance Ministry. The basic thrust is that there is a broad consensus in France on two fundamental principles which must be applied to public sector enterprises: that they should have management autonomy and that fair and open competition between public enterprises and between public and private enterprises must be guaranteed in France and within the European Community. The French government likens itself to any other majority shareholder. French company law provides a strict framework for the government's responsibilities. The government refrains from interfering in management decisions although it reserves the right to pass judgment on the results of the strategy adopted (this, it says, is no different from any majority shareholder in a private company). Public enterprises have no special access to special funding for acquisitions. They decide for themselves on their commercial and financial objectives which are approved by the government as far as they affect its interests as shareholder. Public industrial enterprises are free to choose their insurers and bankers. The government ensures competition law is strictly applied. The British response to this is that it is all fine in theory but the reality may be different. However, on four occasions the MMC has accepted on the evidence before it the French explanation of the role played by its government in the management of French public enterprises. Its conclusions on the issue of state-control in the Elf case largely echo those in the other three French cases - the French government leaves the running of its state enterprises to their managements. So is Mr Lilley's policy now a dead letter? Clearly there are occasions where state-control can be a factor which requires investigating during the normal course of an MMC inquiry into a proposed merger which raises competition concerns. But in the absence of sound reasons for referring a proposed merger on competition grounds, state-control is surely no longer a good enough reason on its own for launching a full-scale MMC inquiry.</p>

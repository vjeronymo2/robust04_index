			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / No formal Kuwait recognition Iraq's parliament ended a special session yesterday by backing President Saddam Hussein's handling of thorny relations with the United Nations, but did not reveal if it had approved the recognition of Kuwait's borders and the Gulf state's sovereignty - a fundamental Security Council precondition for any moves towards the easing of sanctions. The hastily called meeting had been widely expected to meet the terms required by this weekend's Security Council resolution, calling on Iraq to make the recognition through 'full and formal constitutional procedures'. But no announcement came at the end of the meeting. At the UN in New York, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, reported formally on his Baghdad talks and reiterated Moscow's view members should consider lifting the oil embargo in about six months if Iraq showed honest co-operation and followed through with recognition of Kuwait's borders. Ms Madeleine Albright, the US delegate, responded that the crisis created by the recent Iraqi troop deployments was still not over. As for promises made to Mr Kozyrev, the US placed no more value on these than on previous Iraqi pledges. The council should categorically reject any idea of rewarding Iraq for 'partial compliance with some of its obligations', she said, citing a list of other requirements under UN resolutions.</p>

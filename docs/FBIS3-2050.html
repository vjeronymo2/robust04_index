Information from relevant departments reveals that by  February 15 of this year, 1,881 out of the 1,900 items put  forward by CPPCC members and members of non-communist parties  since the First Session of the Eighth National Committee of the  CPPCC have been answered through concerted work of 157  organizations, including the Chinese Communist Party central  community [as received] and the State Council.    This accounts for 99 percent of the total number of matters  put forward.    Many of the proposals, which concentrated on the reform,  opening- up and modernization drive, on the establishment of a  socialist market economy, on strengthening the ideological and  cultural build- up, as well as the construction of a clean  government and the improvement of the Communist Party's working  style have been accepted by relevant departments.    For instance, many CPPCC members submitted ideas and  proposals for a fair, rational tax rating and taxation system,  in a bid to concentrate the central government's power of  taxation and strengthen its management.    On the basis of this proposal, the Central Committee of the  Chinese Communist Party and the State Council decided to  implement a new financial system of tax assignment starting this  year.    Practice proves that over the past year, CPPCC members, non-  Communist Party members, and relevant people's organizations  have been playing an increasingly greater role in carrying out  the spirit of the 14th National Congress of the CPC, deepening  reform, promoting economic and social development, and for  solidifying unity and stability, by way of putting forward  proposals to perform their function of political consulting and  democratic supervision.</p>

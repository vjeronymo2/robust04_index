			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Reversing trends - The new-found interest in the UK private rented sector 'We hope the major institutional investors will soon take the view that a well-balanced portfolio should include residential property.' Sir George Young, minister for housing, speaking at a seminar organised by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last week. As matters stand, Sir George Young's ambition is a lost cause. Decades of restrictive legislation, poor returns and the tarnished image of landlords have made British investment institutions profoundly averse to the residential sector. Despite this, the government is taking the need to revive the private rented sector increasingly seriously. It is considering the introduction of new incentives, which could turn the tide in favour of the private rented sector. In May, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'There is clearly a need for a larger private rented sector in Britain. We have released some of the old shackles on landlords. But we may need to go further if the sector is to show any significant growth.' This new-found interest in the private rented sector stems from a change of heart in government and among prospective buyers in general over the merits of ownership. After a decade when home ownership was seen as an unalloyed blessing, the recession has exposed its shortcomings. Repossessions, mortgage arrears and the problems of so-called negative equity (when the value of the property falls below the mortgage secured on it) have convinced many people that the advantages of owner-occupation were greatly exaggerated. At the same time, economists are concerned that labour mobility is impeded by excessive owner-occupation, which inflicts heavy costs on people relocating. The huge increase in owner-occupation in the 1980s also included for the first time a large proportion in their early 20s, many of whom found the combination of easy credit and the house-owning culture of Thatcherism irresistible. For many of these people renting would have been a better option. 'We have to get away from the idea that the rented sector is just for a residue of people who cannot afford home ownership,' says Sir George. But any increase in the private rented sector will require a reversal of a deep-seated trend against this sector. The stock of private rented housing fell by some 800,000 properties during the years of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's premiership, from 1979-1990. In the UK, only 8 per cent of households are in the private rented sector, compared with 40 per cent in the former West Germany and 29 per cent in the US. The reasons for the move away from private rented housing (which in 1914 accounted for 90 per cent of the housing stock) include tax benefits (such as mortgage interest relief) that have favoured home owners and the post-war urban renewal programmes that swept away large tracts of rented housing. Most important of all, however, was the impact of rent controls. The rent controls that came into force in 1965 reduced rent drastically. This had the effect of cutting landlords' rent revenues, making property an even more unattractive investment. The Housing Act of 1988 abolished rent controls for certain types of tenancy, but its long-term impact is still unclear. Some private sector landlords, such as Bradford Property Trust, believe that renting out property is now an attractive investment. However, sceptics remain unconvinced. They say that the rise in private lettings in the past couple of years owes more to temporary factors, such as the property-related Business Expansion Schemes which will be phased out at the end of the year and the trend for house owners to rent out their properties until a buyer is found. To achieve a broader-based expansion of the private rented sector, says Professor Duncan MacLennan of Glasgow University, the government must provide additional incentives. 'Deregulation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for expansion of the private rented sector,' he says. 'It needs financial and fiscal backing to make it work.' The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a social research organisation, argues that tax breaks are needed to increase the real returns available from rented housing; returns presently stand at about 6 per cent, but they would need to rise by an extra 2 per cent to attract a significant number of new investors. A report commissioned by the foundation from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand urges the government to introduce 40 per cent first-year capital allowances for rented property. The remainder of the cost should be set against tax at 4 per cent, says the report, which is to be published later this month. Moreover, it adds, rental income should be treated as trading income and rented property should be exempt from capital gains tax, provided that it is held for at least 10 years. Given that these incentives could result in the provision of an extra 50,000 rented homes a year, but at a cost to the exchequer of about Pounds 5,000 for each property, the idea is unlikely to be greeted with enthusiasm by the Treasury at a time when it is trying to curb spending. But even if the government were prepared to introduce incentives, there are other obstacles. Few institutions would be prepared to take on the burden of managing residential property. Indeed the notion of direct investment in private rented property is unattractive to most funds. The Prudential, Britain's biggest life assurer, says: 'We feel it is unlikely that institutional investors will be persuaded to invest in private residential housing due to lack of liquidity and the small size of potential investments.' But even if institutions are not prepared to invest directly, they might be inclined to invest indirectly by delegating the management and contact with tenants to a third party. Coopers &amp; Lybrand believes that there is potential in the notion of a residential unit trust, the tax treatment of which would be more suitable for funds that invest in property companies. There may be other factors, however, to discourage funds from investing in rented property. Asda Property, which in 1985 was split evenly between residential and commercial property, has disposed of the bulk of its residential holdings and reinvested in commercial property. The reason behind this decision, says Mr Tony Roscoe, managing director, was more than just a question of returns. 'In commercial property, there is more scope for entrepreneurial flair. It is a less homogeneous product. Residential property is more a numbers game.' Moreover, he adds, running a residential portfolio is management-intensive because properties tend to be spread geographically. Funds are also wary of the political risk associated with investing in private rented housing. Mr Neville Lee, chairman of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, says the real problem is that landlords are concerned that a Labour government might reintroduce rent controls. 'The market simply doesn't trust them,' he says. Nor is Conservative policy above suspicion, in the view of some landlords. The leasehold reform bill, which if enacted would force landlords to sell freeholds to leaseholders, does not inspire confidence among many property owners. Changing the attitudes of landlords towards the rented sector promises to be an uphill struggle. But in the view of many involved in housing policy, the current disaffection with home ownership presents the government with a rare opportunity to expand the rented sector.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BROOKLYN ENDS STREAK OF 58 LOSSES  </P> <P> The Streak is over.  </P> <P> The Brooklyn College women's basketball team finally won Monday night, ending  the longest losing streak in NCAA history at 58 games.  </P> <P> "We never believed it was our lot to just lose and lose and lose," coach Molly  Perdue said after a 60-54 victory at Concordia College. "But we needed to know  that we could win one."  </P> <P> Brooklyn had not won since Feb. 15, 1987, when it beat Molloy 60-59. The  Division I Lady Knights were 0-25 last season and are 1-24 this season with two  games remaining.  </P> <P> None of Brooklyn's players had ever won a game. The Lady Knights have seven  freshmen, two sophomores and a junior transfer. The drought was the longest in  any sport in any division of NCAA competition. The University of Dallas, an  NAIA school, lost 86 consecutive games in men's basketball. Brooklyn's record  may not last long, however.  </P></p>

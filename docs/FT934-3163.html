			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / HK impasse deepens as talks slow The Sino-British impasse over Hong Kong deepened yesterday as the two sides failed to make significant progress in London talks and China stepped up its own preparations for assuming sovereignty over the territory in 1997. British and Chinese officials blamed each other for slow progress in the Joint Liaison Group, the body charged with arranging practical issues of the handover, which ended three days of talks in London without setting a date for the next meeting. Mr Hugh Davies, the senior UK official, said the meeting had been 'disappointing' and that the current pace of the JLG was 'woefully inadequate' if it was to complete its crowded agenda before 1997. Mr Guo Fengmin, leader of the Chinese side on the JLG, made it clear separately that the slowness was a result of Britain and China's failure to advance talks on political issues, responsibility for which he laid squarely on Britain. Britain, Mr Guo said, had undermined previous agreements on Hong Kong and 'the discussions of the JLG are bound to be affected'. Mr Davies said the Chinese view that the political situation affected the JLG 'was felt throughout the agenda. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that a link is being made between politics and economics,' he said. Limited progress had been made on issues such as civil aviation, merchant shipping, investment and the civil service, but items 'ripe for agreement', such as a proposed new container terminal, were being delayed by the Chinese. In Beijing Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, urged a special advisory committee on Hong Kong to step up preparations for 1997. 'We must put greater efforts into our work, and the responsibility borne by each member is even heavier,' said Mr Qian, the panel's chairman. Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political development are deadlocked and Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, plans next week to proceed with parts of his reform proposals without Beijing's agreement. China says it will abandon negotiations should Mr Patten do so. UK officials and Hong Kong business representatives fear the China-sponsored 'Preparatory Work Committee' of 57 leading Chinese and Hong Kong officials will undermine Mr Patten's authority. Mr Wu Jianmin, China's foreign ministry spokesman, left the door open for further talks provided Mr Patten deferred his reforms. 'To resume them, the UK side should change course and correct its errors which have led to the breakdown of the talks.' Mr Patten showed irritation yesterday at persistent Chinese claims of insincerity. 'I think what the word 'sincerity' means to some Chinese officials is: 'Everybody else in the world must agree with us, otherwise they're not being sincere',' Mr Patten said. Louise Lucas adds from Hong Kong: Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's new chief secretary who ranks second to Mr Patten, yesterday hit out at accusations by Sir Percy Cradock, a former UK foreign policy adviser, that Mr Patten would do 'great damage to the territory' by extending democracy. Mrs Chan said: 'The days of back-door deals over the heads of Hong Kong people are over. For the agreement to be acceptable and credible in Hong Kong, it must enable fair, open elections.'</p>

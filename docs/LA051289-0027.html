			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: LOYOLA, PEPPERDINE DOMINATE ALL-STAR BASEBALL TEAM  </P> <P> Pepperdine, Loyola Marymount and Santa Clara, who dominated the West Coast  Athletic Conference baseball season and earned national rankings, also  dominated the all-conference team announced this week.  </P> <P> Conference champ Pepperdine placed five players on the first team -- second  baseman Matt Howard, outfielders Rick Hirtensteiner and Richard Barnwell and  pitchers Britt Craven and Wayne Helm -- and two more on the second team,  shortstop Chris Martin and outfielder Jalal Leach. Loyola placed three on each  team -- catcher Miah Bradbury, first baseman Greg Wall and pitcher Kalani Bush  on the first team, third baseman Rick Allen, outfielder Travis Tarchione and  pitcher Mike McNary on the second.  </P> <P> Santa Clara also had three on the first team -- second baseman Ed Giovanola,  shortstop Matt Toole and pitcher Greg Gohr -- and four on the second team --  catcher Troy Buckley, outfielder Bruce Powers, designated hitter Bill Enos and  pitcher Larry Donahe.  </P> <P> Pepperdine dominated the top four awards. Hirtensteiner, a three-time selection  who hit .372 with 12 home runs and saved four games in relief, was named Player  of the Year. Craven (10-2, two shutouts, 6-0 in conference) was named Pitcher  of the Year, and Andy Lopez was named Coach of the Year in his first season.  </P> <P> Loyola freshman Joe Ciccarella, who hit .328 shuttling between first base and  the outfield, earned the other major award, Newcomer of the Year.  </P> <P> Bradbury, who led the WCAC in hitting at .409, Hirtensteiner and Toole are  repeaters on the first team. The Lions catcher bumped Santa Clara's Buckley,  who was WCAC Player of the Year in 1988, to the second team.  </P> <P> The first team is rounded out by DH Rod Nettnin, third baseman John DeRicco and  utility man Don Angotti of Nevada-Reno and outfielder James Mouton of St.  Mary's. The second team includes Reno first baseman Jeff Barry and pitcher  Aaron Turnier and utility man Andy Roberts of San Diego.  </P> <P> The UC Berkeley men's tennis team is in the hunt for the NCAA title, thanks in  part to singles player Forrest (Woody) Hunt.  </P> <P> The former South Torrance High standout, ranked 12th individually in the NCAA,  will lead the third-ranked Bears in the NCAA Tournament next Friday at the  University of Georgia. Hunt also teams with fellow senior Ted Scherman as the  nation's second-ranked doubles team. The NCAA format, which takes eight days to  complete, opens with team competition, followed by an individual tournament.  </P> <P> Hunt, a two-time All-American singles player and an All-American doubles  selection with Scherman last year, takes a 25-14 record and 16-9 dual record  into the tourney. Hunt's national standing was augmented in April when he  defeated Stanford star Jeff Tarango, 6-2, 6-1. Tarango, who avenged the loss  last weekend, is ranked sixth nationally. Hunt has beaten him twice in the last  two seasons.  </P> <P> National ranking is nothing new to the 5-foot-10 senior. He was ranked fifth  nationally as a junior (18 and under) and was the most heralded tennis recruit  in the school's history. Hunt was a member of the Junior Davis Cup team in  1987. That year, playing in the Transamerica Open, he defeated veteran pro  Peter Fleming. At South High, where his father, Forrest Sr., teaches, Hunt was  also an academic All-American, carrying a straight-A average.  </P> <P> As a junior Hunt battled shoulder problems, and teammate Scherman had an ankle  injury. This year, a healthier, more veteran Bears team -- which includes  sophomore Pete Fitzpatrick out of Miraleste -- unexpectedly won the National  Indoor Team Championships in February to vault into the national ratings. They  could give top-ranked UCLA, Stanford and UC Irvine a run for the title.  </P> <P> Afterward, the sociology major plans to turn professional and play on the  Canadian tour this summer.  </P> <P> Can't-Tell-the-Players Dept.: In recent weeks, viewers of Loyola Marymount  baseball have regularly seen several players take the field in Steve Surico's  uniform, though the real Surico plays only when due to pitch. The answer to all  the confusion, it turned out, came out in the wash.  </P> <P> Greg Wall's road jersey and Mark Grafitti's home jersey were in a recent load  of laundry but never came back. Since Wall and Grafitti generally platoon at  the same position, they have been wearing pitcher Surico's uniform top.  </P> <P> It gets more complicated when Surico pitches. Last weekend at Pepperdine, Wall  wore Surico's jersey on Friday and Saturday. But Sunday, when Surico pitched,  Wall came to the plate in Tim Byrne's uniform and was introduced as Byrne. The  umpire turned to the press box and corrected the identification. Pepperdine  sports publicist Mike Zapolski, manning the public address system, announced  the change: "Correction -- now batting, Greg Wall, the man of many uniforms."  </P> <P> Former USF and Boston Celtics star K. C. Jones was inducted into the basketball  Hall of Fame this week, but it's safe to say Jones doesn't cause quite the stir  of, say, Michael Jordan in public.  </P> <P> At the recent West Coast Athletic Conference basketball tournament held at USF  -- where he teamed with Bill Russell to win two straight national titles in the  1950s and where their uniforms hang on the wall of the gym -- Jones was  scouting for the Celtics and was barred from the press room by a student hired  for security.  </P> <P> A bemused witness asked her, "Do you know who that was?" She said no, but that  he lacked the proper credentials. When told Jones' identity, she was red-faced.  "That's embarrassing," she admitted. "I was just polishing the trophies in the  K. C. Jones Room yesterday."  </P> <P> College Notes:  </P> <P> The West Coast Athletic Conference has hopes its top three baseball teams --  Pepperdine, Loyola and Santa Clara -- will be chosen for the NCAA regionals.  Bids should go out around May 20 . . . Six Cal State Dominguez Hills softball  players received all-conference honors in the California Collegiate Athletic  Assn., with pitcher Denise Biller and utility player Jennifer Moen named to the  first team. Pitcher Kim Park, third baseman Nicole Stelter, outfielder Maria  Romero and shortstop Dina Graham were chosen for the second team . . . Romero  has set a school season record for runs batted in with 27. She set the old  record of 26 last year . . . Loyola basketball player Tom Peabody has one foot  in a walking cast after surgery to remove pins from a previous bone graft  operation on the ankle. Peabody will not be allowed to resume activity until  around August . . . Dominguez Hills outfielder Marty Williams is hitting .413  in CCAA play and .381 for the season. Outfielder Rob Campbell has 13 hits in  his last 22 at-bats, raising his average to .353. He tied a school record with  a five-hit game against Cal State Los Angeles . . . With one more start, Toros  right-hander Rick Davis needs 14 strikeouts to tie the CCAA season record of  170.  </P></p>

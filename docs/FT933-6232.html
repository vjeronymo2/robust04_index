			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Travel: New tracks along the Silk Road STALIN and Mao never trusted one another, even when China and the Soviet Union were allies. So their plan to link China and the Soviet Union by rail through central Asia was never realised. Not, that is, until the 1980s. By then the Sino-Soviet dispute was history, and people on both sides of the frontier were thinking more about trade than politics. So the Chinese revived the idea of a central Asian rail link. They went further, and proposed a new trans-continental rail link joining Europe with China, the North Sea to the Yellow Sea. The proposal involved building a railway line across the mountainous border between the city of Urumqi in the far west of China and Kazakhstan: the railway Stalin and Mao never built. Last December 1 the rail link was inaugurated, and amid much pomp and ceremony the first freight train left the Chinese port of Lianyungang on the Yellow Sea, bound for Rotterdam. There is not yet a trans-continental passenger express on the route. But there is a good second-best: a new express train from China to Kazakhstan, leaving Urumqi for Alma Ata every Tuesday morning. This train ride along the old Silk Road is irresistible - for us, anyway. To travel on the Urumqi-Alma Ata express, our first step was to get to Urumqi. We had a choice between flying from Peking or stopping off along the old Silk Road en route. We chose the second. We flew from Peking to Dunhuang, site of the world's finest Buddhist cave murals, and then took a train across the desert to the oasis town of Turfan. There we visited mosques, bargained for Uygur carpets, rode camels and climbed sand dunes (harder than it sounds). Then we hired a car and drove north-west to Urumqi. For three hours we sped through the northern outskirts of the Taklamakan desert, the most awesome and barren mass of land in Asia. Then we wound through the pass between the gaunt and forbidding Tian Shan, the Mountains of Heaven. At last we drove down into the suburbs of modern Urumqi, now a bustling centre of frontier trade and tourism. In the railway station at Urumqi the following Tuesday morning a sign in Chinese proudly pointed the way to 'International Trains.' There was only one train from Urumqi fitting that description. That was our express. The carriages were smartly painted in green with yellow clover-leaf friezes. According to a plate on the undercarriage, they were made in Halle, eastern Germany. Our compartment was spotlessly clean - an echo of the immaculate days of Chairman Mao - and contained two couchettes, a table and a teapot. Every so often our Kazakh carriage attendant would replenish the pot from a state-of-the-art samovar at the end of the corridor. He wore a stiff peaked cap and stood to attention outside his carriage when the train stopped at stations. Otherwise he lay on his bunk in his vest. The journey was a leisurely trip through space and time. The Han Chinese faces of city people in Urumqi gave way to the more homely features of the minorities - Uygur, Kazakh and others - to be found in western China away from the main urban centres. Portraits of small-town frontier life passed our train windows. Gradually, more and more Russian faces could be seen, rough-hewn at first, then more finely drawn. The landscape began to change, too. The land became more fertile, and vistas of barren mountains and brown stone wastelands gave way to fields of cotton and grain. Our neighbours in the next compartment were too busy to observe all this. They were a delegation of Chinese railway workers earnestly preparing for a visit to the railway ministry in Moscow. Their interpreter was a warm-hearted Chinese woman who had learned Russian in the 1950s, in the heyday of the Sino-Soviet alliance. She had not spoken or read the language for years, and now she was eager to brush away the cobwebs and start again. With this in mind she helped us get to grips with the timetable posted in the corridor of the carriage. This was not so easy to do. It was not at all clear why the train was scheduled to take 10 hours at the frontier going one way, and four hours the other. Finally we worked out the answer: the timetable, issued by the government of Kazakhstan and printed in Russian, showed Moscow time. From Urumqi to the border the train carried a Chinese dining car. By the time we found our way there the car's stock of local beer had been consumed, as we could see from the ruddy complexions of the diners. So we washed down our spiced meats and vegetables with a pink fortified wine from the Turfan vineyards. Later, across the border, we found a Kazakh dining car in which we drank Russian champagne and dined on a banquet for the princely sum of Dollars 1 (our first experience of the collapsing rouble). The border crossing from China to Kazakhstan was an elaborate affair. Mercifully, it took place at night, so we slept through most of it. There was much bumping and grinding as the carriages were adjusted to the broad Russian gauge, and much striding and searching as frontier guards and customs officers examined every inch of the train. Clearly they had been brought up to exercise authority the old way. At the same time they were trying to adjust to their changing role in the new era. 'Passports] Papers]' the Chinese customs officer snapped officiously as he flung open our door. But then he sat down and chatted for 20 minutes about China's open-door policy and investment prospects. We received much the same treatment from the intent-looking Russian woman who rushed in waving a sheaf of forms. 'Kazakh Aids certificate - government regulations]' she declared grimly. When we shook our heads and explained our ignorance, she smiled sweetly and hurried into the night. As we approached Alma Ata on the second day, the white mountain range beyond the city made a glorious backdrop against the winter sky. When we drew into Alma Ata station we parted reluctantly with our travelling companions. The carriage attendant beamed, but looked wary when we asked him to recommend a good hotel. How was he to deal with such innocents at large? He probably wanted to warn us about the perils of life in a market economy, or at least tell us how to bribe our way into a hotel room. In the end he said very little. As a result we learned the hard way, and found rooms very late that evening, only after lining our passports with large dollar bills. As for my friend from the Chinese railway department, she turned up once more in an unexpected setting. On the way to London from Alma Ata I stopped off in Moscow, where I lost my luggage at the domestic airport. She was on the same flight, and lost hers, too. But she knew at once what to do. 'Follow me', she said, and led the way out on to the tarmac. There, far away in the snow, was a pile of abandoned suitcases, including mine. 'How did you know where to go?' I asked. But I knew the answer before she replied. Who better than a Russian-speaking Chinese, nurtured on the Sino-Soviet alliance, to understand how the Russian bureaucracy works, even today? Travel from Peking to Urumqi and on to Alma Ata by air and rail can be arranged through the China International Travel Service (CITS). Much the most comfortable hotel in Urumqi is the Holiday Inn, which can be booked through CITS or direct, tel: (0991)-218788, fax: -217077. There are several large hotels in Alma Ata. We stayed at the Hotel Otrar. Hotel bookings as well as bookings for internal Aeroflot flights can be made through Intourist. For these services local Intourist offices take payment only in USDollars .</p>

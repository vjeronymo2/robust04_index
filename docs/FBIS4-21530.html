			<p>CSO     [Text] Armscor this week revealed exactly how it is beating  its swords into ploughshares.    At a military research seminar in Braamfontein, Armscor  senior manager Dr. Andre Buys described how the only country in  the world to ever dismantle a nuclear weapons capability had  gone about it.    South Africa has 400kg of highly enriched uranium in storage  15km from Pretoria, supposedly safe against terrorists -- unless  they have scientists on their side, said Mr. David Albright,  president of the US-based Institute for Science and  International Security.    South Africa also had a controversial batch of tritium,  which  daramatically increases the power of nuclear weapons, imported  from Israel in exchange for uranium.    As part of the scheme, the tritium was sold for use in  fluorescent signs such as those on cinema exits.    South Africa -- the founder member of "the ex-nuclear club"  -- realized it had to commercialize its technology if it was to  succeed in dismantling its nuclear weapons capability, said Dr.  Buys.    Scores of Armscor ideas were whittled down to 17 business  units with processes stemming from the uranium enrichment  programme.    Centrifuges designed to enrich uranium were adapted to  reduce  emissions from industrial stacks, to filter air for helicopter  turbines and to improve ventilation.    Staff members at Armscor subsidiaries involved in the  construction of nuclear devices also came up with 200 commercial  ideas that were hacked down to six projects.    These were:    --Explosive cladding. Metals aluminium that cannot be  welded conventionally are joined by explosives;    --Creating rare-earth magnets;    --Linking tungsten to copper or silver for use in  electrical switchgear;    --Hot isostatic pressing which allowed components to be  made from matallic powders;    --Pyrotechnic products which include special focused  explosives to break up big boulders; and,    --A medical ventilator.    However, Dr. Buys said it was not known if the technology  conversion would be successful in the long term.    "Since no one else has dismantled a nuclear weapons program,  there is nowhere to look for advice."    The 400kg of highly enriched uranium outside Pretoria cannot  immediately be reconstituted into weapon form.    And, with a glut of nuclear material on world markets, it is  only worth R15-million.    But if, as the ANC wishes, it is used to make medical  isotopes, the value will increase to R500-million.    However, Western nations oppose this option because they  fear  the "black bomb" -- industry terminology for a black nation with  nuclear-weapons capability.    Mr. Albright said: "America doesn't want highly enriched  uranium to remain in South Africa."    At the ANC's military research group meeting in Johannesburg  this week, he said the West wanted the possibility of  bomb-making removed from South African soil.    But Mr. Albright said: "The US government won't give up on  highly enriched uranium. They don't want to hurt South Africa  economically -- they just don't want it to have this power."    One the other side, the ANC was "upset by the lack of trust,  the idea that it wants to create a black bomb."    "If highly enriched uranium wasn't present in South Africa,  it would take years before it could get a nuclear weapon here,"  said Mr. Albright.    "But as it is, the project could be reconstituted in secret  and it would take only a few months."    Mr. Dion Smith of Armscor confirmed that a maximum of 1,000  South Africans had known about the nuclear military program --  so reconstitution in secret was not impossible.    The closest South Africa came to using one was in 1987.    Test-bomb shafts were dug in the Kalahari desert and later  closed in the 70's.    But they were reopened in 1987, said the ANC's Roger  Jardine,  because "the Cubans were overrunning the SADF in Angola."    Dr. Buys said: "The shafts were reopened in relation to  events in Angola. The war was reaching a semi-conventional state  and it was backed by the Soviet Union."    The thinking was that if South Africa detonated a nuclear  bomb in a shaft, the Americans would pick it up on satellite or  seismic equipment and would be forced to help -- or risk SA  using remaining "credible devices."    And so the watchers and the watched, former adversaries,  continue to debate the chronology and detail of what really  happened, with Armscor asking for a copy of a Soviet report it  says "cannot exist."</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Inside the United Nations - Radio EASTER broadcasts began on Good Friday with Radio 1's Talk of the Devil, an anthology of evil, ranging from Paradise Lost to the bombing of Nagasaki, with music by Elizabeth Parker from the Radiophonic Workshop and readings by Dr Leslie Griffiths, the Rev Steve Chalke and DJ The Man Ezeke, a Restafarian. Michael Wakelin produced. At the other end of the scale, Radio 4 has swapped its morning Bible slot for Something Understood, a collection of spiritual but not necessarily religious English verse. Donne, Herbert and the rest are there, of course, but so are many poems by modern writers. The selection of readers is as imaginative as the selection of writers. David Benedictus produces. The Thin Blue Line, Radio 4's four-week series on the United Nations, produced by Anne Sloman and presented by James Naughtie, examines the internal work of the UN and its capacity in the field. The first programme (Thursday, repeated tomorrow) assessed the practical influence of Boutros-Ghali on the UN. 'The end of the cold war,' he says, 'means the democratisation of international relations, the new role of the United Nations'. Boutros-Ghali is one of those recorded, civil and military, not only on the 37th floor of the UN building in New York (where the Peacemaking and Peacekeeping Departments are), but in Zagreb, Cambodia and Cyprus, with occasional action-bites that emphasise the cleft between a decision and its realisation on the ground. The Canadians arguing with Serbs in Pankracs, the Royal Navy patrolling the Mekong River, the troops fighting boredom in Cyprus, these stress the gap between UN decisions and work in the field. Naughtie can be an ace reporter on his various expeditions, and does not take sides - perhaps just as well. There is a written-in-advance feeling throughout that is a handicap in a current-affairs piece. Two days before the first programme went out, he had to report on the news that Prince Sadruddin Aga-Khan thought the Bosnian activities reflected 'the worst bungling since the end of the cold war', and that 'the moral foundations of the UN were at stake', thoughts much unlike Boutros-Ghali's, though rather like Lady Thatcher's. The same disadvantage dogs Radio 4's six-part series Ice Cream to Eskimos, that began last Saturday. This scans the troubles of advertising agencies working on unpopular accounts, for the British Field Sports Association to popularise fox-hunting, for NACRO to promote the employment of ex-prisoners, and for CFW (Care for Family and Womanhood) against feminism and the employment of women. In this first programme, we had the easy answers - the fox is killed quickly; many ex-cons have no resources but valid skills; women's abilities are better suited to the home than the police or the armed forces. Yet circumstances invade. Foxes, yes; but on Costing the Earth (Sunday, also Radio 4) we had the slaughter of pilot-whales by the Faroese, also regarded as a sport. Well, there are five more Saturdays for the arguments, which are matters of opinion, not the politics of The Thin Blue Line. In a fortnight we are to hear that the anti-feminism campaign has been relinquished, but no casualties are reported. Less amusingly unwell than Jeffrey Bernard lately, I spent about ten hours with radio drama, of which I most enjoyed the start of Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (Radio 4, Wednesday). The 1920 world of New York snobs monitoring the progress of Newland (Andrew Wincott), newly engaged to sweet young May (Cathryn Harrison) but in danger from fast Ellen Olenska (Suzanne Bertish) is refreshingly unlike the romance of our own day, and Christopher Reason's adaptation should sustain the novel's excitement if all six parts are as good as this.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Siam Cement increases third-quarter profit 34% Siam Cement, Thailand's biggest manufacturing conglomerate, said that robust growth in all its five main business areas enabled it to lift consolidated net profits for the first nine months by 52 per cent to Bt3.91bn (Dollars 156.4m). Consolidated profits in the third quarter surged 34 per cent to Bt1.38bn on sales 18 per cent higher. Cement and construction materials, which account for more than half the business, were surprisingly strong in the rainy season third quarter; cement sales alone rose 11.3 per cent over the year-ago figure. Several Bangkok analysts said they would revise upwards their full-year profits forecasts for the company in the light of the latest figures. Miss Sirinuch Tharmapornpilas, at Jardine Fleming Thanakom, said she now expected full-year net profits of around Bt5.2bn, 10 per cent higher than the firm's earlier forecast.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Kantor seeks break for US No game has received more anticipatory ink and airtime than today's between Brazil and the US. But the best word comes from Mickey Kantor, US trade representative and baseball freak, caught with his family at the Spain-Switzerland game. He fancied Spain, though not, he insisted, because Swiss markets are insufficiently open. When Brazil declared independence early last century, the first country to afford recognition was the US. Is it not time, Kantor wonders, for Brazil to acknowledge that favour, especially since it is playing the US national team on the 218th anniversary of US independence?</p>

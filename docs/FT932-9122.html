			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Beijing raises interest rates CHINA yesterday raised interest rates on bank lending in an attempt to cool an overheated economy and avoid a resurgence of inflation that is threatening reform. Interest rates on treasury bills were also increased sharply following the failure of the March offering, which was heavily undersubscribed, prompting the authorities to ban new issues of debt and equities securities. The Finance Ministry announced that interest on bank loans would be raised from 8.64 per cent to 9.36 per cent, and rates on deposits would also increase in an effort to stop the flow of funds from the banking system. The interest rate increase had been widely expected in the light of China's continuing high rates of growth and a big jump in urban inflation in the first quarter. The cost of living increase in China's larger cities reached 15.7 per cent in the three months to March. Western economists were sceptical, however, about the likely effectiveness of the fairly modest increase in the lending rate to slow China's economic juggernaut. China registered growth last year of 12.8 per cent, and an annualised 14.1 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with the same period in 1992. Among constraints on a larger increase in lending rates is the precarious health of many state enterprises that are heavily in debt and barely surviving. Government officials described steps taken yesterday as an attempt to 'fine tune' the economy. China last adjusted interest rates in April 1991, when it reduced them in an effort to stimulate the economy. The authorities also abandoned at the same time the system that made it compulsory for workers to buy treasury bonds. Rates on three- and five-year treasury bills have been raised to 12.52 per cent and 14.06 per cent from 10 and 11 per cent respectively. It was not clear whether the new rates would apply to unsold March bills. But the People's Bank reiterated yesterday that enterprise bonds should not offer rates higher than government paper. China's central bank also repeated its instruction that no enterprise bonds were to be sold before the backlog of treasury bills was cleared. By the scheduled April 30 expiry date for the March treasury bond issue only about 15 per cent of the Yuan 30bn (Pounds 3.3bn) offering had been taken up.</p>

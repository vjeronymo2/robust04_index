			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY CENTER RATES MAY GO UP  </P> <P> Moorpark is considering raising the cost of renting Moorpark Community Center.  </P> <P> Current rates range from $6 to $26, said Phil Newhouse, city director of  community services.  </P> <P> But he estimated that the actual cost of operating the larger of the two rooms  the city rents is $70 an hour.  </P> <P> "It's being subsidized to a certain point -- we made a proposal to increase the  fees to make it self-sustaining," Newhouse said.  </P> <P> Newhouse said the city charges less than nearby cities, such as Thousand Oaks,  Simi Valley and Camarillo.  </P> <P> A City Council committee is scheduled to advise the council May 16 on the  issue. "I believe we should be trying to recoup the costs of the opening of the  center," said Councilwoman Eloise Brown, a committee member. "If it's a  community event, open to the whole community, that's a different story." KIM  KASH  </P></p>

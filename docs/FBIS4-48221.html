			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African news"] </F>   [Text] Voting scheduled for today in the three  parliamentary by-elections in Togo has been postponed. An  official announcement gave no reason for the postponement but  said the elections would be held as soon as circumstances  permitted. Reports say the technical preparations have not been  completed, and there has been no campaigning. Opposition  parties were declared the winners in the three constituencies in  the elections last February, but the Supreme Court has ordered a  revote.</p>

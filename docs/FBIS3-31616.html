			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, who is now  in Poland, and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski have  announced that President Lech Walesa would be paying a three-day  visit to the Swiss Confederation in the second half of May.    Much attention was paid during talks to the possibilities of  improving economic cooperation between our two countries.  Attention was also drawn to the need to build a security system  in this part of Europe.    Andrzej Olechowski assessed relations between Poland and  Switzerland very positively.    [Begin Olechowski recording] It is a country whose  friendship  and will to help and cooperate with Poland is something we  experience every day. Today too this willingness was expressed  both in the interest shown by the minister in events in our  region, in his understanding of the importance of this region  for the future of Europe and in his understanding -- which we  traditionally find among the Swiss -- for economic affairs,  something which we also discussed for quite a while.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAUREL CANYON LOSES ELECTRICITY  </P> <P> A minor car accident on Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Studio City triggered a  power outage that left 4,000 Department of Water and Power customers without  electricity this morning, some for as long as five hours, officials said.  </P> <P> The outage occurred at 11:20 p.m. Monday when a car hit a utility pole on  Laurel Canyon Boulevard at Berry Drive, DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said.  </P> <P> The driver, whose name was unavailable, suffered only minor injuries, but the  utility pole hit by the car snapped near the top, bringing down electrical  wires, officials said. That set off a chain-reaction of stress on the local  power system. Three circuits that feed electricity to the area were knocked  out, Jensen said.  </P> <P> Primarily affected were homes and businesses in the Laurel Canyon area between  Mulholland Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway.  </P></p>

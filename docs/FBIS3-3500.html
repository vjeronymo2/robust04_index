An agricultural bank official said that in the first 70 days  of this year, bank savings in the rural areas increased by 6.2  billion yuan.    The drastic increase in rural bank savings was attributed to  the favorable development of rural industry, government measures  to reduce the burden of farmers and improvement in bank services  in rural Jiangsu.    Last year the funds which Jiangsu's rural enterprises  distributed to their employees amounted to 9.5 billion yuan.    Meanwhile, the provincial government took measures to reduce  the burden of the farmers, and the tendency of illegally  collecting funds in rural areas was checked, so farmers are  willing to deposit their surplus money in banks.    Last year the agricultural bank branch in Jiangsu Province  set up 1,178 computer-controlled bank savings offices all over  the rural areas.</p>

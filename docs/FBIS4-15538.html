			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RIA-Novosti correspondent Sergey Gryzunov] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] We have learned from  well-informed diplomatic sources that Russia repeatedly warned  the Bosnian Serb leadership about the danger of stepping up  their activities in eastern Bosnia. The last of these warnings  was made just a few hours before the air strike. In response,  the Russian embassy in Belgrade received firm promises that  there would be no aggravation of the situation. But literally a  few hours later Serb detachments mounted an offensive on Gorazde  and occupied its southern part. As a result, the airplanes were  forced to intervene after the lives of UN observers came under  threat. [passage omitted]    After Russian diplomacy averted the bombing of Serb  positions  in Sarajevo, a dangerous confidence in their own impunity  manifested itself among the Bosnian Serb leaders, generals, and  soldiers. The withdrawal of heavy weapons was presented by  local propaganda as a Serb victory, and the fact that NATO did  not mount air strikes was seen as a sign of weakness and  hesitation. But now the Rubicon has been crossed. A  fundamentally new situation has arisen, in which the Russian  president's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin will have to use all  his influence and skill to continue his peace-brokering mission  and the talks.    He has now begun a meeting with Serb President Slobodan  Milosevic, during which Moscow's views on what happened in  eastern Bosnia will probably be set forth.</p>

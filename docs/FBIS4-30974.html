			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The expulsion of foreign journalists  ordered by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's Ministry of  Information has drawn protests from a variety of Serbian  organizations, including opposition political parties,  journalists and writers, and an independent trade union. While  Federal Secretary for Information Slobodan Ignjatovic, in a  statement carried by Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service on 12  April, accused AFP and CNN of "waging a fierce media war against  Yugoslavia... on the territory of Yugoslavia," those who have  protested the expulsion decision have said they view it as a  serious mistake that violates freedom of thought and political  expression and is detrimental to the interests of the country.  Some also see it as foreshadowing action against domestic  journalists.    The 14 April issue of BORBA contains several articles  expressing what the editor called "stormy reaction to the  decision by the Federal Ministry of Information to withdraw the  credentials of CNN and AFP journalists." One of the articles,  titled "High-Risk Ban," presented the Serbian Renewal Party's  view that the expulsions were an alarming warning that Serbia is  going through the process of reintroducing bolshevism and  isolating itself from the world, a development that is a serious  threat to lasting peace, the lifting of sanctions, and monetary  and economic reforms.    Another article reported the reaction of the Serbian  Democratic Party [DSS], which charged that the Ministry of  Information had itself "significantly contributed" to the  "biased views" of the foreign media by failing to inform foreign  journalists "about the real causes and consequences of this  civil war." Now, according to the DSS, the ministry had made  another serious mistake. Instead of helping journalists to  witness developments, the ministry has forced them to seek  information exclusively from "the other side."    In a third article, titled "Step Toward Further Isolation,"  the Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia declared  that the withdrawal of credentials of any foreign or domestic  journalist was " contradictory to the fundamental right to be  informed, which is an important aspect of human rights in  general."    Under the title "Cancel That Decision," BORBA of 19 April  published a statement by the Serbian PEN [International  Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and  Novelists] organization, stressing that "withdrawal of foreign  journalists' credentials represents a rude violation of one of  the fundamental principles of the charter of PEN, which  specifically strives to secure the free exchange of information  and opposes all forms of censorship.... Such acts... are  plunging the Serbian people further into isolation and away from  the world community. Therefore, the aforementioned decision must  be retracted and cancelled."    On the same page, BORBA carried a statement by the  Association of Writers of Serbia titled "Attack Against Freedom  of Thought and Interpretation of Facts." It called the expulsion  order "a dangerous policy of preventing the free flow of  information" and charged that "if this trend continues, Serbia's  spiritual space will become a hopeless wasteland, completely  isolated from all media."    These groups were joined by the "Nezavisnost" (Independence)  Association of City Trade Unions in strongly criticizing the  Serbian Government. It pointed out ironically that the "purge of  foreign journalists sheds much more light on the actual  objectives of this latest democratic offensive by the Serbian  authorities." This is "only a warm-up... before the final  showdown with domestic journalists who think differently."    Nezavisnost's prediction about the ultimate domestic media  target of "the Serbian authorities" was supported by a statement  attributed to Milorad Vucelic, director general of Serbian TV  and Radio, in the 25 April issue of the Belgrade opposition  weekly VREME: "It is not CNN, not the foreign media which made  up all these lies about the Serbian people, but journalists from  Belgrade who write for DANAS, OSLOBODJENJE, VREME, Studija B, TV  Politika, BORBA.... They provide the references for the writings  of the foreign media." The VREME article observed that "bad  omens are accumulating. A change in the membership of the  Association of Journalists of Serbia has been announced, and,  like parrots, the self-appointed patriots keep repeating the  names of the unfit media houses, demanding that `this' question  be resolved once and for all."</p>

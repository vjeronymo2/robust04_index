			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the proposed rules, a ``security rating'' is defined as a credit assessment of an issuer's ability to make payments of principal, interest, dividends (as applicable), or other payments on the instrument being rated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rules also would require disclosure of any designation assigned in connection with a rating organization's evaluation of the security's non-credit payment risks. For example, the evaluations covered by such designation would include an organization's analysis of prepayment speeds, effects of interest rates or other market based factors, event risk provisions, or volatility assessments done in connection with or in addition to a solicited rating. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comment is requested whether all these evaluations should be required to be disclosed and whether any or all these evaluations should be required to be disclosed even if issued in the absence of a solicited security rating. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that the definition of security rating only applies in the context of determining whether a disclosure obligation exists. This release should not be taken to imply that all security ratings would qualify as ``ratings'' for all regulatory purposes under the Commission's other rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  section I.B.2., ``Noncredit Payment Evaluations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Neither ``security rating'' nor ``evaluation'' is intended to include rankings of interests in direct participation programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rules do not mandate, but would continue to permit, disclosure of ratings by rating organizations that are not designated NRSROs. However, the mandated disclosure proposals would extend to ratings assigned by non-NRSROs that are used voluntarily in the prospectus. Comment is requested, however, as to whether disclosure should be required when a non-NRSRO rating is used to market the securities. Historically, the consent requirement has, for the most part, foreclosed disclosure of such ratings. Disclosure of such ratings in the prospectus would continue to require the rating organization to consent to be named in the registration statement as an expert, and thereby assume potential Section 11 liability under the Securities Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 USC 77k.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission solicits comment on the continued appropriateness of its policy of exempting NRSROs from providing consents, while other rating organizations are required to provide consents for their ratings to be disclosed in prospectuses and registration statements. Would the proposed disclosure requirements cause issuers to forgo ratings or seek ratings from non-NRSROs? Should the Commission expand the consent exemption to all ratings organizations? Would this result in ratings being issued by unqualified parties and the potential for investors to be misled? If the exemption were extended to all rating organizations, should the proposed rule mandate disclosure with respect to all ratings obtained by or on behalf of a registrant, whether or not issued by an NRSRO?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, should the exemption be rescinded for NRSROs? If the exemption were rescinded, and rating disclosure were mandated, what would be the effect on the practice of rating securities? Would issuers forgo obtaining ratings? Should the exemption be rescinded even if the Commission were to determine to continue its voluntary disclosure policy? Would this cause issuers to eliminate ratings disclosure in prospectuses and registration statements? If so, would ratings disclosure be eliminated entirely for registered public offerings or disseminated outside the prospectus and registration statement?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, the rules would not require disclosure of unsolicited ratings_ratings issued by a rating organization on securities on its own initiative, not at the request of the company and not used by any participant in the offering. Where the company does not have any involvement with the rating, and does not use or permit the use of a rating in an offering, it would appear unwarranted for it to have to assume disclosure responsibility and liability for such ratings. On the other hand, the ability to disclose a favorable solicited rating and not disclose a lower unsolicited rating arguably could encourage rating shopping and could allow companies to avoid disclosure that there are disagreements about the creditworthiness of a particular security. Should issuers be required to disclose unsolicited ratings by NRSROs if materially different from that disclosed? If so, to what extent should issuers be responsible for ascertaining whether an unsolicited rating has been issued? If such unsolicited ratings are required to be disclosed, should the mandated disclosure be limited to the rating assigned and name of the issuing rating organization? Would mandated disclosure of unsolicited ratings in effect compel issuers to obtain ratings from all NRSROs to protect against having to disclose unsolicited ratings that may be based on incomplete information?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also solicits comment on the need to require disclosure in the prospectus on the method of compensating the rating organization. Likewise, comment is requested as to whether the extent of the rating organization involvement in the structuring of the security should be disclosed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Closed-end investment companies (``closed-end funds'') often issue senior securities that are rated by one or more NRSROs. As with non-investment companies, closed-end funds are not required to disclose these ratings in their prospectuses.

Disclosure Required with Respect to Security Ratings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B are proposed to be amended to specify the disclosure required whenever a security rating is disclosed, either voluntarily or pursuant to Commission rule. The ratings disclosure should tie directly to the description of securities so that potential investors may compare the actual payment obligations, expected payments, and risks with the promises and risks assessed by the assigning rating organization. The proposed rules require description of: (1) What elements of the securities the rating addresses; (2) all material limitations or qualifications on the rating; (3) any related designation (or other published evaluation) of non-credit payment risks assigned by the rating organization with respect to the security; and (4) any material differences between the terms of the security as assumed in rating the security, and the minimum obligations of the security as specified in the governing instruments or, if significantly different, the terms as marketed to investors. For example, the rating description should explain if the security was rated using a yield assumption which differs from the expected yield being marketed to investors. Also, by way of example, a statement that the rating ``covers payment obligations in accordance with the terms of the security'' usually would not be informative where the security permits the issuer to defer interest payments for a specified time period. In this instance, the ratings discussion should explain whether the rating assumes that the interest deferral provision is or is not exercised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

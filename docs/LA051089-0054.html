			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Millionaire businessman P.J. Morgan won the mayoral race in Omaha, ending a  political comeback bid by former Mayor Mike Boyle. With only absentee ballots  remaining to be counted, Morgan had 56,774 votes, or 53.35%, while Boyle  received 48,115 votes, or 45.21%. Boyle, who was recalled from his second term  as mayor two years ago amid allegations he abused his executive power, said  during the campaign that he was a changed man. He contends the recall was  prompted by his controversial management style, something he says has changed.  He said during the campaign that he is a recovering alcoholic and has not had a  drink in more than a year.  </P></p>

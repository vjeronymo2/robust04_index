			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 7 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese official said  here today that China is ready to work together with all other  countries in the Asia Pacific region to make the second Asian  and Pacific ministerial conference on women in development a  success.    Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary-general of the State Council of  the Peoples Republic of China, made the remark in the Chinese  delegation's statement presented here this afternoon. He  recalled that the region has made remarkable progress in women's  affairs, in improving women's social status, etc. However,  because of differences among countries in social development,  historic and cultural background, continued efforts are needed  in this field of work.    He noted that the plan of action to be adopted by this  conference should reflect in full sense the common aspiration  and requirements of women in Asia Pacific.    Toward this end, the Chinese delegation has put forward five  proposals:    First, to take more vigorous measures to help most of over  30  million impoverished women in Asia out of poverty by 2000;    Second, since education is of great significance, China  appeals to the countries in the region to eliminate illiteracy  among young and middle-aged women and provide more opportunities  for women to receive vocational and technical training;    Third, to increase the proportion of women taking part in  decision-making and management;    Fourth, to protect women's rights and interests by  legislation and law-enforcement, to do away with all form of  discrimination against women and to promote equality between men  and women;    Fifth, to encourage women to contribute to and play a  greater  role in maintaining social stability in their respective  countries, promoting intra-regional cooperation and exchanges  and championing peace in the region and in the world at large.    He pointed out that China is convinced that with the efforts  from all the participants, this conference will adopt a plan of  action which can help resolve the major issues facing  Asian-Pacific women and contribute to the preparation and  convocation of the 4th World Conference on Women to be held in  Beijing, China, in September next year.    Senior officials from 47 countries of the Asian and Pacific  region gathered here today to begin the senior officials meeting  from June 7 to 11. The ministerial conference on women in  development will be held from June 13 to 14.    A 38-member strong Chinese delegation led by Chen Muhua,  vice  chairman of the National People's Congress and chairman of the  All- China Women's Federation, arrived here on June 5 to take  part in the senior officials meeting and ministerial conference.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant markets help lift Jones Stroud to Pounds 6.5m JONES STROUD (Holdings), the textiles and electrical accessories group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 6.51m for the year to March 31. The increase was flattered by a Pounds 609,000 exceptional provision taken in the previous period. Turnover improved to Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 65.4m). Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said: 'The rise in profits is due to increased turnover and more buoyancy in our markets, both in the UK and overseas.' 'We have some new products,' he added, 'and we found late last year that the recession lifted a bit. We were the first into the recession and presumably we will be the first out of it as well.' The group supplies the hosiery, electrical engineering, consumer durables, clothing and aluminium tube markets. The textiles market was now the strongest. Mr Jones said two plants had recently been closed and the vulcanised fibre business consolidated onto one site. The group had incurred some trading loss in the previous period because of this. An increased final dividend of 5.5p gives a total for the year of 8.8p (8p); earnings per share were 24.85p (18.05p).</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 800 POUNDS OF POT CONFISCATED FROM ILLEGAL ALIENS ON FOOT  </P> <P> U. S. Border Patrol agents Wednesday night seized 800 pounds of marijuana with  a street value of $750,000 from illegal immigrants transporting the drug on  foot just north of the U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> This is the same area of Imperial Beach where more than 900 pounds of cocaine  were intercepted about a month ago, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Five adults and one juvenile, who identified themselves to authorities as  Mexican citizens, were arrested about 9 p.m., said Dale W. Cozart, San Diego  chief patrol agent.  </P> <P> Agents were still searching for a vehicle that was believed to have been  waiting for the cargo and for an unspecified number of others who were  accompanying the group, some of whom were armed, Cozart said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vehicle Part of Investigation  </P> <P> "There is a vehicle that we were able to identify, and that is part of the  ongoing investigation," Cozart said. He declined to give a description.  </P> <P> Border Patrol agents were near Monument Road and Hollister Street when they  noticed a group of people carrying "large bags" on a ridgeline about half a  mile north of the border, Cozart said.  </P> <P> Border Patrol agents and a helicopter intercepted the group and arrested six  males. Nine duffel bags containing 10-kilo bundles of marijuana were found in  their possession, Cozart said. The others in the group escaped. No other  narcotics were found.  </P> <P> "We believe because of the terrain and our (helicopter) being up, that we took  all of the narcotics into custody," Cozart said.  </P> <P> "We did have information that there were individuals traveling with this group  that were armed. We did not encounter them," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Similar to Cocaine Seizure  </P> <P> The incident is similar to the seizure of 969 pounds of cocaine from "human  mules" in the same area by Border Patrol and U. S. Customs agents May 8. The  cocaine had a street value of $60 million.  </P> <P> Authorities are investigating whether there is a connection between the two  cases.  </P> <P> Those arrested Wednesday on suspicion of transporting a controlled substance  and suspicion of possessing with intent to distribute are:  </P> <P> Alfredo Chavez Martinez, 23; Jose Arturo Ancira Hernandez, 20; Pedro Barraza  Rivera, 19; Armando Quintero Acosta, 33; Ricardo Rojas Morales, 32; and a  16-year-old youth.  </P> <P> The last significant marijuana seizure by San Diego Border Patrol agents was  Jan. 18, when 954 pounds of marijuana were seized near Boulevard in eastern San  Diego County.  </P></p>

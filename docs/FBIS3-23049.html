This, according to Gov. Abdulgani "Gerry" Salapuddin, is  because the Islamic religion is being used to fuel the  commitment of the group's members to turn Mindanao into an  Islamic state.    Basilan is where the group started to gain prominence and  followings. It was founded by Islamic leader Abdulajik  Janjalani.    The military has described the group as "the third force" to  reckon with in Mindanao, after the Moro National Liberation  Front [MNLF] and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).    "This (Abu Sayyaf problem) is more difficult to solve than  mere insurgency," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. He said the  insurgency problems are rooted on political and economic factors.    Once these factors are addressed in a sustained manner, "the  issue will die down by itself," he said. "But not extremism  because ideas and beliefs don't die."    It is likely, he said, that the group will not give in to  any  concession short of the establishment of an Islamic government  in Mindanao.    Abu Sayyaf members are ready to die for their cause,  believing they will go to heaven (or surgah) if they die  fighting.    Salapuddin, a former MNLF commander, continued: "They will  be accorded martyrdom by Allah if they are killed in combat.  This is what new members are taught. It is difficult to  re-orient them otherwise."    It is the appeal on religious extremism, Salapuddin said,  that contributes to the growing appeal of the group to new  members in Mindanao and in Metro Manila.    "Extremism catches fire," he said.    Moreover, the group is reported to be targeting both the  Muslim intellectuals and the poor fishermen "who are not  educated enough to know the true meaning of Islam."    But the majority of more than four million Muslims here are  reportedly not supportive of the cause and ideal propagated by  the Abu Sayyaf.    "Islam espouses moderation, anything that is extreme is not  what Islam teaches," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER.    He urged local government leaders in Mindanao to mobilize  the  local "moderate" Muslim leaders to "counter the spread of  extremism," which had reportedly reached many Muslim-populated  barangays [villages] in Mindanao and Metro Manila.    Meanwhile, he said the top leaders of the Abu Sayyaf have  left Basilan for other places in the country.    He could not say where they have gone to, but he gave this  hint: "Where bombs are exploding, where terrorist activities are  -- you can guess they have leaders there."</p>

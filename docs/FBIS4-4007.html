			<p>BFN     [Text] Ottawa, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Canadian Prime Minister  Jean Chretien said today that his country pays great attention  to its further development of friendly relations of cooperation  with China.    Meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua here, Chretien  said mutually beneficial cooperation between Canada and China  hold out great potential because the two countries, which are  vast in territory and rich in resources, have their own  advantages and share a lot of common ground.    Canada's advantages in the economy and its advanced  technology will be useful for China's development of  infrastructure and modernization drive, he said.    Chretien expressed his warm welcome to the Chinese vice  premier who arrived in Canada 10 days ago for an official visit.  It was a wise and foresight decision in 1970 when the Canadian  Government led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau established  diplomatic relations with China, he said.    Chretien said he is confident that the two countries will  make their efforts to strengthen the good relations.    During the meeting, Chinese Vice Premier Zou said he is  delighted to see the emergence of new trend towards all-round  development in the Sino-Canadian relations.    He said China and Canada are faced with a rare opportunity  to  enhance their ties and a lot of things can be done in the  development of the mutual cooperation between the two countries.    He hopes that the two countries will make common efforts to  promote the Sino-Canadian relations to a new high.    On behalf of Premier Li Peng, Zou also invited Chretien to  visit China later this year at his convenience and Chretien  accepted the invitation. Chretien said he will head a group of  businessmen and provincial premiers for the China visit.    Present at the meeting were Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet,  Finance Minister Paul Marti and Secretary of State  (Asia-Pacific) of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Raymon Chan on  the Canadian side.    On the Chinese side, Vice Chairman of the State Planning  Commission Zeng Peiyan, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, vice  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation Zhen Silin  and Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun attended the  meeting.    After the meeting, Zou left Ottawa for the United States by  a  special plane to attend the funeral of the former U.S. President  Richard Nixon. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu also left here  in the same plane.</p>

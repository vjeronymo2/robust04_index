			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Suifeng (1728 4482 1496): "New Political </F> Body `123 Democratic League' Founded in Hong Kong Today"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  "123 Democratic League," composed of 82 persons from various  circles in Hong Kong, was officially founded today. A founding  declaration was issued which stated that this league is an  organization participating in political affairs on the principle  of "basing itself in Hong Kong, keeping in view the two sides of  the Taiwan Straits, and concerning itself with the development  in three regions." Its aim is: "To support China's peaceful  reunification, promote sincere exchanges between the two sides  of the straits, and safeguard prosperity and mutual benefit in  the three regions."    Today, the "123 Democratic League" held its first general  meeting and elected its first central committee, with 20  members. Chairman of the central committee Jen Shan-ning [0117  0810 2899] said to our staff reporter: The political program of  the league provides that concern for Hong Kong affairs is the  league's most important task, and that besides giving top  priority to Hong Kong, the league especially wishes to make  great efforts to promote Hong Kong's communications and  exchanges with the mainland and Taiwan. He pointed out: Many  people say the 21st century is a century for the Chinese; Hong  Kong is an outstanding community in Chinese society, and  therefore will play a very important role in the 21st century.  Yet Hong Kong is facing a major change in 1997. What direction  Hong Kong will head after 1997 and how Hong Kong's relations  with the mainland and Taiwan will change are very much worth  studying. In this respect, the Democratic League bases itself  in Hong Kong and wishes to have the opportunity to represent the  interests of Hong Kong people and to communicate with both sides  of the straits.    Jen Shan-ning made no attempt to conceal the fact that some  founding members of the Democratic League graduated from Taiwan  colleges and have a good knowledge of Taiwan. However, he did  not accept labeling the league as a "pro-Taiwan" or "right-wing"  political group. He said: The Democratic League has quite a  large capacity, and hopes that the exchanges between the two  sides of the straits and among the three regions will be  predominantly in the form of dialogue. It does not wish to see  any confrontation, and regards as worthwhile anything that will  contribute to communications, exchanges, and mutual benefit  among the three regions.</p>

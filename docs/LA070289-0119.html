			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DEBRIS FROM CITY BUILDINGS TO BE TESTED FOR ASBESTOS  </P> <P> An inspector from the Air Quality Management District, following up on  complaints about possible asbestos contamination from city-owned buildings  being demolished in Lawndale, said Friday that the agency will test debris  taken from the site for asbestos content.  </P> <P> Michael Haynes, an AQMD air pollution specialist, inspected the site Friday  where three city-owned houses had stood, on 167th Street at Osage Avenue, after  two people complained to the agency that material they believed contained  asbestos was being removed from there.  </P> <P> The buildings, in the old city yard, had been used to store surplus city  material, from old tractor tires to city Christmas decorations to inoperable  city vehicles, city officials and residents said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighbors Complain  </P> <P> One of the complaints was filed by Anthony Reed, whose mother and sister live  next door to the yard. Reed said the city did not take sufficient precautions  to prevent dust generated by the demolition from drifting downwind into  neighbors' homes.  </P> <P> He said he had collected several pieces of a siding material Tuesday that city  workers had separated from other debris and placed in 55-gallon drums near a  wall separating his property from the city's.  </P> <P> Reed, who provided pieces of the mint-green material to the AQMD, said he was  told by a city employee working at the site that it contained asbestos.  </P> <P> "I'd like the city of Lawndale to make some kind of determination, whether it's  medical people or a private agency that checks for asbestos," Reed said.  "Unless they prove to us we're safe, I may take (legal) action."  </P> <P> Haynes said that AQMD chemists will test the material and that a report on its  content would be issued next week. If material containing asbestos is found in  connection with demolition at the site, the city could face a citation and a  fine, Haynes said.  </P> <P> Although Haynes said he could not confirm whether the material contained  asbestos, he said it appeared to be a type of siding, no longer in use, that  often contains asbestos, which has been known to cause cancer.  </P> <P> "When they remove it, they should take precautions not to break it up," Haynes  said. The material Reed said he took from the drums was broken into several  pieces.  </P> <P> The problem arose when city officials attempted to expedite the razing of the  buildings, which Public Works Director Jim Sanders said had become an eyesore  and a source of complaints from residents.  </P> <P> After the city opened a new city yard on Manhattan Beach Boulevard east of  Inglewood Avenue, the three old houses at the old city yard fell into disrepair  and attracted vandals, residents said.  </P> <P> "It was ugly; it was terrible," said nearby resident Debbie Larratt. "I was  glad they tore it down, but I wish they'd told us before they did it."  </P> <P> When a contractor who had won a bid to knock down the three buildings failed to  show up to do the job, Sanders said, the city canceled his contract and decided  to do the job itself, using city employees and a rented crawler loader to haul  debris into large bins at the site.  </P> <P> Sanders, who learned how to operate a loader when he was in high school, said  he worked at the site himself after city employees completed their regular  workday at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Sanders, who has worked for the city since April, said city officials hoped to  clear the lot for $4,800 or less, the contractor's estimated cost for the  demolition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Material Being Checked  </P> <P> Sanders said workers separated some concrete siding from other demolition  debris but said he did not know if it contained asbestos.  </P> <P> "We're checking it out," Sanders said.  </P> <P> City Manager Jim Arnold said he and Sanders, who is a civil engineer, had  inspected the site before the city began tearing down the buildings and found  no evidence that the buildings contained asbestos. In the past, he said, if  asbestos was found at a building slated for demolition, the city has hired  specially licensed contractors.  </P> <P> "I think we've done the best we can," Arnold said. "I've seen a lot of  demolition by private contractors, and we're doing a good job."  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Carol Norman, who called Sanders "well-qualified" to oversee  the project, also defended the city's actions.  </P> <P> "If there was asbestos there, it was overlooked in the pre-inspection," said  Norman, adding that Sanders is "a very conscientious young man, and I believe  he probably realized he could save the city (money) by doing it himself."  </P> <P> Norman said Lawndale's budget cuts over the past three years may have been a  factor in Sanders' decision to take on the job.  </P> <P> Sanders said the last of the debris was scheduled to be cleared from the lot  Monday. One use for the lot under consideration is as a park, officials said.  </P> <P> Sanders said Reed is "trying to make an issue out of something that's merely a  minor issue. The major issue is getting this place cleaned up."  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Set the right standards Sir, Richard Gourlay's article, 'Quality under fire' (June 21), on the attack against BS5750 makes excellent points. In particular, the fact that organisations not accredited by the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies are allowed to issue certificates to companies saying they have BS5750, introduces wide variations in standards, and brings the whole system into disrepute. The Department of Trade and Industry should act to stop this outrage and give publicity to the role of the NACCB. Only when this happens will buyers know for certain about the suppliers they deal with. Mike Asher, managing partner, The Quality Partnership, 11 Hale Road, Altrincham, Cheshire</p>

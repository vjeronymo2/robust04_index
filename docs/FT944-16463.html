			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Technology: Working on unity - Attempts by IBM, Apple and Motorola to create a new standard for PCs John Sculley, former Apple chairman and chief executive, called it 'the foundation for a renaissance of technical innovation that will impact the entire computer industry into the 21st century'. 'Together we announce the second decade of personal computing,' added Jack Kuehler, then president of IBM. It was October, 1991. The executives from International Business Machines, Apple Computer as well as Motorola's semiconductor group stood together on a San Francisco stage to announce a technology alliance many believed would create a formidable challenge to Intel and Microsoft, the PC industry duopoly. IBM and Apple said that they would collaborate on a broad range of efforts to create a new 'unified standard' for the next generation of personal computers. Motorola would be the chip supplier to Apple and to any others which might adopt the new standard. Three years on, however, the vast majority of PCs are still based on the Intel-Microsoft combination of chips and software that IBM, Apple and Motorola aimed to overthrow. While the second decade of personal computing is well underway, IBM and Apple are still battling to defend their positions. The two companies that dominated the PC market in the 1980s now have a combined market share of only about 20 per cent. Although the alliance is deemed a success by its three members, IBM, Apple and Motorola have so far failed to create the 'unified PC technology standard' that was to be the centerpiece of their collaboration, the platform upon which they would mount their attack on established PC industry standards. The technology partners got off to a strong start by delivering a family of microprocessor chips called PowerPC, based on IBM's Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) technology and manufactured by IBM and Motorola. The chips are smaller, faster and cost less to produce than Intel's latest Pentium microprocessors. Apple Computer steamed ahead of its alliance partners, launching a new range of 'Power Macintosh' computers based on the first PowerPC chips in March. The new computers have helped Apple to recover from shrinking sales and profits. For Motorola, the alliance has provided the core microprocessor technology for a new generation of chips and salvaged its relationship with Apple - its only microprocessor customer in the PC industry. Other computer manufacturers including Toshiba and Canon of Japan and Groupe Bull of France have announced plans to use PowerPC chips in future computer products. Motorola is also renewing efforts in the computer market with a range of 'PowerStack' computers based on the PowerPC chip, which the electronics company aims to sell through third parties. For IBM, however, the returns on sharing its chip technology with Motorola and Apple have yet to be realised. The introduction of its range of 'Power Personal' computers was recently delayed, for the second time, until next year. 'PowerPC technology has capabilities that don't exist in the current (Intel) technology in terms of speed,' said Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice president and the new head of IBM's PC business, shortly before postponing the introduction of the Power Personal PCs. 'But there are obvious negatives . . . because it does not have an established base of application software.' IBM's delay reflects a fundamental weakness in the alliance strategy. Apple's 'Power Macintosh' computers are not compatible with PowerPC computers designed by IBM and Motorola. Despite sharing common microprocessor technology, the companies' computers cannot run the same software. Without software, a microprocessor is like a new car engine without wheels. It may be an impressive feat of engineering, but it is of little practical use. 'It all comes down to software, software, software,' says David Wu, a PC industry analyst at SG Warburg. To attract third-party software developers who can create applications programs for PowerPC computers, the alliance partners must first establish hardware standards that promise large volumes of compatible computers. 'It used to be that if you built a better mousetrap - a faster microprocessor - then the applications would flood in. That is no longer true. They (software developers) are looking for volume,' says Tom West, senior vice-president of advanced development at Data General. The IBM, Apple, Motorola alliance was flawed from the start, he suggests. 'There is so much ego, corporate identity, and mythology tied up with their (microprocessor) chip agendas . . . Guys, you got it wrong.' Analysts believe that only by aligning computer designs more closely can IBM and Apple achieve the critical mass needed to attract a substantial portion of the software development investment that is made in the PC industry. IBM and Apple have been jousting for several months on this issue, with Apple apparently resistant to changing the design of its Power Macintosh computers and IBM equally determined to make its PowerPC designs the industry standard. (Motorola's recently introduced PowerPC computers comply with IBM's design.) A breakthrough may be close. The companies have intensified their efforts to reach an agreement and Apple said this week that it is 'optimistic' about the outcome of ongoing talks. This has fuelled speculation that IBM might cement its new pact with Apple with an equity investment. A common hardware design is critical if IBM, Apple and Motorola are to fulfil the promise of their 1991 alliance, enabling 'Power' computers to run a wide range of applications programs - including those designed for Apple's Macintosh or IBM's new OS/2 Warp PC operating system. It could, however, take as long as two years for IBM, Apple and Motorola to alter their computer designs and complete operating system software development. By then, Intel and Microsoft will surely throw new competitive challenges in the path of the alliance partners.</p>

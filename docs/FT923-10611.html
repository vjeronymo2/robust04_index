			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings of Japan's brewers fall BRISK sales of beer and soft drinks helped two leading Japanese brewers, Asahi and Sapporo, lift unconsolidated sales for the six months to June. However, the companies reported lower pre-tax profits due to a fall in interest on investments. While Japanese brewers are known for introducing new products and bright packaging, Asahi, which launched 'dry beer' in 1987, said focusing on traditional labels had helped beer sales rise 6.6 per cent to Y294.4bn (Dollars 2.35bn). Sapporo's beer sales meanwhile rose 2 per cent to Y222.3bn. Asahi's operating profits rose 3.1 times to Y18.3bn and Sapporo's 2.4 times to Y7.3bn, thanks to rationalisation of their operations. However, a fall in interest received from bank deposits squeezed profits at the pre-tax level. In the 1980s many Japanese corporations generated profits by issuing commercial paper, and investing the funds in deposits and the money markets. However, companies now face difficulties in gaining profits from such transactions, as interest rates fall and Japanese banks are reluctant to underwrite commercial paper. Meanwhile, losses on securities holdings, following the Tokyo market's slide, totalled Y29.7bn at Asahi and Y10bn at Sapporo. Asahi's non-operating profits fell 61.5 per cent and Sapporo's by 67.6 per cent. For 1992 Asahi expects pre-tax profits to fall 11.2 per cent to Y15.5bn on a 6.2 per cent rise in sales to Y785bn, while Sapporo forecasts a 6.2 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y8.5bn on a 4.1 per cent rise in sales to Y555bn. Asahi Breweries yesterday announced that Mr Yuzo Seto, vice-president, becomes president from September 1, succeeding Mr Yotaro Higuchi who takes over as chairman.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          JAPANESE BREWERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Pre-tax            Revenue          %     profit       %      Net        % Company       (Ybn)    change     (Ybn)   change   profit   change Asahi        357.2       9.6       7.9     -8.5      3.1      0.9 Sapporo      246.8       2.7       4.6     22.5      2.1    -29.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unattributed WEN HUI BAO commentator: "Start a New </F> Round of `Two-Greening Projects'"]    [Text] The annual municipal conference on rural work,  which has become a system adopted by past Shanghai municipal  party committees and municipal governments, was convened on 5  February. The conference decided on four central tasks for this  year, one of which is the primary task of effectively  strengthening the development of agriculture and of focusing on  the "two-greening projects." What is meant by "two-greening  projects?" The first is the vegetable basket project of  concentrating on growing green vegetables in vegetable gardens;  the other is the greening project aimed at improving the  ecological environment. As the two projects concern the daily  life of Shanghai residents and the municipality's ecological  construction, great efforts and strong resolve must be made to  carry them out successfully.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: Little  vegetable baskets have a bearing on the people's daily life,  social stability, reform, and development. Anything that  concerns the people's basic daily life and vital interests is of  utmost importance. From this angle we must understand the  importance of stabilizing agriculture and undertaking the  vegetable basket project; we must, in the spirit of reform,  solve the contradictions and problems we encounter in developing  agriculture and carrying out the vegetable basket project. We  should apply entirely new ideas to carrying out a new round of  high-standard vegetable basket projects for Shanghai in three  years, establishing a perfect system of vegetable basket  projects, and exploring a new path for undertaking vegetable  basket projects for the nineties and for an internationalized  metropolis in the next century.    In recent years, because of the needs of urban development,  vegetable growing and nonstaple food producing bases in the  suburban areas have gradually been shifted to outer areas of the  suburban areas. Therefore, the vegetable basket project must be  steadily advanced in a planned way. It must be stabilized and  upgraded in the course of readjustment. The outstanding problem  faced now is the short supply of green vegetables during the  slack season. In essence, this is due to the lack of  agricultural facilities and the low ability to combat natural  disasters. From the circumstances of the past few years, we  have learned that to develop green vegetable production we  should focus on strengthening the construction of production  bases and that in strengthening the construction of production  bases we should concentrate on the building of large vegetable  growing greenhouses. In Shanghai, the supply of green  vegetables during the slack season will be guaranteed if  vegetables are grown in greenhouses on 25,000 mu of land in its  suburban areas.    We should be aware that the vegetable basket project  involves  many sectors, channels, and links in society. Therefore, it  needs joint efforts and cooperation from various levels and  sectors of society. We should adhere to the principle of  invigorating agriculture through the application of science and  technology. Departments in charge of science and technology  should mobilize and organize technicians to work in the  frontline of production. In particular, they should organize  forces to concentrate on tackling such problems as developing  vegetable and nonstaple food production through intensive,  standardized, and modern methods. Education departments should  assist the suburban areas in speeding up the training of  administrative cadres, technical cadres, and specialized  personnel for the "two-greening projects" and in improving the  quality of rural workers.    An important task in building Shanghai into an  internationalized metropolis is to create a good ecological  environment. While concentrating on the vegetable basket  project, which stresses vegetable production, the masses of  cadres and people in the suburban areas should also pay  attention to grasping the project of greening the environment.  Whether Shanghai can fulfill its greening target for 1994  depends on the efforts of its residents. In the rural areas, it  is necessary to develop greening by planting trees around  housing areas, villages, and alongside rivers and roads;  strengthen the construction of coastal forest belts; and  popularize the greening method of planting economic trees in  housing gardens. Let us act now and strive to create a beautiful  ecological environment in all the suburban areas where "there  will be flowers in spring, shade in summer, fruits in autumn,  and greenery in winter."</p>

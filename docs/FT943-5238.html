			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Markets: Overdoing the caution - Global Investor As analysts speculate feverishly over the outcome of Wednesday's chat between the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England it is worth casting an eye over the recent behaviour of sterling futures. In effect the market has been anticipating an increase in short-term rates of more than a full percentage point by December - in other words, at least two separate half point increases. Notwithstanding the strong probability of some pre-emptive tightening before Christmas, the implicitly draconian forecast looks manic in the light of recent economic data. It certainly appears a backhanded compliment to the credibility of UK monetary policy, as, incidentally, does the behaviour of long-term rates (see chart), where the yield differential in the UK has moved very unfavourably this year against German bunds. The question is whether the markets are overdoing the caution, leaving a big arbitrage opportunity for cooler heads. Some, such as CS First Boston in its September fixed income research bulletin, have unhesitatingly recommended buying the December short sterling futures contract outright. My inclination is on their side of the argument. But it is still worth playing devil's advocate to see what could justify the market's pessimism. The prize candidate for this role is a sterling crisis. The obvious scenario would probably involve market worries about high rates of growth leading to a rapid disappearance of the gap between actual and potential output, quickly followed by inflationary bottlenecks. Against a background of no early increase in base rates and a November budget which is perceived to be excessively political and over-generous, this could easily do the trick. The snag with the argument is that we have already seen some pre-emptive tightening by the bond markets, which have imposed constraints on consumption via the rise in the cost of fixed-rate mortgages. This has coincided with the chancellor's tougher fiscal policy starting to make its mark. The worry about capacity utilisation thus looks premature in relation to a December futures contract. As for the concern about Kenneth Clarke's fiscal and monetary intentions, it presupposes that the man is wholly devoid of judgment. A more interesting case for pessimism is that advanced by Mr Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research. This hinges on Britain's role as a global financial intermediary in a world where the pattern of capital flows looks increasingly perverse. If life were rational, countries with ageing populations in the developed world might be expected to run current account surpluses on their balance of payments and to export capital to developing countries where the risk-adjusted returns are much higher. Yet within the Group of Seven industrialised countries, only Japan comes close to matching that description. Even then, the Japanese last year recycled only half their current account surplus in the form of long-term direct and portfolio outflows. But the most remarkable statistic in the accompanying table is the one that shows Britain, despite being in substantial current account deficit, becoming the biggest net exporter of long-term portfolio capital in the G7 in 1993. The US, too, has recently turned generous with its outflows, especially if direct outward investment of a further net Dollars 37bn is included. Meanwhile, Germany and Italy both received huge portfolio inflows. Part of the reason why the English-speaking economies have been exporting capital despite running current account deficits is that their financial systems are so highly developed. Traditionally, ageing Britons are big savers. But much of their saving has been recycled to younger Britons who borrow more than their counterparts elsewhere. When the inter-generational transfer is netted out, the savings rate proves unduly low and contributes to a large current account deficit. Yet the deployment of the gross savings of the ageing populations of the US and Britain is conducted mainly by fund managers without regard to macro-economic considerations such as the overall level of national savings. This leads to a big financing requirement. Both countries have, in effect, ended up borrowing short and lending long on a huge scale. This leads to an unstable situation, which is more worrying for Britain than the US where external factors are less important for the conduct of monetary policy. Given that the UK economic recovery is more advanced than continental Europe's, Britain will need to cut interest rates again before Germany. That could cut off the short-term inflows, causing sterling to crash. Mr Reading concludes from this that the way to deal with the new external constraint on monetary policy is to allow currencies to take the strain, while the consequences of easier money are offset by tighter fiscal policy. An equally striking feature of the table is the reversal of the biggest net flows, those of Britain and Japan, in the first quarter of this year. Yet in practise they do not represent conventional repatriation since they were largely offset by a return to repayments of borrowing. Because of the historic losses sustained through the appreciation of the yen, Japanese institutions finance much of their international capital excursions in the euromarkets. London, meanwhile, plays host to many leveraged investors in its capacity as an international financial centre. The big swings in the table help explain the extent of the bond market fall-out earlier this year. And, indeed, why burnt investors are leaving such large arbitrage opportunities in the futures markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Total return in local currency to 1/9/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   % change over period                       US    Japan  Germany   France    Italy       UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                0.09     0.04     0.09     0.10     0.16     0.09 Month               0.38     0.18     0.42     0.45     0.69     0.45 Year                2.66     2.66     5.94     6.06     8.38     5.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week                0.50    -0.36     0.00     0.11     0.72     0.57 Month               0.22    -1.13    -0.94    -1.66    -1.70     0.29 Year               -0.89     1.65     3.17     0.81     1.77     1.26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week                0.82    -0.09    -0.21    -0.03     0.46     0.72 Month               0.10    -0.96    -2.44    -3.73    -3.39    -0.02 Year               -4.07     0.32    -1.03    -4.22    -4.63    -2.39  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week                 1.1      0.4      2.1      0.7      0.1     -0.4 Month                2.8      0.8      2.1     -1.1     -1.3      4.2 Year                 4.9     -1.6     13.6     -0.9     10.0      8.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

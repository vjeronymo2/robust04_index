			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Irish central bank cuts STF rate Ireland's central bank yesterday dropped its short-term facility (STF) rate by half a percentage point, to 10.25 per cent the lowest level since late 1991, Tim Coone reports from Dublin. The STF underpins wholesale and commercial money market rates in Dublin, and is now half a percentage point below the 10.75 per cent rate last September just before sterling left the ERM and which brought heavy pressure to bear on the punt and Irish interest rates. The STF has been brought down from 13.75 per cent in a series of cuts, raising the prospect of accelerating depreciation since the punt was devalued by 10 per cent within the ERM last January, and following the series of cuts in German interest rates. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister said yesterday that the latest cut 'clears the way for all lending institutions to make further early reductions in retail interest rates'.</p>

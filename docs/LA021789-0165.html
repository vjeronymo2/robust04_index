			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> MOST CONSTRUCTION STILL ON THE RISE IN ORANGE COUNTY, TWO REPORTS SAY  </P> <P> Construction may be slowing down elsewhere, but not in Orange County. Two new  reports show gains in 1988 in most types of construction in the county.  </P> <P> The F.W. Dodge Group, a McGraw-Hill unit in New York that keeps track of  building contracts, said contracts for construction of offices, stores,  factories and other commercial buildings totaled $1.4 billion in Orange County  last year, up 4% from $1.3 billion in 1987.  </P> <P> Construction contracts for homes and apartments rose 8%, to $1.9 billion from  $1.8 billion, although neither the commercial nor residential construction  categories factors out the impact of inflation on these figures.  </P> <P> Meanwhile the number of building permits issued by local governments for  single-family homes rose 22.6% last year, from 9,368 in 1987 to 11,486, says  the Construction Industry Research Board in Burbank. But multifamily units --  condominiums and apartments -- dropped 22.6%, the board said, from 15,330 units  in 1987 to 11,864 last year.  </P> <P> Altogether, housing units were off 5.5% in the county last year due to the  plunge in multifamily units, according to the research board, a sign that the  housing inventory could get tighter and keep prices in some types of housing  and in certain areas rising sharply.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Message of thanks of  the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea was  recently conveyed to the workers and officials of the Yongsong  associated machinery bureau who had made significant  achievements in the production of ordered equipment.    The associated bureau, a powerful machine-building base, is  proud of being a "powerful enterprise" enjoying deep trust of  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    He gave highly important teachings to the bureau, guiding it  on the spot on several occasions in order to develop it into a  large-scale modern machinery production base.    Comrade Kim Chong-il called at the bureau in May 1984.  Watching the 3,000-ton press operating, he assigned it the task  to manufacture a 10,000-ton press suited to the expanded  economic scale.    Upholding this task, the workers there worked out designs of  the large machine made up of 70,200 parts of some 3,000 kinds in  a few months and successfully built in a little more than one  year a 10,000-ton press which would have taken four or five  years at ordinary pace.    Upon receiving a report about the completion of the  10,000-ton press, Comrade Kim Chong-il visited the bureau again  in March 1986 and praised the workers and officials of Yongsong  repeatedly, saying they had done a big thing, they ere admirable  and the bureau is, indeed, a powerful enterprise.    The bureau was a small machine plant which supplied parts to  factories in the Hungnam area shortly after liberation.    It made a fresh start in its development after the war.    It was widely known as "a hero factory" by making a 510 mm  rolling machine frame and a 1,500 HP speed reducer with highly  efficient single-purpose machines made by it for itself at the  end of the 50s in response to the slogan of the Workers' Party  of Korea "iron and machinery are the king of industry [word  indistinct]."    The bureau, later on, made large machine tools including a  combined processing line of large materials, a 20-metre lathe  and 18-metre turning lathe to reinforce its own processes. And  it greatly contributed to the building of an independent  national economy by producing such complicated and modern  ordered equipment and large machines as a 3,000-ton press,  6,000-ton press, a 10,000-ton press, a 40,000 cubic metre  centrifugal compressor, a 4,000 HP compressor and a large wheel  press.    Now the bureau is pulling full weight on the production of  equipment for accomplishing the comprehensive mechanization of  agriculture on a higher level, large blower of sulfuric acid and  other equipment for fertilizer production, equipment for the  modernisation of light industrial factories and large machines  including Yongsong lathe no. 3 in hearty response to the  decisions of the 1st plenary meeting of the 6th Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.</p>

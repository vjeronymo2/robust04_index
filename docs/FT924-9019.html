			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Seeing red as charges fail to fall - The high cost of overdrafts WHAT goes up does not necessarily come down where overdraft rates on current accounts are concerned. UK base rates have almost halved since their peak of 15 per cent at the beginning of 1990 to 8 per cent today. Savers groan when rates come down, although borrowers should be pleased. However, those with overdrafts at some of the country's largest banks have little reason to cheer. The table shows selected interest-bearing current accounts at banks and building societies and compares the rates on authorised and unauthorised overdrafts in January 1990, when base rates were 15 per cent, with those today. Using the figures in the table, the average authorised overdraft rate has fallen by 2.2 percentage points and the unauthorised rate by only 0.8 of a point, in a period when base rates have dropped by seven points. Authorised rates: It would perhaps be too much to hope that overdraft rates should have fallen in line with base rates over the same period, but many institutions have either held to the same rate or reduced rates by a pitiful amount. Current account holders at Abbey National, the Co-Op and Bank of Scotland will actually be paying more for an authorised overdraft today than they did when base rates were 15 per cent. Nationwide has kept its rates unchanged (a cut is planned later this month) and the majority of institutions which have dropped charges have done so by small amounts. First Direct has only shaved its rate from 20.7 per cent to 20.1 per cent over the period. Barclays and Woolwich have reduced their authorised overdraft charges by less than three percentage points. Halifax and Girobank show the highest falls in charges - of over five percentage points - since the beginning of 1990. Abbey National says that its rates have increased to reflect the higher risks of unsecured lending during the recession. Along with First Direct, Halifax, Nationwide and Woolwich, it does not impose other charges for an authorised overdraft. This can make quite a difference. Which?, the consumer association's magazine, in its survey of banks published this month, found that if you had an authorised overdraft of Pounds 500 and you slipped into the red by that amount for two weeks a month, you would pay Pounds 127 more a year on a Girobank current account than on a Nationwide FlexAccount. 'The charges make the difference and the interest itself is a relatively small part of the overall cost of the overdraft,' said Jane Vass of the Consumers Association. 'But rates are important because banks and building societies have imposed the charges and yet they are keeping interest rates high, too.' Unauthorised rates: The table shows that, on average, the cost of unauthorised overdrafts has gone up since January 1990. For example, Barclays has increased its unauthorised rate fractionally from 35.4 per cent to 35.7 per cent. If you are overdrawn without permission, you have a grace period of Pounds 50 before being charged Pounds 15. If you go above Pounds 200, the fee rises to Pounds 25 a month. Barclays says its overdraft rates are not linked to base rates but reflect the cost of administering an overdraft. However, Royal Bank of Scotland takes a different approach. It says that the rate charged is left to the discretion of the bank manager, who is told that base rates should be used as a broad guide. Girobank says it regards an unauthorised overdraft as an abuse of the account and therefore has no compunction about widening the differential between its authorised and unauthorised rates. Others, including Halifax, argue that unauthorised rates have been kept deliberately high to encourage people to arrange their overdrafts. But Jane Vass said: 'Most people who go into unauthorised overdraft usually do not expect to be overdrawn and have no idea about the rates. One reason why rates are high is that the banks and building societies think people will not notice. It is a cynical attempt to cream off as much as they can.' Once again, charges are crucial to the cost of the overall debt. Which? estimates that if you go into the red without authorisation by Pounds 500 for a week every quarter, you would be paying Pounds 347 more a year on a NatWest Current Plus account than on a Abbey National current account. This is worth looking at in greater detail. Abbey National's unauthorised rate is 34.4 per cent compared with Nat West's 37.6 per cent, so one would expect the overdraft to cost more at NatWest. But, Abbey has no further charges even on an unauthorised overdraft, while NatWest will impose a fee of Pounds 59 a quarter if you exceed your authorised limit by Pounds 50. The warning letter will cost a further Pounds 20. The Co-Op is unusual in having the same rate for both arranged and unauthorised overdrafts but rates on both have increased since January 1990, although there is a three-day grace period before charges are imposed. 'Our rates went up in May 1990 and have not come down since, though they are under review,' said a bank spokesman, defending the rise as reflecting increased lending risks. 'The account is designed for people who stay in credit since it is interest-bearing.' Only Nationwide has attempted to mirror the fall in base rates, but only on its unauthorised overdraft, which has been reduced by seven percentage points. However, its overdraft rate of 36.8 per cent was one of the highest in January 1990. The message to customers is that they should arrange an overdraft with their bank even if they do not envisage needing one. But they should also realise that banks are widening margins at their expense.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              OVERDRAFT CHARGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Jan     Nov                         Jan    Nov                         1990    1992                        1990   1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National current account           Lloyds Classic Authorised              22.4    24.4     Authorised         25.3   21.6 Unauthorised            31.3    34.4     Unauthorised       36.0   32.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Scotland                         Midland Orchard Authorised              19.2    19.5     Authorised         23.8   19.5 Unauthorised            33.6    31.2     Unauthorised       36.0   34.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Interest Option                 Nationwide Flex Account Authorised              24.1    21.3     Authorised         23.8   23.8* Unauthorised            35.4    35.7     Unauthorised       36.8   29.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Co-Op Ultra Account                      NatWest Current Plus Authorised              29.8    31.4     Authorised         24.5   19.9 Unauthorised            29.8    31.4     Unauthorised       35.7   37.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First Direct Cheque Account              Royal Bank of Scotland Authorised              20.7    20.1     Authorised         negotiable Unauthorised            36.0    34.3     Unauthorised       negotiable  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Girobank Keyway                          Woolwich Current Account Authorised              24.8    19.5     Authorised         23.8   21.0 Unauthorised            30.5    31.3     Unauthorised       34.4   33.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax Maxim Authorised              25.3    19.8 Unauthorised            34.4    34.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Rate to be cut to 21 per cent on 16 November  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Based on Abbey National Quarterly Round-Up  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

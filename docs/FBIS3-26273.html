Yesterday afternoon, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial  party committee, traveled to Harbin Engineering College to hold  talks with several class masters with a doctor degree who have  enjoyed great prestige internationally. First of all, Sun  Weiben introduced to specialists the whole province's economic  and social development situation of last year and the whole  province's work arrangements of this year.    The specialists expressed congratulations on the province's  achievements in increasing the economy by five percent and  ranking the province ninth in the national economic and social  comprehensive index last year. They said: The great  achievements which the province had made under a situation of  heavy burdens showed that last year's work arrangements made by  the provincial party committee and the provincial government  were correct and that they had done their work with utmost  efforts. They believed that as long as they continue to act in  line with the established principles of the provincial party  committee and the provinical government, persist in reform and  opening up, uphold the plan of relying on science and technology  to develop the economy, it will not take a long time to enable  our province to become an economically strong province. They  also offered their own views on the economy and science.    Professor (Liu Yuntan), member of the China Academy of  Sciences, said: The slogan of relying on science and technology  to develop the economy has been chanted for many years.  However, this issue has remained unresolved. This is caused not  only by the unenthusiastic work style of scientific and  technical workers and enterprises but also the structure. (Yang  Shiqun), president of Harbin Engineering College, believed that  this is mainly caused by concepts. Enterprises are more  enthusiastic in making money than in using science and  technology. Professor (Wang Menhu) said: Large and  medium-sized enterprises are the burdens of Heilongjiang, but  they are also the endowed advantages. It is very difficult to  solve these burdens, however, if we realisticlly rely on science  and technology to transform the traditional industries into high  technology industries, Heilongjiang will surely become an  economic giant. [passage omitted]    The specialists also suggested that the provincial  authorities should issue some preferential policies as quickly  as possible, build a trans-city and trans-regional contingent of  trained personnel, and enable top-notch personnel of about 35  years old to settle down at ease in Heilongjiang.    Secretary Sun Weiben thanked the specialists for offering  suggestions. He said: These suggestions will be very helpful  to our province's future work. We should properly analyze the  reasons behind the issues on transforming achievements and on  trained personnel, and solve them one by one in an effort to  enable the economy of Heilongjiang to realistically leap forward  under the stimulation of our strong science and technology.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Once again, the Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] failed to attend a Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] meeting  this morning. That CCF meeting is now scheduled to be held on  21 March. The Renamo team did not even bother to provide the  government with any explanation for its absence. The CCF was to  discuss the evolution of the troop confinement and  demobilization processes. It was also supposed to discuss the  possibility of [words indistinct] selection of war materiel to  be used by the new army.</p>

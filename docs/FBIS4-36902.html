			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Nasirite Arab Democratic Party; place and </F> date not given]    [Excerpts] When our party agreed to participate in the  national dialogue called for by the president of the republic,  it had hopes that the dialogue would signal the revival of  Egyptian political life and serve as the beginning of  discussions on the basic, genuine issues of our nation with a  view toward ending the crisis our nation has been experiencing  for years. [passage omitted]    The president's decision forming the so-called committee to  prepare for the national dialogue came as a major shock that  immensely frustrated Egyptian political circles. The formation  of the committee was totally contradictory to the agreement  among the political parties. The formation of the committee was  supposed to come as a result of consultations among the  political parties, not a decision by the National Democratic  Party [NDP].    The overwhelming majority of the committee members are  affiliated with the NDP, which is to blame for all the policies  that caused the current crisis in the country. This was an  ominous indication that its purpose is not to launch a serious  political dialogue in which the energies of the nation are  mobilized, creating a new hope, but to establish an elegant  democratic facade to deceive our people at home and the world  abroad--a facade behind which the current policies are justified.    It was not possible for our party to accept this fait  accompli, especially considering that the committee includes  some people who left their original posts a long time ago and  devoted themselves to abusing and cursing the greatest and  noblest symbols of our nation at the political and intellectual  levels, and others who have dedicated their lives to defending  Israel and Zionism.

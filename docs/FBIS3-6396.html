			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  briefed delegates of 35 member states today on the activities of  the inspection team for North Korean nuclear facilities and  established a policy to seek follow-up measures, including  convening an emergency Board of Governors meeting, if the  inspection activities and results are concluded to be  unsatisfactory.    Following is a report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from  Vienna:    [Begin Cha recording] The IAEA is in a dilemma that it could  not easily show dissatisfaction although inspections on North  Korean nuclear facilities, which had been resumed after much  effort, were insufficient.    The IAEA had a meeting this afternoon presided by Director-  General Hans Blix to evaluate inspection activities on North  Korea after receiving a general report from the inspection team  which has just returned. It has been learned that during the  meeting, the inspection team reported that although inspections  on North Korea do not meet the requirements of IAEA's check list  but, compared with past inspections, there had been improvement  in inspection activities, including the replacement of  surveillance devices, and that the continuity of inspections can  be recovered if such inspections continue regularly.    The inspection team also reported that not enough samples  were extracted to prove whether or not North Korea had used  nuclear materials for other purposes.    It is not yet known whether Director-General Hans Blix has  concluded the inspection to be satisfactory or not after  receiving the inspection team's report. It is analyzed that the  Director- General will have difficulty to make an immediate  conclusion because he has to take into account both the  inspection's technical aspect and international political aspect.    The 35 member states of the IAEA will hold an emergency  nonofficial Board of Governors meeting late tonight to receive a  general report from the Director-General and to discuss  follow-up measures for the inspection results.

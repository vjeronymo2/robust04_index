			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Iron curtain in the way of trade Let us imagine that someone had predicted 10 years ago the collapse of Europe's communist regimes. He would have been dismissed as an optimistic fool. Suppose that he had then gone on to say that after a hard struggle to reform their economies, the former communist countries would find their goods banned by a European Community that claimed to be operating a single market? He would have been dismissed this time as a Soviet agent trying to fob off dissidents with horror stories. Unfortunately, horror stories have a habit of coming true. According to an analysis by Jim Rollo and Alastair Smith in the April issue of Economic Policy (published by the Cambridge University Press), between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the exports of central and eastern European countries fall in the 'sensitive' category. This means they are liable to face EC barriers over and above the modest common external tariff. For Hungary, the worst hit country, the proportion may be as much as 58 per cent. For Poland and the former Czechoslovakia it is about 44 per cent. The percentages are based on the last 'pre-transition' year, 1989. Since then exports of these sensitive products have risen less than total exports, Poland being an exception. The high level of EC protection is the most likely cause of the poor performance of these sensitive sectors. Three of the most advanced central European countries - Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia (as it then was) - signed 'Europe' agreements with the Community which came into effect on March 1 1992. Romania and Bulgaria have subsequently followed suit. These agreements committed the signatories to industrial free trade to be achieved within 10 years. In principle, the EC countries will dismantle their barriers faster, in about five years. Unfortunately, as Rollo and Smith put it, 'there remains a core group of goods for which substantial protection remains in place, either permanently or for some years, or for which past protectionist behaviour on the part of the EC suggests that liberalisation may be more apparent than real. These are generally characterised as 'sensitive' products.' The protective instruments used by the EC are all too familiar: tariff quotas, import ceilings, 'voluntary' restraints and anti-dumping procedures. The six main sensitive manufacturing sectors are: processed foods, textiles, clothing, footwear, steel and chemicals. Free access to agricultural produce would not be possible without dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy - good sense we cannot expect. The characteristic instrument of the CAP is the variable import levy designed to achieve a target level of EC farm-gate prices. The main form of concession to non-member countries would normally be a levy-free quota. A more radical solution, short of abolishing CAP, would be actual membership of the Community for the central Europeans, which still remains an aspiration without a timetable. Rollo and Smith attempt to measure the effects of extensive liberalisation on EC producers and consumers. The loss to EC farm producers is put at 3 per cent of total revenue spread over a period. This is much less than the falls in real farm prices between 1985 and 1991 and very much less than the cuts under CAP reform negotiated in conjunction with the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The effects will be most severe in Greece, Ireland and certain regions of Italy and France. The authors estimate that the gains to consumers and taxpayers in the EC from lower agricultural prices will be sufficient to compensate the farmers who lose and still leave Community consumers and taxpayers better off. The same would be true in manufactures, although the size of producers' losses would be less. What could happen without liberalisation was outlined by Hans-Werner Sinn, of Munich University, in the same issue of Economic Policy. He did not believe that the patience of former communist countries was infinite. If they did not enter a self-sustained growth process in the next few years, new nationalist movements might gain power, which would revert to centralised decisions or even dictatorship. This would be the end of the reform process. Western Europe would again be forced to increase its military spending, borders would be closed and the cold war would return. 'This would create huge welfare losses for the west which dwarf the temporary difficulties of some sensitive sectors.' Signs that central European politicians were indeed running out of patience were evident at a conference in Copenhagen in April between ministers of the EC and some former communist countries. The atmosphere was not improved by an EC temporary ban on meat and dairy products from that region because of foot-and-mouth disease. The Czech foreign minister, Mr Pavel Bratinka, noted that there had been no foot-and-mouth disease in his country since 1974. He added: 'From now on, the almost automatic support given hitherto by the Czech republic to anything bearing the label EC will exist no more.' There were several cases of foot-in-mouth from the Community side. The new French minister for European affairs, Alain Lamassoure, pleaded for greater commercial integration in the east to teach la vie communautaire. He thought it an absurd paradox that eastern Europeans were demanding free trade with the west while maintaining barriers with their neighbours. He received a prompt answer from the forthright Hungarian foreign minister, Geza Jeszenszky, who said: 'East-west trade is simply superior to east-east trade.' Hungary, Poland and the former Czechoslovakia have indeed launched the Visegrad project, which involves mutual free trade over 10 years. But western attempts to get them to include more former communist countries in the arrangement as an alternative to turning west are misguided. Why this is so is well explained in another publication, this time by Daniel Gros and Alfred Steinherr (Redesigning Economic Geography After the Fall of the Soviet Empire, Centre for European Policy Studies, Brussels). The authors show that the normal development of trade is between rich countries with large amounts of capital relative to labour, and less developed countries with less capital. At this stage, there is little trade between countries with similar capital and labour endowments. That comes later when countries are developed enough to specialise in the industrial goods exchanged among the rich. The authors illustrate the point with the example of the Baltic states. Until recently more than 80 per cent of the total trade of the Baltic countries was with the former Soviet Union. On the other hand, Finland, which is in a very similar position, conducted only about 11 per cent of its trade with the former Soviet Union and 45 per cent with the Community. The reason, of course, was that the Baltic states had no choice while Finland could mostly follow its commercial advantage. The inference is that left to themselves, the Baltic states will want to switch the bulk of their trade towards western Europe. The two Brussels authors make a strong plea for a wider free trade area, including not only central and eastern Europe but most of the former Soviet Union. This should surely be the next project after the Maastricht treaty is out of the way. This need not prevent those European countries that are ready from going full-speed ahead towards monetary union. But they need an economic framework not provided by Maastricht for a much bigger new single market covering most of Europe, and a looser political framework in which subsidiarity would be more than a word.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRODUCTS FACING EC BARRIERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARES IN TOTAL EXPORTS TO EC 1989 (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Czechoslovakia  Hungary  Poland  Bulgaria  Romania  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Iron &amp; steel                    12.5      4.9     5.3      10.5      5.0 Chemicals                       11.6     10.0     6.7      11.8      4.4 Footwear, textiles   &amp; apparel                     12.6     17.6    11.7      11.6     19.5 Food &amp; live animals              8.0     25.3    19.9      16.3      3.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                           44.8     57.8    43.8      50.2     32.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EXPORT DESTINATIONS 1989 (% OF TOTAL EXPORTS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Czechoslovakia    Hungary    Poland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                                15.7       25.0      28.9 USSR                              30.5       25.1      24.5 Other Eastern Europe              23.3       15.9      16.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Rollo and Smith, Economic Policy, Cambridge University Press, April 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

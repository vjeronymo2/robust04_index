			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Bank plans to boost lending THE World Bank plans a big increase in lending to developing countries this year after a slowdown over the last 12 months. The Washington-based development organisation aims to boost lending from its core unit, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), to between Dollars 18.5bn and Dollars 21.5bn (Pounds 10.9bn) this year. The World Bank says in its annual report, published this morning, that IBRD loan commitments in its 1992 fiscal year, ending June 30, fell to Dollars 15.2bn from Dollars 16.4bn the previous year, as lending in eastern Europe slowed and big development projects were suspended in Turkey, Yugoslavia, Algeria and Egypt. The bank also expects to increase loans from its affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA), which concentrates on lending at concessional rates of interest to the poorest developing countries. IDA commitments are expected to reach about Dollars 7.4bn this year, against Dollars 6.6bn in the year ending June 30. With sustainable poverty reduction, environmental protection and private-sector development now its priorities, the World Bank says in its report that it has placed new emphasis on its portfolio of existing loans, rather than on making new loan commitments. The bank has introduced a carrot and stick approach to encourage borrowers to keep up with loan repayments. A country that falls 30 days behind in its payments will have no new projects presented to the board for approval. If it falls 45 days behind, even previously approved loans will not be signed. On the other hand the bank has waived half of the 50 basis point interest rate spread which it charges on loans to borrowers who pay on time.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Declaring that federal policies are wasting far more energy than could ever be  pumped from oil and gas fields off the California coast, a parade of witnesses  Wednesday urged a task force appointed by President Bush to push for a national  energy policy that stresses conservation and development of alternative energy  sources. The strongly worded pleas, combined with opposition to offshore oil  and gas drilling by most of the state's ranking constitutional officers, came  as the President's Outer Continental Shelf Leasing and Development Task Force  pressed its review of controversial plans to open up millions of acres of  offshore tracts to oil and gas development. Bush appointed the task force March  21 to review those issues and directed it to report back to him next January.  </P></p>

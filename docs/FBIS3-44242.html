Angolans,  as a whole, long for peace.    Meanwhile, diplomatic sources following the talks say the  proceedings continue today with the discussion of the final  aspects on the formation of the new national police force.  Yesterday, the sides agreed on specific issues. The sources  stressed that the two sides regard as possible the approval of  the general document on the second round of talks. It has been  suggested that the delegations are committed to establishing a  just peace for Angola, despite the military operations carried  out by the Luanda regime with the backing of one of the  observers to he peace process. This has created a great deal of  confusion about Russian's role in the ongoing talks.</p>

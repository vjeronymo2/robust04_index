			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Five-year plan to boost jobs drafted THE French government has finalised a five-year plan to fight unemployment by reducing hiring costs while maintaining social benefits, the labour ministry said yesterday. Officials said the scheme would be the centrepiece of government strategy to reduce unemployment, forecast to rise to 12.5 per cent by the end of the year. But they would give no details before the formal announcement tomorrow. The plan is expected to include a timetable for the government to take over from employers the social security charges for employees' families. The government has already cut employers' payments for lowest paid workers and is committed to doing away with them entirely. The SMIC inflation-indexed minimum wage may also be modified. Many employers and political commentators regard it as a principal cause of unemployment, particularly among the young. The jobless rate for 18-25-year-olds is about 20 per cent, one of the highest in Europe.</p>

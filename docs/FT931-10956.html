			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Stockbroker barred THE former head of a Manchester stockbroking firm has been barred by the Securities and Futures Authority after he took Pounds 40,000 from an elderly client's building society account to bolster his firm's capital. Mr Brian de Vecchis, formerly chairman of Central Stockbroking Services, used the money after his firm failed to meet the SFA's minimum capital requirements last August. The regulatory body said that the money has been repaid to the client, and that the broking firm had been reprimanded and had agreed to sever all connections with Mr de Vecchis.</p>

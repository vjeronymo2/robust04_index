			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP)--China slammed Thursday [14  April] a British parliamentary report that painted a grim  picture of post-1997 Hong Kong, depicting Beijing as  intransigent on the questions of human rights and democracy.    While admitting that Beijing had yet to make a full study of  the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report released  Wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said an  initial reading showed it to be factually incorrect and  supportive of London's erroneous policies on Hong Kong. "This  report, in total disregard of the facts, actually tries to  defend the series of erroneous practises of the British  government and (Hong Kong Governor) Chris Patten on the issue of  Hong Kong," Shen said. It also "supports them to continue on  their wrong way," he added.    The highly critical 100-page report on Sino-British  relations  up to and after 1997, when the British colony reverts to Chinese  rule, said the breakdown in negotiations between Beijing and  London signalled "the probable end of the process envisaged in  1984 of a 'through train' to 1997 and beyond. The "through  train" concept, built into the 1984 Basic Law and Joint  Declaration on Hong Kong, assumed those elected to the colony's  Legislative Council (Legco) in 1995 would continue to serve out  their terms after the handover.    However, says the report: "China has announced that the  Legco elected in 1995 will be disbanded in 1997, and indeed, the  Chinese may seek to undermine its authority before that date. A  British government is powerless to prevent this from happening."  Shen said the Chinese side would comment further on the report  after making a full study of its contents.</p>

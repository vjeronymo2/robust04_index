			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Strange Statements and Stranger Attitudes by </F> the United States"]    [Text] U.S. sources have pointed out that Israel's  acquisition of 45 fighter aircraft of the latest version will  enable the Israeli air force to hit sites in Libya, Iraq, and  Iran, thanks to the aircraft's capability for long-distance  flights. This is the first time the U.S. Government has  approved the sale of aircraft of this advanced type to another  state, as it had been used exclusively by the U.S. Air Force.    It is strange for U.S. sources to single out these three  states, two Arab states and an Islamic state, regardless of the  kind of policy adopted by the latter. In addition, the position  of U.S. President Bill Clinton's government on the question of  the international inspection of sites said to be used by North  Korea to produce nuclear weapons and its threats to conduct air  strikes against South Korea should it reject international  inspection of its nuclear facilities are surprising to many.  They also bring into question the real reason prompting the  current U.S. Administration and the preceding administrations to  ignore any mention of the nuclear weapons that Israel managed to  produce and store in the Negev desert a long time ago and to  turn a blind eye to the Tel Aviv government's continued refusal  to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This refusal is a  flagrant defiance of the world community and the treaties  endorsed by the majority of countries.    Washington cannot claim to be ignorant of Israel's nuclear  activity, something that is known to all scientific intelligence  services, which know the number of nuclear bombs produced by the  Dimona reactor and other hidden facilities. Moreover, every now  and then the Israeli intelligence services leak information  about the nuclear weapons that Israel possesses, the purpose of  which is clear: to spread panic and anxiety among the  neighboring and non-neighboring Arab states. If we add to this  Washington's vacillating position over the tragedy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which encourages the Serbian leaders to  continue their barbaric aggression and ethnic cleansing  operations against Muslims there, we will realize the real  feelings governing the attitude of the U.S. Administration, no  matter how much it tries to pretend goodwill, with which  Washington officials' statements are replete!</p>

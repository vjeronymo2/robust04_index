			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> INDIA'S BHARATA NATYAM AT THE JAPAN AMERICA  </P> <P> Though tracing its origins to before 300 BC, Bharata Natyam, the classical  dance idiom of southern India, is nonetheless an evolving art form. One major  area of recent experimentation has been in going beyond the traditional  restriction to a solo dancer -- who fluidly interprets a number of characters  in a single piece -- to introducing several dancers on stage at once.  </P> <P> The Dhananjayan family -- Padmashri V.P., Shanta and their 14-year-old son  Satyajit -- provided impressive examples of both formats Saturday at the Japan  America Theatre. The Dhananjayans are from India; their concert was sponsored  by the local Shakti Foundation for the Performing Arts.  </P> <P> The two elder Dhananjayans actually found a creative, easy link between  traditional and new in the question-and-answer format of the hourlong dance  drama, "Shiva Shakti Vel." This allowed a sequence of brilliant solos to flow  naturally one after one another as Parvati questions her consort, Lord Shiva,  about cosmic matters.  </P> <P> Those issues resolved, the two found renewed bliss in passages of fluent  mirror-image symmetries, followed by a sequence leading to the birth of a son  who would help gods and mankind slay ignorance.  </P> <P> Still, it was Dhananjayan's solo depiction of Shiva taming the Ganga (a.k.a.  Ganges) by letting the river flow through his hair that drew a spontaneous  ovation from the largely Indian audience.  </P> <P> The program had opened with a series of solo works, heavily weighted in the  direction of "expressive" dance, in which mime and gesture predominated in  interpreting a text. More movement-involved works were danced by the  already-accomplished and still-promising young Satyajit.  </P> <P> Dhananjayan gave informative spoken introductions to each of the dances,  regularly indicating key mime or gestural motifs.  </P> <P> Providing excellent musical support were vocalist Reji George, flutist R.  Gopinath and drummer N. D. Kannan. CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

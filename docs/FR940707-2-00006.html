			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Consultation with persons outside of Agency._The regulation is being published as an interim rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with a request for comments. Implementation of this program is required by legislation. No consultations have been made at this time; however, comments on the interim rule will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Confidentially provided to respondent._No assurance of confidentiality is provided to applicants and grantees beyond that required by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Questions of a sensitive nature._There will be no collection of any information that would be considered sensitive in nature or commonly considered private.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Annualized costs to Federal Government and respondents._The Agency estimates the cost to the respondents to comply with this regulation to be $78,715. This is based on an estimate of 100 organizations filing a preapplication and the Agency making 50 of them a grant. The Agency used $13.00 per hour based on information from similar programs. It is estimated that the primary respondents for the grantee would be a director earning $10.80 to $15.45 per hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost to the Federal Government to collect and evaluate this information is estimated to be $71,718. This includes staff time, printing, publication of regulations, operational expenses, and overhead. Staff time will vary with appropriation levels because the amount of available resources does affect how many applicants will apply and need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation for funding and how many projects will need monitoring and servicing. This estimated cost is based on the grants being approved and serviced in the State Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Estimate of burden._We estimate the total annual man hours required to comply with this regulation to be 6,055. It is estimated that 100 organizations will file a preapplication and 50 grantees will be selected for funding. This estimate is based on historical data from similar FmHA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Reason for changes in burden._This is an initial request for OMB clearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Tabulation, analysis, and publication plans._The information collected is not for the purpose of publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart F_Rural Technology Development Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Table of Contents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 4284.501&blank;Purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.502&blank;Policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.503&blank;[Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.504&blank;Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.505&blank;Applicant eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.506&hyph;4284.514&blank;[Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.515&blank;Grant purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.516&blank;Ineligible grant purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4284.517&hyph;4284.526&blank;[Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

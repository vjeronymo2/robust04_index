			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F> correspondent Dmitriy Vosboynikov on 25 February; place not  given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] As you know, an initiative was put  forward by Russia recently for the leaders of the five leading  states to hold a meeting on the settlement in Bosnia. Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev today stated his point of view  on the prospects for such meeting.    [Kozyrev] It seems to me that this idea is gaining more and  more support. Late last night I had a telephone conversation  with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, where he said it  should be well prepared and that this meeting, proposed by the  Russian president, provided an answer to the main question  confronting us at the moment -- how to prevent the bird we have  managed to catch in Sarajevo slipping from our hands.    [Voskoboynikov] Are you planning a meeting with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher? Quite a lot of issues  worth your discussing seem to have accumulated lately, such as  Bosnia or the Ames affair.    [Kozyrev] I would like to say that it was a proposal of the  president, who suggested a serious discussion of strategic  matters with President Clinton. With us it is, as it were, as  if a car were going along the road of partnership, but when a  sharp bend occurs on that road, then it starts vibrating because  it lacks various mechanisms. A stabilizing device is needed. A  stabilizing strategy for mature partnership -- that is what it  is all about. It was with this in mind that a meeting of  ministers was proposed. At the moment we are searching for the  best solution, but it is a fact that I received an official  invitation today.</p>

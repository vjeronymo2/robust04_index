			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24, IRNA--Iranian Ambassador to Beijing  Mohammad Hoseyn Mir-Fakhr and editor-in-chief of the country's  English daily CHINA DAILY, Zhu Uing Huang [name as received],  Tuesday exchanged views on ways of expanding cooperation in the  news field.    Mir-Fakhr welcomed cooperation between the Iranian and  Chinese press and said this would foil the propaganda launched  by the western media, which portrays news based on its own  interests.    Zhu said in reply that cooperation between Iranian and  Chinese news agencies could obviate the influence wielded by  western news. He added that western news sources never reflect  positive points regarding the achievements of Iran and China but  always try to beam negative news about them.    Zhu proposed that besides the "new world order" there should  be a "new news order" in the world. He announced his paper's  readiness to cooperate with the Iranian press in this regard.    The two sides also stressed an exchange of visits between  editors-in-chief of the two countries' dailies.</p>

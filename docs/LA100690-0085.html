			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS SURPRISES KENNEDY, 20-0  </P> <P> Statistically, the game had the best pair of Valley-area City Section running  backs, the best pair of quarterbacks, the top two receivers and the top two  point-producers.  </P> <P> Buy a new battery for that calculator, this seemed destined to be one for the  books. Bone up on the math. The sum would be something.  </P> <P> Added together, though, it equaled a game in which a special-teams play was the  back breaker.  </P> <P> Granada Hills High quarterback Bryan Martin threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to  Derrick Stewart as the Highlanders defeated rival Kennedy, 20-0, in a Northwest  Valley Conference opener Friday night at Kennedy.  </P> <P> With Granada Hills leading, 7-0, in the fourth quarter, Martin settled back  into punt formation. He made eye contact with Stewart, who had lined up on the  left flank, where Kennedy had left him uncovered.  </P> <P> "It's just an automatic," said Martin, who completed eight of 15 passes for 159  yards and two touchdowns. "I noticed on the first couple of punts they took  their time getting out there on him."  </P> <P> Martin never knew how much time he had. In actuality, Kennedy had just 10 men  on the field -- junior Ronnie Gipson was standing on the sideline instead of  covering Stewart.  </P> <P> Stewart collected Martin's lob and sprinted down the sideline, easily beating  Frank Conley to the end zone for a 13-0 lead with 10 minutes 46 seconds left.  </P> <P> "It was a tough night for Gipson," Kennedy assistant Tom Sams said. "I thought  we played pretty good except for three plays."  </P> <P> You guessed it -- Granada Hills (3-1, 1-0 in league play) scored on each of  them.  </P> <P> Granada Hills fullback Brett Washington scored on a 19-yard run with 2:17 left  to give the Highlanders a 20-0 lead. The touchdown also gave Washington the  school career scoring mark of 192 points, surpassing the 187 points set by Greg  Fowble in 1984-85.  </P> <P> The Highlanders held Kennedy running back Ontiwaun Carter to just 81 yards in  24 carries. It marked the third time in as many seasons that Granada Hills has  shut down Kennedy (3-1, 0-1) with Carter in the backfield.  </P> <P> A pair of promising-looking Kennedy drives bogged down in the first half. On  the Golden Cougars' second possession, Carter carried 12 times in a 13-play  drive that stalled at the Granada Hills 24.  </P> <P> On a fourth-and-18 play, Kennedy lined up for a 42-yard field goal, but holder  Tavarus Logie -- also the team's backup quarterback -- pitched a shovel pass to  Jimmy Rodriguez, who was hammered for no gain.  </P> <P> On the next play, Highlander tailback Stewart broke down the left sideline for  a 43-yard gain. Six plays later, with 4:23 left in the half, Martin hit tight  end Kyron Motton in the left corner of the end zone from 13 yards. Motton, who  made an acrobatic catch while spinning to his right and falling over backward,  beat Gipson.  </P> <P> It marked the first points the Golden Cougar defense had allowed this season.  Kennedy had outscored its first three opponents, 106-2.  </P> <P> Kennedy again failed to score on its ensuing possession despite driving to the  Granada Hills 15-yard line, primarily behind quarterback Mike McMullen's  completions of 19, 14 and seven yards to receiver Keith West.  </P></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Institutions on the sidelines Two large sterling issues helped the eurobond market creak back into action after the widespread public holiday closures on Monday. But syndicate managers found scant cheer, noting that the big institutional players remained on the sidelines. Royal Bank of Scotland's Pounds 150m offering of 21-year paper soaked up what institutional demand there was in the market. The bonds were priced to yield 125 basis points above the 9 per cent gilt due 2012, the most liquid equivalent bond. The issue was aimed at UK groups with long-term investment needs and represented Royal Bank's first foray into the eurosterling sector since the middle of last year. Lead manager UBS said a 'good proportion' of the bonds had been placed but they would remain in syndicate overnight due to volatility in the gilt market. The other big sterling deal was carried out by DSL Finance which issued Pounds 100m of five-year debt priced to yield 34 basis points above the relevant gilt. Traders said the pricing was too aggressive. They noted that the spread on the recent Credit Local offering had widened to 40 basis points over gilts from a launch spread of 37 basis points. Later in the afternoon DSL Bank issued Dollars 300m of five-year paper priced to yield 22 basis points above the equivalent US Treasury. KfW, Germany's state-owned export financing and development aid bank, tapped the dragon bond market for the first time when it raised Dollars 300m through an offering of five-year bonds. Joint bookrunners Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank said the bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 per cent, were well received throughout the Asia Pacific region and added that a number of European names also took up tranches. However, some London dealers said that, although it was one of the best-priced deals of the day, the yield spread still widened when it began to trade. The spread on issue was 24 basis points over five-year Treasuries but widened later to 27 basis points. KfW's closeness to German government debt enhanced the appeal of its bonds to Asian investors: to date the embryonic dragon bond market has largely been the preserve of non-corporates. Attractive arbitrage opportunities encouraged Kredietbank, the big Belgian commercial bank, to launch a CDollars 100m issue of five-year eurobonds. The borrower is believed to have swapped the proceeds into floating-rate dollars, achieving a sub-Libor cost of funding. Lead manager ABN Amro said the bonds were targeted at Belgian retail investors who want to roll over their Canadian dollar investments which are due to mature in the next month. Elsewhere, Eurofima's SKr800m launch of five-year bonds offered investors current-coupon paper in a sector which has seen yields widen by around 250 basis points in recent months.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Pentagon bans smoking After Britain's Royal Navy abandoned the rum ration, it was perhaps only a matter of time before the US armed services stopped smoking. That time came yesterday when the Pentagon announced a workplace smoking ban. The new policy will still allow soldiers and sailors to light up a cigarette in designated areas of military barracks, clubs and restaurants, but will rule out Pentagon offices and hallways, as well as the inside of a tank or aircraft. Smoking below the decks of US Navy ships has already been virtually outlawed. The armed forces have traditionally smoked much more than the population at large, and despite aggressive steps to curb smoking, the rate of addiction remains high. Navy officials said around 37 per cent of Navy personnel were now smokers, compared with around 27 per cent in the general US population. The move was therefore welcomed by anti-smoking campaigners, who have been pressing for tougher curbs on smoking in the wake of the Environmental Protection Agency's recent decision to classify passive smoking as an environmental hazard. Some shopping malls and restaurant chains, including McDonald's, have banned smoking on their premises, and legislation is being debated in Congress that would bar cigarettes from all public buildings. Tobacco companies also face scrutiny over reports that they add nicotine to their products in order to maintain addiction - a charge that has led the Food and Drug Administration to consider regulating cigarettes as a drug. Justice Department officials are also conducting a monopoly investigation into allegations that tobacco companies agreed to keep a cigarette which presents less of a fire hazard off the market. The tobacco industry, facing a steep increase in cigarette taxes as part of US healthcare reforms, is not taking this lying down. Philip Morris, the tobacco conglomerate, shut down one of its largest plants yesterday to bus its workers to Washington to demonstrate against the tax rise.</p>

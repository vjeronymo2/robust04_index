			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Mr. Kim Tae-ho, a worker at a North Korean uranium  processing plant, who defected to the ROK on 7 May, revealed  that the Workers Party's second economic committee under the  direct control of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, had been  carrying out nuclear development with massive capital  investment, and that North Korea had extracted 12 kg of  plutonium in 1988. Mr. Kim gave an interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN  today in Seoul.    He also said: While the Atomic Energy Ministry [wonjaryok  kongoppu] appears to be in charge of North Korea's nuclear  development, in reality, Secretary Chon Pyong-ho of the Workers  Party's second economic committee, is in charge of nuclear  development at the instruction of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il.    Mr. Kim Tae-ho also said that many researcher friends had  told him that North Korea extracted 12 kg of plutonium for the  first time in the summer of 1988 by using the spent fuel at the  5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and that the amount is  enough to produce two nuclear bombs.    Mr. Kim also said that there was a coup attempt in the  military last year, and that all involved, were arrested.</p>

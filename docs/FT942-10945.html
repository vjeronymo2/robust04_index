			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The battle for survival / A look at a company that has had to keep changing its tactics John Litchfield and Debbie Goldsmith met on a battlefield eight years ago. After that, they turned their shared interest into a joint venture and founded Civil-Wardrobe, a company which supplies period clothes principally for English civil war re-enactments, on January 1, 1990. Since then the chief battle for them has been keeping the business afloat. 'We are both fanatical about civil war re-enactments,' said Litchfield, 38. The two were confident of success when they started Civil-Wardrobe. They had been successfully making, hiring and selling civil war costumes to enthusiasts in the Sealed Knot, the English Civil War Society, and other re-enactment groups for two years, and in 1990 they gained a contract to supply, launder and maintain all the period costumes to the Littlecote historical theme park at Hungerford. 'We thought we were made,' Litchfield said. 'The contract soon represented half our income - it was for Pounds 35,000 over a six-month season. At that time we were turning over Pounds 70,000, employing two other staff, and also using a number of part-timers to run the medieval banquet costume hire business, which was also doing well.' The pair did not think twice about the repayments on a Pounds 5,000 loan they had taken out from Barclays, even though a condition was insurance cover that cost an additional Pounds 1,250, also to be repaid in instalments. The big blow came in the summer of 1991 when they learnt that Littlecote was to close as a historical theme park. Within a few months the lease expired on the small shop premises in Newbury that they had rented cheaply and almost outgrown. They managed to find a vastly bigger shop, with large workroom and storerooms, in a small shopping parade on the southern fringe of the town. The rent was a reasonable Pounds 10,000 a year, but a condition of the deal was that they should renovate the premises. They were given the first year rent free, but spent Pounds 15,000 on the restoration work. To fund it Debbie took a Pounds 20,000 second mortgage on her house. The other Pounds 5,000 was spent stocking the shop downstairs, which sells novelties and fancy dress equipment, as well as being a hire centre for fancy dress, hats, and evening gowns largely made by Debbie and her team. No sooner were they in full swing again than a second upheaval hit the couple. A large hotel with which they had done Pounds 9,000-worth of business showed a reluctance to pay. They recouped Pounds 5,500 but had to sue for the rest, which they eventually regained in April 1992. By then they faced a tax bill of Pounds 3,000 for their two good years, which they paid with difficulty. They had leased a computer, a copying machine and an electronic till for the shop and had also bought a Pounds 10,500 new Renault high top van on hire purchase. 'We were really caught in a classic credit trap,' Debbie said. To add to their agony the trade they had tried to build up to plug the Littlecote gap  -selling costumes to other fancy dress shops - proved a failure. 'So many fancy dress shops were closing down due to the recession that we realised it was not going to work,' Litchfield said. 'Fortunately we didn't lose a lot of money over this. We merely diverted the costumes to banqueting hire sets. But I spent a lot of wasted time on the road trying to build up custom.' In addition they saw a marked dip in the corporate events market - another direct result of recession-led cutbacks. 'Although we were working desperately hard and earning quite good money we were not turning over enough to cover our expenses. Our projections had been based on the figures we were earning from Littlecote,' Debbie said. They made two staff redundant but in the summer of 1993 the bailiffs visited, sent by Newbury District Council to collect arrears of business rates. 'Although we had run out of money, we escaped,' Debbie said. 'We were able to show the council that we had written asking for relief on our business rate and the council found that their reply to us had not been posted. Despite this error, we were not granted any relief and still had to pay in full. 'However, in the second half of last year things started to improve. We went to a lot of re-enactment events with our van and our stall, and the medieval banquets and corporate events started to pick up. In addition, we gained a lot of work from museums, and the costumes we had begun to make for an educational supplies company after the Littlecote disaster saw a good expansion. We had an excellent Christmas, and by our year end on May 31 our turnover should be back to Pounds 50,000. We are rapidly paying off our arrears.' The pair have escaped VAT liability by splitting the business into two. They are thinking of selling the hire side and concentrating on manufacturing, as they both enjoy this side of the business and have a successful team of three outworkers. Sales to schools are good, and they have plenty of orders for standard domestic costumes of the civil war period, at Pounds 150 each, and top quality authentic historical costumes for museums, at around Pounds 600 each. Sales from the shop cover the wages of the part-timers who run it. But the operation would be sold off, together with banquet costume hire, as part of the costume hire business, if they decide to go through with the sale plan. 'We could always see how it was working out and start banquet costume hire again somewhere else not too far away. It seems to be a growth market at present,' Litchfield said. For the rest of the year, the pair are concentrating on what they enjoy best  -taking their van to historical re-enactments and joining in the fun. 'It is a very seasonal business. Although we are in a good patch at the moment we shan't easily forget what we have been through in the past three years,' Debbie said. 'But I have a feeling we're winning.'

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ROBBED OF $350,000  </P> <P> Police sought a masked gunman who made off with more than $350,000, mostly in  checks, during a robbery at Children's Hospital in San Diego. No shots were  fired and there were no injuries during the holdup of a hospital financial  officer and two unarmed security guards, police spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> The three were transferring the day's receipts to a main office of the hospital  when the gunman sprang from nearby bushes and ordered them to turn over the  money bag. The robber then commandeered the hospital pickup truck the three had  driven from a nearby administrative office to the main office and fled.  Robinson said the truck was found abandoned a short time later about a block  away from the hospital. A nylon stocking mask was found inside the cab.  Detectives were processing the truck for fingerprints and other possible  evidence. The stolen money included only about $5,000 in cash, Robinson said.  </P></p>

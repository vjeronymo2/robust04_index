			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Brazil puts brake on Whirlpool growth WHIRLPOOL, the world's largest manufacturer of large domestic appliances and now the full owner of the former Philips appliance business in Europe, saw an 8 per cent decline in second-quarter profits, to Dollars 53m after tax. Sales rose to Dollars 1.84bn from Dollars 1.77bn. The Michigan-based group blamed the drop on economic and political difficulties in the Brazilian market. Operations there broke even in the quarter, having contributed about 13 cents a share in the same quarter the previous year. Whirlpool said that, without this setback, it would have seen second-quarter profits rise by some 11 per cent. The second-quarter figures still mean Whirlpool is showing a net profit of Dollars 88m for the first half, compared with Dollars 82m in the first half of 1991. Sales for the six months were Dollars 3.55bn, compared with Dollars 3.38bn. Mr David Whitwam, chairman, admitted that 'despite some recent positive market indicators, the short-term outlook in Brazil remains uncertain'. He also said the quarterly performance in the core US market lagged slight behind 1991. 'Like others, we await, but are not yet seeing, sustained recovery in the North American economy. Economic indicators continue to be mixed.' Mr Whitwam suggested that consumer confidence, having improved earlier in the year, appeared to have stagnated, while competition between manufacturers remained 'intense'. Appliance industry shipments in North America rose by over 5 per cent in the second quarter. Whirlpool expects third and fourth-quarter shipments to show increases, and predicts total 1992 industry shipments will be up by more than 6 per cent. In Europe, Whirlpool International's performance was described as 'solid' in revenue terms, despite the modest decline in industry shipments. Margins improved 'significantly'. 'The anticipated recovery in the overall European market has been slow to materialise,' commented Whirlpool.</p>

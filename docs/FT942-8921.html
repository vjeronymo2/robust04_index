			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs hold back BOC to Pounds 79.7m Economic recovery was boosting sales volumes at BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group said yesterday on publication of its results for the half year to March 31. An exceptional Pounds 85m provision for restructuring and losses of Pounds 8.7m on disposals left pre-tax profits at Pounds 79.7m, compared with Pounds 182.4m. Earnings per share, after the exceptional items, were 3.65p (23.55p). The dividend is unchanged at 11.6p. Borrowings have hardly changed from the start of this financial year and gearing was 33 per cent, the company said. The figures were at the top end of expectations, however, and the shares rose 29p to 715p. Turnover increased to Pounds 1.72bn (Pounds 1.59bn), thanks to economic recovery in the US and Australia, the company said. Higher demand from manufacturing industry helped the gases division report operating profits up from Pounds 156.6m to Pounds 161.4m. Although prices remained flat, Mr Pat Dyer, chief executive, said he was studying the price rise proposed on Monday by Praxair, a US rival. 'You would not have to be too intelligent to see what we are going to do,' said Mr Dyer, adding that it would be 'a little difficult' to raise prices by more than 7 per cent. The gases business in much of continental Europe remained in recession. BOC's recently acquired atmospheric gases businesses in Poland and its hydrogen business in Germany had made some pro-gress. 'We would like to have a bigger continental presence,' said Mr Dyer, although he added that any growth in mainland Europe would continue to be gradual and the group's concentration on markets in developing economies had provided BOC with strong growth. Better results from the north Pacific market were offset by lower profits from Japan. The healthcare business continued to be hit by the falling price of the anaesthetic gas Forane, which has lost its patent protection in the US. Healthcare operating profits fell 47 per cent to Pounds 29.3m (Pounds 55m). The company's new anaesthetic, Suprane, continued to gain market share 'but the costs associated with introducing it meant that it could not offset the impact on profit from lower Forane revenues'. The smaller vacuum technology and distribution services business benefited from growth in demand from semiconductor manufacturers. Its operating profits rose from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 24.8m.</p>

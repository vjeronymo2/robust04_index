Such activities will be conducted throughout the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board of Governors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y (49 FR 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant asserts that the proposed investment advisory services are permissible under  225.25(b)(4)(ii) and 225.25(b)(4)(iii). In particular, Applicant asserts that  225.25(b)(4)(iii) of the Board's Regulation Y permits the provision of discretionary portfolio investment advisory services to customers other than institutional customers, when such services are not provided in combination with brokerage services as described in  225.25(b)(15) of the Board's Regulation Y. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(iii). In addition, Applicant contends that previous Board orders have approved portfolio management services to individuals on a discretionary basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 782 (1982);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Credit Suisse <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 160 (1987);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Creditanstalt-Bankverein <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 63 (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by enabling Applicant to provide a broader range of services to its customers and thereby enhance Applicant's ability to compete and expand its participation in the investment advisory business. Applicant also believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than May 16, 1994.

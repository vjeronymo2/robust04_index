			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Birt pledges extra Pounds 75m savings in next two years MR John Birt, director-general of the BBC, yesterday said that in the next two years the corporation would save an extra Pounds 75m which would be put into programmes. The savings - Pounds 50m next year and Pounds 25m the year after - will follow the Pounds 100m savings expected in the current financial year. They come largely from reduced BBC bureaucracy and from the introduction of Producer Choice, the controversial system which allows producers to buy services from the outside market. Mr Birt told the Royal Television Society's Cambridge convention: 'It is ludicrous to present it (Producer Choice) as a shambles.' He was speaking the day after Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, praised the BBC governors and management for improvements in the corporation and the courage shown in tackling difficult issues. Mr Brooke warned, however: 'If the BBC had not made, and does not continue to make changes, the future of the licence fee in the short term and of the BBC itself in the longer term might need to be considered from a very different perspective.' The statement was seen as tacit government support for the reforms introduced by Mr Birt. A government white paper on the renewal of the BBC's Royal Charter is due in the next six months. The principle of the BBC licence fee is not expected to be in doubt, but proposals for change could include the privatisation of the BBC transmitter network. Mr Alan Yentob, BBC 1 controller, yesterday accepted suggestions that ideally he needed an additional Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m for programme scheduling. BBC 1 is to receive Pounds 60m from the planned Pounds 100m savings. Mr Yentob accepted that this summer's level of repeats had probably been too high. Repeats on BBC television are running at about 20 per cent during prime time. The BBC is to cut up to 131 jobs through a merger in research and development, it said yesterday. The savings of more than Pounds 5m will go to programme-making. The corporation said that some redundancies would be achieved by not renewing contracts, but that there may be compulsory job losses. The plan to merge engineering research and development, currently run as two separate departments with 281 staff, will take effect from April 1 next year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Islamic Jihad Secretary General Fathi </F> al-Shiqaqi by an unidentified AL-'AHD correspondent; date and  place not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-'AHD] What happened during the recent  meetings of the 10 factions [opposed to the Gaza-Jericho  agreement]? How did the factions surmount their differences?  Or are there still many differences among them?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Since the beginning of September 1993, when  news  of the Oslo agreement began to leak, the 10 factions have held  meetings to discuss the possibility of upgrading their year-old  coalition. There was talk of establishing a national Islamic  front with a political program that would be more advanced than  the earlier points of minimum agreement among them and more  developed organizationally. It took some time to agree on the  front's name and its program. The disagreement at this stage  was with the brothers in the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine because of certain political differences over the  interim program and UN resolutions. Eventually, faced with  pressure to be responsible, all the conferees found common  ground for building a political program and outlining political  tasks within the context of a front called "The Alliance of  Palestinian Forces." Ideological differences were avoided.  After this, the meeting was adjourned for a week pending a new  proposal that was being prepared by the brothers in Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement].    On the evening of Wednesday, 15 January 1993, the last  meeting was held. Hamas made a new proposal that appeared to  call for a formula that was stronger than the existing 10  factions framework but still weaker than a front. It became  apparent that the proposed political program, or rather the  proposed political tasks, differed in more than one aspect than  what had been agreed upon earlier. The organizational formula,  however, treated all the factions as equals. The 5 January [date  as published] meeting was tense and anxiety-ridden at first and  it appeared headed toward a deadlock.    Personally, however, I was optimistic and worked hard to  bridge the gap between the position of the Hamas brothers and  the positions of the other factions. I made several specific  proposals to end the differences and when it became clear that  my proposals would be received positively, we recessed the  meeting for half an hour for private consultations within each  faction and for bilateral consultations. During the recess I  discussed the issue with the brothers in Hamas after holding  quick meetings with the other factions. We returned to the  conference room to announce that we had reached a full agreement  that would satisfy everyone. An atmosphere of optimism and  satisfaction replaced the tension and anxiety. We began to  review the documents in a sincere and easy manner and decided to  hold a press conference the next day to proclaim the happy news  to our people about the establishment of "The Alliance of  Palestinian Forces."    I can say that we have overcome the basic obstacles to such  an alliance. However, there are pending issues of less  importance. We will discuss them at a meeting of the central  leadership in less than two weeks.    [AL-'AHD] Did you leave the meeting with a clearly defined  program, or will you continue with the former methods?    [Al-Shiqaqi] We have agreed on clear and specific political  tasks. Some are strategic and had to be spelled out in the  agreement. Other tasks are interim and include the need to  confront the Oslo agreement and its dangers. The basic tasks on  which we agreed will guide our future activities. As for  detailed plans, we will discuss them at future meetings. I will  not hide from our people or the masses represented by our  alliance that we are facing very difficult and complex  circumstances. In the absence of any international or regional  backing, what is being done on the real battleground inside  Palestine will play the decisive role. The strength of the new  alliance will be measured by its actual impact on the battle  inside the homeland. We have taken an important step forward.  Although we have no magical solutions, we are determined to do  everything in our power to carry out the tasks on which we have  agreed. [passage omitted]    Just as we rejected the agreement, we will reject the  elections. Our resolve cannot be shaken by any incentives. The  future of Palestine is a million times more important than a  lowly, worthless council. I advise all hesitant people and  advocates of realism among those who once chose struggle and  jihad not to come close to this pyre. I am convinced, however,  that a certain party to the agreement will delete the election  clause from the declaration of principles.    Concerning municipal elections or other ones, we determine  our position based on their political significance and function.  We will boycott any institution or organization stemming from  the self-rule authority and entailing recognition of the Zionist  enemy and its occupation of our land. But we will deal  positively, as we did in the past, with the other institutions  and with society's infrastructure.    [AL-'AHD] You strongly reject what is taking place. What  alternative are you proposing, taking into account that the  people continue to suffer in the occupied territories?    [Al-Shiqaqi] What is the cause of the people's suffering?  The occupation, of course. According to the Oslo agreement,  will the occupation end? No, the opposite is true. The enemy  wants to rid itself of the occupation's burdens and costs but  wants to maintain the occupation's essence and role. We will  then have to bear an occupation with double the burden. When  the occupation continues, in disguise or without one, it will  cast the burdens that it used to carry onto our shoulders.  Saying that the above agreement will end our people's suffering  is a major illusion that they are trying to sell us. What is  really serious is that we are buying this illusion at a price  greater than any nation ever paid, namely by acknowledging the  enemy's continued presence on the entire territory of our sacred  homeland. When our people have arisen in this century it  certainly was not for the purpose of filling their bellies.  They rose up because they yearned for liberty, independence,  identity, and the preservation of their faith and sanctities.  If all this is lost, is it important if one fills one's belly?  Even the illusions of prosperity are belied by the conditions  suffered by all peoples who accept humiliation.    This homeland is ours, the sea and the river are ours, and  the olives and oranges are ours. The logic of the Koran and  history underline these simple facts. Let us move according to  this logic and struggle according to it. No matter how many  battles the nation has lost, it still has not lost the war. It  possesses aspects of power which, if properly organized, are  capable of terrifying the invaders.    Palestine is the focus and pivot of polarization and  renewal.  The pain of jihad is a thousand times better than the pain of  humiliation. Our alternative is steadfastness, endurance, and  continued jihad until the balance of power changes. If we  cannot defeat the enemy today, then at least let us not turn  into a bridge over which the enemy can cross into the region to  reshape it in the way he wants and in line with his goals,  ambitions, and interests. We must not turn into allies and  guides who show him the way as he presses ahead to control all  the region's capitals. Let us continue to confront him and  reduce his danger until the nation rises again and God permits  change to come. The alternative to this is not peace and an end  to suffering, but a Zionist, cancerous, destructive deluge.    [AL-'AHD] Why do you refuse to meet with Yasir 'Arafat?    [Al-Shiqaqi] We do not believe there is room for a meeting  after the Oslo agreement; there is no point.    As for why no meeting was held before the agreement, the  political issue was again the basic reason. We saw constant  gratuitous retreat in 'Arafat's political position. Add to this  the war of containment, absorption, and blackmail that the PLO  chairman waged against the Islamic Jihad movement. He traded in  the movement's name through some distorted figures he created on  the Palestinian scene. Claiming to speak for the Islamic Jihad,  for instance, someone once came up with an announcement  supporting the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when six Fatah  members rejected it. We cannot be blackmailed, and we are not  the ones who stand at the door of the Sultan [i.e. we are not  supplicants]. However, this did not prevent our meetings and  dialogues over the years with Fatah leaders and cadres; they  contacted us from time to time. They rejected the PLO  chairman's practices against the Islamic Jihad and opposed his  political line, even though he was the one who sent them.  [passage omitted on Jordan]    [AL-'AHD] If Hamas contests the self-rule elections, what  will your position be? You will be standing alone against the  plan.    [Al-Shiqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stressed  to us that they are against the elections and that they will  boycott them. They assert that their position is final and  decisive. The program of the basic tasks of the Palestinian  forces' alliance is clear in this respect.    At any rate, our position proceeds from our principled  commitment to our people, homeland, and nation; from our  understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine,  and from our understanding and interpretation of the reality and  the fact that the infamous agreement means an alliance with the  enemy against the entire nation and region. We will remain  witnesses before God and history, unharmed by those who oppose  us. We will remain the conscience of the nation, even if we are  reduced to only one person. However, we believe that a large  sector of our people and their other leading forces stand with  us in the same trench.</p>

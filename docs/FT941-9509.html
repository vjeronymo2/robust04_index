			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Argentine opposition in turmoil over Menem deal Argentina's largest opposition party is on the verge of splitting over the decision by its leaders to support President Carlos Menem's bid for re-election. Mr Raul Alfonsn, the previous president and now leader of the Radical party, negotiated an agreement with Mr Menem last December, in which he pledged Radical support for changing the constitution to allow the president to run for a second term. In exchange, greater opposition participation in government would be in the constitution. A Radical party conference ordered on Saturday that Radical members of a constituent assembly, to be elected in April to rewrite Argentina's 1843 constitution, must support Mr Menem's re-election. Mr Alfonsn said yesterday: 'The Radicals' position is very clear. We all have to obey the party platform.' His lieutenants warned they would enforce the conference's decision, even at the cost of dismissing regional leaders. Mr Alfonsn decided to negotiate with Mr Menem when it became clear that the Radicals' low standing in opinion polls showed they had more to gain by bargaining with the government than by outright opposition. But the dissidents, led by Senator Fernando de la Rua, Radical leader in Buenos Aires city, denounce the agreement as a sell-out. The Radicals will hold primary elections next Sunday to select candidates for the April election. This will indicate the depth of support for the rival factions. So far, Mr Alfonsn's mastery of internal Radical politics has guaranteed him the overwhelming support of the party machine. However, his deal with Mr Menem deepened the Radicals' already severe identity crisis. The hyperinflation and collapsing public order that marked the end of Mr Alfonsn's presidency in 1989 discredited the party. Their inability to provide a credible alternative to Mr Menem's market-oriented policies made the problems worse. Opinion polls indicate that, in April, the Radicals will be lucky to maintain their poor showing of the mid-term congressional elections last October. Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst, puts the Radicals' support at no more than 25-27 per cent, while Mr Menem's Peronists continue to gain ground.</p>

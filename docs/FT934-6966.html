			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Pacific rim ushers in 'brave new era for trade': Leaders foresee wider economic partnership after historic summit Leaders of Pacific rim countries, meeting in an unprecedented summit at the weekend, set out a vision of economic partnership which they said would give the Asia Pacific region a new voice in world affairs and would spearhead global growth in the 21st century. Although they stopped far short of establishing a formal economic community, the leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping indicated gathering momentum by agreeing to meet again in Jakarta in 1994 and calling a meeting of finance ministers in the first half of the year to discuss macroeconomic developments and capital flows. The heads of government of the US, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei, together with ministers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, met for six hours in a replica of an Indian log longhouse on Blake Island, near Seattle. The summit, held at the invitation of President Bill Clinton, was symbolic of the rapid growth of Asian economies and Pacific trade. It was remarkable for its studied informality, with few prepared statements and plenty of chats in small groups. The leaders issued a 'vision statement' which steered well clear of the many bilateral problems dividing Apec members and contained few specific commitments, but said: 'Our economies are moving toward interdependence and there is a growing sense of community among us.' The region, they noted, accounts for 40 per cent of the world's population and 50 per cent of its gross national product. The statement's vagueness underlined the nervousness of Asian countries about creating new formal structures for co-operation, and particularly about agreeing to anything which could be interpreted as submitting to US domination. However, Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said the summit had 'diminished fears some countries might have had about the US and its motives and the whole development of Apec.' Mr Clinton said: 'We've agreed that the Asian-Pacific region should be a united one, not divided. We've agreed that our economic policies should be open, not closed.' The leaders were emphatic that they were not attempting to establish an exclusive trade bloc and that they were determined to win a strengthened General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Most Apec countries, in a bid to give impetus to talks on the Gatt Uruguay Round, offered new tariff cuts in an agreement hammered out by ministers in Seattle last week. Mr Clinton said: 'We want Europe to work with us to get a good Gatt agreement by the end of the year. That's the message we want to send to our European friends.' Gatt negotiators in Geneva are seeking an accord by a December 15 deadline. Mr Winston Lord, the US state department official responsible for Asia, told reporters: 'I think we will look back in ten or twenty years time and consider that this leaders' conference was a turning point in the Asia-Pacific.' Apec members were, he said, moving towards forming a community 'in the sense of a family and in the sense of shared purpose.' The US enthusiasm for partnership with Asia underlines Mr Clinton's recognition of the region's growth and the need for the US to be involved in it for the sake of its future prosperity. However, he also emphasised that the US was stepping up its focus on the pursuit of human rights and democracy, as well as market access. Mr Clinton's bilateral meetings with China's President Jiang Zemin and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, produced no new commitments. China's insistence that the US should not link trade and human rights issues found an echo with virtually every other participating country. Nevertheless, the leaders agreed to establish a Pacific Business Forum which would identify areas in which trade and investment could be facilitated, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. They will also establish a programme to develop regional co-operation in higher education.</p>

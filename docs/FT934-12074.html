			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Observer: Economic with reality The sharp brains at the Institute of Economic Affairs - the think-tank that lays claim to providing Margaret Thatcher with many of her policies from the abolition of rent controls to the contracting out of council services - are cut to the quick. In the 914 pages of the first volume of the Lady's biography, The Downing Street Years, the institute detects not a single mention of itself. Nor does the 27-page index list Lord Harris or Arthur Seldon, the two men credited with inventing Thatcherism at a time when Margaret Hilda Roberts was still bending her mind to the properties of hydro-carbons. Good thing a second volume is planned.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)--Muhammad Dahlan, a member of  the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations, has affirmed that the two sides have agreed on the  phased return of all the Palestinian deportees who have left  Gaza and the West Bank since 1967. That is a total of 1,068  deportees.    In exclusive statements to MENA, Dahlan said that 105  deportees have returned and that the others will return in  groups, the number of which will be agreed with the Israeli side.    Dahlan pointed out that Israel deported 68 Palestinians  because of the intifadah while others were deported for  different reasons. He added that the release of 1,400 of 8,400  Palestinians held in Israeli jails has not yet been agreed with  the Israelis. He added that it has been agreed with the  Israelis to release 2,500 prisoners two days after the  Gaza-Jericho implementation agreement is signed. He also said  that 1,000 detainees will be released after the Israelis  complete their withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and that 500  will be released one month after the withdrawal is completed. He  added that the release of 1,000 detainees will be discussed  after the inauguration of negotiations on autonomy in West Bank.    The Palestinian negotiators are seeking the release of all  Palestinians held in Israeli jails regardless of their political  orientation. The purpose is to preserve Palestinian unity,  because these prisoners represent every affiliation. The  Israelis refuse to release Hamas members, particularly following  the operations the movement launched recently against the  Israelis.</p>

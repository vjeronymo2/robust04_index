			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Jiangsu Pioneers Reform in Real Estate"] </F>   [Text] Jiangsu Province plans to continue pioneering  speedy economic growth in coastal areas and will usher in a new  boom in the real estate industry in the coming months.    Two regulations to be introduced in Jiangsu later this year  will ensure a sound development of its fledgling property  market, provincial authorities announced in Beijing yesterday.    The move is part of the efforts to regulate its bustling  real  estate business and ensure a healthy economic growth, said Wu  Tingxiang, deputy director of the General Office of Jiangsu.    The first drafts of regulations on real estate management  and  development are now being examined by the Provincial People s  Congress and the provincial administration.    Meanwhile, a bill governing urban construction is likely to  be endorsed next month, Wu said.    The province also plans to expand its foreign-oriented  production and foreign trade and speed up its infrastructure and  basic industries.    On Sunday, Premier Li Peng concluded a six-day tour of the  province inspecting its progress in all spheres, the Xinhua News  Agency reported on Monday.    The premier praised the province for a rapid economic  development and remarkably improving urban and rural living  standards, the report said.    Last year, the gross domestic product of Jiangsu reached 255  billion yuan ($29.3 billion), an 18.5 per cent increase over  1992.    According to Wu, Jiangsu is striving to expand its  industries  in all possible ways.    In transport, projects are well under way for construction  of  the Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway, the Nanjing-Lianyung highway,  and dredging the part of the Great Canal in Jiangsu.    And it is also speeding up work on the new Nanjing Airport,  the Yangtze Highway Bridge in Jiangyin and a new railway in  Jiangsu.    In infrastructure, construction is continuing on 10  state-level development zones, and 48 provincial-level  development zones.    Real estate, as one of the province's pillar industries, is  now enjoying a boom in Jiangsu, Wu said.    The number of real estate firms reached 2,400 last year,  27.5  per cent of which are joint-ventures.    Last year, more than 13 billion yuan ($1.49 billion) was  spent in the sector in constructing commercial and residential  buildings, taking up 12 per cent of Jiangsu's investment in  fixed assets.</p>

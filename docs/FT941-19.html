			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Weak currency helps bolster Johannesburg A sharply weaker financial rand and some bargain hunting helped pare losses in Johannesburg, still very nervous after the week's political developments. Wall Street's overnight drop and the lower gold bullion price took an early toll. The weaker financial rand was also initially seen as a negative factor, signalling poor political sentiment and increased offshore selling. But the currency's weakness worsened after midday, making shares cheaper for foreign investors, and equity prices were also bolstered by some local bargain hunting. The gold shares index closed 31 down at 1,994, industrials fell 67 to 5,696 and the overall index lost 32 at 4,935. Anglos fell heavily in early trade, shedding R10.25, or 5 per cent, to R194 before rebounding to R210 by the close. JCI, the diversified mining house, declined R2 to R85.50 but its restructuring plans found a broad welcome.</p>

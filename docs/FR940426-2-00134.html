			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Notice, FTA pointed out that the experience of many recipients shows that in the context of their operations, the fully allocated cost methodology is not always an appropriate gauge of the true cost of providing a particular service; in some cases, it takes into account costs already incurred or costs that remain fixed, such as salaries of senior managers and other personnel who would be on the recipient's payroll regardless of whether the service was operated by the recipient. Similarly, FTA has interpreted the current policy to require that recipients bid fully allocated costs when competing with the private sector in response to a procurement solicited by a third party. FTA now concludes that this requirement interferes with maximum open competition by artificially restricting price competition between recipients and private enterprise. Moreover, FTA's ``Fully Allocated Cost Analysis Guidelines'' are set forth in a complex and lengthy document that imposes a significant administrative burden, especially on smaller recipients that lack adequate staff resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA proposed that in comparing public and private costs of operating a particular service, recipients should be free to use any reasonable accounting methodology. FTA noted that cost is but one factor to be used in local decisionmaking and that maximum feasible participation of private operators may depend on other factors, e.g., the ability to maintain quality service, operate in a coordinated system, and provide an adequate measure of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters representing private operators and the majority of those representing public operators addressed this issue. Private sector commenters, who overwhelmingly opposed the proposed recision, recalled that the intent of the fully allocated cost methodology is to measure the true cost of a transit service, taking into account the direct cost of service as well as the portion of shared costs attributable to the service in question. They argued that allowing public operators to use marginal costs in comparative bid situations results in an unfair comparison of costs, which in the majority of situations will favor public carriers, and provides a distorted picture of the real costs of public operators to taxpayers. They stated that the fully allocated cost methodology is essential to evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of capital and operating dollars spent on transit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public transit operators related, however, that practical experience with the fully allocated cost methodology has produced less than favorable results. Several pointed out that the FTA guidelines are extremely complex and difficult to apply, even by trained accounting staff. They noted that the fully allocated cost methodology is not a normal analytical tool that has other applications. They stated that the calculation of ``fully allocated cost'' has caused a great deal of controversy due to differing opinions about which model truly reflects the real world in which transit systems operate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For instance, one grantee related that it spent $28,912 to have a consultant develop a cost allocation model that was unusable in its delivered form. Numerous additional staff hours were required before the model was even marginally useful, and the model must be updated every year through a cumbersome process. According to the grantee, the result of this substantial investment has been more expenses due to litigation brought against it by private providers whose opinion of how a fully allocated cost model ought to work differed from the grantee's. In the case of just one challenge by a private operator, the grantee spent $19,125 to have a consultant audit cost comparisons. This figure does not include legal fees associated with that complaint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some grantees complained that certain private operators have taken advantage of the fully allocated cost requirement to thwart local initiatives. One grantee, for example, stated that for 13 years, it provided demand response service for 80 severely handicapped adults, taking them from home to their worksite. A private carrier convinced the mental health agency overseeing the program to put the service out for bid. Because it was required to include all of its overhead costs in the bid, the transit agency concluded that it could not compete with the private operator and chose not to bid. The private operator then withdrew its original bid and renegotiated a fee structure approximately 50 percent higher than its original bid. The mental health agency determined that it could not afford the service and rejected the bid. As a result, a transit-dependent population, which had for 13 years been served by the transit agency, is now without any transit service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter for the private sector cited a report by a noted economist who, on the basis of a study of the utilities industry, advocates the use of a fully allocated cost methodology, since ``years of experience in the electric power industry have shown that cost analysis must be the same for both the buyer and the seller of electricity.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a commenter supporting the recision provided an analysis of a specific FTA grantee privatization proposal by another economist, who points out that the use of the FTA-mandated fully allocated cost methodology often results in a skewed cost comparison. That methodology requires accounting for all of the grantee's fixed costs, from implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements to police protection of transit property and system planning and marketing. In contrast, private operators are not charged with responsibility for managing a regional transportation network and usually provide only a limited amount of bus service. They are thus able to submit lower bids that do not necessarily reflect the actual per-hour cost savings of privatizing service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

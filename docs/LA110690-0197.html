			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LENNON ART RETURNS TO TORONTO  </P> <P> Drawings the late John Lennon made while he and Yoko Ono brought their peace  protest to Canada are returning to the city for an exhibition.  </P> <P> The one-month show at the Animation Gallery Ltd., which opens Nov. 9, includes  the simple but sexually explicit line drawings from the Bag One Suite in a  hotel where they camped in a protest of the bad things in the world.  </P> <P> Britain's Scotland Yard confiscated the drawings in 1970 for being  pornographic.  </P> <P> "And now we're in an age where Jesse Helms is trying to suppress all kinds of  artwork, so nothing's really changed," says Ono, referring to the U.S. senator  who blocked federal arts grants for an exhibit of photos by Robert  Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> "I don't know what politicians think (about Lennon's art), but I know ordinary  people are far more sophisticated and accepting of it," she said.  </P> <P> This year marks the 50th anniversary of the rock superstar's birth and the 10th  anniversary of his death. He was gunned down in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980.  </P></p>

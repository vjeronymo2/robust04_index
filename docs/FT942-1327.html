			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Prudential buys Wimpey share of Little Britain George Wimpey yesterday announced that it had exchanged contracts to sell its 50 per cent share of the Little Britain property scheme in the City of London to the Prudential, the life assurance company, for Pounds 95m. The 473,000 sq ft office building, which was completed in 1991, is at the end of London Wall and is occupied by Clifford Chance, a firm of lawyers. Nippon Life owns the other 50 per cent of the property, which it bought for Pounds 110m in August 1991. The freeholders are the Corporation of London. The deal is expected to be completed next week. It has an initial yield of 7.5 per cent. Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey chief executive, described the sale, which equates to its book values, as satisfactory. 'Consistent with our strategy, it is a further significant step in realising our portfolio assets for investment in our core activities,' he said. The sale is in line with Wimpey's strategy, announced three years ago, of disposing of long term property investments. The company now has just Pounds 60m of investment property to dispose of, most notably its Vantage West project in west London, which will be sold once it has found a tenant. Prudential said it was interested in making further property acquisitions. 'Notwithstanding the size of this purchase, Prudential are still in the market for further City investments where the long term returns are attractive,' said Mr Howard Dawson, Prudential's associate director.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Motoring: A Rover coupe with few rivals ONE majored on luxury, the other on high technology. Both were new arrivals in niche markets catering for affluent seekers after sportiness and individuality. The Rover 800 Coupe is an elegant two-door development of the 800 saloon that has become Britain's best-selling executive car. Large two-door saloons - for this, in spite of the coupe tag, is what it is  -have never been very popular in the UK. In the main, the British like their big cars to be four door saloons or estates. So, at Pounds 30,700 including absolutely everything - from automatic transmission and leather seats to air-conditioning and a radio/tape/six-disc CD autochanger - the 800 Coupe has few obvious rivals. The only extra listed is a driver's crash-protection airbag (Pounds 750). The showroom price of a comparable Mercedes-Benz 300CE equipped to the same level would be about Pounds 5,000 higher although a three-litre Honda Legend coupe, with similar goodies to the Rover's but not at all traditionally British inside, is Pounds 28,995. The Rover's pale hide, hand-stitched and dark-piped, and plentiful burr walnut would make a Jaguar (perhaps even a Bentley) driver feel at home. An 800 Coupe might even be seen as a replacement for a Jaguar four-litre XJ-S coupe (Pounds 33,442 list with automatic transmission). This veteran two-door cannot, however, seat four people, not can its boot swallow two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys. The Rover Coupe's does, with plenty of space to spare for weekend bags. And four full-sized people have lounging room in front or back seats. Mechanically, the 800 Coupe is no different from a Rover Sterling. The Honda-supplied 2.7-litre, 24-valve, V6 engine puts out a smooth 169 horsepower and is well matched to the four-speed automatic. The suspension is quite soft and the power-assisted steering very light indeed. Cruising on the motorway, the 800 Coupe is almost free of wind, tyre or mechanical noise. Even an open sunroof (does an air-conditioned car need one?) creates little disturbance in the car. Like big Rovers of old, it is a typical senior partner's car, unlikely to be chosen by the press-on-at-all-costs kind of driver. Which makes Rover's choice of decidedly low-profile, 55 series tyres on 16-inch wheels surprising and, I suspect, mainly cosmetic. They give sharp steering response and masses of cornering grip. But a less-squat tyre would not thump so disturbingly on rough minor roads.</p>

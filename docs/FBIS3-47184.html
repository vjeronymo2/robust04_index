Although some progress was made, such as making procurement  procedures transparent, Japanese and U.S. officials remained at  odds as they failed to fill the gap between their basic views  concerning the issue of objective criteria. The procurement of  medical equipment is one of the priority sectors in the  bilateral trade talks. Dispute over this sector must be settled  before the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit meeting. Therefore,  negotiators plan to resume talks as early as after mid-January.    Concerning objective criteria, the United States demanded  setting criteria to evaluate Japanese efforts "toward increasing  imports to the level of other major industrialized nations."  Japan, however, objected that "this idea would result in  setting numerical targets." Thus, the two nations remained at  odds, both refusing to compromise.    Working-level meetings regarding the government procurement  sector in the bilateral trade talks have been held continuously  since 4 January. A high-ranking U.S. trade official expressed  strong dissatisfaction, saying: "Although an agreement was made  during the summit meeting last July to set up numerical targets,  Japan is now objecting to it. No progress has been made in the  discussions because of Japan's attitude."</p>

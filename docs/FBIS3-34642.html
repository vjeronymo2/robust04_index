			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief Palestinian </F> negotiator in the peace talks with Israel, by Me'ir Kohen in  Cairo "this evening" -- recorded]    [Text] [Sha'th] In fact, this agreement is not an  agreement in the true sense of the word, but a declaration  resolving three major problems that obstructed these talks aimed  at implementing the Declaration of Principles and the beginning  of Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Those three  problems relating to the crossings, the size of the Jericho  area, and the security measures in the areas of the settlements  and in the roads leading from the settlements to Israel  constitute an obstacle. We announced yesterday that we had  solved this problem and overcame this obstacle. Consequently,  the road will be open to reaching an agreement. This is not a  separate agreement from the Gaza-Jericho accord, nor is it a  partial agreement, rather it is a declaration overcoming the  major obstacles.    [Kohen] Will this declaration provide answers to Israeli  security concerns and at the same time achieve Palestinian  wishes and aspirations?    [Sha'th] I believe that it responds to a great many of these  aspirations, but it does not necessarily give each party what it  wants. This is the nature of such talks, especially as far as  these kinds of phased talks are concerned, which seek to reach  partial agreement on a transitional government, not on full  sovereignty and an independent state. There is no model that  one can follow. Therefore, we have to work out some kind of  arrangement that realizes the Palestinian people's aspirations  for dignity, independence, and freedom and upholds the Israelis'  demand for security, which has always constituted an Israeli  concern.    [Kohen] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, at the end of every set of  negotiations each side calculates the losses and gains of an  agreement. What is the Palestinian gain from the agreement  signed in Cairo last night?    [Sha'th] That we implement the accord that we signed in  Washington relatively quickly because we have lagged behind.  Now we should end this delay so as to implement this accord.  The beginning of an implementation of the accord will open new  vistas to our people in the occupied Palestinian territories  that will gradually remove from them the burden of Israeli  occupation and achieve for them part -- part -- of their  aspirations in governing themselves and repatriating part of the  Palestinian people to Palestine, especially those displaced in  1967. Consequently, the gain here is to start moving matters  toward the realization of the Palestinian people's goals.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A chef chooses chicken - Appetisers Asked by an inquisitive nine-year-old to name his favourite food, Simon Hopkinson, chef/partner at London's Bibendum restaurant, replied immediately: 'Roast chicken'. Perhaps a mundane choice for such a talented chef. But in his cookery book Roast Chicken and Other Stories (Ebury Press, Pounds 17.99 230pp) Hopkinson explains why he adores simple, tasty things and where he has enjoyed them. Included are a refreshing, sour and salty parsley salad from Berowra Waters restaurant in Australia; a milk chocolate malt ice cream recipe from San Francisco; and a recipe for oeufs en cocotte from Lacy's restaurant which was his first London culinary experience at the age of 18. Each chapter deals with produce rather than seasons or menus, which allows Hopkinson to voice his enthusiasm for such a wide range of foods as aubergines, cod, potatoes and double cream. Lindsey Bareham intelligently turns Hopkinson's restaurant quantities into easy-to-follow recipes for four. * * * The Athenaeum Hotel and Apartments in Piccadilly, London is seeking malt whisky - surprising since it stocks 56 varieties already.

The winner was distilled on November 22, 1972 and aged in a sherry butt, making it unusually fruity for an Islay malt (Bruichladdich is also one of the mildest whiskies made on the island). Its strength is 53.4 per cent. The whisky is available from Invergordon Distillers in Leith. Tel: 031-554 4404. Fax: 031-554 1531.

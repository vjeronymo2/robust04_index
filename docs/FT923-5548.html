			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Whites and wrongs WHITE ON BLACK by Jan Nederveen Pieterse Yale Pounds 20, 259 pages THE KENYAN novelist Ngugi Wa Thoing'O is right: 'If you want to pity the white man, watch him dance.' The dance on show in Jan Nederveen Pieterse's White on Black amounts to a quickstep through white European images of Africa and blacks in popular culture. This bold project sets out to compass the slave trade, plantation slavery, colonialism and its aftermath. The book is popular in design and academic in method. Pieterse's prose is haunted by the language of academic jargon. But when he sticks to his illustrations and examples, he is readable and informative. He shows cultural stereotypes operating at all levels, and traces the white view of blacks as savage, uninhibited, libidinous, athletic or musical, to name but few. Pieterse, rightly, gathers French and Belgian examples along with the Dutch and English. White on Black starts with Egyptian images of blacks. In general, Egypt, Greece and Rome took blacks as they found them: as Nubian warriors, as emissaries from the unknown described by Pliny, or as citizens of the Roman empire. With the rise of Christianity, the colour black accrued negative connotations, notwithstanding the legend of Prester John (an apocryphal Christian-Ethiopian) and extensive diplomatic links with Ethiopia as a potential non-Moslem ally in the Crusades during the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the focus shifted to America. The New World fascinated such stalwarts of western humanism as Montaigne, Hobbes, Locke and Montesquieu; for a while, Africa was forgotten. Then came slavery. Between 1451 and 1870, around 15m slaves were imported into the Americas by Dutch, English and American traders. The ensuing abolitionist debate spawned anti-slavery tracts like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1853), the book that started the civil war. Images of blacks as slaves appeared against a growing literature of denigration and condescension. After slavery came colonialism, subjugation by another name. In England, C for Colony was as natural as the alphabet: 'C is for Colonies, Rightly we boast, That of all the great nations, Great Britain has most' (An ABC for Baby Patriots, 1899). As the home nation reached out to impose values, it reaped benefits from colonial products like coffee, rubber or bananas; these reached its homes in advertisements picturing blacks. In Africa, the props of colonialism, Christianity and commerce receive unequal attention; Pieterse is long on missionaries and short on economics. But, predictably, some shocking images emerge from colonial Africa, including the Mill Hill Missionary Calendar picture from May 27 1938 depicting a black child holding a tin of shoe polish above the caption Nu weet u warom ik zoo zwart ben ('Now you know why I am so black'). The second half of the book attends to European images of Africa and Africans as servants, sportsmen (Joe Louis), entertainers (Al Jolson) or erotic dancers (Josephine Baker in the famous banana skirt, 1926). These images hardened into advertising symbols like the golliwog, which once was the mascot of the Beatles but became more widespread as the face of Robertson's marmalade, or the Mohr, which is the face of Sarotti chocolate in Germany. Blacks in advertising throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s were associated habitually with the tropics - with fruit and plenty; this, says Pieterse, reinforced the white cultural prejudice that blacks were lazy and feckless. Only with Grace Jones' 1987 Citroen advertisements and Benetton's 'United colours' campaign did the images start to change fundamentally. These moves relied on 'Black is beautiful' and Black Power in the 1970s, and the crowning in 1984 of Vanessa Williams as the first black to be Miss America. In essence, White on Black unpacks the prejudices in Euro-western staples like Little Black Sambo or the black maid in Gone With The Wind. This is a book about things rather than about theories, so Pieterse curbs his intelligence and avoids thinking in favour of showing. He has developed, albeit half-heartedly, a crucial issue. He needs to broaden the coverage. His book should be transferrable to other cultures. It should show why and how the fact of us seeing the Shuar or Waorani in west Ecuador as savages makes it easy for us to cut down their rain forest.</p>

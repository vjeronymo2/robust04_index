			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Observer: Keeping it in the family Old city hands will find something reassuring about the sight of Joe Barclay taking over from Allan Tritton as Barclays Bank's number one banker in Lombard Street. Running the group's City of London business is not as grand a job as it sounds, but the slot has generally been reserved for a member of the Barclays founding clans. That said, the family grip on Britain's biggest bank is nowhere near as strong as it once was. True, there is another Barclay running East Anglia, and managing director Andrew Buxton is also well-connected. On the other hand chairman Sir John Quinton is not a member of the family, and it is by no means certain that the next chairman will be a member, especially if the roles of chairman and chief executive are split. Alan Tritton himself was only 43 when he was appointed to the Barclays main board 17 years ago. Young Joe is two years older and has far to go before he gets a boardroom seat . . . if ever.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Independent child of a powerful parent - The Professionals / Seeing how the professionals look after their clients' money gives an insight into managing your own better. That's the theory behind Joanna Slaughter's series on private client investment managers. Today: BZW Portfolio Management Ltd BZW Portfolio Management Ltd (PML) is the investment and financial management division of the BZW Group, the international investment banking arm of the Barclays Group, and the advantages of this parentage are considerable. Take analysts: BZW has more than 200, who are a major source of research for PML's portfolio managers, while Barclays provides an extensive distribution network to assist the search for new clients. Well over half PML's private clients are introduced through the bank's high street branches, or through the Barclays Group as a whole. The obverse of this particular coin is that PML must work hard to reassure its private clients that there are no conflicts of interest, and that it is not the poodle of either the Barclays Group or BZW. PML was established as a separate legal entity; it has its own board of directors, which is separate to those of the BZW trading companies; and it distances itself physically by occupying a separate building. Peter Saunders, head of portfolio management, says: 'We are independent - we do what is best for the client. 'For instance, we wouldn't necessarily take a view that agreed with BZW Securities because a great deal of the output from securities houses is aimed at institutional investors and we have to interpret research for the private individual.' PML also thinks hard before using any group product for private clients. Saunders explains: 'If we go into a Barclays unit trust, we have to be able to prove that it is positively better than any other.' The directors describe PML's investment style as 'conservative but pro-active, aided by our direct line access to research and sophisticated technology'. This technology includes a pilot scheme with a system devised by James Bevan, a PML director. With this, market forecasts are fed into a computer programme that has the history of markets and currencies already in it. The system then produces a suggested asset allocation. 'It is a tool, not a full answer,' says Saunders. 'It rationalises history into a reasoned view of the world, and it takes into account more circumstances than you could keep in your head.' Saunders adds: 'We have a house view on pretty much everything on the world markets and on the right allocation for general categories of clients.' Portfolio managers are asked to interpret the house view in relation to their clients. Insight into the firm's thinking can be found in the latest asset allocation guidelines for private clients who are looking either for 'wealth growth' or for 'wealth preservation'. For clients wanting income from a wealth growth portfolio, the guideline allocations are UK cash, 10.53 per cent; conventional gilts, 25 per cent; convertibles, 21.60 per cent; UK equities, 40 per cent; and emerging markets, 2.86 per cent. For clients who are seeking capital appreciation, the suggested split is UK cash, 12.61 per cent; conventional gilts, 10 per cent; index-linked gilts, 7.5 per cent; UK equities 46.14 per cent; North America, 2.5 per cent; Continental Europe, 10 per cent; Pacific Rim and Japan, 3.75 per cent; and emerging markets, 7.5 per cent. On wealth preservation portfolios, more emphasis is placed on gilts for income and UK equities for growth. The suggested income divide is UK cash, 12.50 per cent; conventional gilts, 30 per cent; index-linked gilts, 1.65 per cent; convertibles, 16.67 per cent; UK equities, 32.93 per cent; and overseas equities, 6.25 per cent. The growth guideline allocations are UK cash, 11.91 per cent; conventional gilts, 10 per cent; index-linked gilts, 10 per cent; UK equities, 52.50 per cent; North America, 4.34 per cent; continental Europe, 2.50 per cent; Pacific rim and Japan, 3.75 per cent; and emerging markets, 5 per cent. PML prides itself on providing bespoke investment management within parameters set by the private clients themselves. The 20 portfolio managers who deal with private client money meet each morning at 8.15 to discuss global economic or political developments, overnight market movements and specific stocks. Traditionally, PML held a buy/hold/sell stock list, but this has been developed recently to include the measurement of technical factors. The stock selection list is reviewed constantly and the performance of its shares is used to demonstrate the firm's investment track record. Charles Pinney, the director in charge of offshore portfolio services, says: 'There is no edict saying these are the stocks managers must hold for clients, but they are a recommendation to a manager if he is buying now. If he gets very enthusiastic about a stock, he can get it put on the list.' Currency hedges are used to a limited extent, and 'individually tailored' derivatives' programmes are available through BZW. The firm also has access to group expertise if clients want management of other assets, such as property. Portfolio performances are monitored rigorously, and PML is reviewing its information technology to assist the process. 'Anyone can have a streak of bad luck,' Saunders points out, 'and we encourage managers to come and tell us if anything is going wrong.' Average turnover within the portfolios is 30 per cent, and Saunders says: 'Whenever we make changes in a portfolio, we write to the client. It has become part of the service, although some of our competitors have given up doing this.' PML also differs from some competitors in its willingness to take clients on an advisory, as well as a discretionary, basis. Saunders describes investment houses that will not offer an advisory service as 'arrogant'. He argues: 'It is not client-sensitive. What is important is that you give advisory clients just as much attention as your discretionary clients, rather than making them tail-end Charlies.' PML manages Pounds 1.3bn on behalf of private clients, and the average portfolio of new clients is Pounds 750,000. But the directors will not say how many private clients there are. Perhaps some professional secrecy is required from even the most independent arm of a large banking group.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment managers: factfile 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BZW (BZW Portfolio Management Ltd)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Established: 1986 (origins in 18th century) Regulator: SFA Number of offices in UK: One (London) Number of offices worldwide: In most major financial centres as part of the Barclays Group Funds under management: Pounds 1.3bn (private clients) Pounds 50 bn (BZW Group) Number of UK private clients: Not disclosed Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: Not disclosed Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 250,000 Current asset allocation for private clients: 68% equities, 20% bonds, 12% cash Average annual portfolio turnover: 30%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fees: Discretionary, minimum fee Pounds 1,500 pa (0.75% on first Pounds 1m, 0.6% on next Pounds 2m, 0.5% on next Pounds 2m, thereafter negotiable); Advisory, minimum fee Pounds 2,000 pa (1% on first Pounds 1m, 0.7% on next Pounds 2m, 0.6% on next Pounds 2m, thereafter negotiable).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

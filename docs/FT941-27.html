			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Floating-rate gilts auction 2.28 times oversubscribed After a weak start, UK gilts outperformed most other markets yesterday with traders taking heart from the positive reception to the Bank of England's first auction of floating-rate gilts for 15 years. Dealers said prices were also boosted by signs of strength in US and German bond markets. Gilt prices opened a point lower, as the market fell prey to rumours that UK prime minister John Major was on the point of resigning. But such fears were soon shrugged off, and long gilt futures on the Liffe gained almost two points before falling back in after-hours trading to end at 107 5/32 , up 1 1/2 points. The Pounds 2.5bn worth of floating-rate gilts due 1999 was oversubscribed by 2.28 times, according to the Bank of England. The weighted average accepted price was 99.92. The gilts pay interest of 1/8 point below the London interbank bid rate (Libid). Dealers interpreted the auction's success as a sign of confidence in the market, rather than a symptom of lack of interest in conventional gilts, reflecting expectations that UK interest rates will start to rise sooner rather than later. The enthusiastic reception to the auction fuelled hopes that more of the Bank's funding will be completed through floating-rate issues, limiting the supply of conventional, fixed-rate gilts. Despite the strong rally, there was little sign of any return to the market by medium-term institutional investors, and price changes were driven by futures trading. The spread between two-year and 10-year gilts has widened to 119 basis points from 85 basis points on Friday, as the long-end of the market improved. Yesterday's rally 'prompted discussion of a key reversal day,' according to Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg. Many analysts believe the market could rally strongly from current levels, if end-investors return to the market. Italian government bonds ended higher after a fairly volatile day on hopes that the right-wing alliance would be able to form a government in the near future. The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe traded between a low of 109.95 and a high of 111.80 during the day. In the late afternoon, the contract stood at 111.35, up 1.17 points on the day. German government bond prices rallied slightly on the news of a four basis point cut in the repo rate. The Bundesbank awarded DM65.9bn in variable-rate securities repurchase agreements, and lowered the marginal rate to 5.76 per cent from 5.80 at last week's repo. Dealers said the cut was widely expected, and prices ended the day only about 1/8 point higher. French government bonds remained vulnerable to domestic political developments but traders detected some buying interest late in the day, which they said was position-squaring ahead of the long Easter weekend. The June contract of the notional 10-year French government bond on Matif fell from a day's high of 123.08 to trade at 122.94 late in the afternoon, down 0.12 points on the day. However, this was off the day's worst level of 122.74. Longer-dated US Treasury bonds slipped further yesterday as stronger than expected data on factory orders brought an abrupt halt to an early rebound in prices. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at 89 17/32 , with the yield rising to 7.097 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/8 , to yield 5.175 per cent. After days of heavy selling pressure, the market opened firmer, with prices across the yield curve showing modest improvement in lacklustre activity. However, the market gave back all of its gains and more soon after the mid-morning announcement by the Commerce Department that new factory orders had fallen 1.0 per cent last month, marking the first decline since July. Traders were disappointed, however, because analysts had forecast a decline of 1.2 per cent. In addition, most of the weakness was concentrated in the volatile aircraft sector. The data's suggestion that February's weather had not slowed the economy as much as expected sent a chill through the market, which was already nervously anticipating Friday's important employment data. The weakness at the long end was also linked to jitters in the mortgage-backed securities market, where traders fear a sell-off by Askin Capital Management, an operator of hedge funds, which have experienced heavy losses.</p>

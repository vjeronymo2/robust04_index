In the Notice, Southeastern proposed a System Policy which would deal with the complete Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects including systems both east and west of the Savannah River. Based on analysis of proposals and recommendations received, consultations with interested parties and further studies and considerations, Southeastern decided to develop a policy applying to the system effective with the expiration of existing contracts, or as soon thereafter as is practical. The policy, when finalized, will constitute written guidelines for future disposition of power from the system. The policy is developed under authority of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s, and Section 302(a) of the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7152. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments directly to Southeastern and/or present written or oral views, or data at the public comment forums on the proposed policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments are due on or before September 16, 1994.

This response was carefully considered as were facts gathered from those who consulted with Southeastern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Major issues raised by the proposed policy are determination of marketing area, allocation of power among area customers, handling of energy at pump-storage installations, utilization of area utility systems for power integration, firming, wheeling, exchange and other essential relationships, wholesale rates, handling of resale relationships, and conservation measures. An Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact have been prepared indicating that the proposed power marketing policy will not have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment. A copy may be obtained by contacting the Administrator at the address or telephone number listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public comment forums will not be adjudicative in nature. The Administrator shall act as or appoint a forum chairman. At the start of the forums the chairman shall briefly explain procedures and rules.

If necessary, the chairman may establish time limitations for oral presentations by these participants to assure that all who register to speak shall have an opportunity to do so. Others will be permitted to speak if time allows. Those unable to speak because of time limitations and others who so desire may submit written comments. The chairman and Southeastern representatives may question forum participants and, the chairman, at his discretion, may permit other participants a like privilege.

Finland wants the whole country to be classified as an  unfavorable agricultural area and to therefore receive the EU's  special support, LFA [less-favored areas], for such regions.    The EU has been unwilling to provide support for the whole  country -- at most to Hame province northwards. However, it is  now being reported that the EU side is showing greater  flexibility on this point and is prepared to move the limit  further south.    As well as LFA, Finland wants special Nordic support for  agriculture, and here too the EU is said to be cooperative.  However, it remains an open question what criteria should apply  -- latitude or the short growing season. The EU has nothing  against such support being paid in Finland, as long as it is  paid for by Finland, but the Finns would ideally like to have EU  money as well.    At Tuesday's [8 February] ministerial meeting the EU put  forward its first negotiating bids in the agricultural field --  and these were rejected by all the applicant nations. But it is  only now that the agricultural negotiations are beginning in  earnest.    This week a working group consisting of agricultural experts  from the EU countries has gone through all of the applicant  nations' almost 400 negotiating demands in the agricultural  field, to sort out the really difficult issues from the purely  technical.    Around 40-50 difficult issues have been isolated, including  the transition to EU prices, production quotas, and Nordic  agricultural support. These questions will now be handed over  to the EU ambassadors and foreign ministers for discussion and  will be resolved -- if they are resolved -- in the final phase  of the negotiations, at the marathon negotiating meeting from 25  to 28 February.    The working group did not change the production quotas for  milk and sugar that the EU Commission has proposed and that all  the applicant nations have rejected as too low.</p>

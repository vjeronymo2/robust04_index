			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Further flattening of US Treasury yield curve The yield curve flattened further yesterday as the long end of the US Treasuries market outperformed the short end in the wake of mixed economic news. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 95 7/8 , yielding 7.854 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 3/16 , yielding 7.684 per cent. Economic data released early in the morning offered differing signals about the strength of the economy, but the flatness of the curve depicting the relation between yields on two-year and 30-year bonds seemed to indicate that the market was preparing for another round of tightening by the Federal Reserve. The spread was near 17 basis points by the end of the day, as flat as it has been in more than four years. The yield curve, a graphical representation of the yields on bonds of different maturities, is taken as an indicator of market sentiment about the economy. A flattening curve indicates that the market is expecting the economy to slow. The curve has been markedly flatter since the Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis point in November. The producer price index grew by 0.5 per cent in November, marking the reversal of two months of decline, but was generally in line with economists' forecasts. Less expected was the slowing growth of the core index - PPI excluding volatile food and energy prices. Core prices rose by 0.1 per cent last month, below the expected 0.5 per cent increase. Still, the figures continued to show inflationary pressures at the early stages in the production cycle. The intermediate goods sub-index showed a 1.1 per cent increase in November, the largest jump since October 1990. Another signal of potential inflation came from much stronger than expected retail sales figures. Figures released by the Commerce Department showed sales up 1.2 per cent last month, whereas economists had predicted an increase of 0.5 per cent. A sub-index showing the sale of durable goods was also strong. UK gilts slipped on weak sentiment from the US, and were largely unaffected by the CBI survey which showed that in November a balance of 6 per cent of retailers were reporting increased sales from a year ago. The balance of retailers reporting an annual price increase was 13 per cent, the weakest since the survey began in 1983. Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said: 'The market didn't move at all when the figures came out, and it might be that the market has under-rated the significance of the survey.' He said the CBI survey suggested UK retail sales figures due to be released tomorrow would be weak. He said: 'If that is the case, the market might take it quite well.' Mr Saunders said: 'The signs are that a similar round of price cutting and prolonged sales may be under way now, helping to keep inflation low in coming months.' Mr Tom Cullen at Technical Data said: 'The major emphasis now is on Thursday's by-election, where the government is expected to suffer a spectacular defeat. 'This will set the tone for heightened political concerns in 1995, which in turn will bring pressure to bear on gilts and sterling.' The December long gilt future was down  13/32 to trade around 101 19/32 . The yield spread over bunds moved out from 123 to around 126. German government bonds were hit by the poor sentiment in the US, but found some support and recovered ground. The March bund futures contract on Liffe fell by 0.19 on the day to 89.70. The retail sales figures for October were released, and Mr Julian Jessop at HSBC Markets said they were 'a timely reminder of weakness in the personal sector'. The figures showed a decline of 2 per cent month-on-month. and Mr Jessop said the personal sector had yet to face a 7.5 per cent increase in income taxes, known as the 'solidarity surcharge,' which would further weaken spending. Italian government bonds edged down on domestic political worries as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, met magistrates investigating corruption, and the March bond futures contract on Liffe ended at 98.74, down 0.13. Mr Pio de Gregorio at NatWest Markets said: 'A government crisis is now looming, and it is very likely that it will come in the new year. This is already in the price in bonds, equities and the currency. It is unlikely that the market will recover until there is a clarification of the political outlook.' He said it was likely that the budget would be passed, possibly before the end of the year, but said: 'What will happen afterwards is unclear.' He added that the outlook for the economy was positive, with wage inflation at 1.8 per cent in the year to October.</p>

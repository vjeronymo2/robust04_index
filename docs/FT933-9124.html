			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / EC moves to repair damage of currency crisis LEADING European Community governments, including France, Germany and Italy, are to prepare proposals to limit the damage caused by the recent currency crisis and restore the credibility of the process leading to economic and monetary union. A special meeting of EC central bank governors is expected to be called in the coming weeks, followed by the EC monetary committee, to prepare plans to be presented to the expected extraordinary Community summit to be held in Brussels at the end of October. In Paris yesterday it was announced that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, would meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on August 26, for their first meeting since last week's European exchange rate mechanism crisis strained relations between their countries. Meanwhile, Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, has written to Mr Kohl, Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, calling for an initiative to reinforce European currency co-operation, and to keep the process towards a single currency on track. 'Things are starting to move,' one senior European official said yesterday. 'You can hear the boiler-room starting to cook.' Fears have been voiced, however, that some EC member states may seek to reimpose partial controls on capital movements as the only effective way of preventing the sort of massive currency speculation which precipitated the ERM crisis. Any such move would be fiercely resisted by Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, the member states which are most committed to freedom of capital movements. 'It would mean destroying the present currency market, and that is why I think it is inconceivable,' the official said. 'Yet I can imagine that it will be proposed. There would be accusations that we are building not only a trade fortress Europe, but a monetary fortress too.' Mr Kohl's determination to maintain the momentum towards Emu has been repeatedly stressed by Bonn officials in recent days, in spite of his public speculation about the possibility of delays in the timetable. Yesterday, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, confirmed that strict maintenance of the criteria for economic convergence of the EC member states - including limits on their budget deficits and inflation rates - was more important for Germany than the precise timetable. That could mean an extended period of preparation for eventual monetary union, he agreed. French overnight rate cut, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

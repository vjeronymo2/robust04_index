			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Observer: Saucy export Goodbye, Chicken Kiev. Hello, mushy peas. For the next seven days Ukrainians will be able to pay Dollars 50 a head to be subjected to the best of British cooking at Kiev's new Red Fort restaurant (old apparatchiks welcome). When it comes to promoting British exports to Ukraine, Britain's 'outstanding cuisine' is hardly the number one target. High-tech engineering gadgets, and British literature, yes. But British food? Not only can most Ukrainians not afford British prices, but food is one of the few commodities that Ukraine is rather good at exporting. Quite why Britain's diplomatic machine feels it is worth promoting British food exports to one of the world's richest agricultural countries is a bit of a mystery. However, a BBC TV chef, Colin Capon, plus a plane load of 'ecologically clean' English food have been flown in, with Tesco's Ukraine distributor picking up the bill. However, the Foreign Office's 'duty to promote every aspect of British life' in its bid to win over Ukrainian tummies did not extend to the wine on offer at last weekend's launch. It was French.</p>

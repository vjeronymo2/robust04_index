			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Breeden Supports Penny Stock Bill: SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told a House  panel that he supports the objectives of a bill to curb penny stock fraud but  fears it may cause as many problems as it solves. Penny stocks are low-cost,  high-risk securities, usually trading for less than $3 per share.  </P> <P> They are not listed on stock exchanges, and reliable, up-to-the-minute  information about them is hard to obtain. The Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990,  introduced earlier this month by Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), would implement  several reforms, including requiring that all penny stocks trade through an  automated stock quote system and beefing up the SEC's power to bar crooked  promoters and consultants from pushing highly speculative stocks on  unsophisticated investors.  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Pit strike ballots start LOCAL leaders of mining unions yesterday predicted a close vote in strike ballots starting tonight. British Coal managers said industrial action would cut redundancy benefits and damage customer confidence. Members of the National Union of Mineworkers have rejected a series of strike calls from their leadership since the 1984-5 pits dispute, but some local officials expressed optimism that the latest call would be heeded. The strike vote, called because of impending job losses and privatisation, is being held tonight and tomorrow among members of the National Union of Mineworkers and the Nacods pit deputies' union. British Coal said 7,379 miners had left the industry since the corporation announced plans last October to close 31 pits. Some 33,300 remain, and the corporation said all the threatened pits had enough staff to continue operations if required. Union leaders traditionally exaggerate the strength of their members' militancy in the run-up to ballots. British Coal nevertheless acknowledges that the vote may be close this time because miners feel they have public opinion behind them. Mr Ted Millward, NUM secretary at Maltby, South Yorkshire, site of one of the 31 threatened pits, said the feeling among his members was that 'if we vote 'no' the union is going to get smashed to pieces'. He added: 'Nationally there will not be much in it, perhaps 53 per cent to 47 per cent, but we think it will be 'yes'.' Mr Alan Cummings, secretary at Easington, Durham, said the mood for strikes had grown recently because 'no one thinks there is anything to lose'. Branch officials in Scotland and Wales said the ballot was too close to call. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director, warned yesterday that industrial action could 'only lose the public support that had made possible the current review of the prospects of maintaining a larger market for coal'. Union officials said British Coal had been less vociferous than usual in urging men to vote against the strikes. The RMT transport union is also holding a strike ballot tomorrow. Although RMT officials have been co-ordinating their disruption plans with the two coal unions they were anxious yesterday to insist the cause of their dispute was quite different to that of the mining industry. The union wants a pledge from British Rail that if any job cuts are announced as a result of BR privatisation, there will be no compulsory redundancies or contracting out of employment. The result of the miners' ballots is expected on Sunday. The RMT ballot will not be known for about a fortnight.</p>

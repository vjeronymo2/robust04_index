			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Delors ends budget revolt: EC president forces compromise on regional funds A DRAMATIC intervention by Mr Jacques Delors secured a deal on the 1994-99 structural funds budget for the EC's poorest regions early yesterday morning. The European Commission president picked off member states one by one, putting down a revolt by ministers who feared they were about to lose their share of the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107bn) budget. But the price of a 5.30 am victory was a fudging of the final sums which Brussels will deliver to member states, and some bruised feelings on the part of Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional aid. Last Thursday, Mr Millan told Mr Delors that the latter's promise of IPounds 7.5bn (Pounds 7.1bn) to Ireland had undercut his negotiating position and triggered an avalanche of counter-claims from other member states. Mr Delors, still suffering from severe sciatica, invited Mr Millan to hold further talks with member states in the margins of Monday's foreign affairs meeting in Brussels. But on the day, Mr Millan refused to commit himself to firm numbers, provoking a revolt among member states who accused him of displaying a 'Scottish accountant's mentality'. Mr Millan's aides countered that some countries' bids were more than 20 per cent over budget. The result was that seven member states joined Ireland in refusing to back the new rules for sharing out the structural funds. Summoned from his bed, Mr Delors savaged the junior ministers present for being anti-Community and threatened to expose their greed to assembled reporters. Then, after a performance worthy of Tammany Hall's finest, Mr Delors and Mr Millan persuaded the rebels states to accept the new guidelines, including rough indications on what they could expect to receive from next January 1. Under the deal, Ireland was assured it would receive IPounds 7.8bn over seven years at 1993 prices, slightly less than the IPounds 8bn which the Dublin government claimed it was promised at last December's EC summit in Edinburgh. The UK received an assurance of around Pounds 2 billion with the main beneficiaries being the Highland and Islands, Merseyside and Northern Ireland. East Germany will also receive a significant boost from the structural funds, so too areas in eastern Europe such as the Czech republic where the former communist regime in Berlin had strong trade ties. This is a new development. But the final deal was struck only because Mr Delors received support for his own numbers. In Brussels parlance, these are known as fourchettes or brackets which contain a range of figures and depend on a mixture of trust and fudge. Just how these are allocated will depend on a final decision by the Commission in September. EC officials in Brussels were still unsure whether all of Mr Delors promises matched or exceeded the sums agreed last December in Edinburgh.</p>

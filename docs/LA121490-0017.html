			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SPARTANS WIN ON SHOT AT BUZZER  </P> <P> Steve Smith had the right touch, the right position and the right timing  Thursday night at Cincinnati, leading No. 21 Michigan State to a 65-63 victory  over Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Smith scored 34 points, the last two on a controversial offensive rebound at  the buzzer.  </P> <P> The Spartans (3-2) trailed by 15 points at halftime before Smith, who is  averaging 27 points, took charge.  </P> <P> He scored 22 points in the second half, including Michigan State's final nine,  and was in the right place to rebound Mark Montgomery's missed shot at the  buzzer for the game-winner.  </P> <P> The officials huddled before deciding Smith's layup had beaten the buzzer, even  though a TV replay indicated it didn't.  </P> <P> Cincinnati (3-3) took a 40-25 lead at halftime before Smith took charge.  </P> <P> Smith made a jump shot to tie it at 63-63 with four seconds left.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW WORKS AT THE JAPAN AMERICA THEATRE  </P> <P> One of his duties as the Los Angeles Philharmonic's composer-in-residence,  Steven Stucky told a reporter last week, is "to be seen a lot," to be publicly  visible.  </P> <P> Stucky was exactly that -- he was ubiquitous, even -- Monday night. At the  Japan America Theatre he conducted all five works at the latest performance by  the Philharmonic's New Music Group, and did so with energy and authority.  </P> <P> Equally important, he assembled a varied, striking and potent program: To frame  first performances of works by himself, William Kraft and Donald Crockett,  Stucky chose Schoenberg's "Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte" and Stravinsky's  "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto.  </P> <P> Crockett's engrossing "Still Life With Bell" received its world premiere in  what seemed a fair and transparent reading by 14 members of the group. A  quarter-hour piece in a fragmented but apprehendable atonal style, "Still Life"  could easily become the background for an abstract film, or the basis of a  dramatic ballet.  </P> <P> Mournful, grating and passionate by turns, Stucky's 5-year-old Double Concerto  for violin, oboe and chamber orchestra arrived at its first West Coast hearing  clearly polished and handsomely delivered.  </P> <P> One is tempted to call the work neo-Bartokian, but its actual stylistic  identity is much more complex; it broods in a unique manner. Tamara Chernyak  and Barbara Winters were the protagonists, interacting responsively with  colleagues and with conductor Stucky to produce emotional resonances of a dark  kind.  </P> <P> The first complete performance of Kraft's "Three Settings from 'Pierrot  Lunaire' " accomplished similar success.  </P> <P> Performed by soprano Jennifer Trost and a sextet of instrumentalists, and  conducted pertinently by Stucky, these musical realizations of poems by Albert  Giraud, originally commissioned by the Arnold Schoenberg Institute (as part of  the now-concluded "Pierrot Lunaire" project), made a stronger impact as a group  than they might individually. Rangy but vocally grateful, they use the  instrumental body in colorful and pointed ways, and demand further hearings.  </P> <P> Hector Vasquez was the Reciter and Gloria Cheng the pianist, with a quartet of  Philharmonic members, in Schoenberg's "Ode." The evening concluded with a  sometimes scrappy, often game reading of the "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto.  </P></p>

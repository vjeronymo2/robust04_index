			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Sterling stronger as shares add to gains STERLING moved off the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism for the first time in five months yesterday. The pound, buoyed by the re-election of the Conservative party, leapfrogged the Danish krone to become the second weakest currency in the European Monetary System. Its better performance was due mainly to its own strength, but analysts said the krone had weakened over fears that the country would vote against European Monetary Union in a referendum to be held in early June. Sterling and the dollar also strengthened against the D-Mark which came under selling pressure. The pound closed at DM2.9150 compared with an opening DM2.8988, putting it six pfennigs above its pre-election level and within the 2.25 per cent fluctuation margin of the ERM. Share prices advanced, lifting the FT-SE 100 index 18.4 to 2,591.0 for a gain of more than 6 per cent since the election. There was no sign of an early cut in interest rates.

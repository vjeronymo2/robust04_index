			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> WYNTON MARSALIS  </P> <P> In May of 1981, at a long-forgotten Los Angeles club known as the Maiden  Voyage, Wynton Marsalis emerged with Art Balkey's Jazz Messengers. He was  promptly hailed as a 19-year-old discovery and potential star of the 1980s; but  there was more to it than that; more, in fact, that he had already  accomplished.  </P> <P> The teen-aged wonder, we soon learned, had racked up several years of classical  and jazz credits in his native New Orleans; moreover, he was a member of a  unique family, three of whose members have since become nationally celebrated:  father Ellis Marsalis, older brother Branford, and his younger brother  Delfeayo.  </P> <P> Wynton Marsalis has become a symbol of a musical life style of the 1980s. He  has helped, more than any musician who preceded him, to break down idiomatic  boundaries that had too long existed in music. At the same time he has  spearheaded a move toward acoustic, unhyphenated jazz at a time when fusion  seemed to be taking precedence.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.

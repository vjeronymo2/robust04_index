			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Siderca seeks control of Tamsa SIDERCA, the Argentine steel tube maker, is set to take effective control of Tubos de Acero de Mexico (Tamsa), Mexico's only manufacturer of steel tubes. This follows agreement by important Tamsa shareholders to set up a trust of 20m shares in which the Argentine company will have majority interest. Tamsa's shareholders voted to let Siderca's international division buy shares not taken up in a Dollars 75m Tamsa rights issue. The two moves should enable Siderca to take operating control of Tamsa, although the Mexican steel tube company will continue to maintain its separate identity. The deal underscores Siderca's ambitions to consolidate its share of the international steel tube market. Siderca recently reached agreement with Confab of Sao Paulo, Brazil to swap 30 per cent of each other's shares. Siderca is Argentina's largest private exporter, with annual production of seamless steel tubing of about 750,000 tonnes a year, most of which is exported to more than 50 countries. Tamsa, which had sales last year of 919m new pesos (Dollars 296m), has suffered recently from strong international competition. It has also been affected by the restructuring of Petoleos Mexicanos, its main client. The Tamsa rights issue is 6-for-25 at Dollars 5.54 per share. Tamsa is listed on the New York stock exchange. Siderca will have the right to buy up those shares not subscribed to. The issue had been opposed by the State of Wisconsin investment board, which has a 7 per cent holding in Tamsa. Alfa, the Mexican industrial conglomerate, is set to launch an initial public offering of 15 per cent of the capital of its steel subsidiary Hyslamex. The offering is expected to raise Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m.</p>

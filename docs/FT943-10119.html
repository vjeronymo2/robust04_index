			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Mediterranean Property, a Two-Part Series: Beware in Greece Greece has no universal land registry, so if you buy property there you must know the boundaries and check the title thoroughly. Vendors, economical with the truth, may claim sole ownership of a property, when it is split between 20 members of the family half of whom are in Australia. You need a good lawyer to avoid a court case later. Greek lawsuits take years. The safest people to buy from are friends of friends - involving the whole complicated network of obligation and honour - or foreigners. But a good agent will have gone through the necessary checks first, and will explain the system and such matters as the declared value for tax (which may be less than what you paid). A British lawyer versed in Greece may spot problems, but you will need a Greek lawyer whatever happens. And only a Greek architect may submit plans for permission. The agencies will help to find builders and architects. Holly Properties, for example, has its own development arm. If prices seem steep, it is because for centuries there has been a distrust of paper wealth in Greece. Property has been the main investment. (Until recently, the price was in sovereigns. The buyer collected a bagful from the bank, which the vendor then took to his bank.) Pay cash if possible and do not take out a loan, at least not in Greece where rates are high to combat high inflation. Convert money into drachmae as late as is safe, to take advantage of the slow lowering of the Greek currency. Many observers see it as overvalued by as much as 20 per cent. Frontier areas, where foreigners were banned from owning property, are officially no longer a problem for EU buyers - but you might need help from the lawyer. In Crete and the Ionian islands all seems well, but there are reports of difficulties in Rhodes (as it is so near Turkey). If your dream is an island, think first about how you will get off it. Many smaller islands have summer charter flights but winter storms regularly cut them off. Skiathos, Skyros and Alonisos in the Sporades are attractive, as is Crete. John Goodwin offers a large selection of old and new island houses. It has building plots (from Pounds 29,000 for 1.5 acres at Georgioupolis in west Crete where there is a marvellous beach) with a design-and-build service; old cottages in the Pounds 20,000-Pounds 30,000 range to renovate (probably costing as much again); and a luxury villa, near Rethymno, for Pounds 370,000. For Pounds 165,000 you could buy the traditional-style house an English sculptor built on Paros, in the Cyclades, in 1979. It has no pool, but does have 35 olive trees. The alternative is the mainland - perhaps in the Peloponnese or Poros, which you reach by Flying Dolphin hydrofoil from Piraeus or by road via Corinth and Epidaurus. Halcyon offers an old town house in Poros for Pounds 52,000, and cottages on the nearby Methana peninsula from Pounds 18,000 (an old olive press) to Pounds 59,000. All need work. Where would I go? Crete in the hinterland of Rethymno or Chania. John Goodwin, Southampton 0703-864660; Halcyon Properties, Seaford 0323-891639 or Poros 01030-298-241 75; Holly Properties, New Brighton 051-630 2621. Next week: Italy, France and Spain.</p>

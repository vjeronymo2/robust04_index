			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Army Commander Janos Deak by Erika Gulyas, </F> broadcast in the "Kinn Padon" program of Hungarian Television's  Day TV on 21 March; place not given: "We Need A Hungarian  Military Industry"]    [Text] [Gulyas] Kalman Lorincz, the predecessor of  Hungarian Army Commander Janos Deak, who retired at the  beginning of March, said that he was leaving a depressed army  behind. Do you agree with this evaluation today?    [Deak] Kalman Lorincz obviously had a reason to say these  things when he left. I think that the mood of the personnel of  the Hungarian Army is very important. The mood is a reflection  of our current situation, and the situation of the army  personnel is indeed not very rosy, especially its social  situation. I think Lorincz was right.    [Gulyas] In evaluating the social situation, he also said  that the officers' mood was bad because they had not taken a  really active role in the changes of the past four years. Do  you agree with this, given that you have also participated in  this process?    [Deak] The Hungarian Army has been a stabilizing factor in  Hungary over the past four years. The Hungarian Army and its  officers have done some excellent work. Our officers' corps is  excellent, and their activity in the army has been exemplary. I  do not think they should have played any other active role in  the society.    [Gulyas] Nor did Kalman Lorincz think that; instead, he  thought that the officers' corps had not played a sufficient  role in shaping the issues within the army.    [Deak] We did everything in our power to make it possible  for the Hungarian Army to start reorganizing and carrying out  all the tasks that have been carried out over the past four  years. We worked together with General Lorincz, who personally  did some rather successful work, too.    [Gulyas] It was also said and it also appeared in the press  that a third of the officers' corps were living at about the  minimum subsistence level. Let us try to examine what  percentage of the defense budget you are spending on wages. How  much money can you allocate for maintaining the current level  and how much is left for development?    [Deak] We have already presented these figures many times.  I would like to present the situation from another angle. We  spend a considerable proportion of our budget on personnel  expenses, and another part of the budget goes for material  expenses, so no money is left for development. For example, the  monthly net pay of a first lieutenant is about 17,000-18,000  forints, and I do not think that I need say anything else.  Hoping that the bill on soldiers' legal status will be adopted,  we think that the income of our officers, warrant officers, and  civilian employees will increase, and we will also be able to  give a better monthly payment to our conscripts.    [Gulyas] This law will probably not be passed by the present  Parliament. Something might come out of this in September at  the earliest.    [Deak] We very much hope that this will then take place in  the autumn. I cannot say that the bill will not get to  Parliament in the current legislative cycle. This is a decision  for Parliament. However, if we cannot submit it to Parliament  now, we very much hope that it will get there and will be  adopted soon.    [Guyas] I read an evaluation that, with the exception of the  MiG-29 aircraft, the army's equipment will become practically  totally obsolete. Can we accept this evaluation?    [Deak] Not this way. We worked out a long-term military  technology development concept and the government accepted it.  There is also agreement with the parliamentary parties on this  issue, but Hungary's capacity did not make it possible for us to  start the implementation of this plan. We think that the  situation of the Hungarian Army requires action. Regarding  spare parts and certain replacements, we depend on Eastern  imports. On the other hand, we would like to get high  technology from the West and, most importantly, we would like to  develop the armed forces based on a Hungarian military industry,  something that perhaps does not yet exist. I would like to say  that guns will be guns after the year 2000 too. We need Western  technology mainly for our air defense, air force, electronic  combat units, reconnaissance units, and command. We hope to  purchase such technology when Hungary's economic performance  permits.    [Gulyas] You mentioned our military industry. Many people  complain that the Hungarian Army does not place orders, although  there is a background and basis on which to build such an  industry. People mention Videoton, MOM, and other enterprises.  In your opinion, is this complaint justified?    [Deak] Absolutely. We need the minimal support from the  current budget for projects that we can carry out. The Danube  Aircraft Repair Factory has been mentioned recently. We could  only place 400 million forints worth of orders this year. I  think this whole situation will have to be considered  differently. We need a Hungarian military industry in any case.    [Gulyas] In the long term, this country is interested in  approaching NATO. In your opinion, to what extent can our  joining the Partnership for Peace program help us to bring our  technical level closer to that of NATO, because we cannot expect  NATO to accept a country whose technical level is decades behind  that of the NATO countries?    [Deak] The approach to NATO or other European alliances is a  process. The Partnership for Peace initiative and process is a  possibility for this approach and an opportunity to get to know  one another. We must obviously get closer in technical systems  too.    [Gulyas] What is the official duration of your appointment?    [Deak] My appointment lasts until the end of 1996.    [Gulyas] In your opinion, can you imagine a situation after  the elections in which you will have to leave earlier than  planned?    [Deak] We always carry out what the state leadership  determines for us. We serve the army as long as we are needed  and for as long as we can.</p>

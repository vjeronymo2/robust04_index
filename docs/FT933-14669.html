			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Monarch sees upturn from Revemin plant MR MICHAEL Beckett, chairman of Monarch Resources, the London-quoted gold company with activities in Venezuela, told the annual meeting that the Revemin processing plant, which suffered a loss of Dollars 1.84m (Pounds 1.22m) last year, would return to 'significant profitability' after a new hard-rock crushing plant began operating next month. Mr Anthony Ciali, chief executive, said later that Monarch had located at its Canaima concession 75,000 tonnes of hard rock containing 9.7 grams a tonne, enough to keep Revemin going for a year, and for the first time Monarch would 'be in charge of its own destiny for feed for Revemin.' A special task force had been established to identify more high-grade, hard rock feed resources for Revemin from the group's concession holdings and from third parties. Mr Beckett said he expected the second call of the recent rights issue to be fully taken up. The 20p a unit second instalment, due by July 30, involved holders paying a total of 66p a share compared with a recent market price of 180p. This Dollars 10m net would help finance the La Camorra gold mine, development of which was under budget and ahead of schedule. He recalled that the mine, set to start up in June next year, would be one of the world's lowest-cost gold producers with cash costs predicted to be Dollars 115 a troy ounce. With projected annual output of 86,000 tonnes for four years, La Camorra would generate a great deal of cash - for a company of Monarch's size - to be used for further projects in Venezuela and, possibly, Mexico and North America. Mr Ciali said Monarch's exploration expenditure would remain relatively high this year at about Dollars 2.5m and be concentrated mainly in the La Camorra area, where there was a good chance of more ore being discovered to lengthen the life of the mine.</p>

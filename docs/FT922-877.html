			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Moldovans warned on TransDnestr air attacks: Russian 14th army officials say aggressive aircraft will be shot down on sight OFFICIALS from the Russian 14th army yesterday issued a warning that future Moldovan aircraft attempting to attack civilian or military facilities in the TransDnestr region would be shot down on sight. The army statement came after Moldovan forces on Monday night strafed the TransDnestr forces using three MiG aircraft. At the same time, officials estimate that nearly 100,000 refugees have fled the war-torn TransDnestr area as the fighting for the strategic city of Bendery on the right bank of the Dnestr river continued yesterday. Dnestr authorities say that hunger and disease threaten besieged Bendery, where the exchange of sniper fire has disabled the city's main bakery. The long running conflict between Moldova and the separatist TransDnestr region, which fears that its parent republic will unite with Romania, erupted over the weekend when Moldova temporarily seized the city. Over the last few days Bendery has been transformed into a battleground where more than 1,000 have been killed or wounded. Backed by the Russian 14th army, Dnestr forces retook the city. Moldova struck back again on Monday night, using three MiG airplanes to bomb the TransDnestr line. At a meeting scheduled to be held in Istanbul today, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Romania are planning to discuss the TransDnestr conflict. Mr Igor Smirnov, president of the breakaway republic, yesterday said he welcomed Ukraine's recent decision to support his republic and expected Ukraine and Russia to back the TransDnestr position at the meeting. Mr Smirnov called on the 14th army to give his troops increased support and warned that 'the people are demanding that we turn our artillery on Kishinyov. If it is war, then let it be war.' According to Mr Vasyl Muranets, chief border guard at the main crossing into Ukraine, 80,000 have fled the carnage into neighbouring Ukraine. Mr Alexander Narolsky, head of the TransDnestr government's evacuation committee said the border guard's figure was a conservative estimate. Mrs Nadiesda Osefian, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, is one of the newest refugees. Yesterday morning, she left behind her husband in Bendery. He is a telephone operator who will not leave his post. 'People are hiding in basements like rabbits,' said Mrs Osefian who fled with only two dresses, a jacket, a bible and a small icon.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAA BLAMES AGING CIRCUITS FOR COMPUTER BREAKDOWNS  </P> <P> Operations at the regional air traffic control center in El Toro were back to  normal Wednesday, Federal Aviation Administration officials said, after a  series of computer outages was traced to vital components more than a dozen  years old.  </P> <P> The FAA's explanation came after air traffic controllers told The Times on  Tuesday that a new multimillion-dollar computer system installed 2 1/2 months  ago had failed 104 times on Sunday, endangering air safety.  </P> <P> But "no new computer system was involved," Jim Panter, manager of the Coast  Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, said Wednesday. "It was strictly old  equipment that needed to be replaced."  </P> <P> The computer system at Coast TRACON has been in use at least since 1972, Panter  said. New system software was installed 2 1/2 months ago on the existing  computer's hardware, leaving it vulnerable to the type of breakdown that  occurred Sunday, which officials blamed on brittle wires inside aging memory  units.  </P> <P> From about 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday, flight data repeatedly disappeared from  video display screens used by air traffic controllers at Coast TRACON,  sometimes for as long as five minutes, officials said. During the outages,  radar still showed each plane's position, but the only way to know a plane's  altitude, speed or identity was through voice communication with pilots.  </P> <P> "It wasn't really that dangerous, because we still had the radar," Panter said.  </P> <P> A special crew from the FAA's technical center in Atlantic City, N.J., worked  on successive nights this week to solve the problem, but due to a parts  shortage, some outages still occured Monday and Tuesday, Panter said. There  were no outages Wednesday, he said.  </P> <P> A heat buildup aggravated the situation on Sunday, Panter said, with the  computer system shutting itself down and restarting several times as it tried  on its own to locate the memory problem.  </P> <P> Four of the Univac computer's 11 "memory modules" went out on Sunday because of  cracked, broken wires, Panter added.  </P> <P> "They've all been replaced now, so there shouldn't be any repeat," he said.  </P> <P> The recently installed software was not implicated in Sunday's failures, Panter  said, but FAA officials said it has been involved in problems at other TRACON  facilities.  </P> <P> "Just like any program, the new software has had its glitches," said FAA  spokesman John Leyden in Washington.  </P> <P> Officials at the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. in Washington said  Wednesday that at least one NATCO chapter, at Dallas-Ft. Worth, has filed an  "unsatisfactory condition" report with the FAA concerning computer problems at  their control center.  </P> <P> However, NATCO officials said they believe the Dallas-Ft. Worth problems are  software-related and not similar to the hardware failures that plagued Coast  TRACON on Sunday.  </P> <P> Dallas-Ft. Worth air traffic control officials could not be reached for  comment.  </P></p>

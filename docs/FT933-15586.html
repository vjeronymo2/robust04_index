			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Carsberg backs Law Society move SIR BRYAN CARSBERG, director-general of fair trading, yesterday signalled his approval of the Law Society's latest application for wider advocacy rights for solicitors in the higher courts. Sir Bryan said the application - which was rejected by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee last week - did not have, nor was likely to have, the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition to any significant extent. The liberalising nature of the proposals would serve to lower entry barriers to the market for the supply of higher court advocacy services, he said. But in his advice on whether to approve the society's application, Sir Bryan said that Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, should consider a mandatory requirement that a solicitor's advice to a client on choice of advocate, the likely costs and the criteria for any recommendation, should be clearly set out in writing. Sir Bryan said that extending higher court advocacy rights to solicitors would widen consumer choice and might lead to gains in efficiency. His advice will now be considered by Lord Mackay together with the advice of his Advisory Committee before he decides whether the society's application should be approved.</p>

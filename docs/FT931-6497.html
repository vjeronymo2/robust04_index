			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Leaders versus parties: Europe Mr Michel Rocard has long been the white hope of a certain free-wheeling school of liberal social democracy in France. So when he launched his proposal for the creation of a broad new centre-left political movement, encompassing socialists, ecologists, reformed communists and moderate liberals, the immediate reaction from rivals and opponents (two categories that include just about all the stars in the French political firmament) was astonishment followed almost immediately by cynical dismissal. This was just a wily manoeuvre, they said, designed to change the rules of the game in his favour. By calling for the creation of a broad-bottomed movement, he was seeking to enlarge his own constituency as well as making a takeover bid for the ecological vote, which has swelled as fast as the Socialist vote has shrunk. By criticising the accumulated mistakes of the Socialist party, he was effectively criticising President Francois Mitterrand, distancing himself from his discredited rivals in the party leadership, and trying to position himself for the presidential election campaign of 1995. The Rocard proposal is more than clever footwork, however; it may yet start a serious debate on political reform in France, and perhaps in Europe as well. One reason for the Socialists' decline, according to Mr Rocard, is that they have told too many political lies. In 1981 they promised miraculous economic improvements which were unrealistic; then in 1983 they did a massive U-turn to economic austerity, but tried to hide the fact. A second reason was that many have engaged in wholesale corruption. But the heart of Mr Rocard's analysis is much more structural than these two factors: traditional socialism no longer corresponds to the modern world. 'The very name of socialism was forged in a conception of the world wholly based on production and class relationships . . . We have entered a market society where inequalities appear in many forms, but where the feeling of belonging to a class, to a collective movement, is no longer perceived as a reality.' This explains the rise of the ecological movement, he believes. 'When the French can no longer find the springs of their identity in a social class, nor in a religion, nor in a profession, nor in a generation, nor in a level of income, what is left to identify with? What surrounds them immediately: their environment.' The dilemma for a convinced socialist such as Mr Rocard is that he needs, but does not yet have, a new message for the times. Conservatives may delude themselves that this is just a socialist problem, which leaves them free to triumph. In reality, the conservative agenda has been essentially defined for most of this century by and in opposition to socialism. The best ideological hope for conservatives, is that socialists should fail to modernise their message. The question is, how can the socialists set about modernising their message? In most west European countries politics has been, for several generations, a war of classes, dressed up as a war of doctrines, and organised through a war of parties. As ideological organisations, it is in the nature of parties to resist changes in their doctrines; just look at the British Labour party and its absurd clinging to Clause IV and the idea of nationalisation. Rocard's implicit answer is threefold: you must break the old party stranglehold of dogma, ritual and faction; you need someone who is above the party, and free from the dogmas, to lead the process of rethinking; and therefore you need to dilute the party into a larger, looser group, under a paramount chief. Now the French political system may be peculiarly amenable to this strategy of political reform. First, the political spectrum contains enough different parties to permit a flexible choice of groupings. Second, the lure of the presidency generates a number of potential leaders who are not wholly dependent on their parties; at the moment, there are at least six credible potential candidates for the presidency, three on the left and three on the right; and Rocard is one. Italy and Britain, which are in even greater need of reform than France, have systems that will make reform more difficult, if not impossible. Italians used to claim their PR system gave them 'representative' government. However, the parties represented only themselves and their clients. Political decadence has gone so far that the parties are paralysed, except in their resistance to change; their leaderships are largely decapitated. Virtually the last desperate hope for reform is that it will finally come from grassroots referendums. The British myth is that the voting system provides 'strong', therefore good, government. In fact the British system is locked solid by the anachronistic war of the parties; as a result, not merely are there no alternative political leaders who are independent of party, but the leaders in place are the prisoners of their parties. Where the governing party is deeply and irreconcilably split on the most important issue of the day, as it is now, there is no escape from government which is both weak and bad. In France, some constitutional reforms are already under discussion; the paradox is that these might be good for the quality of ongoing government, but bad for structural political reform. If members of parliament were forbidden to hold a second elective office, parliament might be more effective; but politicians who did not have an alternative power base in a town hall or region would be less independent and more subject to party discipline.</p>

"Every  little bit helps."  </P> <P> Residents can take trees to Lacy Park from 9 a.m. to noon on Thursday. Workers  will run the trees through a "chipper," grinding them into recyclable material.  </P> <P> The service is part of the community's new comprehensive recycling program.  Residents, who may be asked to show driver's licenses, are asked to remove  nails or other protrusions from trees.  </P></p>

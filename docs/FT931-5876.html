			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Computer company to set up in Ireland SUN Microsystems, the California-based manufacturer of computer workstations and peripheral devices run on the Unix operating system, is to set up a new software subsidiary in Ireland. Called Sunsoft, it will open in Dublin this summer and will eventually employ 200 people, developing and localising software specifically for Sun's systems sold in Europe. That market accounts for some 30 per cent of its worldwide hardware sales. Sun is a market leader in 'open systems' workstations. Demand for these has grown rapidly over the past two years, as the trend by users to 'downsize' from mainframes has accelerated. The development of complex and powerful new software for multimedia applications is seen by the industry as vital to the development of the workstation market. Sun's move into Ireland has been welcome news for the government, following the announcement last week by Digital Equipment, another US workstation manufacturer, that it is to consolidate its European manufacturing in Scotland, with the loss of 780 jobs in Ireland. Mr Ruari Quinn, Ireland's enterprise and employment minister, said the Sun decision 'demonstrates clearly that Ireland has the edge when it comes to software development expertise'.</p>

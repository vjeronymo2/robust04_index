			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: MAM lifts Owners stake MERCURY Asset Management has bought 1m shares in Owners Abroad, increasing its stake to 14.07 per cent in the holiday company that is fighting a hostile Pounds 268m takeover bid from rival Airtours. The purchases were reported yesterday and executed at an average price just below 134p, where Owners share price closed unchanged yesterday. Airtours closed 1p down at 308p. Mercury said last night that it had yet to decide whether or not to accept Airtours' offers. Mercury is Owners Abroad's largest shareholder and held 13.4 per cent before the latest purchase. At the same time, Scottish Amicable reported that it had reduced its stake to 3.7 per cent through the sale of 250,000 shares at 132p.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTORS URGE PRISON TERM FOR NORTH  </P> <P> Government prosecutors declared Monday that former White House aide Oliver L.  North "has not indicated one iota of remorse" and should go to prison for his  conviction on three felony charges in the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> In legal papers filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell four days  before North is scheduled to be sentenced, prosecutors charged that North sees  himself "as being above the law and beyond reproach" and, in making public  appearances around the country, "continues to profit from his notoriety."  </P> <P> Convicted on three of nine felony counts last month, the retired Marine  lieutenant colonel could receive up to 10 years in prison and $750,000 in  fines.  </P> <P> Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's defense attorney, declined comment on the  prosecutors' statement. However, Sullivan has been submitting material to the  court under seal to argue leniency for North and will make a public statement  before Gesell imposes sentence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notice of Appeal  </P> <P> Sullivan also has served notice that he is appealing North's conviction.  </P> <P> In their sentencing memorandum, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and three  associates who tried the 12-week case told Gesell that "the most striking thing  about North's posture on the eve of sentencing is his insistence that he has  done nothing wrong."  </P> <P> They cited North's post-trial claim that the jury's verdict represented "a  partial vindication" of his conduct, and that he will "continue the fight"  until he is exonerated.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the prosecutors said, "North's lack of remorse is particularly  troubling in view of the fact that he continues to travel throughout the  country, like a politician on the stump, giving speeches and discoursing on his  defiance of Congress."  </P> <P> North's appearances have commanded an average fee of $25,000 each. His  associates say that the proceeds, together with contributions toward a legal  defense fund, are being used to defray legal bills estimated at $3 million.  </P> <P> Declaring that an unspecified "term of incarceration is appropriate and  necessary," the prosecution's statement urged Gesell to "consider the  seriousness of North's abuse of the public trust, the need for deterrence,  North's failure to accept personal responsibility for his actions, his lack of  remorse and his perjury on the witness stand."  </P> <P> Although North was charged with perjury, he was not convicted of that charge.  He was found guilty of altering and destroying top-secret documents, helping to  mislead Congress and illegally accepting the gift of a $13,800 home security  system.  </P> <P> But the prosecution contended that "with supreme faith in his ability to  deceive, North took the witness stand and perjured himself" with a false story  claiming that he had a cash box at home and had not pocketed any Contra cash  funds.  </P> <P> North "apparently sees nothing wrong with alteration and destruction of  official national security records," the prosecutors added, describing such  crimes as "designed to protect himself and his associates, not the national  security."  </P> <P> Stressing the deterrent effect of a prison term, the government's statement  said:  </P> <P> "After a nonpolitical trial and a nonpolitical verdict, the court in its  sentence should alert all government officials that such activities are indeed  unlawful and that, if officials engaging in such conduct are caught and  convicted, the punishment will be severe." North was "not a scapegoat," the  statement concluded, and he "cannot simply rely on real or imagined  authorization of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PURSUERS OF D'EATH IN A HURRY;  </P> <P> HYDROPLANES: IF A MOVE IS TO BE MADE, IT HAD BETTER BE THIS WEEKEND ON MISSION  BAY.  </P> <P> The drivers are calling San Diego's Budweiser Cup the most important stop in  the HFC Hydroplane boat racing series. It is the 10th of 11 on the 1990 tour,  and if someone is going to make a move to overtake series points leader Tom  D'Eath, it will have to be done on Mission Bay this weekend.  </P> <P> Defending national champion Chip Hanauer, second and 573 points back in the  overall standings, said he plans to catch D'Eath Sunday. But don't expect any  drama here until then. The Budweiser Cup will hold time trials today and  Saturday, beginning at 9 a.m., but no one will see much of Hanauer and his Miss  Circus Circus boat (which set a lap speed record of 158.87 m.p.h. here last  year) during qualifying.  </P> <P> "I doubt if we'll make six runs in two days," said Hanauer, 36, who last won  the San Diego event in 1987 but has won more national championships (four) than  any other driver the past 10 years.  </P> <P> "We'll probably make three," said George Woods Jr., the 1988 winner and third  overall driving Jif Presents Mr. Pringles.  </P> <P> Hanauer and Woods said that unless a racer is new to a course or his boat  requires a lot of adjustments, the trials offer no incentives. Many curtail  their qualifying activity because of the salt water, which often causes the  boats' turbine engines to fail if they get too wet.  </P> <P> Last February, Hanauer solicited the support of other drivers and made a  proposal to institute a points award to the top qualifier for each race.  </P> <P> "If you put up 20-25 points for the top qualifier, you'd set up some great time  trials," he said. "Basically, what it amounts to right now is two days of  testing. We don't want to subject the turbines to the salt water any more than  we have to."  </P> <P> The drivers voted in favor of a time-trials points system and sent their two  representatives, Jim Kropfeld and Ron Snyder, before the Unlimited Racing  Commission's Competition Board. But the board, according to Kropfeld, never  acted on the proposal.  </P> <P> So with his sights set on Sunday, Hanauer knows a victory in any of the four  heatswill bring 400 points. Secon is worth 300 points, third 225 and fourth  169. All of a sudden, 573 doesn't look that far away for Hanauer.  </P> <P> "It's a substantial lead, but we have overcome a bigger lead in the past with  two events to go," said Hanauer, currently the winningest active racer with 34  victories.  </P> <P> He also a blew a seemingly insurmountable lead, close to 1,000 points, in 1986  when he failed to qualify in San Diego, raced badly in Las Vegas and saw  Kropfeld pass him.  </P> <P> "The unthinkable happened," he said. "We basically didn't show up."  </P> <P> Hanauer will show up Sunday, but you might not see much of him until then.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUDWEISER CUP FACTS  </P> <P> What: The Budweiser Cup, the 26th anniversary of unlimited hydroplane boats on  Mission Bay.

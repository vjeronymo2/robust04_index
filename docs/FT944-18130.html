			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Wooing the bosses with chablis and canapes - Labour's meeting with business leaders on its first ever corporate day It had all the hallmarks of a Conservative fundraising event. Chief executives and directors of some of Britain's biggest companies lunching on chablis and canapes, sponsored by Philip Morris, the tobacco company, which hired Baroness Thatcher as a consultant. But there wasn't a Tory in sight - at least none willing to admit it. This was the Labour party's first ever corporate day. Ms Nicki Lewis, the party's corporate relations manager, was shepherding captains of industry around a Blackpool hotel room to meet members of Labour's shadow cabinet. In case the line-up was not sufficient to attract the big names in industry, the party boosted its star quality with the support of Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, and Mr Ken Follett, the author. There was little need for the supporting cast. Those attending - dubbed by one Labour aide as Britain's deserving rich - wanted to meet the men and women many were convinced would form a Labour cabinet. Mr John Moores, a director of Littlewoods football pools whose family controls about 40 per cent of the company's shares, said:  'Since Labour is going to form the next government, it's worth getting to know them.' For Pounds 350 per person, the executives - including Sir John Egan, chief executive of the airports group BAA, Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of London's policy committee, and Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson - breakfasted with Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman. There were also senior representatives from Tesco, the food retailer, and Motorola, the electronics company. The executives lunched with some of the party's most senior MPs before being ferried back to their VIP balcony in Blackpool's Winter Gardens to hear Mr Tony Blair give his first speech as Labour Leader. While leftwing delegates were muttering betrayal over Mr Blair's thinly-veiled attack on Clause 4 of the constitution, the executives were in face-to-face conversation with the Labour leader at a drinks party he hosted at the Imperial Hotel on the seafront. They also sat down to a sumptuous dinner with Mr John Prescott, deputy leader. Not all those attending Labour's first corporate day viewed the proceedings with unalloyed enthusiasm. Mr Cassidy was disappointed that Mr Brown did not set out his policies or strategy for business in more detail. He also had a blunt message for his Labour hosts - if Mr Brown's attack on the 'undeserving rich' leads to punitive taxes on foreigners, it will jeopardise the future of the City which the corporation estimates contributes Pounds 8bn a year to the British economy. Mr Harper of Hanson, one of the biggest corporate donors to the Conservative party, feared his hosts had not sufficiently understood his arguments that high dividends did not restrict investment. 'They also don't seem to understand that takeovers of companies act as a great discipline on managers.' But Mr Harper was delighted that he was being listened to at all. As was Sir John, who said: 'As a privatised company we have a case to prove that we are able to continue to generate wealth and it is encouraging that Labour want to listen to it.' Most companies were there for practical reasons. Mr Cassidy said: 'With only two-and-a-half years to go to the next election Labour is ahead in the polls by around 27 per cent.'</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC criticised by US over trade policy THE US Trade Rep-resentative's Office yesterday released its seventh National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, the yearly cataloguing of the rest of the world's trade transgressions, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The EC attracts 15 pages of criticism, ranging from high tariffs to 'buy national' policies to oilseed production subsidies. A new barrier listed is the EC ban on fur from animals caught in leghold traps - a measure of the type often imposed by the US and criticised as an attempt to foist American environmental standards on others.</p>

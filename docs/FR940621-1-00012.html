Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, (CAA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or ``the Act''). EPA published a ``General Preamble'' describing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its preliminary views on how it intends to review SIP's and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NOx  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplement to the General Preamble'')).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also issued a draft guidance document describing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 51 to reflect the requirements of the emission statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable by section 182 (b), (c), (d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements certifying their actual emissions of VOCs and NOx. This section of the Act provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992 establishing this emission statement program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a source emits either VOC or NOx at or above the designated minimum reporting level, the other pollutant should be included in the emission statement, even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission statement for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NOx or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At minimum the emission statement data should include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Certification of data accuracy;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Source identification information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Operating schedule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Emissions information (to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Control equipment information; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Process data. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA developed emission statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the State Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Procedural Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Maryland held public hearings on September 21 (Frederick), September 22 (Columbia), and September 23, 1992 (Centreville) for the purpose of soliciting public comment on proposed regulatory revisions concerning emission statements for stationary sources. Following the public hearings, the regulatory revisions were adopted by the Secretary of the Environment on November 13, 1992, submitted to EPA on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the SIP, and became effective in the State of Maryland on December 7, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Components of Maryland's Emission Statement Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several key and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the State must submit a revision to its SIP which consists of an emission statement program which meets the minimum requirements for reporting by the sources and the State. For the emission statement program to be approvable, the state's SIP must include, at a minimum, definitions and provisions for applicability, compliance, and specific source reporting requirements and reporting forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maryland's revision consists of amendments to COMAR 26.11.01 General Administrative Procedures. These amendments, revise COMAR 26.11.01.01, Definitions, and add 26.11.01.05&hyph;1, Emission Statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section .01, Definitions, has been revised by amending or adding the definitions of the following terms: Actual emissions; Capture efficiency; Certifying individual; Control efficiency; Oxides of nitrogen; Percent seasonal throughput; Standard Industrial Classification; and Typical ozone season day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements, requires that a person who owns or operates any installation, source, or premises located in areas designated by the CAA as marginal, moderate, serious, severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area to report the levels of emissions from the sources emitting 25 tons per year (TPY) or more of VOCs and NOx, in order to track emission reductions and attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Because the entire State of Maryland is in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region, emission statement reporting provisions also apply to sources in all remaining areas of the State which emit 100 TPY of NOx or 50 TPY of VOC. Section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements, requires that a certifying official for each facility provide the State with a statement reporting emissions by April 1 of each year, beginning with April 1, 1993, for the emissions discharged during the previous calendar year. Section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements, delineates specific requirements for the content of these annual emission statements, including the use of the reporting form developed by the MDE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Enforceability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Maryland has provisions in its SIP (MD. Env. Code Ann. Section 2&hyph;609, 2&hyph;609.1, 2&hyph;610, 2&hyph;610.1) which ensure that the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) and sections 184(b)(2) and 182(f) of the CAA as required by COMAR 26.11.01, sections .01 and .05&hyph;1 are adequately enforced. Once EPA completes the rulemaking process approving the Maryland's Emission Statement program as part of the SIP, it will be federally enforceable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that the submittal made by the State of Maryland satisfies the relevant requirements of the CAA and EPA's guidance document, ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July 1992). EPA's detailed review of Maryland's Emission Statement Program is contained in a Technical Support Document (TSD) which is available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the Addresses section of this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Maryland SIP to include an Emission Statement Program consisting of revisions to regulation COMAR 26.11.01., General Administrative Provisions, to amend section .01, Definitions, and add section .05&hyph;1, Emission Statements. This revision was submitted to EPA by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0061 gpodeletetag --> 1The EPA is requesting public comments on all aspects of the issues discussed in this document. These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional Office listed in the Addresses section of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision of any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action to propose approval of Maryland's SIP Emission Statements Program has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Maryland's SIP Emission Statements revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K), and part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 52.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection, Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Nitrogen dioxide, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Volatile organic compounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stanley L.

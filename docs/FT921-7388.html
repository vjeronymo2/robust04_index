			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: A homespun new colony - Long Island's traditional crop  -potatoes - is making way for the vine NEW YORK City stretches into the Atlantic along the Forks of Long Island, effectively the extremes of Manhattan. Here, you can find a deli called the Barefoot Contessa selling cooked brussels sprouts and five blends of coffee, go', four of them decaffeinated, to take away. In cafes nearby, roundabout you can order an all-white omelette or cholesterol-free French fries. Long Island now has a wine industry which, in its way, is also extreme. It is, for a start, extremely young. Wine labels may boast that the relevant vines were planted way back in 1980. (Long Island's first vinifera (ital?) vineyard for more than a century was planted in 1973 by Alex and Louisa Hargrave, in 1973 who had to wait six years for the next grape-grower to come along and prove their sanity). It is also, like many a fine wine region, at a climatological extreme. Further north, in New York state, winters are too hard for vinifera. Only the moderating influence of the surrounding ocean allows the vine species responsible for all the great wines of the world to be grown this far north. Almost all of the vines planted around the lakes in upstate New York belong to coarser, hardier vine species . Vines are now encroaching on Long Island's traditionally dominant crop, potatoes - oddly prosaic for a region famous for providing the famous with somewhere (the Hamptons) to spend their weekends with the equally famous. Today, there are well over more than 1,200 acres of vineyard have been planted, mainly on the North Fork, by about 45 growers and vinified at 15 different wineries. As in so many other areas of commercial endeavour, the early 1980s eighties were the boom time. An acre of land was then just Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,105); now, it but is today closer to Dollars 20,000. The odd Manhattanite, associating the South Fork of Long Island with luxury vacations and wine with the ultimate good time, invested in what turned out to be a dream. They have now been shaken out, according to Dan Kleck, who has worked as a Long Island wine-maker since 1979 and is now introducing malolactic fermentation at the Palmer winery. 'They've sold to more committed people who spend two or three days a week out here and might even drive a tractor once in a while. It is a lot better. Fewer egos.' Now that undesirable outsiders have been seen off, Long Island wine producers are concentrating on the remaining major pests: birds (they are 're on the main migration route and have to spend about Dollars 1,000 an acre on special netting); hurricanes (these are 're meant to happen every 40 years, not every other year) - and California. Any California-trained wine-maker comes a terrible cropper in this cool, late-budding climate. 'You have to un-learn that California thing,' says Kleck. 'Our reds need much longer maceration. Our fruit acids are much higher and our alcohols lower.' (A Long Island wine more than 12 per cent alcohol is rare indeed, and chaptalisation - adding sugar to raise the final alcohol level - can be the norm for some vintages). All of this sounds very European, and Long Islanders have been keen to stretch welcoming hands over the Atlantic. They have invited inviting Bordeaux's top brass to a couple of instructive 'wine-ins' over the past few years, along with Australian viticulturalist Richard Smart who has shown how to use every ray of sunlight to maximise ripening. The wines taste French in structure, if New World in technology: never heavyweight with crisp, bordering on lean, fruit flavours. At last year's the recent New York Wine Experience - a weekend's wine extravaganza organised by The Wine Spectator magazine - 1,000 experienced tasters were asked to identify the 1989 Chardonnay from Long Island's exciting new Gristina winery. Well under two 2 per cent guessed it came from Long Island; I thought it was a well-made Chassagne-Montrachet. Chardonnay seems to be particularly successful on Long Island here but, unusually, there is potential for dry Gewurztraminers with none of the oily bitterness that dogs California examples. Among red grape varieties, Merlot has shown most form so far (like Washington State 3,000 miles west), although Cabernet Franc has its devotees among those not wedded to the clout of California wine. Cabernet Sauvignon can be difficult to ripen fully except in a few very well-chosen sites, but Long Islanders claim that part of the problem lies in the American consumer's California-shaped perception of how Cabernet Sauvignon should taste. Blending different varieties is a novel sport that will surely become more popular. Most of the wines retail in the Dollars 12 to Dollars 15 bracket, putting them on a par with California's mid-priced varietals; but, like their counterparts who make English wine, Long Island wine producers sometimes have to labour against local prejudice. Bridgehampton Winery, one of only two on the South Fork, sets its cap deliberately at the major big urban market 70 miles west by using with the least bucolic image possible - that of Manhattan by night  - on several labels. The typically-spare but Vivaldi-haunted winery building overlooks the sad remains of a vineyard too prone to frost. Undaunted, the jingle-merchant who owns Bridgehampton has acquired land elsewhere. It was there that I was told how that Bridgehampton reds would be lightening in style. As he put it: 'Our winemaker had a child recently, so his search for immortality no longer has to be diverted into his wines.' Most impressive of a wide range of current releases (sic) I tasted on Long Island recently were Lenz Gewurztraminer 1989; 1989 Chardonnays from Gristina and Bidwell, as well as Gristina's 1988 Cabernet Sauvignon (made at Bridgehampton before its own their understatedly elegant winery was built); Bridgehampton's light 1989 Merlot; Bedell Cellar's confident and plump 1988 Merlot Reserve; and unfinished samples of Palmer 1990 Merlot and 1991 Gewurztraminer. And Rainy 1989 has been Long Island's only real problem vintage since 1987. As far as the vine is concerned this is clearly a viable, if slightly homespun, new colony. Pindar and Bridgehampton wines are imported into the UK by the Great American Wine Company, 137 Lavender Hill, London, SW11 5QJ. Tel: 071-924-4599. Palmer wines are stocked by Wigmore Wine of London.

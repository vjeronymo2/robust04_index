The proposal  was made in letters delivered in the border village of Panmunjom and addressed  to South Korea's president, prime minister and three main opposition leaders.  According to South Korean officials, North Korea repeated a proposal that the  two Koreas hold "top-level political talks" to discuss free travel on the  Korean peninsula.  </P></p>

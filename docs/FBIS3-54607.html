			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Slip of Tongue From al-Hariri?"] </F>   [Text] Rafiq al-Hariri's success in making billions  [currency not specified] from his private businesses in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and using these billions as a passport  to reach premiership in Lebanon does not mean that he is a  successful politician. Because politics is a science that has  its own rules and basic elements. Of course, money is one of  the elements, but not the only one.    Al-Hariri arrived in London and was very warmly received by  some Lebanese and Palestinians. he held press conferences and  delivered lectures in his capacity as a rich man first and a  prime minister second. He was successful in most of them. But  success failed him in one of them, specifically at the press  conference held at the foreign correspondents association.    In this conference al-Hariri focused on his country's  refusal  to settle Palestinians in Lebanon. He stressed this point at  great length, as though the Palestinians are just refugees, not  Arabs also. Maybe they are not human. Al-Hariri tends to  forget that he is from Sidon (unless he still insists that he is  from al-Dar'iyah [as transliterated]), which is a few kilometers  from Palestinian 'Akko.    It might be useful to recall that the people of Sidon, Tyre,  and southern Lebanon have always been an extension of the people  of Galilee and the Palestinian coast, and vice versa, to the  extent that it is difficult to distinguish between them in terms  of features, customs, and traditions.    But al-Hariri, who holds Saudi nationality, although he is  Lebanese, and is enjoying all its privileges, is using a  non-pan-Arab -- we would not say racist -- language when dealing  with Palestinians. Because he thinks that their might has been  destroyed and that he can through foreign aid flex his muscles  on them whenever he wants.    We assure al-Hariri that the Palestinians are guests of the  Lebanese, just as they are guests of the Syrians, Jordanians,  and all the other Arabs. They appreciate the patience and  generosity of their hosts. And they have not asked to be  settled, because nothing can replace their homeland, otherwise  they would not have become strugglers and fighters.    The point which attracted our attention most in his press  conference was when he said he would consider an application to  be submitted by Palestinian President 'Arafat to visit Lebanon,  hence indicating that the Palestinian president needs a visa  from the nearest Lebanese consul to make the visit in question,  while other Palestinian leaders do not get the same treatment  when they enter Lebanon.    Regrettably, these unsuccessful statements, which lack the  simplest political and diplomatic rules, came in reply to an  optimistic question suggesting that the problem of President  'Arafat's visit to Lebanon was resolved the moment he was  received in Riyadh by the Saudi monarch, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. But al-Hariri -- because of lack of  experience or information -- "maybe" did not understand the  significance. He failed to seize the opportunity to improve his  government's position toward an Arab leader who only did what  al-Hariri wants to do but cannot, that is sign a peace agreement  with Israel.    It saddens us -- and we know the situation in Lebanon and  the  independence of al-Hariri's government -- to hear these  unsuccessful statements, which do not reflect a realistic and  correct political reading of the rapid developments in the Arab  region, the most recent of which is the Palestinian president's  visit to Damascus and Riyadh and the historic meeting held in  Geneva less than two weeks ago between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad  and Bill Clinton.    Prime Minister al-Hariri needs a pause for examination and a  thorough revision of his positions, especially on the  Palestinian issue and people -- a pause that matches the depth  of the relationship between the Lebanese and Palestinian  peoples, which was built on joint sacrifices for the sake of  bolstering the issues of Arabism, first and foremost the  Lebanese and Palestinian issues.</p>

Following is the full text of the memorandum of accord.  <H6>  "Memorandum of Accord </H6>   "Realising the complexity of the political and economic  situation in our society and the need to take urgent and  constructive measures to ensure Russia's safe exit from the  crisis situation on the basis of the consolidation of all power  structures and political forces, we adopt this memorandum.    "Despite the diversity of our political and economic views,  we have reached an understanding on the following goals:    "To establish genuine democracy on the basis of the strict  observance of constitutional norms and laws of the Russian  Federation, to increase the responsibility of all levels of  bodies of power for the state of law and order and for ensuring  the safety of the individual, society and the state.    "To provide for economic growth of the country on the basis  of the development of all forms of ownership, regulated market  relations, state support for the national economy, increasing  economic independence of regions and manufacturers, reducing  federal expenditures.    "To ensure an even distribution of the burden of the crisis  between regions and social groups, support for socially  vulnerable groups of the population as necessary conditions for  society's agreement with the proposed pace and direction of  reform.    "To reverse moral degradation of society, restore the  prestige of honest labour, create conditions for the development  of the individual and respect for the rights and freedoms of the  human being.    "We are convinced of the inadmissibility of destabilisation  in a country which possesses huge arsenals of weapons, including  weapons of mass destruction, the loss of control over which may  have catastrophic consequences for mankind. Considering this,  we believe it imperative to conduct a political struggle within  a legal framework, without resorting to or calling for any form  of violence, national hatred or persecution of dissidents.    "In order to reach civil accord, we believe it necessary for  the bodies of executive and legislative power to jointly  consider the entire set of problems faced by political, economic  and social reforms in society.    "We suggest that the government of the Russian Federation in  cooperation with the committees, factions and deputy groups of  the State Duma and the Federation Council, with the president of  the Russian Federation acting as coordinator, work out within  the next two to three months a package of concerted measures to  resolve the crisis with the participation of the country's  specialists, politicians and public figures.    "As far as regional policy is concerned, we agree to refrain  from separatist approaches and insist on settling disputable  issues through conciliatory procedures within the framework of  the integral federation.    "As concerning relations with the states -- republics of the  former Soviet Union, we consider it important for Russia to  abide by a policy aimed at strengthening inter-state relations  and mutually advantageous economic ties, excluding actions aimed  at provoking conflicts.    "Amnesty for people who are currently under investigation or  custody in connection with the events of August 19-21, 1991, May  1, 1993 and September 21 -- October 4, 1993, as well as amnesty  for a number of people who have been sentenced for crimes in the  economic sphere could become an integral part of the drive aimed  at reaching national accord by the people of Russia.    "We are convinced that only if all the constructive forces  of  society promptly develop coordinated measures on the basis of  goals and principles proposed by this memorandum will ensure the  country be ensured of a safe exit from the current crisis.    "The State Duma       "The Federation Council       of the Russian Federation       "Moscow       "February 23, 1994"</p>

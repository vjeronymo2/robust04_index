			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed CET: "European Union Signs Partnership </F> Agreement With Ukraine"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 23 Mar (BELGA) -- On Wednesday [23 March],  the European Union (EU) and Ukraine signed a "partnership  agreement." Ukraine is the first country belonging to the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) with which the EU has  concluded such an agreement.    The partnership agreement could grow into a free trade zone  between the EU and Ukraine. In 1998 both parties to the  agreement will examine whether Ukraine has made sufficient  progress in the direction of a market economy for negotiations  on a free trade agreement to begin.    Our dream and our objective remains to join the EU,  Ukrainian  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said. Ukraine will launch its  economic reforms as soon as possible. This year, 30,000 large  and small companies will be privatized, Zlenko noted.    In the partnership agreement, both parties granted each  other  most favored nation status. That means that they will award  each other all the trade benefits that they offer other  countries.    The agreement provides for economic cooperation in highly  divergent areas, such as industry, investment, public  procurement contracts, scientific research, intellectual  property, energy, the environment, transport,  telecommunications, financial services, regional policy, and  social cooperation.    In the introduction to the agreement it is expressly stated  that democracy, human rights, and a market economy are the  essential preconditions for cooperation.    The EU is negotiating a similar agreement with Russia. We  are making good progress, but several problems still have to be  ironed out, European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said .</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Apprenticeships not just replacement for training Sir, We were interested to read your survey on modern apprenticeship schemes ('Apprenticeship scheme sparks scepticism', July 13). I chair the London Modern Apprenticeship Group and would like to address some of the points raised. Modern apprenticeships will give young people who wish to pursue training through a work-based, rather than an academic-based route, core skills. However, modern apprenticeships are meant to exist as an alternative to, and not as a replacement for, educational opportunities. The article states that there is scepticism over employers' willingness to support the programme. In north London, we are beginning to work in partnership with other industry training organisations (ITOs) to develop a framework for the programme. The fact that there are already strong links between employers and ITOs means that Training and Enterprise Councils will be able to communicate with a far larger group of employers than before. It is these links which will make modern apprenticeships work, and all the employers I have spoken to are very keen to get involved in the programme. While the modern apprenticeship scheme will indeed help gain work-based skills, it is important it is looked at as one part of the programme to raise the skills base of the population - a programme which includes many other projects designed to complement each other.

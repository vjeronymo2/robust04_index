			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium hits 32-month high on Japanese buying THE PRICE of palladium, a metal used mainly in consumer electrical goods and as a dental alloy for filling teeth, yesterday reached Dollars 119 a troy ounce - its highest level for 32 months. Two reasons were suggested by traders and analysts: concern about supplies from Russia, which accounts for about half the world's palladium output; and speculative activity on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, which launched a palladium futures contract in August last year. Traders suggested that the price could reach Dollars 120 an ounce this week, and possibly Dollars 125 an ounce by the time Tocom's February palladium futures contract expired on February 24. They predicted, however, that it would then quickly drop back. Traders said the price 'spike' was being caused by speculators who had sold palladium they did not own in the hope of buying it later at a lower price scrambling to obtain metal to cover their obligations. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles Lambert, said that, apart from the Tocom activity, market sentiment was being influenced by the fact that contract negotiations between Russia and Japanese palladium users had been delayed two months. This suggested something was wrong in Russia where supplies had fallen by 15 per cent last year and were likely to fall again in 1993. Also the interest rate on leased palladium had risen to more than 10 per cent, which indicated supplies were tight. Last November Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, estimated 1992 palladium demand would rise by 2.9 per cent to 3.86m ounces while supply would fall by 4.1 per cent to 3.75m, giving a supply shortfall of 110,000 ounces. However, Mr Neil Carson, JM's marketing director, platinum, pointed out yesterday that this followed two years of oversupply. 'There is no real shortage of palladium, there is plenty about.' JM believed there were no supply hitches in Russia but exports were being held up by bureaucrats who did not understand the workings of the precious metals markets.</p>

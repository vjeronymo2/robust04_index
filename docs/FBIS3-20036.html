			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kaa Eneberg: "Europe Missionaries Visit </F> `Heathens'"]    [Text] Why is Gallivare in the interior of Norrbotten worth  a trip in the dead of winter, when the weather does not even  allow skiing?    Carl Bildt says urbanely into the local radio's microphone  in  the icy school playground that it is always wonderful to come  here. But the truth is that he is uneasy, just as uneasy as  opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson that the unruly people who  mine ore will vote to a man against membership in the European  Union [EU].    That is why little Gallivare, with its 19,000 inhabitants,  has become an attractive destination for politicians advocating  a yes vote in the run-up to the national referendum.    Yet the prime minister is good at concealing his uneasiness.  He explains and discusses, during visits to schools and at  nighttime meetings, the fear Norrbotten residents have of the  Brussels bureaucracy. The answer to almost every question,  whether it pertains to the legal right of access to private  land, hunting, alcohol, or support for Norrland, is consistently  introduced with "we will decide that ourselves..." Next comes a  speech outlining what the consequences of membership will be.  So, for example, each EU krona provided to subsidize Norrland is  a bonus that will get added to the usual Swedish subsidy.    Ingvar Carlsson, who was here last week, was less precise,  but then he does not have the same direct channel to Brussels as  Carl Bildt. He left it at saying that EU membership could only  be positive for Norrbotten.  <H5>  Opposition Decreases </H5>   When the public opinion figures on EU membership were  studied  in detail one year ago, 75 percent of Norrbotten residents were  definitely opposed. Moderate Party ombudsman Tommy Eriksson,  Lulea, said that he had gotten "signals" that the opposition has  now been pushed down to 60 percent. More people have become  undecided.    "It will come down even more, and we hope we prevail with  the  help of our Moderate Party ministers in particular," he said. He  has just scheduled Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik for a trip to  Gallivare in April. Tax Minister Bo Lundgren has paid a visit,  EC Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel is thought to have done well for  himself in Gallivare, while party secretary Gunnar Hokmark tried  to make the people in Boden see reason.    Education Minister Per Unckel "will do Haparanda in May" and  Industry Minister Per Westerberg is on the ombudsman's wish list  for a longer visit.  <H5>  Schools as the Key </H5>   "All of Norrbotten is a challenge. That is obviously true in  Gallivare, which is more communist than other places, with the  Swedish Communist Party [SKP] still in power," said Eriksson as  he rode about during the minister's visit.    During each visit Eriksson schedules a school. So each  Moderate Party minister has obligingly stood at a lectern.  Because it is among youth that they see an opportunity to win  over the growing group of those who are undecided. In Gallivare  Prime Minister Bildt ventured out on a fearless operation by  urging youth "to listen and think for themselves," not to be too  impressed by the naysaying older generation being understood.    The Moderates, who are supported by approximately 12 percent  of the voters in the province, know they are somewhat frustrated  by the other nonsocialist parties where winning Norrbotten  residents over to the EU is concerned.    The Liberal Party is lying low, the Christian Democratic  Party is heard from most often as being opposed, and when Labor  Market Minister Borje Hornlund (Center Party) was with the prime  minister in Karesuando, there was "only demonstrations and  misery." Carl Bildt, on the other hand, went out and talked  calmly with the unemployed who were demonstrating, telling them  that the EC was not a danger but rather would produce jobs, not  least in Norrbotten.</p>
